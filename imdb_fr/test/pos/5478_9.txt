It's a Hollywood movie. The references of the people involved are not revolutionary. This movie will not change the world. However, it is well done, well planned and well played, which matters a lot. <br /> <br /> This is the story of the cat and mouse of a former CIA dissatisfied assassin who feels betrayed to prosecute him a secret service officer who was protecting John F. Kennedy when Kennedy was killed in Dallas. The agent was understandably troubled by this failure in the following years of his career and when the film resumed its place in 1992 - or certainly in contemporary America, this alleged assassin, Mitch Leary (John Malkovich, makes a feat of goose bumps in which he gives a transformative performance) was consumed by frustration and anger and decides that he will assassinate the president. He imagines he has a common cause with Secret Service Agent Frank Horrigan (Clint Eastwood at his best cool, calm and kindly grumpy) who he believes should hold grudge as he does because the Warren Commission blamed Horrigan -injustment, believes Leary - for the assassination of President Kennedy. The tension is heightened by some phone calls from Leary to Horrigan-Leary, wanting to keep Horrigan close but not betraying his location or plans. <br /> <br /> Rene Russo is excellent, as is Lily Raines, a colleague with whom Horrigan develops an adult relationship. It's nice to see a relationship between two peers of equal skill (though Russo is a younger bargain than Eastwood at the time of filming). Russo is a calm and capable agent, able to face Horrigan's quick wit in friendly jokes. It's a good role for Russo, who allows him to play the role of a capable professional woman and not just the default romantic interest of the old man. The acting, the competent direction of Wolfgang Peterson, the thoughtful use of music for the development of the plot and the excellent cinematography make it a film that I can watch again and again.
