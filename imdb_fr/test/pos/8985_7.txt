Peter Lorre performs one of his best performances as a Hungarian clockmaker to United Staes to make a new life and one day bring his daughter on the other side of the big pond. Lorre's infectious optimism and brilliant prospects emerge very effectively, making the performance all the better when burned in a hotel, and when nobody gives him the chance to work, he reluctantly turns to a criminal life. Lorre's range of actors is rarely as apparent as in this film with his jovial, good-natured immigrant, his depressing, melancholy and disfigured self in search of the truth behind what he thought America had offered him in his suave, intelligent, better than your average hood, his relationship with a blind woman he falls in love with. The story is well paced, presents some interesting twists and gives Lorre many opportunities to shine. Director Robert Florey does a quality job behind the lens, and all the minor actors help the film. Evelyn Keyes plays her role as a blind woman particularly well. I loved the ending - and the truth - that shone in the character of Lorre despite all the negative things that society had done to him. For a small image B, The man behind the mask is a good achievement for his time.
