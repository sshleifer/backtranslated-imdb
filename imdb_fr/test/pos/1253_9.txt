While my kids enjoyed the movie (and later announced they wanted to buy it later), I think I shot more. The scene in the airport store at the beginning is real (I did not use the commentary to cut aloud, but I thought so). It's a good mid-life film, a little dark and some scenes work less well than others (why does the child stay with Bruce Willis after he knows that his mother is dying? ?), But overall and good weather. It also gave our family a topic of discussion: did my children think my life was boring? What are they waiting for at 40? How can you not love a movie that brings a good conversation with your children?
