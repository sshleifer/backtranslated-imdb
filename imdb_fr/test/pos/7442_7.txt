This movie was made especially for fans of FF VII. I am someone who has never played the original game and who has watched it with a friend who was a fan of the series. From a visual and technical point of view, this film is as good as "The Spirits Within", if not better, but from the point of view of history, I was rather lost. One of the major weaknesses of the intrigue that was revealed to me is the scene where "all" dying children of geostigma were brought to the "meeting" of healing by the three Jenovites. In all, there were about 15 children in all ... Hmmmm ... I thought this Geostigma was a disease of pandemic proportions ... I understand why they did it this way (time, budget, CPU) , but it just seemed corny after all the explanations of how the bad guys had to gather everyone who had Jenova's cells so that Jenova could be reincarnated. The version of the subtitles we had (some internet fans) was a pretty direct translation and so probably added to my confusion. <br /> <br /> It piqued my interest in FF VII however and I spent a few hours on the FF VII wiki to read about the main characters and the plot. Once I read the Advent Children's wiki, things made a lot more sense. If you are a fan of video games or sci-fi, this movie is a very good movie, but as a previous review says, it's a 1.5-hour fight scene. We never really know any of the characters and the story only seems to jump from one scene to another without a lot of explanations, even if some explanations are necessary. Thank God for Wikipedia.
