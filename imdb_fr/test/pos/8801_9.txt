Great film in the style Trainspotting ... to be presented as the Welsh train, but it's the same for Twin Town, although it's the streets in front of us. <br /> <br /> Takes a weekend in the life of Cardiff Clubbers, Kerrigan's good movie debut and some great performances in the cast. <br /> <br /> Go see! then go to disco
