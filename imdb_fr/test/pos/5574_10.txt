After 2 years of using this site for movie reviews, I finally signed up for IMDB to give Farscape a "10". The writers, the actors and the team of the series proved that they were the undisputed masters of the science-fiction genre. Even those who do not normally like science fiction should be encouraged to give this exceptional series a chance! <br /> <br /> The virtues of Farscape are just too numerous to list, but one of them stands out above all else; the quality of the writing is incredible. I have not heard of this dialogue since "Blake's 7." In fact, Farscape looks a lot like a "Blake's 7" with good special effects and a little more romance. <br /> <br /> Everyone, enjoy!
