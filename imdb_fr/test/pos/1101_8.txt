OK .... so, at minute 15 of the movie, there is still no dialogue. <br /> <br /> This film happened to me in a stuffed Down Down bag, with Sharpie encrypted information on the front. I am a programmer of a North American festival and our leader sent us MOD LOVE as a potential starter after having preceded the distant Moscow / Karlovy Vary interface. <br /> <br /> I thought "this movie is not for us" (no dialogue at the 15 minute) but I continued to watch anyway. Well good. He built and built and built, and halfway I was involved in this film, because, like when you go to the zoo, at first you're reluctant, but by the time you get to the dangerous part of snakes, you are totally "there". <br /> <br /> This film is dangerous, not at all like the very popular WolF Creek, but because it is so totally "other" in every way, and seems to weave Web composed of all the fantasies of most independent helmets, that is to say. - a gloomy weather, a red-necked intrigue, strange collages, a disturbing music, and a scenario that, although imperfect and fundamental, has something in common with one of the "great Australian films", namely cars that eat Paris, de Wier. But MODERN LOVE is really not really a very Australian film, in the sense of Ocker and the playful self-deprecation that permeates many films of this country. It works on a more nightmarish realm from the beginning. No mobile phones, no brand names, no i-pods, no middle-class / middle class urban anguish - just a guy married to a handsome man, an old Volvo and a little boy (son) who has weird teeth and stuff around. Oh, and it's in a strange seaside village where people all look slightly 'wrong'. Photographed by Nick Matthews (2:37) and music by Tom Huzenroeder (Ten Canoes), the MOD LUV succeeds where many Aust. the films fail - that is, they rise up without taking into account the "abandoned" country from which they come. Instead, it reveals itself in a distorted but entertaining riddle that the film itself can not solve - and that's where the weakest link lies ... What does this movie have to do with "Modern Love" ???? The last minutes of the movie seem to give an answer, or at least an allusion to a ... and while I sat down and I had a coffee before eating my Hershey, all I could assume, that is that the director of this movie, Alex Frayne, will have a lot of fun with this one.
