I like Armand Assante and the summary of my cable company seemed interesting. So I've watched it twice already, and probably again. <br /> <br /> The first part is difficult to follow, but it clears up later. I think the screenwriter was very good at mowing things. <br /> <br /> Some of the actors are not convincing, but maybe it's because I was always expecting a kind of double cross. In this case, the mediocre game would be the lack of sincerity of the characters who interact with each other, which suits him very well. <br /> <br /> The important theme is that the owner of the carnival (Assante) launder money for a local casino. & his charming wife of snakes (Dagmara Dominczyk) wants to steal him. She complains to "Archie" (Reedus) about the severity of her life and how he could help her get by. <br /> <br /> There are 3 or 4 twists (which is probably the reason for everything), and just when you think you have solved the mystery, something else is going to happen. <br /> <br /> My score of 8/10 is mainly for the plot. <br /> <br /> I won Do not say more: I do not like spoilers, so I do not want to be one, but I think this movie is worth your time.
