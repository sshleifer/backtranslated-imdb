This film seems to have been neglected by everyone. Someone should take it out on VHS and DVD. It's an excellent film and far superior to Brooke Shields, which was awful. <br /> <br /> Jean Simmons deserves more credit than she gets now. It would be nice if all his films were on VHS or DVD. Jean Simmons was and still is a very good actress. She was definitely a beauty. In fact, she is always a beauty. She was also very successful on T.V. She is so much better than many actors today.
