I'm a big fan of Lonesome Dove and all the books in the series and I love the movie. I was happy to see that they ended up with Comanche Moon. I'm a long time fan of Steve Zahn and I could not wait to see him play a serious role. Personally, I think Steve Zahn did an amazing job recreating Gus. I can not think of another actor who would have been better. He has the voice, the mannerisms, the pronunciation of the words, all in one. Admittedly, no one could ever hold a candle to Robert Duvall as Gus, but I think Steve Zahn did a very good job. Karl Urban plays the same role in all the movies he went to, so he made a good match for Woodrow Call. As for the movie itself, yes it's a bit corny but can you really beat Lonesome Dove? No, I do not think so.
