Dekalog 5 can be considered a violent accusation against the death penalty, according to the fifth commandment "You will not kill": it does not put the concept of a state in full compliance with the provisions of an unjust law. the figure of a murderer. "But the law could not imitate nature, but also correct it," says defense lawyer, a real catalyst, "punishment is a form of revenge to make evil for evil without preventing crime." in whose name the law takes its revenge, really in the name of the innocent? " The horrendous and detailed footage of the last half-hour of a man sentenced to death values ​​the uselessness of the deterrence function applied to the death penalty in order to intimidate all potential criminals. "Desperate sufferings do not require desperate solutions," Kieslowski explains in his message, explaining how the act of disobedience to a commandment of God that judges punishment in the same way that the crime is unfair. There are three different moral attitudes here: the innate sense of rebellion of the murderer to awaken the hostile torpor of the surrounding environment; the strong feeling of chronic indifference of VICTIM, prone to laugh at the demands of others; the deserving behavior of the COUNCIL FOR DEFENSE always ready to fight adversity, in favor of human life. The struggle for life is alive without mercy all the time; the characters are plunged into scenes of affliction and distress, in an urban landscape accentuated with greenish tones and reflecting its own reflections through the windshield of a taxi. Everything in "Dekalog 5" expresses a terrible sense of estrangement and isolation: descriptions of a waste of violence and madness, scenes of precarious working conditions, sinister appearances of buildings plunged in an anonymous aura of desolation, wandering without purpose in disenchanting environments. Jazek, the main character, is forced to fight against an opponent stronger than him: a city completely enveloped in a deep indifference, apparently hostile, deaf to all his silent calls for help, while a faded photo of a little girl wearing a first communion dress continues to gnaw at her soul. He irremediably directs his steps towards a damnation path disconnected through the deformations of the 18 mm. Wide-angle lens aimed at distorting all the details, modifying the reality and making it progressively disappear into distant and extra-terrestrial echoes. Kieslowski does not bring any mitigating circumstances flavored with melodromes to the honeyed voice in favor of the accused, unlike some Hollywood stereotypes such as "I want to live" (by Robert Wise). He does not slip on banana peel from unnecessary pathetic scenes to ease Jazek's guilt and mitigate the brutality of the crime. He is not interested in the immediate psychological motives justifying any manifestation of extreme or violent behavior and refusing to include any unnecessary judicial proceedings. procedure. In other words, according to Kieslowsky, "a crime is always a crime": according to the principle of "by condicio", it puts the prosecutor on the same plane as the convicted person, using many signs or symbols to represent a society front view. the most sinister light. And we can not remain indifferent: even if we do not agree with him, Jazek's screams of anguish touch our hearts with pity in the same way as Terri Schiavo's eyes.
