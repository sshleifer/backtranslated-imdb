John Cassavetes is on the run from the law. He is at the bottom of the pile. He considers Black Sidney Poitier his equal and they quickly become friends, forming a kind of alliance against the intimidation of a foreman played by Jack Warden. <br /> <br /> As someone who worked in a warehouse myself younger, I can tell you that the struggles in the warehouses, with their boxes of packaging and their claw-hooks, are also realistic as possible. I myself participated in such fights, even though no one was killed. <br /> <br /> The introduction of Sidney Poitier's widow is a variant of Shakespeare's Shylock: "Am I not bleeding?" It is an anti-racist film which, at the time, was very necessary. <br /> <br /> The three main characters - Warden, Cassavetes and Poitier - are superb, with Warden the most remarkable of the three.
