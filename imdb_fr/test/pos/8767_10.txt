The subject is commonplace, even in 1942. It is a war propaganda. The fascists are among us and are doing everything in their power to sabotage the war effort and prepare for their victory and seizure of power at that time, as well as for the establishment of an effective totalitarian state. But Hitchcock must make it a real thriller. He invented a first sabotage that succeeded but one of the victims, the friend of the one who dies there, becomes the main suspect and runs away for sabotage. This allows him to visit the country and discover the delicate organization of the local Nazis who have knowledge and support in the highest benevolent society and who use the little bit of whites dissatisfied to do the dirty work. The pursuit of the real saboteur brings our young suspect from Los Angeles to New York and to the top of the organization. He meets a blind pianist who believes that his senses know that the guy is not guilty, his niece who is a star of the billboard, but also a frenzied and fanatical patriot who thinks only of going to the police. Then the rich breeder and his nest of tracers. Then, on the road, a friendly and friendly truck driver, a long circus caravan and his dwarf, his beard, his Siamese sisters and some other grotesque of this type. And he discovers the target in a Soda City, an electric dam that supplies Los Angeles and its war industry with the energy they need. He participated as a gravel in the organization of the sabotage of a USS Alaska military ship at its launch. And finally, with a little inventiveness, creativity and fat, his niece the pianist manages to clean everything, most of them are arrested and the first saboteur, a certain Fry, falls from the torch of the Statue of the Freedom. This one will not fry on the old electric sparkling chair. But Hitchcock is not used to making a personal appearance in his own movies, so do not look for him. It's well built and well played, but it's just a propaganda film with extra style. <br /> <br /> Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines
