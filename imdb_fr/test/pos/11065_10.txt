I gave this movie a 10 just of my sickly obsession with Ingrid Bergman :) lol. I really think she was the best actress to have ever honored this land with her talent and all her films are absolutely wonderful (even when they are terrible) because she is in them. If it had not been her and Vivien Leigh (as I had originally heard), I would have given a rating of 9.0 Just because I love Viv but probably not as much as I love Ingrid. And any other actress might have done one. It's a good story, two wild people falling in love with a society where it's bad to be bad. It reminds me a little GWTW, except that his attitude is higher. Gary Cooper is very handsome as usual and of course, his voice never changes in the whole movie, but good Ingrid makes him look so incredible and dashing and 20 times warmer than he probably should have being.
