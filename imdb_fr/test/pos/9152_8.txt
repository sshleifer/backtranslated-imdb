The Beloved Rogue is a wonderful period piece. He describes the Paris of the 145th century in the Hollywood way, while offering a darker side to the existence that would be lived by the poor. And the snow. This is constantly turning around, adding to the severity of the decor - awesome! The decor is enhanced by strange characters, including beggars, cripples and dwarves. <br /> <br /> John Barrymore delivers a brilliant performance, surpassed only by the magnificent Conrad Veidt, who plays a degenerate and dissolute voice. Louis XI to perfection. And yes, Veidt willingly gives himself the nose, pushing his portrait to wonderfully twisted limits.
