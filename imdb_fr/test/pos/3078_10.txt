I love that movie! I know some people might say it was not a good movie, but I really disagree. The comedy is in the classic style of Mel Brooks and the actors have been superbly chosen. It was my first meeting with Cary Elwes and Dave Chappelle and what a first impression they made. Cary Elwes shines as Robin Hood, the only British Robin Hood to notice. He has a good comic timing and the right attitude for this type of film. Dave Chappelle is obviously much bigger now, but at the time it was his first film and he did a great job as Achoo. The characters were all very well planned and all added their own little quirks to the movie. I highly recommend renting this movie and enjoying it with a good bowl of popcorn and close friends!
