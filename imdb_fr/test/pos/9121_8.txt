I love a film that combines suspense, laughter, style, good acting and a bit of self-parody. Hitchcock has always won, and in "The Red Circle", Jean-Pierre Melville does the same. I was sorry when this long film ended. <br /> <br /> I agree with the English commentator who found the words of one of my compatriots chauvinistic. I like French movies, Italian movies, English movies, Indian movies - and the good American movies that are increasingly rare. I also think that the writer who criticized the film because he was not even a good copy of an American gangster film completely missed the point. But I guess it's like jazz: either you get it or you do not have it, so why waste time explaining. <br /> <br /> See "The Black Circle" and get ready to be entertained.
