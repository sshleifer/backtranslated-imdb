A sweet and rich girl from the valley develops a crush on a lane punk and, when her snobbish friends approve of her, she is forced to choose between her heart and her popularity. A very funny romantic comedy mixes with elements of black comedy and 80s cheese, making it even more fun to watch. The film does not only follow the life of the valley girl and her punk; but his friends too, as they shop, party, hang out and go to the mall. If the dialogue does not make you laugh without stopping for a week, the music will be. Songs like "Johnny, Are You Queer?" can be found everywhere. In addition, Elizabeth Daily is a funny and existential character and the speech of Prom King & Queen in the end is hilarious!
