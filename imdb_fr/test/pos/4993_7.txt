Everyone wants Duvall and Jones to come back, come on! Viewers say things like, Zahn and Urban are not as deep ... Puhlease! Were you as deep when you were young? That's the problem: they have a lot to learn. Zahn and Urban get the superficial innocence they were asked to act on, and with a superb commitment to preserving the nuances of Duvall and Jones' contributions to the characters. Zahn is obviously perfect as Gus at first and Urban is subtly perfect as Woodrow at first. What a daring move it must have been for them to take such a position in the entertainment industry. They had to know that they would please everyone not to be the beloved originals, but they obviously made every effort possible. I gave it a 7 because the editing was jerky in places and the timelines were not precise, but the acting was a pleasure to watch. Val Kilmer was absolutely great. One more thing: I suppose that the public would have accepted more the mysticism implied by the appearance of a jaguar and a blue and gold macaw if additional efforts had been granted and so simply accepted by the characters.
