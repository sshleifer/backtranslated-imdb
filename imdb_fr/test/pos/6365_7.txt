Many people do not think Dan Aykroyd is funny. This film proves the opposite. Aykroyd is brilliant delivering his one-liners in this comedy. The only major problem with this is that he loses far too much time jumping from Aykroyd's character to the doctor who sues him for proving he's a fraudster. The doctor goes crazy like Dr. Leo Marvin (Richard Dreyfuss) in "What About Bob?". The scenes where the doctor tries desperately to return to Los Angeles are stupid, incredible and unusual. Other than this aspect the movie is really funny, especially the first half.
