I'm selling the dead (2009) 1/2 Dominic Monaghan, Larry Fessenden, Ron Perlman, Angus Scrimm, John Speredakos, Eileen Colgan, Brenda Cooney. An unequal mixture of horror and comedy that presents itself as an image of Valentine's Day compared to Roger Corman and Hammer Studios' horror movies of the 60s, with two deadly pillars (Monaghan and Fessenden) punishable by penalties. finals for crimes committed by the guillotine, but not before. occult can be recalled in flashbacks. Fun and a few shakes well sprinkled, but really a mess of a movie B trying to be a cult classic largely thanks to the casting of veterinarians of genus Perlman and Scrimm, but to no avail; a good rental for Halloween.
