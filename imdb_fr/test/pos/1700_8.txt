I have never seen "American Werewolf in London" but this movie was very entertaining. When I rented it, I thought it was a horror movie, but it turned out to be more of a comedy with horrible aspects. I thought that the transformation sequences were well done, but as far as the effects are concerned, the best scenes were the ones where the effects and lighting were built, well. The transformations reminded me of a lot of werewolf transformations in other movies, but the werewolves themselves are very stupid and do not look much like dogs. Gore: I think there are too many things in this film, which really takes away horror, when every image has blood in it, it's hard to take violence seriously. <br /> <br /> J.Hurst (8th year)
