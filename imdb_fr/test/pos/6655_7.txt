I went into this film thinking that I was not going to like it, but hoping to be surprised, but that, like the movie, ended up being dark and hopeless. But do not get me wrong, Minghella delivers a great epic and for those who love this kind of experience and are willing to live this adventure and accept what comes like that, then they will not be disappointed and it will be one of them best movies of the year in their opinion. The cast of actors is of high quality and should most likely result in a trinity of Oscar names for Law, Kidman and Zellweger, though the few scenes of Portman are perhaps the most powerful of the film. The places are beautiful and Minghella has the eye for a good shot. <br /> <br /> However, those who, like me, want the director to take them on an adventure instead of leaving voluntarily can be disappointed, mainly because of Minghella and his adaptation. The film is so dark that it is what I consider to be an epic of boxing bags, a film that tries to hit hard with emotion but does so at an extreme and so often that during the film I did not have the It was time to invest emotionally, or did not recover from a previous blow, and it became unrealistic and therefore too difficult to care about, not to say predictable. Overall, the film "Cold Mountain" almost left me too tired to remember the good aspects of the film, because I only remember the death, which was perhaps an original motive but ended up being the center of interest.
