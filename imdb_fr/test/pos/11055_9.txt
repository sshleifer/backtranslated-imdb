I would say that this film is disturbing. The brutality is described in a very sick way, it's like a psychosis in 40 minutes. At the same time, it is a cruel introspection in human behavior. The scenes are fierce, beginning with the horse's butchery and ending with the brutal sex scene in the kitchen. Each emotion is exploited to the extreme, the frustration of the butcher, the love for his almost incestuous daughter, the rage when he discovers that she has been abused, every feeling is so natural and so bad. This film delivers the truth about human nature in a very honest and brutal way. The message of the film is that a person's life can change in one second because of his behavior and that the most primitive emotions are the most powerful and can determine the acting of the actor. I loved the unique way of filming, the simplicity and the brutality accompanied by the silence in which only inner thoughts are emerging.
