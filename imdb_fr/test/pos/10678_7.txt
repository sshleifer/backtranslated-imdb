One of my favorite movies, no matter when it airs, even though I admit to having missed it once when it was on Foxtel last year. <br /> <br /> Despite the age of the film, it does not look like that and this story, even though it had been done a thousand times before, still seemed entertaining. There were one or two small issues for me in the story, but I looked beyond them and just enjoyed the movie for what it was. <br /> <br /> Overall, I give him a 7/10
