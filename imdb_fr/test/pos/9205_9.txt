I read the Las Vegas reviews and I agree with some of them, it's not a brain surgery TV, but I had the impression again that the TV was mainly for the escape, especially with what is happening in today's world. Let's face it, a show on Vegas (which is not a reality-based show) does not go to a reality-based show because for me, Vegas is a pure fantasy! This is the kind of place we can go and do pretty much what we want when we want (subject to funds of course!). <br /> <br /> Therefore, the fact that Las Vegas is pretty, sexy and cliche of characters reflecting all this seems to be on the money in my eyes. If you do not like it, do not look at it, that's why we have a million channels! <br /> <br /> We are coming to the third episode in the UK and I know I will. make a beeline to look at it again. I just hope it's not canceled, something that seems to happen often with most shows coming to the UK that are half-decent! (Firefly and Jake 2.0 anyone? !!). <br /> <br /> It's harmless, very fun and every time I look at it, I want to come back to reality :)
