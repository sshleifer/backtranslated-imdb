BEAST STABLE is considered by many as the last of the "real" films of FEMALE PRISONER, since it is the last of the series directed by Shunya Ito, followed by another film (GRUDGE SONG) by another director. I have not seen GRUDGE SONG (but soon ...), so I do not know how it compares to previous FP movies - but it will be interesting to see. The way BEAST STABLE ended did not leave much room for another predecessor - but I guess I'll know ... <br /> <br /> This entry puts Scorpion on the run from the cops, where she clings to a prostitute on the street who gets pregnant with her belated brother's son (oh yeah - that's not a lie ... you have to like those sordid stories). Scorpio ends up being kidnapped by a former rival, but (as she is so good at ...) ends up escaping and taking revenge on some people who have wronged some of her hooker friends ... I agree with other commentators, that this one is a little slower in the points and more "serious" than the two previous entries. The story is somewhat confusing and sometimes complicated, but many of these 70s-era movies are - and I still love them. BEAST STABLE lacks enough in the area of ​​nudity, which was rather disappointing - but I found it strong in other areas - screenplay, cinematography, some good movies, etc ... This is definitely worth it for fans of that kind of stuff or the other films of FEMALE PRISONER ... 8/10
