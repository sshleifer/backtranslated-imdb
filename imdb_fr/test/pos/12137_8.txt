Not a bad MOW. I was expecting another movie about women but I was pleasantly surprised by the suspense. Of course, some parts of the plot were rather hokey, but the movie let me guess. Was the walnut bar tied to the ex-husband, to someone in the tavern, or was it the guy she had cut? Daniel Magder was excellent. I saw him in Mom's on Strike and in Guilty according to the association, both of MOW, and he is very believable, especially for the way he challenges his mother in the same way as a preteen would. <br /> <br /> Laura Leighton also played the typical mother (ex-wife) to which both men and women can relate. She was frustrated enough to look real. <br /> <br /> See if you missed it. It's worth it.
