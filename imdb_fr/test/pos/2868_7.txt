It's one of the best horror movies I've seen in a long time. A strange abandonment house, interesting characters, gore and a twisted plot. Who could ask more in a horror movie? This is pretty predictable for most, but again, most of the horrors you can understand in the first 10 minutes, so I will not oppose it. Music, camera angles, etc. are excellent. The sets are well done and very convincing. There was almost no secondary plot, however, being a horror movie, many secondary intrigues only minimize what was lacking anyway to the horror ... To be afraid ... -It remains quite simple and does just that. If I compared it to another film, I would say it reminded me of the remake of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Certainly a horror movie lover must see.
