This is the average drawing of the three (between Rabbit Fire and Duck! Rabbit, Duck!). It just depends on a gag for too much action. Another good cartoon. I feel a certain sympathy for Daffy in this one, which is rare for me. Daffy is so clearly matched that it becomes almost painful to watch sometimes. Good cartoon in an excellent series. Recommended.
