I was walking around my local library, browsing VHS tapes, when I saw a movie that silenced me: Waterbabies. I was hoping to see this movie again - it's been more than 22 years since I did not see it (cable channel around 78-79). I had recalled many details, especially Grimes. My son, who is 4 years old, and I watched him. <br /> <br /> He agreed with me that Grimes was "not nice" and that the best way for me to describe him was that he did not like Tom. He accepted that. It was amazing that I still remember some songs! It's been 22 years that they're stuck in my head - which means they must have a memorable memory, huh? <br /> <br /> This is a good movie for children, with the help of parents in case of questions about what children have to pass through who were not nobility / society in the time frame . That's what every child is facing every day (except for a few lucky ones), and although we're trying to make movies with Disney Coat, making them more pc for kids these days, that does not matter does not mean that cruelty did not even exist yet. I enjoyed the animation. It was not Disney, no. I do not think Don Bluth touched a brush on this film. <br /> <br /> But there are many. David T plays two roles! (I really like it!) James M too. The waterbabies themselves are cute. You feel sorry for Tom and root for him. Then Billie herself is extraordinary in the multi-role role she plays - it's as if her eyes were magical! I'm a big fan of WoO, TLW & TW and company (and I'm looking into the future!), And I've classified this with this kind of movies. Yes, he jumps into the water, but not because of a suicide. He jumped because he trusted the lady in black - she appeared to him from the beginning. <br /> <br /> I think it's a good movie! If you have children, pick up a rental copy. If you find a copy that can be purchased, let me know where! Ian loved it! :) <br /> <br /> Dee
