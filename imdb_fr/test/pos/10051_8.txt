All in all, it's an excellent movie from this era and from this source (which comes from Warner Brothers, its art and style culminating just before the Second World War), provided you do not take it seriously . The film does not really claim to be historically accurate, and is certainly neither more nor less accurate or credible than JFK, for example. (This one may be more honest about this, though, because he basically admits that it should not be considered fact-based, but rather a stylish and semi-heroic representation.) It should be noted that the public of history was not more naive than we are today; The NY Times magazine conceded that the public "would reject factual inaccuracies throughout the film," describing Custer's biographical narrative as "fanciful" and pointing out that Custer's presentation of the end events was contradictory. with various historical stories. It may be supposed that they might have gone too far in the construction of Custer, but they are admirably successful in describing him as a type not necessarily the smartest or the most diligent, but determined, principled and inspired. <br /> <br /> DeHavilland, making their eighth movie together for 7 years (and their last), is so comfortable with each other and is playing so easily at this stage that it's not that hard to lose sight of how much their parody is written here. With twinning for the first time, it would be difficult to imagine what might really attract Elizabeth to Custer, but both of these elements make it work. The film also misses the director from their previous seven films together (the very underrated Michael Curtiz), but since he worked with them on the similar Santa Fe Trail trail from the previous year, it's understandable that he chooses not to participate in this film. a. (They all started with Captain Blood and The Light Brigade Charge - both great - so we can not really blame them if they start having trouble keeping it all cool.) <br /> < Raoul Walsh, the director here, is certainly more comfortable with the action sequences - which are exceptional - and everything else on the outside. The interior scenes are a little more uneven, but the studio's artists manage to compensate for this very well, as well as the excellent cast of "usual suspects" and new faces of Warner Bros. (Greenstreet, Gene Lockhart, Anthony Quinn, Arthur Kennedy , etc.). . I would have liked better if Kennedy's character had been a little less standard (I usually like his work), but here he seems to be hitting pretty much the same notes in all the scenes; the part could have been better written - and I guess they might not know what he could do because he was in the movies for only a year (Walsh probably took it for that after doing High Sierra together). <br /> <br /> The representation (probably imagined) of the genesis of "Garryowen" as a theme of the cavalry is one of the highlights. The last half hour is particularly remarkable, especially with the separation of the protagonists echoing the end of their partnership with the screen, followed by the final battle scenes. An exciting adventure. <br /> <br /> 8 of 10
