This film directed by George Fitzmaurice, who has made so many excellent films, lives up to his excellence. He is lively, witty, with a few wonderful lines and the inimitable Ronald Colman in the romantic head. Colman plays the youngest son with the irresistible charm of a rich English pair. He is financially irresponsible (spending for example Â£ 15 of his last 20 books in the world on a pretty little burrow he calls George), but open, extremely generous, despising of profit, irreverent in the most polite and desperate way possible. sentimental. It's so dashing that all women fall in love with him. His girlfriend is a music hall star. That is why, in 1930, she was a half-world inhabitant and played with her typical silky, narrow-eyed young Myrna Loy. Fitzmaurice was not a big user of close-ups, and the girls of that day had half-hidden their faces with these ugly hats, so we do not have as good a glimpse of the faces of the two heroines as we we would like it. The director seems more and more interested in the charming Colman. The fresh-faced girl, Loretta Young, had not yet become the proto-Julie Andrews we usually know, but was still a blushing girl exuding all the sweetness of a rose garden and laughing happily all the time. It was obvious that a character with an extraordinary sense of humor was needed to appreciate the stunning social anarchism of the refreshing aristocratic character played by Colman. The plot does not matter, as is often the case with these light and fun movies. It's so much fun.
