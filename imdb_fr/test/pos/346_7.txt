"Meet Sherri..for an evening of fun and terror!" by Al Adamson. <br /> <br /> The film talks about an evil old spirit who owns a nurse in a hospital, then she starts killing doctors one by one. The acting was ok but some of the actors were robotic. The scenario was good, but the sex scenes were added, probably to get more views. The realization was bad, and the special effects looked like a drawing, they did not deceive anyone. The scenes of death were pretty good, but the director mixed too many things that make no sense, such as sex scenes, nudity, the football player, and many others. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's a good movie, but not the best. <br /> <br /> 7 of 10
