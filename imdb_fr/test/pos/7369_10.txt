This film tells the story of a group of four friends who destroy a car while driving. They make a campfire to spend the night and wait for help. To pass the time, they tell each other scary stories. To talk about it would be to spoil the movie, praise it and enjoy it !! <br /> <br /> I'll say it starts a little slowly, but each story gets better. This film features some of today's hottest actors, Christine Taylor (The Brady Bunch Movies), James Marsden (Disturbing Behavior) and Ron Livingston (Office). You can see that there are big stars but not very big ones! Rent or buy it as soon as possible !! This movie is great !!
