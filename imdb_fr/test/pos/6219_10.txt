This enchanting film is based on a novel by Arto Paasilinna. The bestseller is one of the best books I've read. Here's the story: <br /> <br /> One day, journalist and photographer Kaarlo Vatanen decides to leave behind his past and starts a new life wandering in the Finnish forests and countryside. With him, he has a companion, a young hare hit by a car. Vatanen has to take care of the hare, because he has the injured leg, so they start a journey together taking care of each other. <br /> <br /> During their adventures, the hunters are almost shot, caught by the police, meet many people and finally arrive in Lapland, where they live in peace, until a group of foreign tourists are disturbing their privacy. The hare gets sick and they have to go back to Helsinki to see the vet. <br /> <br /> Vatanen has found an ideal way of life, but modern society is trying to reassign it to its duties and taxes. In Helsinki, Vatanen drank, even engaged and was imprisoned, but eventually he and the hare fled.
