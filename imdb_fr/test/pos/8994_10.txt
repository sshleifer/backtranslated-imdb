I wanted to watch this movie since the release of the premieres. I do not understand why everyone is so hard on this movie. All this may not be technically true to rugby, but this film does not deal primarily with this sport. This is a rugby team that is learning to be more than what the world expects from them. They are taught to become men and not boys who are temporarily forsaken. Hollywood is never 100% correct in its productions. They are there to make a product that sells. Something fun. The story of Gelwix coach and what he has taught over the years is simply incredible. He teaches service, honor, integrity and moral cleanliness. How many movies do this teach our kids these days? I was proud to see such an incredible story that taught reverence and respect.
