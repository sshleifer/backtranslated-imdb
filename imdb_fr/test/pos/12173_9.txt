Super movie. I laugh all the time. Why? Well, I come from Austria, I can get along with the kind of German humor (Bavarian). So, I guess this film only makes sense to watch when we speak German. Stefan and Erkan both speak of a new Turkish-German accent, which has become very popular in our countries (GER & AUT). But of course, they are very stupid. As in every comedy, your personal humor will decide, whether thumbs up or thumbs down.
