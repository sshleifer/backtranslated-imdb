Opera (the American title is terror to the opera) is a little disappointing after some other Dario films such as Phenomena, Tenebre and Suspiria. (I still can not find Inferno anywhere.) It's one of those films that has a great first half, but in the middle, it's like someone is slowly starting to let the air out of the screenplay and the logic. <br /> <br /> The plot involves a handsome opera singer who is hunted by an obsessed and disturbed fan. this killer starts killing people close to her in a very unique way. he binds her and squeezes her, taps him tiny pins pointed under the eyelids. So, if she tries to close her eyes, she will tear off her eyes. it forces him to watch while the killer murders his knowledge in a typically brutal and bloody way. <br /> Unfortunately, pretty much in the middle of the film, the game becomes slow and illogical. (This is especially geared towards the killer's motives, I still have not figured out why he's so crazy.) The end comes out particularly from the left field in the worst possible sense. <br /> <br /> But, for This is about the first hour of filming that is among the best films of Dario and the work of the camera is breathtaking. a pity not to be able to keep it to the end. <br /> <br /> Rating: 7
