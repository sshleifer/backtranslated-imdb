I had heard some interesting reviews about this movie. I thought it was a love story, but I was not sure what the plot was. So when I finally saw her, I found myself in the middle of a relationship between the ex-girl Isabel (Isabel Ampudia) and the drugged Rufo (Sebastián Haro). So, a love story, but probably not what I expected. <br /> <br /> The film is centered on Isabel, who struggles to return to society. She does not want to go back to her neighborhood and she finds herself homeless and nowhere to go. Thus, while she had just lived her first hours of freedom after being released from prison, she met Rufo, an old acquittal who, during her stay, had become a junkie and lived on the street. With no place to go, and no money and no real source of income, she decides to join Rufo in her home: a covered area in a secluded street. <br /> <br /> The story itself is moving. This explains how the impossible relationship between Isabel and Rufo sinks to the almost final turn of the film. <br /> <br /> The film is definitely worth watching. Sebastián Haro is magnificent in his role as a drug addict. A person capable of being both an innocent and tender person and a merciless street scum. It all depends on who is treating him. I believe in his role. <br /> <br /> For cons, I do not quite believe in the role of Isabel Ampudia. Although the film tries to show bitterness in her through several scenes, she is not able to make me believe it. She is too kind and honest about what could be expected from someone in the same situation. <br /> <br /> The film tries to show a love for a desperate situation. It's a nice movie. But the feeling I feel at the end of the film is that Isabel, with her way of thinking and acting like she does, would never have come to that situation. Its role, partly because of the scenario, partly because of the acting is hard to believe. <br /> <br /> I particularly like the end, and because of that, I raised one or two points in my note. I liked his sour sweetness and showing that sometimes the survival instinct takes precedence over other more spiritual considerations than love. <br /> <br /> Summarize, an interesting movie, but it lacked a bit of punch to be a total "must see". .
