I agree with BigAlC - this movie prepared me for many differences and cultural practices before my stay in Japan for a year in 1993. Tom Selleck does a fantastic job here, as always, and the film is very humorous and educational . I'm a big fan of Tom Selleck, and he blesses this part with his usual charm and charisma, bringing the film to life so that I can not imagine another actor succeeding. <br /> <br /> This film featured leading Japanese actors and it was very entertaining to see them when they were talking to Selleck. Where to go, whether you want to party, see or just try everything.
