I really liked this movie and I spent several years trying to get it. It is simply not available and has not been shown on television for many years. I liked that and the songs because they had something different to say and made you think of how each person looks at something from different perspectives. Moreover, we do not often appreciate something we have until it is gone. <br /> <br /> My 12 year old daughter has just discovered the music and is delighted by some songs. One day, I hope to get a copy of the film so that she can have the opportunity to see it. (Oh, I'd like to see him again too!) <br /> <br />
