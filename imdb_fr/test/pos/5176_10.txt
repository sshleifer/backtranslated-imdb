The BIG NEW is that this movie is now AVAILABLE on DVD of http://treasureflix.com for all those who wish to own it as well as on video. This is good news because it's one of my favorite movies! <Br/> <br /> I watched this movie for the first time in the 80s and watching is mandatory. Living in the small market town called Tewkesbury, picturesque and with its own traditions, reenactments and traditions, we are also a close and welcoming community. We are now also facing major housing projects that threaten to destroy the Community and you can see why I like this film. First of all, and most importantly, there is snow choking !!!! Then there's the beautiful Christmas tree legend and the Christian denouement as the whole community pays money to help the poor farmer save his farm and stay in the community. The evil developers, once the money is sent, pack their bags while the entire city promises its money to protect what they have, which is very special. I love how the whole community sends its message to Santa through the mail, which is misunderstood by the hero. He and his daughter have a long way to go after the death of the wife and the mother of the family. (There is a likely candidate for this) - even a sleigh ride and the most comforting is that the taxi driver, whose engine is down, mysteriously receives a new engine on Christmas morning and nobody 'Created! There is a beautiful moment when Denver sings a lullaby and an exciting search. Great sweet movie for all that Christmas is really.
