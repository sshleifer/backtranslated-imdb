I watched Nile Princess for the first time when I was about 10 years old. I'm 63 now and I have never forgotten the movie. Nor did I overcome my fascination with Egypt. I searched the internet trying to buy the movie, but I could not locate it. I wonder if this is one of the movies lost in Hollywood. I loved Debra Padget and Jeffrey Hunter together. They have such a charisma together. If you asked me something about the movie, I could not tell you anything other than to know who was there. I vaguely remember a Nile scene with Debra Padget, a group of other women. I always wanted to see her again. I never thought of it as an escape movie at the time, but now I can see where it was probably. I hope they will put it on DVD and that I will be able to see it again before I die. It was a wonderful movie.
