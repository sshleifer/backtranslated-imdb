Jimmy Wang Yu, a true Asian superstar, directed and wrote this movie that I only saw in a dubbed version of a videotape. The widescreen shape (Shaw Scope!) Was lost and the original actor's voices were absent, but it's still good to watch. The story is that of a regular martial arts school that fights the villains of the Japanese plot with our winning young hero in the end by beating a crowd of various hooligans. <br /> <br /> The fight improves as the film breaks. At the beginning of the film, the film seems stiff and dull, but later, there is a great scene in which Wang Yu fights hordes in a game hinge then enters a snowy scene and faces other villains with knives, sword and fists. This part is very exciting. <br /> <br /> Pretty good, but it would be interesting to see a large screen version unlined if there is one.
