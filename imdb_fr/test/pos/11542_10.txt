This documentary about Bill Hicks 'life and comedy contains excerpts from Hicks' "Revelations" and other stand-up concerts. There are also interviews with comedians and industry people who knew him, as well as journalists and journalists who say his political commentary was crude and brutal. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed it. I had already seen "Revelations" but the comedy clips were always refreshing. It's a nice balance between comedy and documentary that will explain the popularity of Hicks to non-fans and satisfy those who already know him. <br /> <br /> I noticed it at ten.
