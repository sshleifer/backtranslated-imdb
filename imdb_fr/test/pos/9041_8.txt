No film could ever do justice to Faulkner's mastery of the English language. but they did a very good job here. Lucas Beauchamp is exactly as I described it in the book, just like Chick. What the movie could not really explain was how the blacks did not like Beauchamp either, because he was just as stubborn. Not that it was a bad thing, but from what I read in the book, it was his attitude towards the world (yet I had the impression that it was racism from the white society that triggered it and spread to black society, until it became his attitude towards everyone. <br /> <br /> The best part of the movie is that you get to see Yoknapatawpha County (actually, Oxford, Mississippi) exactly as Faulkner wrote it (the film was shot when Faulkner was alive and writing) .This does not seem very different today For this reason alone, the film is worth seeing as the film is shot in Faulkner's backyard, a real must for Faulkner fans.
