Fulci ... Does this man bring one of the hottest and strangest movies ever made? Answer: yes! Cat in the Brain, also known as the Nightmare Concert, is Fulci's latest masterpiece. Yes, no matter what some people will say. There are few facts why this film is one of Fulci's best films. <br /> <br /> Fulci makes fun of himself and his films with this one. The main role in this film is none other than that of Fulci himself, who plays ... the director of horror films, splashes and horrors, who thinks to go crazy gradually. It is filled with black humor that, unlike most modern horror movies, works here. Being Fulci movie, you must know that it's bloody. How many? Pretty much. I've always loved gore in movies and I can not get enough of it, but Cat in the Brain actually stopped my thirst for gore, and believe me, it's hard to archive. Even the Braindead did not stop him. CITB is all about gore. Almost every scene revolves around Fulci, who, after having been hypnotized by evil psychologists, sees all kinds of horrors for everything that happens to him or everything he sees. In some scenes, he accidentally drops the whiskey and instead sees a rotten corpse lying on the ground, which begins to spit out mud. Forget the afterlife or Zombie 2, this is Fulci's hottest movie! Now, I like the way Fulci manages to apply all these comic parts in the gorefest movie. He is such a brilliant director. From time to time, fun moments and stories happen, like the one Fulci says "doing gore movies is a kind of disease". Fin is a very good one considering the fact that Fulci (and most Italian horror masters) is known for his senseless ending. or many terrain holes. If you're enjoying Fulci, be sure to check it out. If you have a weak stomach, avoid this and repeat "This is just a movie" ps. Some bloody scenes from this film: broken chainsaw (complete), torn tongue, ripped eyeballs, dead bodies infested with fly, zombies, beheadings, face immersed in boiling water, stabbing in the shower (to the head) , cleft throat, many parts of the body and organs being roasted, the hammer smashed his face ...
