Strange, shorts like this one gets a 10. Why? They are hilarious. It's hilarious. Notice a lot of offbeat humor. Dated and childish toon naysayers, but they do not know what they are talking about. They learned that cartoons are not just for kids. This art is probably the best non-road runner art of the 1950's Looney Tunes shorts. It's hard to come up with anything better than the art of "The Big Piggy Bank", though nothing will ever be. This probability runs a 3rd or 2nd. Short films like this could have spawned brainless scams like Tiny Toons Adventures to try to crush all the old comedy, such as how big movies like Scream generated bullshit like I Know Spread all the old Horror of Scream, but like Scream, it's great all by itself. Chuck Jones has had his faults with the shorts from time to time but he catches them. Take Hopper for example. Few people love Hopper, but that has never ruined LT's reputation, but I'm sure that's his way of putting on makeup. Bottom line: It's not as good as "Duck! Rabbit! Duck!", But nearby. Catch him often on Cartoon Network.
