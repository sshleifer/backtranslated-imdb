After the Second World War, film studios quickly began to focus on returning veterinarians to their homes. "The best years of our lives" was probably the best example. He describes different people who are returning home and how they need to readjust not only to their pre-war lives, but also to the changing world. The most interesting cast member is the non-actor Harold Russell. Having lost his hands in the war, he plays a man with hooks where he used to be and reminds people that he wants to be treated like everyone else. he later won the Best Supporting Act and Special Oscar for the role, making him the only one to have won two Oscars for the same role. There will probably always be a debate as to whether this film deserves the best picture better than "It's a wonderful life", but I certainly think they worked well. Very well done.
