Ponyo, written and directed by Hayao Miyazaki, is a little tale about respect for the sea, people, young and old, and cultural differences. This is a new story of a little goldfish wishing to be a girl, rather than telling Disney's Little Mermaid again. Miyazaki animated by hand a whimsical and magical film for young and old. The film begins with a slow, wavy blue-green palette of sea anemones, jellyfish and dozens of fancy little goldfish with childish faces. There is no need for narrative, the movement of the creatures and the music of Jo Hisaiahi tell the beginning. Released last summer in Japan, Ponyo won the Japanese Academy Award for Best Animated Film and Best Score (Jezebel.com). The whimsical little goldfish, Brunhild, leaves her ocean at home with a jellyfish. Once on the surface, she is caught in a fishing net filled with other fish, garbage and mud. She is propelled into a jar that is rolled to the shore where Sosuke, five years old (voice of Frankie Jonas), recovers. He cuts his hand by opening the jar to release the little goldfish. Brunhild tastes his blood, which heals Sosuke's cut and sets his transformation into a human, while unbalancing nature. Sosuke puts the little goldfish in a green bucket and calls it Ponyo (Noah Cyrus), which means soft and gelatinous. Sosuke's mother, Lisa (Tina Fey), allows her to take Ponyo to school, which is right next to the retirement home where she works. Lisa's crazy driving on the scenic winding road, along a dry dock, the bustling fishing town and a tree-lined road leading to the retirement home is representative of the wonderful sequence of Miyazaki and illustrious actions. perfectly the restless morning of a parent. Miyazaki created another strong and independent female character in Lisa. By making her a loving, sensitive and modern mother, for both Sosuke and Ponyo. Lisa's phone conversation with Kiochi (Matt Damon), her husband who does not come home, because the ship he has to order again, is a typical reaction of his wife. Later in the evening, Sosuke intercedes using a light to speak to his father as the ship passes the cliff on which their house is. Lisa refuses to acknowledge Kiochi's apology. She gets up and reports that "Bug-off, Bug-off, Bug-off" is a hilarious scene. But when Sosuke takes the signal lamp and says to his father, "Good luck, I love you," Lisa takes him in his arms and tells him he has a good heart, the scene is very poignant. <br /> <br /> My personal favorites Miyazaki elderly women, wheelchair granny in retirement home, Yochi (Betty White), Noriko (Cloris Leachman) and Toki (Lily Tomlin). Their exchange over Sosuke's goldfish is wonderful and recalls the quarrels between Witch Sorceress (Lauren Bacall) and Sophie (Jean Simmons) as they climb a long staircase in Howl's mobile castle. The magical father of Ponyo, Fujimoto (Liam Neeson), a sea god, who looks like wizard Howl arrives to bring Ponyo back to his ocean. Fujimoto uses one of his elixirs to balance nature, but the little magical Ponyo escapes again, further disrupting the elixir and causing a tsunami. Running on the backs of giant dolphins to get to Sosuke, this little red-haired girl reminds the public of the obstinate and adventurous little Mei of My Neighbor Totoro. Ponyo is as adventurous and curious as Mei. When Fujimoto realizes what Ponyo did, he calls Gran Mamare (Kate Blanchett), the goddess of the ocean, to help him cope with the situation. This wise soothing goddess arrives in a blue garment that never ends. She had a private conversation with Lisa to discuss the future of young children, which helps the audience understand that Sosuke and Ponyo's relationship are not lovers, but brothers and sisters. The simple and quiet end of life is typical of Miyazaki's films, leaving the audience filled with hope.
