LOL. <br /> <br /> Just starting my article with 'lol' says it all. I watched this movie all the time when I was a child; and even then I felt the stupidity of everything. The low-budget scenario, the horrible acting and the lame scenario were still evident at the time. I watched it again yesterday and I could not help but laugh. It's a shame that it's really good lol. As another critic has said, this is not taken seriously. There is no way to watch this film and say that the producers did it. The soundtrack is so funny, I laugh every time I hear it. The "climax" is just a riot of laughter. It's an all-out war zone in New York, full of explosions and total chaos ... so ridiculous that you can not help but laugh at the sight. <br /> <br /> Other hilarious moments: <br /> <br /> - The scene with Kersey and the policeman running side by side like two cowboys against all the Wild West was so old-fashioned that it was funny. <br /> <br /> -He killed me how the bad guys could shoot Kersey and he could even fall on one knee by taking a very cautious (and slow) goal and not getting hit LMAO. Of course, with him, he killed a shot with his LOL elephant handgun. <br /> <br /> - Another hilarious scene was the end when he finally killed the gang leader .... with a rocket launcher. lol ... destroying the whole side of the building with him. <br /> <br /> - It's obvious that Kersey is used to losing loved ones ... when his new girlfriend is quickly eliminated after a few dates. The acting is so serious that you can not blame anyone who thinks Kersey is angry at the destruction of the car lol .... he crashes, looks at the carnage and walks away. <br /> <br /> Once again, too bad, it's good. <br /> <br /> *** ***** stars.
