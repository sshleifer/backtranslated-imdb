This is a new Barbie movie. The graphics were really good. They made the film partly realistic. I was doing ballet and this film made me want to continue it. This film was a bit like a Cinderella movie but a little different. A father of 12 princesses falls very sick. His cousin poisons him and wants the throne. The girls find a magical and secret country thanks to the stories of their deceased mother. It's up to them to save their father and society. With the help of their handsome prince. It was a funny movie and my friend and I had fun watching it. We enjoyed the Indian parrot that speaks. The music was very nice and made the movie even bigger. There was a big classical orchestra. The voices were excellent and the characters adorably sweet and cute. I loved it so enjoy the movie it's great for the family. All in all, I would watch it again.
