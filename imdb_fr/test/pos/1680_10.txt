The Rififi In Men / Rififi (1955) can be described on the surface as a French variation of John Huston's flagship film, Asphalt Jungle (1950). The difference between the two films is that Rififi (1955) gives a little more attention to the sequence of the flight. In addition, the police are not involved in the aftermath of the robbery at Rififi as much as at Asphalt Jungle. In the end, Rififi (1955) is in my opinion a slightly better film than Asphalt Jungle (1950). Remarkable black image that defines the French cinema of the 50s. <br /> <br /> Spartacus (1960) was perhaps the one who broke the infamous blacklist, but in my opinion, Rififi (1955) has started breaking the unbreakable Hollywood blacklist. First film in five years for Jules Dassin, victim of communist McCarthy hunting from the late 40s to the early 50s. He had a kind of revenge when Rififi (1955) became a success in France and Europe. Defying Hollywood's toxic blacklist in a way that probably inspired others to do the same. Rififi (1955) is the most important film of Dassin's career because he not only gave him his name, but also gave him a second chance to make films. <br /> <br /> Jules Dassin has given the world of film and its audiences ever more numerous masterpieces of influential proportions. His manipulation of the material is exceptional and the direction of the actors is flawless. Creates tense situations with precise know-how. Dassin closed the loop in the genre Film Noir by directing his best and last Black, Rififi (1955). The end of the film period of Dassin was devoted to the realization of Black. <br /> <br /> Rififi (1955) is the number one film in an arsenal of more than thirty films for the director, Jules Dassin. A masterpiece of acting, cinematography, directing, editing and writing. It's not a movie to leave your seat for a minute because there is always something unforgettable. As brilliant as any of Jean Pierre Melville who was a master of this type of film. Masterpieces such as Rififi (1955) are relatively small compared to the billions of films probably made in the history of cinema. <br /> <br /> The only fascinating aspect of Rififi is the accurate planning and careful execution of a robbery that takes a whopping 118 minutes. The main characters plan and execute the jewel in the same way that a director prepares for the pre-productions, the production and the post-production of a film. This shows how difficult it is to commit a jewel like Rififi (1955) and why very few people do the same. The fact that the scene is not spoiled, as in other filming films, makes this scene even bigger. As close as possible to a perfect sequence in a movie. <br /> <br /> The absence of its unnatural sound in the thirty-minute historical sequence stirs absolute realism. Any dialogue and / or music would spoil any suspense and tension that the director is trying to create. The use of natural sound makes the heist sequence a rewarding movie viewing experience. Now, filmmakers and producers are using dialogue and music in a scene like this because of the lack of confidence in the patience of an ordinary viewer. Maintains a level of consistency that never drops. <br /> <br /> Maintaining a high level of suspense is what makes the beat sequence run perfectly. The director achieves a suspense in the heist sequence that is rarely matched in most heist movie stealing scenes. Jean Servais and the rest of the main actors contribute to the suspense with some discrete actors. Getting suspense in a scene is a task that few people are able to do. The flight sequence of Rififi (1955) reaches a level of suspense and Hitchcockian tension. <br /> <br /> Many filmmakers of the following years Of Rififi In Men (1955) were influenced if not inspired by it. An influential filmmaker was Jean Pierre Melville (first choice of the director of Rififi) who used variations of the sequence of shots in Le Doulos (1961) and Le Cercle Rouge (1970). Stanley Kubrick was another filmmaker influenced by The Killing (1956). Quentin Tarantino, whose first feature film, Reservoir Dogs (1992), is inspired by this film. Other influential directors include John Woo, Michael Mann, Paul Schrader, Ringo Lam, etc ... <br /> <br /> Rififi In Men (1955) is comparable to Bob the Flambeur (1955) to in many ways. Jules Dassin and Jean-Pierre Melville directed innovative films in Rififi (1955) and Bob le Flambeur (1955). Second, each film involves an elderly criminal who plans and makes a bold robbery. Third, Bob the Flambeur and Rififi end fatalistically. Four, each film shares many motifs and situations that classify them as great. <br /> <br /> Rififi's charm is part of the charm of the colorful characters that surround the story, such as Tony the Stephanois, Jo the Swede, Mario Farrati, and Cesar the Milanese. Most of the violence is implicit but effectively brutal. The main characters led by Tony the Stephanois respect a strong and outdated code of honor reminiscent of Sam Peckinpah and John Woo. Jean Servais becomes the role of Tony the St√©phanois with his cynical vision and his tired look. Rififi's The Men / Rififi (1955) became one of my favorites as soon as I saw it on the big screen from start to finish.
