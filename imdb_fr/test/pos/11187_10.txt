A group of evil businessmen need to demolish a building to build a huge complex, but they can not remove the tenants. Tenants and businessmen with their hired thugs clash until the movie ends with one of the funniest fights of all time! The guy with the red hair that goes 'eeeeehhhh' every time he throws a punch and the other guy who poses with a knife in his mouth instead of fighting, only to be beaten from the camera. rather than with them.
