Many things have already been written on the film itself, so instead of making more noise, I just want to say a few words about the two actresses. <br /> <br /> This must be a discouraging prospect for any actress. in a sense, playing against the spectacular Monica Bellucci, but Romane Bohringer achieves a sensational result. A movie with Monica Bellucci where I fall in love with the other girl ?? This is not supposed to happen. <br /> <br /> This has been said a thousand times, but Monica Bellucci strikes the saddest figure of modern cinema. I have never seen such innate sadness before. It would not be out of place to break Lon Chaney's heart.
