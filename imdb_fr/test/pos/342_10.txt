I am a big supporter of Indian films, especially Malayalam and Tamil. <br /> <br /> Shame on India for failing to send this film as an official film for its Oscars. I saw this film and it clearly showed me the maturity of its script and its story that Tamil cinema understood better. Bollywood is catching up. By the way, all Westerners, Tamil cinema is more qualitative and very different from Bollywood. about beauty and promotion. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, what was India thinking about when it sent a film like "Devdas" to the Oscars? It was really a masochistic gesture. I think they are trying to punish the boredom of the Oscar judges by sending Devdas since they overthrew Lagaan last year. <br /> <br /> "Devdas" is a melodrama bursting but predictable predictable love, destiny and destiny. I would stay away from that. In any case, not sending a film like Kanathil Muthital shows how much the Indian administration needs to be reorganized to be saved from the poor administrators who lack intelligence. Now, I know why this country has so many problems. They have a lot of talent but are not highlighted properly.
