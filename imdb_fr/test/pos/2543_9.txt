It's a wonderful movie, about a beer soul. It's a trip to the heart of Ale. I found it fascinating. The director did a great job. He makes the scenes speak. Especially on silent scenes. The window of Ale is a big one. The scenes where he lies in bed are one of the best directed scenes I've seen. <br /> <br /> Outside the direction. It's been a long time since I watched a movie about a soul. As a philosopher, I can say that this film proves that age does not matter to your soul. So, like the soul of Ale. <br /> <br /> As I live in Turkey, I do not care about the other side of New York. It's a universal scene that you can see all over the world. As for my opinion more universal than anything else. <br /> <br /> Do not miss this movie. Otherwise, you will miss a great thing about a soul. If you have one. <br /> <br /> Baris.Sentuna
