The "hunting trilogy" of Rabbit Fire (1951), Rabbit Seasoning (1952) and Duck! Rabbit! Duck! (1953) should be considered the comic high water mark of the collaboration between Chuck Jones and Michael Maltese. Although they are rarely mentioned in the lists of "greatest" or "most important" drawings in the history of animation, they are certainly the most entertaining drawings I have ever seen. Michael Maltese never had the merit of a director like Jones, Freleng or Avery, but it's his dialogue and his situations that make Warner Bros.'s cartoons.
