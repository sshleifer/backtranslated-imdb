The best British comedy movie ever! For years, English television comedy programs turned into movies and collapsed: "Are You Being Served?" "Army dads", the list is long. However, the popular TV show with black humor BBC; 'The League of Gentlemen' not only managed to create a film that did not manage to be a flop, but which also managed to become the best British comedy film ever recorded! With its dark and horrible twists, the apocalypse of the League of Gentlemen's is the British talent at its best! His demonic intrigue written by the League of Gentlemen (Mark Gatiss, Steve Pemberton, Reece Shearsmith and Jeremy Dyson) is a fantastic match with the role of awesome actor! I hope this is not the end of Royston Vasey, not after this great success anyway! Do not think that if you have not seen The League of Gentlemen on TV, you will not understand what's going on. Everything is well explained and at the end of the film, you will be satisfied with the result, but you are always hungry for more ... Mmmm, Special Stuff.
