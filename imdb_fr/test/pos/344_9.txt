I saw this film at the Toronto International Film Festival in 2002. <br /> <br /> This is the first Indian movie I saw in the Tamil language. Although he shares some similarities with other Indian films (marvelous music and choreography, complete script), the director tries more than entertain. The film tells the story of Amudha, a nine-year-old girl, whose parents told her that she had been adopted, opening an odyssey that took them all from India to Sri Lanka, a city torn apart by war. Beautiful visuals mingle with horrible scenes of violence to make a point, even if it is a simplistic text. Amudha is played by P.S. Keerthana, and she is one of the few children actors I've seen that can be early without being boring. Its charm and beauty kept the film together.
