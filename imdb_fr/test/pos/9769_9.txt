Apparently, this Australian film based on Nevil Shute's novel exists in more than one form. Pay attention to heavily cut versions sometimes shown on cable or satellite, ranging from 95 minutes to 2 hours. Only the full version of the 5-hour mini-series tells the story correctly. It is a realization very close to the story, which suffers only editorial mistakes common in the movies: hacks and episodic progression. But this excellent distribution continues the story very well with good production values ​​that usually accompany their work. Yuki Shimoda is notably known as "Gunso Mifune", one of the guards responsible for accompanying women in their atrocious journey. In the end, he becomes a friend. You will be agonized with him when his loss of face will lead him to death. Helen Morse as "Jean Paget", pretty but not very beautiful (she looks a bit like Sigourney Weaver) records just enough sperm and seduction on demand . The mini-series highlights the beautiful love stories, three of them: "Joe" and "Jean", "Noel" and "Jean", and "Jean" and Willstown. Gordon Jackson plays "Noel Strachan" in an attractive way, but as a man a little younger than Nevil Shute, as stated in the novel. The third love story I told you about does not get all the attention it deserves, and the importance of the title is diminished. "Jean" is dedicated to creating businesses in Willstown that will attract young women and girls and their civilizing influence to this deserted backcountry town. She wants to make it "a city like Alice"; Alice Springs, that's it. We only have some clues about this in several scenes. If you have five hours to spare, this miniseries is a truly rewarding experience. Nevil Shute based his novel on the cruelty of the Japanese army by moving a large group of women and children from one place to another on the Maylay Peninsula. This happened in Sumatra, according to Shute, rather than on the peninsula. The crucifixion of "Joe" by a Japanese officer for stealing chickens to feed the women is probably a fiction, but the cruelty of the Japanese in the treatment of prisoners is certainly a record deal.
