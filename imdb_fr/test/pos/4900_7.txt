A family of tight-knit musicians, a grumpy, benevolent father and four perennial teenage daughters, is reinforced by, on the one hand, the appearance of Felix, a dashing young composer, and, on the other, and most profoundly, of Mickey , his insolently orchestrating friend. <br /> <br /> It takes a while for Michael Curtiz to float this piece of Americana. The first part looks almost like a paraphrase of a cereal advertisement, not without a certain picturesque and very bourgeois charm, then John Garfield enters the scene in the role of the condemned Mickey Mouse, making his first appearance in cinematographic films, with loops black, Sleepy eyes, hangover, rude and disheveled, unlike Felix de Jeffrey Lynn, persuasive and fiery charm. Garfield is in full, and he directly needs a counterpoint with the rest of the household ("Nothing I would do would surprise me," he thinks), and suddenly the film becomes interesting, well that I agree with critics who find that the plot runs insufficiently motivated. <br /> <br /> The four sisters are pretty bland and seriously subscribed, but Claude Rains as pater familias at his moments. <br /> <br /> Look at it for Garfield, although it's the only really durable thing about it.
