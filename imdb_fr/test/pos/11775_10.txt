Talk about your classics! Ernie Fossilus (the Foss from now on) has created a cute and creative trailer totally parodying Star Wars. This jewel is so full of tribute and gags that I laugh every time! Not only that, when Star Wars reissued with new special effects, Hardware Wars did the same! You speak of a parody that will not die! There is a reason why George Lucas calls this his favorite parody. He was so impressed that he even engaged the Foss to work on "The Return of the Jedi" (Do not believe me, check his entry into IMDb!) <br /> <br /> This must be the first, and A in my opinion, the best parody ever made. I think the special edition was a little exaggerated, but on reflection, I think it's perfect for the modern re-release of Star Wars, and it proves that sometimes it's wrong to mess with perfection. > Yes, it's only 10 minutes, but it's really worth it. <br /> <br /> You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll kiss $ 3 bye! Well, maybe 15 for the DVD, but you'll be really happy to have done it.
