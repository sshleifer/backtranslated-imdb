How's the bear's paw, the elephant's trunk or the monkey's brain for dinner? Let Tsui Hark tell you about this wonderful and funny comedy about the art of cooking in Chinese (?). <br /> <br /> This film presents the common structure of an American sports film, but instead of focusing on baseball it focuses on cooking, which makes it all the more interesting. I even think that the character of Leslie Cheung looks a lot like Charlie Sheen in the Major League ... <br /> <br /> This film also contains a bit of a fight between Zhao Wen Zhao and Xiong Xin Xin (I love see more after The Blade) and a funny joke about a Leon Lai pop song ... <br /> <br /> Maybe the film is not ideal for the strictest vegetarians.
