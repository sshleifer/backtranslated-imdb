A must for all hardcore carpenters fans! <br /> <br /> Cynthia Gibb plays the role of KC with a huge amount of justice, and although "the story" is not 100% factual, she remains a good glimpse of the life of Richard and Karen and deserves a watch just for the soundtrack. <br /> <br /> It makes me cry every time !!! <br /> <br />
