Koreans are therefore abandoning American horror films. But they do it with style. DOLL MASTER is a close copy of PUPPETMASTER and DOLLS, and even has a little child's play to win. Many young adults are invited to attend a special event in a gallery filled with dolls, only to discover that they are the target of an avenging spirit. The dolls come to life and make bad things unpleasant to children. The gore level is reasonably high, the photography and the design of the sets and the production values ​​are first-rate, the acting is not so bad, and the frights are there. DOLL MASTER may not be in the same league as A TAL OF TWO SISTERS or even DEAD FRIEND, but it's close. Give him a watch. You will not be disappointed.
