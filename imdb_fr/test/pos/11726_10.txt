Dirty Harry goes to Atlanta is what Burt called this fantastic crime thriller of the first order borrowing part of his plot to the venerable film of Dana Andrews "Laura". Burt Reynolds not only plays the main role in this great saga, but he also piloted it and he does not make the slightest mistake in staging the action or casting of his characters. It's not a bad performance in the film and Reynolds does it in a remarkable way. Henry Silva is really cold as a hit-tube. <br /> <br /> Detective Tom Sharky (Burt Reynolds) is in a narcotics case in the subterranean city of Atlanta when things go wrong. He ends up chasing a suspect and killing him with the shooter in a bus. During the melee, an innocent bystander dies. "The Killer" by John Woo reproduces this scene. Anyway, the Atlanta Police Department puts Burt in the vice position and takes control of a new leader, Frisco (Charles Durning's "Oh, my brother, where are you?"). -ground. Sharky finds himself in a real crime gap. Sharky and his fellow detectives Arch (Bernie Casey) and Papa (Brian Keith) set up a surveillance system for a high-priced call girl, Dominoe (Rachel Ward of "After Dark, My Sweet") who owns a luxurious apartment she shares with another girl. . <br /> <br /> Dominoe meets a local politician, Hotchkins (Earl Holliman of "Police Woman") who is fighting for the governor but the main villain, Victor (Vittorio Gassman of "The Dirty Game") wants him to end to the case. Hotchkins is reluctant to welcome Victor, so Victor asks snorting cocaine Billy Score (Henry Silva of "Wipeout") to finish Dominoe. Billy makes a hole the size of a twelve-inch pizza in the door of Dominoe's apartment and kills her. <br /> <br /> Sharky did the unthinkable. During the surveillance, he became so fond of Dominoe that he loved him so much. Sharky's mission in the present life is to overthrow Victor, but he learns that Victor has an informant in the Atlanta Police Department. The plot really warms up when Sharky later finds out that Billy shot the wrong girl and that Dominoe is still alive! Sharky takes her on remand and things get even more complicated. He assembles his "Machine" title to deal with Victor and his hoods. <br /> <br /> William Fraker's big-screen optics are immaculate. Unfortunately, this largely underestimated classic is only available as a full-frame movie. Fraker definitely contributes to the atmosphere of the photo, especially during the scene of mutilation on the boat when the villain cut one of Sharky's fingers. It's a rather macabre scene. <br /> <br /> Burt never shot a movie that surpassed "Sharky's Machine".
