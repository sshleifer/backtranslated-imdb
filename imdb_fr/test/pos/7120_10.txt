This one is rare. <br /> <br /> After a few years of fantastic RPG, we parted, I did not leave without feeling ashamed of what I had become: a dork. <br /> <br /> You see, these things are really canonical, it happens to everyone. <br /> <br /> First, you create a character in a fair way and he dies after the first attack. <br /> <br /> Then you help a little with the constitution, and while you're there, why not help too with strength, intelligence, intuition, charisma and dexterity? This will in turn frustrate the game master who does not know how to handle this invincible gang. And after a while, the players are bored too, so they start creating more and more exotic combinations, no matter how ridiculous it is. <br /> <br /> I created a warrior monk druedain, yes, not so far. of the film. <br /> <br /> And that's not all about the destructive nature of the dynamics inherent in this diabolical game (think about the hunt for experience points), but watch the movie, it shows everything - and of course the stupidity of his most elementary premises. <br /> <br /> To this end, there is no better job than the bard. I do not really understand why the bard became a character in the first place, after all, the blacksmith is none. But once it became one, it had to be integrated in the course of the game, that is to say, it had to be made deadly, at least indirectly. The joke of this game never ends and rightly so. <br /> <br /> Of course, it's not really a professional production, but I have not seen a better satire all the time.
