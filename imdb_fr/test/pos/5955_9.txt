That's how I would summarize! There were others who said, Naked Gun meets James Bond. I think mine is more precise, but I'm not neutral on this point ...; o) <br /> <br /> This film is a kind of breath of the past. It reminds you of old movies (from the 50s and 60s) and it's not just because it's read at that time (1955 to be exact, with the Flashback exception), but it's the mood in which film is shot. watch on the screen! The main actor here (who, as I was told, is very popular in his home country, France), is perfect in his role here. He is the spy with the number 117 attached to him. There is a character that sums it up in the movie, asking a question, whether it's good or not ... you'll see when you watch the movie! <br /> <br /> It's really very funny, and if you like your spies mixed up with old-school comedy, but do not take yourself seriously, do not need to look at that! : o)
