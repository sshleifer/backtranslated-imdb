A friend brought me this film and at first I hesitated, the rhythm in the film was so slow that it was certainly boring at first. But the scenes of life were attractive, it's like watching what to watch. <br /> <br /> It turned out to be just beautiful throughout the movie. The way the director handled the scenes of life to reflect the reality was disconcerting, but at the same time overwhelming. It's like understanding the real life of a living person as watching a movie. <br /> <br /> Alejandro Polanco and Miss Isamar Gonzales played their role so well that it's more like telling us their own story. Indeed, they used their real names in the movie.
