I have not seen this film for more than 20 years, but it struck me so much that I remember going to the credits for several minutes. It's one of the most underrated films of the entire decade in which it was originally released. I just ordered a copy of the DVD and paid for it the next day and can not wait for it to arrive. It is very edifying at times, and also very dark and somewhat disturbing. This is the story of a very dense group of normal children growing up in the city center who seem to be seated rather than watching on a movie screen or television . Hard to explain, but it's something that needs to be experienced. The story begins in childhood and traces the life of the four main characters throughout their high school and during their various journeys in life. The entire casting has done an incredible job and this is by far the best job of Jodi Thelen's career. I hope that the DVD will live up to my memory and I hope to see it on Friday with a good friend.
