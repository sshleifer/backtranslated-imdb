We can say that the most beautiful series ever presented (without debate for the moment) on Earthman Flash Gordon, Professor Zarkov and the beautiful Dale Arden traveling in a rocket to another world to save the planet. On the way, in breathtaking, spectacular and action-packed chapters, Flash and his friends, as well as new friends such as Prince Barin, Prince Thun and the impressive King Vultan pool their resources to fight against Woes and armies of the merciless Ming de Mongo and the jealous betrayal of his daughter Priness Aura (now she is a car!). This serial number is not just an advantage over most serial publications in terms of plot, action game and budget - it is very advanced in these areas. Produced by Universal Studios, it has many old-fashioned decors at its disposal, such as The Bride of Frankenstein's laboratory cabinet and the Opera House of the Phantom of the Opera, to name a few. In my humble opinion, the values ​​of production are advanced for 1936. The costumes worn by many of these strange men and women are truly creative and first-rate. We have men of hawks, shark men, lion men, high priests, creatures like dragons, octasacks, orangapoids and tigers (oh my god!) And many other fantastic things. Are they all credible, first-rate special effects? No way. But for 1936, most are very impressive. The score is awesome and the chapter debuts are well written, long enough to revitalize the viewer's memories of the old chapter, and have been noted expertly. Director Frederick Stephani does a great job assembling everything perfectly and creating a film worthy of Alex Raymond's phenomenal comic strip. Finally, the acting is very good in this series. Too often, the series have no name, no talent, surrounding one or two former talents - here everyone has abilities. Do not get me wrong, it's not a Shakespeare troupe at all, but Buster Crabbe does an honest and friendly job like Flash. He is assisted with talent by Jean Arden, Priscella Lawson and the rest of the cast in general with two outstanding performers. But before we get to those two, let me add, as another reviewer has noted, that this drama must have been extraordinary for the Hayes office. I see more flesh on Flash and on Jean Rogers and Priscella Lawson than in movies decades later. The shorts that Crabbe (and unfortunately for all of us, Professor Zarkov (Frank Shannon) wears) are as beautiful as the shorts that boys can wear. Lawson is also very sensual and beautiful. For me, the two actors who make the soap opera are Charles Middleton as Ming: unofficial, sardonic, ruthless and fun. Middleton is a class actor. Jack "Tiny" Lipson plays King Vultan: turbulent, catchy, hilarious - a symbol of pure joy in life and the very essence of hedonism. Lipson steals every scene in which he finds himself. The intrigue meanders here, there and everywhere - but Flash Gordon is the penultimate opus in the series, the space opera, as well as the basis of science fiction to follow.
