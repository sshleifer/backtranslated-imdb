At first glance, this is one of the most classically entertaining action / comedy / romance movies I've seen in a long time. timed humor and integrated action. Beyond that, there is our knowledge of the context of this film. It has the same elements of "Casablanca", but is defined just before many characters really understand the seriousness of what was happening in their country (and the world) and the consequences of some of their own behaviors. This adds a touch of irony to the humor (we feel that one of the female characters has a radical change of hairstyle in her future). It's a movie you will not regret watching.
