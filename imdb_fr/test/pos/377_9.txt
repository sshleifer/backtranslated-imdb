In Alfred Hitchcock's adaptation of Patricia Highsmith's "Strangers On A Train", Guy Haines (Farley Granger) and Bruno Anthony (Robert Walker) meet for the first time on a train trip and discuss the idea of commit two murders. Anthony, a little too arrogant, suggests that he could murder Haines' unfaithful wife and that Haines could murder Anthony's domineering father. The absence of any link between the murderer and the victim in each case should ensure that both crimes remain unresolved. The content of the conversation leaves Haines, more comfortable, feeling that the proposition is not quite serious. Complications arise later when Anthony kills Haines' wife at an amusement park, then sues Haines for her share of the bargain. <br /> <br /> The differences between the two men are clear from the beginning. Haines is a professional, respectable, and modest tennis player in his exploits, while Anthony's life is nowhere. He admits to being trolled into three colleges for drinking and gambling. Haines is in a relationship with a senator's daughter whom he wants to marry. Anthony characteristically interprets this as a cynical maneuver on the part of Haines to give himself a shortcut to a career. Character differences are also visually enhanced. Anthony often lives in shady areas and goes on a boat called "Pluto", while Haines is often seen from a more heroic angle thanks to the low camera angles. <br /> <br /> There are some striking visual sequences, such as: - <br /> <br /> (1) The murder of Haines' wife, who sees herself through the reflection of her falling glasses on the ground as she struggles to free herself from Anthony. <br /> <br /> representation of Anthony alone, dressed in black and very small in front of the huge white edifice of the Jefferson Memorial. <br /> <br /> (3) The occasion where all the spectators of a tennis match move their head in unison, following the show action, while a head (the one of Anthony) remains frozen in a position facing Haines. <br /> <br /> (4) The scene where the roundabout becomes completely uncontrollable and crashes dramatically. <br /> <br /> "Doubles" are frequently used throughout history, for example, Haines and Anthony are originally presented in 2 p. tunes of feet coming out of their taxis and going to the train. When the train leaves the station, there are 2 sets of tracks, each offering a choice of 2 lanes. The two men discuss the murders of two potential victims and order two double whiskeys. The cameo Hitchcock sees him struggling aboard the train with a bass. Haines feels double-faced when his wife denies an agreement that she sees a lawyer to arrange a divorce. Haines's wife goes to the amusement park with two boyfriends. When Anthony confronts her before the murder, he turns on his cigarette lighter and produces two reflections in his glasses. Anthony then becomes very confused when he meets the younger daughter of the senator, whom he considers a doubled for the woman of Haines. Anthony also feels doubled when Haines refuses to pursue the second murder. When Haines travels alone on a train to Metcalf, he sees two men in the same car accidentally kicking in the same manner as he and Anthony. <br /> <br /> The action takes place throughout the film. a good pace and the performances of Robert Walker and Patricia Hitchcock (as younger daughter of the senator) are particularly powerful.
