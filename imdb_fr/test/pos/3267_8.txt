Jordan takes us to the criminal part of Sydney, Australia, following the desperate attempt of 19-year-old Jimmy (Heath Ledger), who confines a job to a local gangster and needs to change before joining him . The gangsters (led by Bryan Brown) form a threatening band of humor. That's what makes the film work, because we always see gangsters as a rough group that tries to hurt you. But this crowd is also tickling your funny bone. Jordan, a clever and structured script, presents characters who cross each other and get trapped in the web plot.
