I saw Dark Harbor at the Seattle Film Festival in 1998. Filmed in a fall scenery of Maine, this film presents an excellent cast and a plot that lets you guess. Sometimes mysterious, sometimes funny, I must say that it stayed with me for days after seeing it. Rickman and Walker are wonderful as icy brides and Reedus is someone you'll hear more about, I'm sure. The foreground of a deserted and winding road in a twilight downpour (and the accompanying score) set the tone so well - just fantastic. Nice work from a new director / screenwriter and his talented team.
