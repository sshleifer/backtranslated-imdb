I think Crewes did very well that she should have won a prize. Everything in Dunne is recoverable because Dunne is an excellent actress and can do anything, even a weak scenario. Therefore, I would recommend it for this reason alone. This film was perhaps a little ahead of time, the plot may have been more acceptable nowadays. <br /> <br /> During Hollywood's Golden Age, movies were meant to entertain or teach, mainly to make us feel good or cope at the time. This plot seems to deviate from this profile. Yet, again, I must say that all that Irene Dunne was, at least, was "good" because she made things so credible! The only other actress I could say made me think that was the way, maybe, Deborah Kerr. Watch Silver Cord if you have the chance to "play" if nothing else.
