Recently caught after noticing the name of James Earl Jones on the title. It was better than I expected. Of course, it's pretty old - made in the early / mid 70s, but it's actually a decent drama. It lasts about 90 minutes and features good performances by James Earl Jones and Diahann Caroll. The plot is conventional in general but told through the perspective of a single black woman on social assistance who has six children and tries to solve all the problems that persist. That makes it an interesting sight ..... also in the fact that the script was not too sentimental or overdramatized - it's almost like looking at a slice of the past. All styles of the 70s are in abundance. The end is a bit crazy however ... would probably have done better without theatricality.
