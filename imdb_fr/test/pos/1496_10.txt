Mr Bean was very fun, I loved it, every episode was really funny, Rowan Atkinson was perfect for this role, he was funny and his facial expressions were hilarious !!! <br /> <br /> The series was so successful that it even shot a movie of Mr Bean in 1997, which was quite funny! <br /> <br /> It's funny to see all the adventures and situations in which it is, this series was a classic, for sure, and I still watch an episode from time to time. <br /> <br /> Mr. Bean is worth a 10/10 in my book, quirky comedy fans have to check that.
