One of the best silent dramas I've seen. Dark and dark as all the German Expressionists have produced, but with rather sober and naturalistic performances for the day. No camouflage of the camera and no involuntary laughs due to histrionics with wide arms. Sjostrom made a convincing performance as David Holm drunk, mean and scary. <br /> <br /> Placed mainly at night in a dark Swedish slum, the film had a very claustrophobic impression of play, helped by the discreet lighting and the intensive use of the iris. <br /> <br /> There was a deep sense of hopelessness and despair in the story: the film begins in a rather sinister present, then tells us the story of David Holm in a series of flashbacks (and flashbacks in flashbacks - a fairly complex story structure for 1921), where his character is offered many chances of redemption, but he does not take them, and we know he will not take them, because we saw him die drunk, miserable and mean as always in the present. The penultimate scene is as dark as the one I saw in the cinema as a whole. <br /> <br /> The writing and the realization are rigorous and intelligent, even according to the current standards. In many cases, Sjostrom skillfully prepares the public to suspect something, then creates a surprise. The end may not be a surprise to some viewers, but I did not see it coming. <br /> <br /> This film deserves a complete restoration and a DVD release. Or even a shabby budget publication. He just needs to be there for people to see and appreciate. <br /> <br /> 9.5 / 10, which rounds to 10/10
