I do not know if I would go so far as to say that this film belongs to the pile of "Australian trash", but it is fair to say that there are no Oscar nominees here. What is important to consider is that most of the actors in this film were not really actors as such, but only children having nothing better to do at the time. Many other people were offered roles in the film, but refused to go surfing the coast. All taken into account, it was really not a bad movie for his time. In some ways, it's not really like today, where peer pressure is still alive, without cell phones, computers and other similar gadgets without which children did not live, unlike this generation. Anyway, I have to evaluate this film as being an old teenager that I look at once in a blue moon and that I never take too seriously ...
