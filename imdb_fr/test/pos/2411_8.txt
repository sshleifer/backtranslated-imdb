OK, so it's a real scam of the first karate kid. However, I think there can never be too many movies like the first Karate Kid. There is something about this type of story that seems particularly applicable to people like me. You have the general impression that you can overcome adversity by discovering new things about yourself. In this movie, Hillary Swank is a special gem as Next Karate Kid. You can really say she has a bright future ahead of her. <br /> <br /> Not to say that this film is not without problems. Unlike the first, Mr. Miyagi seems a bit too impatient to get Julie to learn martial arts and to get her involved in the fighting. It almost seems that he forgot his values ​​of the first film. In addition, disbelief must be suspended during the examination of the monks. The film gives the monks a far too simplistic view of life and does not really explain why they do what they do in the plot. The bad guys are also a little questionable, even if they are really bad villains. I also suspect the martial arts movies that end on the evening of the prom. <br /> <br /> It may not be a perfect movie. So maybe it would not be the best movie to rent on Friday night. However, for more than one reason, it's a guilty pleasure. Hillary Swank is so adorable, and the story, while not original, works. In a genre of movies that seems to rest only on action and violence, it's a breath of fresh air. Unlike all those of Steven Seagal and Jean Claude Van-Damme, this is a film about the mind and the heart. There are people who need movies like this, and we take everything we can get. My rating: 8/10
