This film was played at Lexington KY for 7 days. I saw it on the last day of its broadcast and regretted not being able to recommend it to anyone because it is about a movie that demands a big screen experience. The aerial shot where the cluttered ship moves away from the crowded dock is a masterpiece, as is the scene where the two main characters flirt on the bridge - a ballet almost as sexy as many more explicit These days. I just think that more people will not have the opportunity to see this beautiful movie in a theater; the DVD experience will not be the same. Here's an idea: If you live in a university town, see if you can lobby for it to appear in a campus film festival.
