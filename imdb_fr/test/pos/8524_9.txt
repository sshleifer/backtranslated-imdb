It's an excellent James Bond movie. Although this is not part of the original and more famous series, and it is an independent film, it is very well done. Encouraging Sean Connery to return to the role he made famous was a stroke of genius, as was the title of the movie that refers to his past wish to no longer play Bond. Connery was as awesome as in his previous appearances in 007. The script is remarkable, as is photography and performance. I remember the first film with Kim Basinger, who became much more famous after this film; Barbara Carrera was excellent; and Klaus Maria Brandauer was absolutely perfect as the main villain. The frequent references to Bond's aging and the changing times and attitudes of the British secret services were very humorous. The 007 gadgets matched those of other Bond movies. The only thing missing was the famous musical theme 007, which, of course, could not be used by this competing production. It was pretty amazing for me to be able to see two great James Bond movies released the same year, this one and Octopussy with Roger Moore. An interesting aspect of the film is the emphasis on video games and computer graphics. The early eighties marked the first day of glory of this kind of thing and its use in this film made it a very contemporary film. The movie is actually a different version of Thunderball, updated with newer technology. Regardless of the repeated theme, there are enough differences to make it more entertaining. I will look at this one frequently.
