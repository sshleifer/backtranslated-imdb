Bobbycrush, Cam Archer's lyrical song, boldly captures the disoriented kaleidoscope of adolescent desire with a sumptuous rendering (beautifully photographed by Aaron Platt), more vibrant than narrative. Taken between the documentary and the dream, Bobbycrush recalls the inventiveness of Todd Haynes and the lively hyperrealism of Gus van Sant. With grain, glamor and heartache, it sounds a bit like the cinematic equivalent of Sonic Youth playing Bubblegum Pop.
