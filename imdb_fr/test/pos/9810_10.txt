SPOILER, BUT SPOILER <br /> <br /> I have to add my name to the list of people who feel that other viewers simply do not understand. But nobody has even mentioned the word "s" so far. <br /> <br /> Although I agree that the kid is dead, I think we can be more specific: he committed suicide. He goes down the slope in an old wagon, pulls off the cliff and ... "flies off". Perhaps the story of the form of death is an allegory or perhaps it commits suicide in a wagon as described. In both cases, it "flies away" (go, not such a hard metaphor). <br /> <br /> Maybe I just have something for Tom Hanks, but I agree with the narration. In addition, he raises dollars for the memorial of the Second World War and you must like it for that. <br /> <br /> Oh yes, I loved the movie and found it incredibly moving.
