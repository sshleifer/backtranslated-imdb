Mark Blankfield was playing with Jekyll and Hyde. <br /> <br /> Michael McGuire was the father. <br /> <br /> Tim Thomerson was the plastic surgeon. <br /> <br /> Have you even seen this movie? I doubt! <br /> <br /> Blankfield was quite popular at that time for playing the doctor who took the pills on Friday. Thomerson was funny in everything he did, from movies to series to comedy. If I ever find this movie on DVD, I will definitely buy it. I recorded this movie on HBO in 1982 and I used the tape a lot. One of the funniest games on the theme of Jekyll & Hyde never took place. <br /> <br /> Of course. with all the references to cocaine in this film, it would be considered too politically incorrect today, just like Cheech and Chong. Too bad, because it's funny, funny, funny!
