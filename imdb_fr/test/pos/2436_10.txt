Almost missed. While visiting friends in Philadelphia in the early 80s, I surfed a channel after everyone else went to bed. It was not just Bogart who was obsessing him; but rather the whole era of those old movies that those of my age know so well. Add to that a plot that resembles the Maltese Falcon - where so many different characters interact with Sacchi - and you have a work of art for me. About ten years later, he appeared on television and I recorded it. >
