very rarely, I happen to sit down to write a comment for a movie .... but this movie !!!!!! Oh my God !!!!!!!! has never existed a Hindi movie better than this one ...... and never a better movie than this one has come ...... it's the king of all comedies ... .. <br /> <br /> aamir khan is arguably the best comic actor in the Indian film industry ... although it's funny to say that because it's an issue of class, not a comedian ... but what he did in this movie is perhaps the most hilarious performance of all Indian actors in a comedy. .. <br /> <br /> Salman Khan was never a good actor in my eyes .... but this film made the most of him .... he was innocently comic ... if ever there was a term like this .... what the doctor ordered regarding his role in the film ... <br /> <br /> rajkumar santoshi, I do not know why, do not never again tried comedy. ... he's been leading big companies like The Legend of Bhagat Singh and Khakee but could not recreate the magic of Andaz Apna Apna .... <br /> I do not care why this film was bombarded at the box office .... although I'm sad that a movie like "haap ah haa kaun" was the reason for its failure ...... from now on, I hope that the rumors will become true ..... there will be "andaz apna apna-2", they say ....... we, as a public, can only say AMEN !!!!!
