A rather silly little movie you may love. <br /> <br /> Although it is a little tacky and cliche from time to time, it still works and allows a good entertainment. Five teams embarked on a scavenger hunt and fought brilliantly to win the all-night competition - just for the absolute joy of "knowing that yours is the best team". <br /> <br /> Notable for several screen debut, including First role in David Naughton's film after his commercial for Dr. Pepper "Be a Pepper" and before his 1981 film, "American Werewolf in London ". We also find Paul Ruebens in what I believe to be his first Pee Wee Herman-esquire roll a year before being known. And finally, Mr. Spin City and Alex Keaton himself, Michael J. Fox gets his first role in the film here. Fans will remember Stephen Furst as Flounder in Animal House. Apart from that, no names, but all the fun characters. <br /> <br /> Doubt, this has never been recorded on DVD, but there are probably still floating VHS copies and you could even watch a late show. One day. If you do, it's worth watching. You may hate it, but it could also become a little original movie you'd like to like.
