I saw this film at the Telluride Film Festival in 1997, where one of the writers, Jos√© Giovanni, was in the limelight. It ranks as a big black-crime-drama drama, incredible performances of Belmondo and Lino Ventura. The attention given to each character and the complex psychological representations, detailing loyalty, betrayal, love and hope, are enormous. It's an excellent drama, an excellent thriller and an excellent movie. Up there with the best of Melville. (The title in English "Class All Risks", in French "Class All Risks" is a pun on "Class Tourist", which means "Class of tourism".
