Even if, at times, I was the only one in the cinema to laugh, that's the main pleasure I got from "Thirsty", the beautiful shot shot: laughter. Although sometimes the film seemed to be in a crisis of identity and not knowing if it was a tragedy or a comedy, the darkest of black moods appeared at regular intervals. <br /> <br /> This naturally helped that everyone's level of action is wonderful, and that I'm a little obsessed with the sometimes naughty main lady, who was beautifully elegant, whatever the color of her blood and his malevolence. became. <br /> <br /> I read reviews that suggested that this movie was too long. I did not mean it. In fact, the last scenes, moving and hilarious (I mean brown shoes ...) have proved in turn among the best of the film.
