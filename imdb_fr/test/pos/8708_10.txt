This is a perfect example of a Classic Full Moon Pictures movie. Any fan of Horror / Vampire Flicks should definitely check this one. Original plot and good, easy to follow story. In addition, this film presents thrilling scenes that combine horror and action. For now, the only continuation I saw in this film is the fourth part, which, I must say, is almost better than this original. <br /> <br /> I give it 10/10 <br /> <br /> Fans of horror movies like this one should go to Puppet Master, on Slumber Party Massacre, on Skinned Alive, on Sleep Away Camp and other Full Moon Pictures movies.
