(VERY light spoilerish) <br /> <br /> I must begin by saying that science fiction does not usually impress me. Pitch Black (2000) was a pleasant surprise. From the beginning, it made me addicted to the rhythm, intensity and visual explosion that fascinated me and stuck to my seat. I am very happy to say that this film is the best (well, at least * one * of the best) sci-fi document I have seen for a very long time. <br /> <br /> The plot In short, this may seem simple: a (space) ship crashes into a planet supposedly deserted and its captain, Caroline Fry (impressive Radha Mitchell), must lead the survivors to the security. At first, a cold-blooded murderer, Riddick (Vin Diesel, who plays the role with a very credible rescue style), may seem like the group's biggest problem, but at nightfall, the creatures of the night starts to wake up ... This leads to a desperate attempt to escape the bloodthirsty predators, which, as we all can guess, does not lead to a happy family picnic. <br /> <br /> It's not the plot itself that makes the film worth watching - - after all, let's face it, if you get to the point, it's is not * the * original *, but the skill in which that is said. The story flowed forward, did not let me yawn (at least not much) at any point. The realization was a fabulous job. It was a very visual film, even magnificent. The purple night view was a real treat. Although "beautiful" may not be the right word to use; Yes, the images shown were candy to the eye, but they also added a touch of unspecified grotesque, serenity, as if something was about to explode under the motionless surface. (Not to mention the fact that the monsters were really well designed, they seemed realistic, which seems to be rare these days [maybe people can not be bothered to make them look real ...]) /> <br /> I not only appreciated the visual aspect of the film but also the psychological aspect of the story. During the film, we see the characters go by - some fall, others go up - but what fascinated me most was the development of Riddick's character. I liked watching the change in him throughout the movie. To go one step further, the other thing I really liked about Riddick is the incredibly good and initially executed UST (unresolved sexual tension) between Fry and him who "did not" (you'll get what I say once you see it). [One can not deny that they had chemistry. Do not even try or I'll pick you up and make you listen to chopsticks until you scream * a smile *] It was cool. As Radha Mitchell once said (modified quote), "Pitch Black is a really sexy movie without sex", which makes it even more interesting. <br /> <br /> To summarize, I recommend this movie - even if you're not really a fan of "space stories". The suspense was maintained until the end and, importantly, we were (or at least I was) looking for more. If you do not worry about psychology, subtext, etc. (like my bad habit) you will always find Pitch Black very entertaining. Take off your shoes and enjoy.
