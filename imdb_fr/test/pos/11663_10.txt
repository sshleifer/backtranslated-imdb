it was very sensitive very deep. It's my favorite all the time you can not see a movie deeper than this amazing movie. Susan Sarandon did her role as a mature actress, and she fulfilled her role. She deserved the prize. She convinced me to be a nun. The music was very impressive and sensitive. I really liked this deep masterpiece.
