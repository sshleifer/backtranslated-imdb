Rooms and hallways is the kind of film that makes you understand that the drama of life is hidden in the details. And this drama can be very fun too! Even if your love life and your friends may not be as unique as the characters in this film, everyone is bound to recognize themselves and others in the colorful protagonists of this film. And it's the great strength of the rooms and corridors, the irony of life, is that the most confusing things that happen to you can be the most interesting / hilarious / funny / sexy / ... too! I hope you enjoy the movie as much as me!
