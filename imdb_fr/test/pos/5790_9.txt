This documentary was my first introduction to the peak oil theory. A fascinating concept that has many frightening consequences if it turns out to be correct. I did not know that the effects of oil depletion would come so soon, it literally took my breath away. This movie will probably open your eyes to the force with which the American way of life depends on "the abundance of cheap oil" - a term used throughout the film. Many topics are common sense and do not go into detail. But you probably have never collected all the pieces like this movie does. Interviews with authors and energy experts are all very interesting. I do not think this movie is meant to scare people. It's just about informing people what to expect in the coming years, and perhaps encouraging you to think twice before going to work and leaving your lights on all day . <br /> <br /> After watching this movie, I was no longer able to watch cars and buses zooming in the same way. Excellent documentary, everyone should see it.
