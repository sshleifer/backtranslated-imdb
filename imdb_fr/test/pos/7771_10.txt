I watched Love Jones over thirty times. It's one of the few movies that portrays a love story about people who happen to be African-Americans. The dialogue was written in a realistic manner and delivered with honesty. It was so nice to see a movie whose screenplay is centered on young professional African-Americans. It's practically an untapped market. Love Jones was also visually captivating. The chemistry between Lorenz Tate and Nia Long will bring memories of past and present love. The feeling of the film is jazz and blues, and brings to me the sensuality of hot, creamy hot chocolate with a hint of Kahlua and Butterscotch. If you had not guessed, I loved it!
