I would like to know if anyone knows how to get a copy of the movie "It's the way of the world". It has been about 30 years since I saw this film and I would like to see it again. Earth Wind & Fire transcends the nation around the world with its inspiring music and themes. It was unfortunate that this group did not take off like its counterparts in the early 1970s but, as noted earlier, there was racial tension in the United States that prohibited even exposure of Afro-American musical groups. It is good to see that Earth Wind & Fire continues its success. I would like to add this film to my collection. Someone please help me if possible. Thank you for your attention. Milton Shaw
