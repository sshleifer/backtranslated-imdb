GoldenEye 007 is not only the best tie game of all time, but it may be the most influential first-person shooter of all time in the game console market. are not aware of the plot of this game, it is not a problem, because it is essentially the same film as the popular James Bond film, GoldenEye, released in 1995 - two years before the release of this game. <br /> <br /> It's a game full of techniques and styles that will be imitated in many upcoming games and offers the player a wide variety of challenging goals and challenges. A.I. is intelligent (especially on higher difficulty levels) and environments are complex enough to provide entertainment as well as difficulties for any player. <br /> <br /> The introduction of logical hit points on your enemies is an interesting feature. Even the bosses in this game can be shot with a well targeted shot to the head. It's this kind of realism that really makes you feel like your James Bond and that you can sneak around secretly, secretly go out of handcuffs as you go, or trigger alarms and have to go through massive fire. For this reason, there are many ways to defeat the game and limitless possibilities of accomplishing your tasks. AKA: You can choose simple or difficult ways to beat levels ... and if you do not have a strategy guide, you will have to discover them yourself (which, I would add, is incredibly fun if you want lose a day). <br /> <br /> This is one of those games in which the more you play, the more you are able to value your contributions to the gaming industry. Every time I play, I notice aspects that have been reproduced in many of the following FPS games. So, if you have a Nintendo 64, save it and order a used copy of GoldenEye 007, because believe me, as a fan of Bond and casual player, I can say that this game is highly recommended to all those who wish. Step into James Bond's shoes or simply experience an intense and intense gaming experience. <br /> <br /> (Also be sure to watch his twin game, Perfect Dark, also on the N64, as a result of the same similar weapon controls and uses.)
