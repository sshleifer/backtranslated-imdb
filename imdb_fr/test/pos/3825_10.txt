What can I say about the series dubbed the NEW EXTERNAL LIMITS ... Hmm ... Only it was one of the best television series ever assembled !! You have actors of all ages, actors that we know a little and that time has forgotten. Everyone plays their part perfectly! These shows always have a kind of moral story which, most of the time (if not all the time), is very true! You can feel that the man whose voice is doubled by the credits and at the beginning and the end believes what he says without reserve! Not only do these series have a beautiful story, but they also throw you in, stimulate your mind and stimulate your blood. Originally, the outer limits were in black and white in the 60s. These shows made a triumphant return as I have never seen it before! The new twilight zone with Forest Whitaker was fun to watch, but the new OUTER LIMITS is here! If you have not seen: I beg you to check these episodes, and you'll see exactly what I mean! LIVE THE NEW EXTERIOR LIMITS !!!!!!!!!!!!
