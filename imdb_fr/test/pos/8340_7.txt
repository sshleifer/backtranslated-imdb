It's one of those films that looks so "old-fashioned" that being part of the fun is so. You see and hear things you NEVER see or hear on the big screen today. Part of that is good; Some are too clear for words, others bad (depending on your views on some cultural issues.) <br /> <br /> For example, in this short film (68 minutes) from 1931, you have: < The grandfather of the family who is featured in this story extolling the value of patriotism and the reason why one must speak against criminals for the sake of the United States (image only in the movies). 'today!) <br /> <br /> A district attorney (Walter Huston) almost begging for the death penalty and the crowd who support him 100% (again, imagine that in modern movies .) <br /> <br /> On the way, you will have a shocking experience. the violence, for example a young boy who was taken several times and literally threw his head first in a closet, while his father was caught and swung repeatedly head first in a wall. It's a difficult thing, to say the least. <br /> <br /> Yet the film is sprinkled with comedy, mostly from the patriotic grandfather, played in memorable fashion by Charles "Chic" Sales. There is a lot of laughter for everyone watching this unique crime movie. And, to make it soft, there are the two young boys, one of whom - Dickie Moore - became a fairly famous child actor in his day. Here, he is only a little tyke of about 5 years old who, of course, is far from being a refined actor, but you can see him becoming a celebrity on the horizon. In fact, that's what he did the following year with a strong performance in "Blonde Venus", with Marlene Dietrich. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this film is entertaining because of an effective mix of violence, comedy and sentimentality. .... and his end is nice and his message stimulating. It also required an Academy Award for "Best Writing, Original Story". I'm sorry to say that this program is only available for cable TV because it has never been broadcast on VHS or DVD ..... and it's a shame.
