I read it on Turner Classic just because it was pre-coded and it looked interesting. When I started to look, I noticed that the "criticism" gave it a star and a half on a four-star scale. I started to watch with concern - even old movies can be bad movies - but I quickly got into the story and performance of Mary Astor as the brain business behind the success of a simple salesman. Not really a good movie - too predictable - but certainly better than the one advertised. And I would have liked to see more of Ricardo Cortez as a man who appreciates Mary but does not abandon her rich wife. I would recommend taking a look to appreciate Astor and how far we have come, baby.
