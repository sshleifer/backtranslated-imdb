It's an intelligent and entertaining movie about the fight behind the scenes that then chose Johnny Carson's successor at the Tonight Show. However, the film's ultimate thesis that David Letterman's top comedy talents have been overlooked because of his controversial nature, Leno and Letterman perform can see for themselves. The truth is simple and accurate, as stated by a NBC member in the movie "Jay Leno is the funniest man in the United States". And David Letterman is not. Once you realize it, a lot of the machinations in the movie become useless. In the end, the whole movie is little more than just tart grapes by Letterman fans, who simply can not accept that the best comic has been chosen by people who know that stuff. The latest evidence is that despite Letterman's debut, perhaps because of the hype that emerged from the battle for the Tonight Show's succession, Leno's show has always proved to be the most popular. stolen from his legacy.
