Personally, I do not like a lot of black and white movies, but this film has something magical about it. <br /> <br /> The film begins with Elizabeth Lane (Barbara Stanwyck). "Liz" writes in a magazine column how she is the "Martha Stewart" of Connecticut. Of course, she's lying. This becomes a problem when his publisher, Mr. Yardley, asks him to host a Navy sailor for Christmas. In addition, Mr. Yardley, who will be alone for Christmas, invites himself to the farm for Christmas. From there, things go crazy. <br /> <br /> Since the movie takes place on a New England farm, the film has a warm holiday feeling. Plus, the characters are hilarious. Mr. Yardley is still shouting orders and Liz's friend, Felix, is still screaming, "Catastroph!" When things go wrong Finally, the film ends like a Christmas movie. a fat fat man laughs and shouts "What a Christmas!" <br /> <br /> In short, whatever your age, you will love this movie.
