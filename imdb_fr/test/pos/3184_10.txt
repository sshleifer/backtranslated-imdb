I can only take a lot of Filipino films, especially nowadays where the trend is to sex, action and black comedy (which I hate). the fact that Nasaan Ka Man makes me think and make me speechless during the movie is a big plus. There are good cinematic scenes and editing was excellent, especially cinematography. I think Claudine deserves the best actress here rather than getting one in the movie Milan. the fact that there are very few Filipino films that I really like. I think Cholo Laurel did such a good job in this movie. I really loved this movie, both technically and character development. the plot was complex and that was what made it great.
