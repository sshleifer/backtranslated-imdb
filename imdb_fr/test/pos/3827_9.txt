For starters, this is my favorite among ST operating systems. <br /> <br /> In addition to the critical comments of StuOz, I will add some of them: techniques, when the Enterprise triggers a target photon torch, they should be powerful near direct fire (I think) so to cause less damage to the Romulan vessel with the emptiness of space to cope. <br /> <br /> I had a problem with the Romulan commander who is questioning his faith in the Romulan "protocol" or his leaders, unless he is attacking vulnerable targets (before neutral zone posts) that are not at war. In addition, I do not think the commander would crack for the basic or simple tactics Kirk used, such as "play to death" or as the stratagem that the subordinate forces him to attack whether or not the Enterprise play to death. <br /> <br /> About the Enterprise: I'm surprised that after seeing the Romulan ship's attack method earlier, Sulu says, "Are they surrendering?" when he attacks the company for the first time. <br /> <br /> It's funny how Spock can only fix weapons control when the emergency is over. <br /> <br /> Also in the final attack, I thought that the Romulan ship had been defatted too long (so long as Spock could walk two aisles and return to the gun room to activate and fire the photon torpedoes I would have already used phasors, but I'm sure technicians and budget). <br /> <br /> On the positive side: it's a good drama played on the Romulan ship to introduce us to the Romulans. Stunning scenes with Stiles telling a good deal of human knowledge of the Romulans. So his conflict with Spock is right up there. I wish the Stiles character stayed in the show for a while, if only for the extra energy he added. <br /> <br /> It's only with fun that I post the negatives and blunders (of course there is more). But for me it's as good as that !! "Balance of Terror" is always the one I place at the top of my ST rankings.
