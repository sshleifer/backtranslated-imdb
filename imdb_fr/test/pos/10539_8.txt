What do people expect horror movies these days? Do is MUST be something macabre like 'SAW' or it's just shit ... ??? I do not pretend to be a knowledge expert, but I am about 47 years old. I have seen and owned thousands of films and I sincerely believe that this director has really made this film a sincere and sincere effort. Believe me, I was about to go back from the beginning of the dialogue, assuming it was going to be awful and I was pleasantly surprised. It's not a Mamet script, that's for sure; but come !!! With all the HORRIBLE garbage out there, especially in the horror, I thought it was much closer to the top of the pile than most others. <br /> <br /> The director used a lot of neat and clever shooting angles; the soundtrack was excellent and sullen, perfect for the atmosphere necessary for this kind of film. The editing and the timing were very good. And he did NOT use the tired and worn clich√© of the excessive violence "slasher"; for example ***** MINOR SPOILER ***** During a bare shower scene absolutely delicious and completely free (but tasty ... well, I say good taste), I really expect that it is cut and cut into cubes; but, AMAZINGLY, we just appreciate her heavenly beauty and that's it. what. ***** SPOILER ***** Especially where the psychiatrist leaves the girl and Pinnochio alone in the office; We see the doll talking to him, but not in the video recording. In addition, the mother sees Pinnochio move and be mean enough; so, is the mother AND her daughter mentally ill ... ??? There is also the original "killer" and what the mother had supposed about a possible influence of Evil. But even with all this, we are STILL not quite sure that the WHO kills the murder. ***** FIN SPOILER **** good old type Full Full type Full Full Full Moon and with a lot of restraint on violence. And without typical SLEAZE thrown in for no reason (just the pretty, beautiful, innocent, beautiful shower scene, which I will remember at the end of my days ... :) Compared to the absolute training of MINDLESS, a DEFINITE, strong 8 / ten !!!
