In a California detention camp in an indistinct future, an English film crew records the proceedings as young students and political dissidents are tried under a fictitious "Insurrectionary Act" that allows the US government to suspend civil liberties of its own emergency citizens without the right to bail or the need for evidence. In such cases, the Government is authorized to apprehend and detain anyone who, in its opinion, may engage in future sabotage activities. The judged group includes a feminist, a black panther and a folk singer. <br /> <br /> People convicted by a Conservative court have the choice between long-term imprisonment or three days in Punishment Park, where they can reach their freedom by reaching an American flag in the desert. They must do this without food or water. They must also be prosecuted by national guards and armed police forces who can send them back to the camp if they are captured to face the criminal penalty awarded to each convicted person. The reality is different. those who choose Punishment Park are hunted and killed or brutalized with no hope of winning their freedom after the discovery of a dead policeman in the park. The park appears to be a training ground for police and guards who must master these acts of repression in order to be able to use them in open American society. <br /> <br /> Shot in 16mm and developed in a documentary style by Watkins, in his famous Culloden and the controversial The War Game for the BBC; he interacts with the prisoners and the guards and observes the unconstitutional process, cutting himself between them to create a totally convincing political film that remains vital and relevant. Using his knowledge of the medium, Watkins produced an exciting, relentless and ultimately frightening cinematographic performance of a fictitious American political detention camp that would not have been convincing without its flawless construction. Most actors are improvisers with large characters. Sparks spurt out in the trial scenes where every case is heard, in part because Watkins has prevented those judged from appearing before the jury until these scenes are shot. Watkins also claims that actors often express their own opinions, which certainly explains the ferocity and credibility of their performances. <br /> <br /> The film was strongly criticized for having polarized the opinions of those who see it. It has been claimed that the film is reactionary and unequivocally represents that conservatism and war are the root of the social problems of the United States. Although these criticisms may be valid, it is important to consider that the film operates on a fictional, metaphorical level and that the realism that the film constructs so intelligently is perhaps what encourages such a sharp opinion on its content. In fact, the most important theme of the films is the problem of polarization itself. The "conservative" judges and the brutal law officers are on the one hand and the "liberal" convicts are clearly on the other, without concessions made on both sides. This seems to be what the movie is really about. The new law and the park itself result from a situation where the mediation between the two political positions has been lost. <br /> <br /> During and in protest against the Vietnam War and the treatment of those who opposed it In America, the main themes of the government persecution of its own citizens and conservatism that encroach on civil liberties always resonate in the same way in the Patriot Act era and the identity card. The news sequence of Guantanamo Bay and the treatment of Iraqi prisoners by Allied forces are also troubled. <br /> <br /> The threat of internal "terrorism" is so volatile that the film can not fail. connect with current attitudes towards the subject. Unsurprisingly, the film has had a turbulent history of distribution, being marginalized to the extreme because of its content, but the disturbing fact that this film may remain relevant today suggests that the wait has not been vain. Punishment Park is a film that had to struggle to be seen anywhere and that demands your attention.
