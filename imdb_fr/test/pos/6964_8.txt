Ok, so Ghoulies 4 is a little bad. And there are not even really ghosts. And the acting is bad. The scenario is stupid. But I forget to say how funny this movie is. It's so campy and so ridiculous that it's too much fun not to enjoy it. There are only 2 ghouls in the movie, and they do not really seem to be related to the ghouls in the other movie. But they are pretty funny. And funny thing, that Jonathon Graves come back for this one. If you saw first, he was a character in that. In my opinion, it's better than the first. There are classic scenes and classic lines, one of which is in a grocery store. "Attention, buyers of K-Mart!" Look at this if you like bad movies. It's so bad it's good. And did I mention Barbara Alyn Woods is hot?
