I think that together, all the critics have captured this film very well. I have seen it many times, but I still feel a sense of joy and warmth just like I did the first time. My emotional response to this movie never seems to go away. The final scene certainly makes me cry, but it's the same between Perks and The Children on his birthday. And as for the nice gentleman. Something else is going on with this character. The generous supplier and problem solver. He knows everything and has links everywhere. A perfect father to run and make us feel safe. I do not know how the film does it, but it touches something very English deep within us, which has disappeared from our daily experience, but we all instantly recognize and aspire again.
