"Fame" is a very successful portrait of the students who live in the High School of the Arts in New York. The film focuses on a group of students who dream of doing things big while perfecting their art at the now famous school. Director Alan Parker allows each of the highlighted students to mature on the screen, allowing you to feel connected to each of them. The music is contagious and fun. The dance is exciting and fresh. The film eventually became the basis for an Emmy-award winning television series starring Debbie Allen and some of the other actors in the film. One of the most enjoyable "dance" movies of the 1980s. Oscars received for music. 8/10
