I do not understand why everyone hates Barney. If you hate the show so much, then do not look at it! It's stupid how everyone changes the son "I love you" to "I hate you". If you do not like it, all right. It does not matter, it's your opinion. But it is useless to degrade the series, while it is not so serious. OK, so it's corny, and yes, it has its flaws, but it's a children's show. Children do not want to be sad and miserable, they want to be happy. And Barney helps that. And even in the show, there are moments of sadness and anger, etc. And yes, Barney uses magic. But children see Barney as a product of imagination. Children need a place to escape to express themselves. The world is a miserable and difficult place. We all need a place to express ourselves and be happier. Barney does this to us. This show is great. I watched Barney when I was younger. Yes, some people find that stupid. But I looked at it and I'm at the top of my class. It will not necessarily make you smarter, but it is not the goal. I think Barney's goal is to provide a place where children can be children and where the spirit of childhood can be expressed. Where the imagination lives. So many teenagers are now unimaginative and afraid to express themselves. Barney helps encourage that. Barney helped me not to be scared and to show me who I am. I am a sophomore in high school, an AP student with a 4.0, a drama student with a love of theater and art and a new baby cousin who loves Barney. I look at him with him, I appreciate him and I sing with him. Yes, it's silly and silly, and whatever, but it's great for kids. Who wants to be an adult who does not have time to have fun? I'm a child at heart and I love Barney. It's great for kids and those who have a heart to heart. <br /> <br /> This is a great show for babies and toddlers. So stop hating. Say you do not like it, but stop with the "stupidest show of all time" or "Barneys a bunch of bulls" or something else. Keep it to yourself. Take a cold tablet or something. Here's something: I never liked Sesame Street. But you do not see me leave: "Grover is a bull charge" or "Cookie Monster should die" or something else. I hate all the BULLSS ** T that people say about books or movies, like Barney or Twilight. If you hate it, all right. Nobody cares. Do not say hate, you might be offending someone.
