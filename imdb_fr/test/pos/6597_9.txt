This movie was great. It's a documentary about the influence of surfing on skateboarding in the early days. He has interviews with skaters such as Tony Hawk (my idol) =) and Stacy Peralta to name a couple. Dogtown is a part of California called "ghetto", where there was an amusement park that was demolished. People began to roll next to the dangerous ruins of the park. Soon, Zepher's surf team was formed. This led to the first real start of skateboarding at Dogtown. The Z Boys were a team of ragtag teenagers who loved skateboarding and started the phenomenon called green skating. They started skating in dry pools. It's just part of the story behind that. It even contains rare footage of Charlie's Angels of Stacy Peralta making a cameo. I think you should buy this movie if you are a skater. This will teach you that skateboarding has not always been popular. Even if you are not, buy!
