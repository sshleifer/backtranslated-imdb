Classic, well done and well made version of how a great international thriller should be realized. Determined to fight a dreaded global terrorist known as "Carlos the Jackal", Jack Shaw (Donald Sutherland, "Without Limits", "Space Cowboys"), a CIA agent and his Israeli counterpart, Amos (Ben Kingsley, "Gandhi"), "Sexy Beast") asks a noble naval officer, Annibal Ramirez (Aidan Quinn, "Music of the heart"), to become Carlos and use it in a bold plot for the KGB to kill the real Carlos, offers the CIA. Sutherland and Kingsley are fine here, but the film really belongs to Quinn here, who is incarnated here (in a dual role). Director Christian Duguay and director of photography David Franco bring another major asset to the film, with a suspense to the Hitchcock and a breathtaking view of the world.
