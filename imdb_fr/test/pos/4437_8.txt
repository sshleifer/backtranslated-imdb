Nominated for Best Feature Documentary at the 2004 Oscars, My Architect follows filmmaker Nathaniel Kahn on his quest to discover his father, the legendary architect Louis I Kahn. Lou Kahn died in 1974 when Nate was 11 years old, leaving behind an incredible but limited workload, unpaid debts and three separate families all living just a few kilometers away. <br /> <br /> My architect follows Kahn's life by chronologically examining his buildings and blending their beauty with the story of a charismatic but selfish and emotionally immature genius. As a son Lou never publicly acknowledged during his lifetime, Nate delicately placed himself in the story without dominating the main goal. <br /> <br /> When he examines the magnificent Salk Institute in California, Nate talks about his father's mythical use of space and light in his buildings, making it a peaceful and fascinating experience for the audience. . Nate's photo inline skating in Salk's white and smoky central meeting place underscores the building's harmony with nature. It's breathtaking. My architect also covers the difficulty that Louis Kahn had to make accept his conceptions. Many fantastic buildings exist only on paper, rejected by architects and real estate developers more practical. It was only when Louis Kahn went east that his visions were embraced with enthusiasm. In India, where he built <br /> <br /> Institute of Management, a former colleague describes him as a guru. In Bhangladesh, where he built the magnificent building of the National Assembly, citizens consider him a father of democracy. <br /> <br /> Watching my architect is a great way to start or continue learning architecture and the importance of space. But it is the irony of Lou Kahn's egotism, combined with the transcendence of his work, that will inspire you. 4 stars.
