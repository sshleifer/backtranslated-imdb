I absolutely love this movie. It's not very fun, but it's a feast of strange and amazing images! There is no dialogue, only some background sounds and sounds. If you like something completely different and original and you like darkness and the strange ... then you may like this piece of art. Ik looks like a movie made with the very first camera ever created, at a time when strange beings look like human beings live and interpret their strange habits. God killed himself with a razor and gave birth to Mother Earth. Mother Earth has been impregnated with the sperm of God after an act of fellatio and gave birth to a son "Flesh on Bone". The following are inhumane acts of ritual torture, rape and murder for purposes we do not know ... or do we do it?
