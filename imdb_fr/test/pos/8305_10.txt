My father took me to see this film when it was released in 1976. I was just a kid and it scared me. So much so that I had to leave the theater during a particularly claustrophobic tunnel scene because it was too intense for me !!! I went home for the safety of my family. I grew up and I really enjoyed the movie. Too bad for men in monster suits, though. If you forget the low prices of the production and you deepen, you will discover an excellent performance of Cushing, a score of breathtaking opening, beautiful photographs and the very reliable Mr.Douglas McClure, my childhood hero! the end! Titty Bang Bang Bang wife of the cave! Billed monsters! Actors in monster costume slip on threads! That has everything! Superb.
