I have seen this movie so many times, it's so good. Perhaps because I can understand the lifestyle of Tittas is the reason. Not everyone would find it to their liking. In addition, my Italian improves after each viewing. Am I a sad case? Thank you Mr. Sorrentino. I am looking forward to your next film. Although I have not seen the movie at the cinema, I have the DVD and I encourage everyone to buy it. Special extras are only worth the price. The time that a director devotes to the making of a film is very rarely appreciated, the extras of the DVD give an excellent overview of the realization of a film. As for the story of the film, I am biased. I love all my friends, but as I said before, I am very attached to the main character who is a loner in a situation he did not choose. . The Mafia in Sicily uses Titta to launder money in a Swiss bank. It owes them costs that cost them millions of dollars several years ago. The transaction went wrong. Love Kills.
