For those of you who are not familiar with Alisdair Sims, it is of course the ultimate Scrooge of all their Christmas Carol movies. (I guess I'm REALLY naughty, I did not really see the damn thing) I suppose that those who saw Christmas Carol and who are so used to his character could find the Bells of Saint-Triniens rather surprising. You see, in this film, the Sims have two roles. One, he plays better, and in the other, he is a trainer in a private school! So once you get that through your thick skull, this movie offers a lot of delights. The plot is about how the school is trying to make money that it desperately needs through a horse race. It's actually a little more complicated to manage for little kids, but I think they'd be concerned about their antics and the horses to notice. Adults too could be confused by all the thick accents that are thrown. But again, the story is reasonably light, the crazy and frenetic action, that we really notice. PS, the children all seem to come from the school of kindness Eloise.
