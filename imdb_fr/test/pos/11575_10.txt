"I have fought against death, it is the most innocuous contest you can imagine.It takes place in an impalpable greyness, with nothing underfoot, nothing around, without spectators, without clamor, without glory, without the great desire for victory, without the great fear of defeat, in an unhealthy atmosphere of lukewarm skepticism, without trusting you much, let alone in that of your adversary.If this is the form of ultimate wisdom, life is a bigger puzzle than some of us think it is. "Marlow in Joseph Conrad's" Heart of Darkness "<br /> <br /> It's hard to make lyrics the subject of death in a work art. Yet, films have recently boldly attempted to humanize it to the extent that it is part of the cycle of all living things and can be chosen rather than legislated. "Chosen" is the key word for Sea Inside by Alejandro Amenabar, based vaguely on the true story of Galician sailor Ramon Sampedro. It is a drama about euthanasia without prejudices dressed in love, poetry and friendship. If this sounds like Barbarian Invasions (2003), in which a cancerous professor bids farewell to long-time friends and likes before committing suicide, then you're right. In fact, Sea is better because he spends more time with the protagonist before his departure, a remarkable feat that does not involve any of these insignificant or uninteresting moments. <br /> <br /> Javier Bardem as Ramon has expressive eyes and dominant voice for the romantic tetraplegic, a combination of realist realistic and poetic victim. Belen Rueda plays Julia, the disabled lawyer, who becomes an imaginary lover of Ramon. His radiation increases as his life degenerates with the disease. At Lola Duenas, Rosa, a blue-collar visitor who initially tries to dissuade Ramon from looking for death but soon falls in love with him, is added to the opera already featured in a television series. Are you talking about his romantic handicap ?? This guy has an amazing chance of attracting important women and he can not move a finger. But he can do it, proving that this is the ultimate argument of what women want: a love that speaks, not just a product. <br /> <br /> I will refrain from mentioning the big film that we are now preparing for an Oscar and which is about euthanasia. so as not to spoil the experience for beginners. Sufficient, suffice it to say that both films manage to open both sides of a contentious subject without forcing a specific point of view. The religious right has the right to complain that the old film and Barbarian Invasions celebrate suicide; he has no right to accuse the perfectly balanced interior of the sea in the same way. <br /> <br /> "A life in this situation has no dignity," said Ramon. The irony is that he is behaving with a supreme dignity that makes one doubt his determination to end his life. "The Sea Inside" is a great entry into the 2004 Oscar nominations for Best Foreign Language Film.
