The best thing of the American pie "bakery". I found the humor and intrigue much more captivating than any American Pie movie to date. Regarding also the relevance of the content, I found that it was acceptable to a much wider audience than any of the previous American Pie movies. I really enjoyed this movie experience. When the film was released for the first time, I read a number of negative reviews and ended up not seeing it while it was still in the theater ... I now regret this decision. The film has far exceeded my expectations in terms of plot, dialogue / script and overall quality. I give him two inches!
