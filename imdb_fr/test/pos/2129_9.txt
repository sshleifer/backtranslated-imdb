It's a well-made story with pretty music, lots of dancing, lots of big sister / little sister interactions (almost all positive) and a lot of wishes fulfilled. There are fun times for older kids and adults, like when King Randolph exclaims, "These are just SHOES, is not it?" And tender moments as when Princess Genevieve comforts her youngest sister, Lacey, after a blunder. <br /> <br /> The animation may not be as good as Disney's, but it's still very good. The facial expressions are nuanced, especially for Genevieve, King Randolph, Duchess Rowena and her servant, Derek the shoemaker and Little Princess Lacey. My only small criticism about the animation is about the dance sequences where the dancing princesses become absolute copies of each other without the slightest deviation - even the three youngest ones copy perfectly the steps of the dance. I would have liked to see a little more individualism in the dance, considering that these girls are neither professional ballerinas nor choir dancers. <br /> <br /> The resolution of the story is cleverly managed to get rid of a wicked without actually hurt him. There has been violence among the guards in history, and the wicked monkey is mean to other animals in history. <br /> <br /> My 4 year old daughter loves this movie and has watched it many times. found that it was perfectly acceptable for her to watch.
