Sharpe's Honor, intended for the uninitiated, is the fifth entry in a series of telefilms on a rifleman of the British army during the Napoleonic wars and is inspired by the books of Bernard Cornwell (which I strongly recommend to read). However, if you start by looking at this one in particular, you would have the impression that Sharpe is not so much a soldier as the centrifugal force on which the rest of the army is turning. If that were the case, I'd recommend starting with previous chapters such as Sharpe's Eagle or Sharpe's Company, but it's a wise choice for a second visit. <br /> <br /> The story boils down to espionage this time. things. While the French army withdraws in disarray from Spain, Major Ducos, the sticky spy master, sees an opportunity to reverse the situation. By associating the assassination of a Spanish Marquis with Richard Sharpe, hero of the British army, the fragile Anglo-Spanish alliance will begin to collapse and the situation will turn around. When the Spanish nobles come to Wellington to claim the blood of Sharpe, the English general refuses to suspend his best soldier. He simulates his death. He soon leaves for a secret mission behind the enemy lines to find out who is behind the plot. As surprising as it may sound for a Sharpe movie, there is a beautiful woman to save along the way. Imagine it. <br /> <br /> Of course, this results in a more adventurous approach. The focus is less on the workings of the English army, with Sharpe as figurehead, than on his escapades in the country, avoiding French patrols, knotting with the Spanish guerrillas and engaging in bold escapes from positions fortified soldiers. Sergeant Harper, his faithful right hand, naturally accompanies him, but the rest of the skirmishers remain in the camp without knowing that their leader is still alive. Curiously, they are actually getting more attention than usual as they find themselves in their own subplot involving the delivery of Harper's baby. <br /> <br /> This slightly different approach is an intriguing episode but is only a good thing to do. the long term. And if anyone worries that there will be no standard battle at the climax, because once again, the poor old French get a good kick. In addition, Ducos is a fantastic successor to Obadiah Hakeswill as a villain whom you love to hate. He is the duplicate son, wicked and absolutely devilish of a canine and strangely reminiscent of this black guy from Raiders of the Lost Ark. Elsewhere, Hagman stands out prominently when he's lucky enough to spend more time on screen and this seems to be the kind of man you'd like to give birth to, even if he looks like a member of Iron Maiden that was catapulted in time by accident. <br /> <br /> In short, another strong chapter of the Sharpe series. Sharpe remains as heroic as ever, but considerably bitter and edgy this time considering the events of the previous movie. This is not the best introduction if you have not seen any of the other chapters, but it shows Sharpe a facet of which we are not used to testifying: the hero of the action rather than the professional soldier. And if that is not enough for you to indulge, you must also look for the surrealistic show of an enraged Sean Bean swinging a live chicken against a group of nuns.
