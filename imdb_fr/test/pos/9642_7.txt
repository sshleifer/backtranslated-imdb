I recommend to the spectators, if in the New York area, to visit the Intrepid museum and to get an idea of ​​the life of the crew members of the submarines of the Second World War. It had to be even more for sailors during the First World War. It really had to be a hell from below. <br /> <br /> Walter Huston and Robert Montgomery at the helm of the Hell Below cast, Huston to captain and Montgomery as his number two freewheel. They are both quite credible as naval officers and the rest of the cast, such as Robert Young, Eugene Palette, Jimmy Durante, Madge Evans, Sterling Holloway, etc., perform their role very pleasantly. became more popular during World War II and after. It's incredible, but I could name a whole series of underwater images such as Torpedo Run, Operation Pacific, Navy Hellcats, Run Silent, Run Deep and many more. You will see all the same situations of conspiracy. I guess the situations are also limited. <br /> <br /> The performance of Jimmy Durante is interesting. He's quite funny and his stage with the boxing kangaroo leaving the shore is really very funny. But I must say that a character like him in these cramped quarters is probably very important for morale. If you do not have someone like that to break the tension on a submarine, you have to immediately transfer one to your ship. <br /> <br /> The highlight of my life, however, is the scene of Sterling Holloway's death. Very similar to Sean McClory in Island in the Sky. This will haunt you long after watching this movie.
