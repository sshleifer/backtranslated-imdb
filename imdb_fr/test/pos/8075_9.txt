THE ANTENNA (Esteban Sapir - Argentina 2005). <br /> <br /> The silent cinema in a very unique tone in this fairytale tale of Esteban Sapir, beautifully shot in black and white and virtually without dialogue "La Antena" is a feast for the eyes and a must for lovers of German expressionist cinema, whose essence is a nod to the works of Fritz Lang and Friedrich Murnau. <br /> "The city without voice", "La Ciudad sin Voz", is directed by Mr. TV. He took the voice of the locals and totally controls all the words and images, forcing everyone to eat his own TV brand. Mr. TV is not only a monopoly, he is the personification of evil and totalitarianism, even the swastika appears as a symbol several times. He secretly works on a hypnotizing device to control all the minds of citizens through his television shows. To this end, he removes the last representative of the singer, The Voice, but a TV repairer witnesses the kidnapping and fled to an old television antenna in the mountains to put an end to the evil plans of M TV. <br /> The design of the production is beautiful with beautiful scenery and images. Although mainly shot with the basic language of silent cinema, Esteban Sapir also adds a number of new techniques of his own, such as a combination of typography and animation techniques. Everyone is talking through text bubbles (usually floating near the mouth), louder is the talking noise, bigger are the characters. The texts themselves can be pushed back or crushed. In the opening sequence, we see a book called "The Antenna" that opens and a city of paper is born from the pages. There is virtually no reference to Argentina. It is constantly snowing, which gives the film a very little Argentinian feel, while the surrealist setting evokes any major city in the Northern Hemisphere, with only a few of the songs revealing the Argentinean background of the film. <br /> <br /> The pace is fast and so much is happening on the screen that it's hard to keep track of the film's surreal narrative. Not only are we breathtaking to watch, but we also receive some messages about media monopolies, corruption and totalitarianism, but they are packed with care. One of the most original films I've seen in years. A delight. <br /> <br /> The film was presented as an opening film at IFF Rotterdam 2007. <br /> <br /> Camera Obscura --- 9/10
