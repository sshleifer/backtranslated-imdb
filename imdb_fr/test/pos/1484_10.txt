This is one of my favorite RTV shows of all time, Rowan Atkinson is just a genius! And it's quite normal that I chose this choice for my 1000 reviews! I can not begin to tell you how much I love Mr. Bean, and what surprises me is how he manages to get out of these incredibly difficult situations. He is always so creative. Robyn Driscoll also deserves praise! he is also a genius! My favorite is the Amazing Adventures of Mr. Bean and, while all the others are extraordinary, this is my favorite, not to mention that I wish the show does not stop as fast! Every episode is brilliantly written and they have all been brilliantly directed. In addition, each episode is a classic in my eyes! This show is incredibly popular, and I can certainly understand why, because it's probably the funniest show of all time. The actors all played their roles very well, especially Robyn Driscoll and Matilda Ziegler (as Irma). This is one of my favorite TV shows of all time, Rowan Atkinso is simply a genius and an incredibly talented comedian (maybe the best!), And it's quite normal that I have chose this choice for my 1000 reviews if you have not seen it show, drop what you are doing now and go take a look, you will not regret it, believe me, this is one the best TV series of all time !, and I will continue watching the show again and again, I do not get tired! , Mr. Bean Rules! ***** out of 5
