We start all our exams with the following information. My wife and I have seen nearly 100 films a year over the past 15 years. Recently, we had the honor of receiving free lifetime movie passes for all movies, anytime! So, we can see what we want when we want it. The key point is that CRITICS counts for ZERO. Your local critics or national critics like Ebert are really no different from you or me. The only difference is that they write about the film and are forced to watch hundreds of movies, whether they like it or not. Therefore, we are convinced that if you remove it for two hours of entertainment, that's enough for us! We never listen to or read the reviews. We only care about our friends and those we know love the same things as us. Pretty good about it. <br /> <br /> When Meryl Streep, head of the CNS in the movie, says "The United States does not torture", this movie made people laugh. This is obviously a lie that the Bush administration has repeatedly denied. It's a very good movie and it's scary what they can do to us when we lose all our civil rights. They can just "catch" you anywhere and tell one of them that they did it. In this case, they take a man with a name similar to those who killed thousands of people on September 11th. Of course, he's like you or me. They take him to a secret place outside the United States to torture and wet him. <br /> <br /> Very scary. Well done by Jake and Reese and the whole cast.
