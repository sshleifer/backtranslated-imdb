This is an excellent film and I would recommend it to everyone. Mr. Drury's acting is excellent as always, and he mixes well with other actors in the film. I can not give the suspense or drama found in the movie. The hell to pay is a must see movie! The plot was very suspenseful. I would watch this movie again and again because it contains all the elements of a great Western movie. It was very authentic in the way they showed the components dealing with this film that includes guns, horses and clothes. The soundtrack is nice and adds flavor to the movie. James Drury has the right touch when he chooses a movie. This is another winner for the western genre. !!!!!
