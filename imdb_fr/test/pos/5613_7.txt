I really enjoyed this movie ... and I still watch it from time to time. I used it in my music classes at the school where I teach. The children seem to enjoy it, even if they wish it to be in color. <br /> <br /> The best thing about this movie is, for me, who grew up after the death of Heifetz, it's lucky master violinist is working his craft! I was surprised at how up-to-date the story is. Although references to "reform school" are outdated. A boy whose father died and who was raised by his mother and stepfather ... today, most of our children are brought up by in-laws, although the film suggests that most of them are cruel. I am VERY angry when his mother does not stand up and defend his actions against the father-in-law. <br /> <br /> In addition, musical selections are hard to believe. I find it incredible that a child who seems to be about 8 years old can play the "Minute Waltz" or that a 13-year-old girl can sing a Rigoletto tune. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, it's a really fun and enjoyable movie, and I really recommend it. I wish it will be released on DVD.
