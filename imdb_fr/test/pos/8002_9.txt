I really wanted to be able to give this movie a 10. I thought for a long time that it was my favorite among the four modern Batman movies in actual action to date (and maybe it will still be - I did not not yet seen Schumacher's films yet). I am also starting to wonder if I am unconsciously contrarian. You see, I always liked Schumacher movies. As far as I can remember, they were either 9's or 10's. But conventional wisdom is that Tim Burton's two films are much better. This year, I had serious problems with the first Burton Batman - I ended up giving him a 7 - and I apologize, but I could not help but think that Batman Returns had too many small Achievement, Scenario and Scenario Problems <br /> <br /> But Burton overcomes the problems of sheer force of style, and even though there are many small flaws, Batman Returns is still a great movie , especially if you 'As a fan of Burton, Batman Returns has as much in common with The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993) and Edward Scissorhands (1990) as with any other element of the Batman universe. <br /> <br /> The film begins strongly, with Cobblepots having a baby. We see their distress - people come out of the birth hall with horror, ready to throw up. Later, they have the baby in a small cage. Eventually, they take him for an evening walk and throw him into the Gotham City River. The baby eventually becomes Batman's villain, The Penguin (Danny DeVito). <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Max Shreck (Christopher Walken) is the "villainous villain" of the film, comparable to Grissom (Jack Palance) in Batman. He plans to fool Gotham City in different ways, and we see him emotionally abusing his secretary, the shy Selina Kyle (Michelle Pfeiffer). When Kyle discovers one of these infamous plots, Grissom tries to get rid of her, but she is saved by cats and becomes Catwoman. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, The Penguin, which has long been rumored to exist and is considered dangerous, a ploy must be presented to the public as a good man, although he has motives least, though ulterior motives. <br /> <br /> Before watching Burton's Batman films again this time, I do not remember how few Batman movies (Michael Keaton) are. It's almost as if Burton did not feel that the character was interesting enough to focus on. The focus here is much more on the bad guys, especially The Penguin. Batman does not appear very often, especially at the beginning of the film, and surprisingly often, we watch him watching The Penguin. <br /> <br /> Although some viewers necessarily view the above as a defect, I can not tell, even though I would like to know more about Batman and follow his story further. The stories of the villains are also interesting and, as a "story of origin" for two major villains of Batman, Batman Returns is already more than complex in terms of scenario. <br /> <br /> However, there are some problems I count as a defect. The Penguin has a group of circus artists in his position, but even though they are often on screen, we will never learn anything about them. Burton has a core of characters as intriguing as those of Tod Browning's Freaks (1932) available, with actors as interesting as Vincent Schiavelli, but he just does not have the space to use them. <br /> <br /> For that matter, he barely has space to explore Catwoman. The film plays as if Catwoman had been as well developed and presented in as many scenes as The Penguin, but this sequence would have lasted 4 hours. So, most of Catwoman's scenes had to be excised. Of course, all this leaves little room for Batman. Burton Batman is very dark in the eyes of the public in this film, and exceptionally, he never cares to solve this problem. As far as we know, in the end, the Gothams still think that Batman is a mad killer. This is an interesting development, but unfortunately it was abandoned between this movie and the next one. <br /> <br /> Regarding the scenario, however, there are minor issues, including non-sequential errors and bizarre decisions (in terms of logic). ) made by characters, it is clear that Burton and writers Sam Hamm and Daniel Waters are not exactly trying to tell a traditional story. Much of the dialogue is pessimistic, but often it is quite subtle and / or complex (of course, sometimes it is also very blatant or transparent). It is useful to consider Batman Returns as a more "poetic" film, as I thought. This also leads to more general decisions in the plot and direction: many actions of strange characters, including minor characters, are performed in the service of a mood or a general style, and this style works very well. <br /> <br /> "Dark" is the simplest way to summarize Batman Returns in one word. The choice between positive and negative depends on your disposition. Anyone who knows me knows that I like black. So for me, Burton's style largely transcends the flaws of the plot and the script. In many ways, Batman Returns is like an insane campanic horror movie, with a surprisingly strange production design. Like Batman, Burton still makes many references to other films, but instead of Vertigo (1958) and Star Wars (1977) (well, there is still a slight reference to Star Wars), he invokes films like Nosferatu ( 1922) (notably "Max Schreck" was the name of the actor who played Dracula), Motel Hell (1980), the previous Freaks, Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory (1971) (which has a surreal side and Dark) and Zombie Movies - made more explicit in the final scene of The Penguin. <br /> <br /> In terms of graphics and general atmosphere - and including the general "feel" of the story, characters, etc. - this could not be a stronger one.
