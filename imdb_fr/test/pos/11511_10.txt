First of all: if you like to watch movies, I recommend NOT to watch this one. Why? Then you will not enjoy another film so easily ... <br /> <br /> In fact, I do not want to create excessive expectations, but the fact that Einar's work is perfect, intense and gorgeous is almost scary. Gudmundsson is. When in most movies, there is at least one aspect that spoils the whole thing, like good actors but horrible dialogues or nice scenery but low-budget cinematography? in "Angels of the Universe", there is nothing of this ambivalence. Really everything is great, even (and not least) the soundtrack of the magnificent Sigur RÃ³s. <br /> <br /> In this story of Pall, a student who is schizophrenic after being dumped by his girlfriend, the dialogues (and the monologues) deserve some attention: with (and sometimes in striking contrast) the conspiracy, they go from depressing and fatalistic to the complete opposite of comic and totally absurd. What's more, they are often (with quotes from Hegel and Shakespeare) so poetically beautiful that the film is almost lost in a surrealistic sphere and is saved in the real world only by its incredibly authentic actors. <br /> <br /> One of the other comments already made reference to another point: this film is not a banal entertainment to relax at night. Despite several comic reliefs, it is largely disturbing, partly cynical and bitter, and especially sad. a modern poetry about a life of madness with all its emptiness, rage and loneliness. <br /> <br /> Finally: When did you see the movie? look again. It contains some great visual metaphors and allusions that you only realize when you look twice and associate them with the "moral of history". And of course: read the book, it contains a lot more little fun stories in you also allows you to understand a little better some things of the movie.
