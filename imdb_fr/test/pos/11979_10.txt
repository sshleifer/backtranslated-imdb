This film deserves the 10 that I give it. <br /> <br /> But this is not the 10 you would give to movies like "The Godfather", "Goodfellas" or "Psycho". This is the kind of 10 you give to a movie that makes you laugh again and again! It is the most horribly written and directed film, but it does not fail to entertain. It has the most amateurish effects, but you appreciate every moment! I saw this film today on television and I did not want to go away! Read the following dialogue to find out why! <br /> <br /> (The whole college is standing around Manisha, who has just been raped and the guys who tried the rape ask for forgiveness) <br /> <br /> Bad Guy 1: Please forgive us! <br /> <br /> Naughty 2: Yes, we will not do it anymore. <br /> <br /> (No answer from Manisha) <br /> <br /> Akshay: Come on, forgive them! <br /> <br /> Manisha: I do not know ... <br /> <br /> Akshay: You're a beautiful woman, and even dead men can be excited by you! And they are young men alive! Do not blame them! <br /> <br /> Pancholi: Yeah Manisha .. <br /> <br /> Manisha (to Suniel): What if they tried to rape your girlfriend ??? <br /> <br /> Suniel: I would break their hands, their legs and kill them. But finally, just forgive them. <br /> <br /> Akshay: Yeah, if you do not forgive them, then it will be as if you are too arrogant for your beauty! <br /> <br /> This is a true masterpiece of dialogue! This film never fails to entertain, mainly because there are so many gaffes and unrealistic situations! The villain (Munish) can do almost anything. He can pull a sandstorm out of his mouth or he can take a motorcycle from his back and make it disappear just as easily. <br /> <br /> Each actor speaks in turn. A line of Akshay, then of Suniel, then of Arshad, then of Aftab, then of Nigam. This is the main rule followed by the director, so that an equal screen time is given to each guy. And then, there is the all-powerful pendant, which can make sure that even a car that runs at full speed passes through you without hurting you! All of these things make it a nice movie, and I can watch it again and again. I think this film can enter the pantheon of comedy if there is one. <br /> <br /> The only problem is he was not trying to be funny.
