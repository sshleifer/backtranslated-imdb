I looked at the longer version and I could not leave the screen of the eyes. 219 minutes passed and yet it seemed only an hour had passed. the characters were very believable and funny, and the photography was excellent. the story attracted me and caught my attention. I will definitely watch this again and again. This true story tells the best of all ... not the usual cheap thrills of Hollywood or deep glitz. I saw a lot of critics about this movie. most seem to pan the film or congratulate it faintly. Basically, it's a good movie that has received unfairly harsh criticism. Look at it yourself with an open mind. if you like westerns, pieces of the historical period, even if, historically, you will appreciate the film. Superb !!! 10/10
