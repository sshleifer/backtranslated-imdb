I saw this caricature as a child, a father and now a grandfather. This is my favorite drawing. I like the characters, the little funky tunes and the really good drawings. I love the main song that appears throughout the cartoon. I think it's a nice little cartoon. Everyone I've shown it just loves it. It's a shame that it was opened by such a difficult day (bombing of Pearl Harbor). Without the wrong timing, it would have been a great success. I hope I can find a DVD because all VHS tapes do not do it justice. <br /> <br /> I think if someone shows it to his child, he will get the same result. They will love. <br /> <br />
