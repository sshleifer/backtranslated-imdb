It's one of the funniest movies ever made. And for those who do not understand, it's supposed to be funny. So often comedies try to be so intentionally funny that they miss, but here is finally a film that manages to be hilarious in the most subtle way. Even "periodons" lack the originality and natural feeling of this film. It's a classic comedy that will surely be appreciated at another time, when the studios organize this stuff regularly. Congratulations to the authors and a cast of hilarious and subtle actors, including Isaac Wade, whose performances are excellent. Really, a real star performance by a real underrated theater actor. It will be great to see this guy have his due.
