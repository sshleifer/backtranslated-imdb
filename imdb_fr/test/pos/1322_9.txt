Several views were necessary for me to fully appreciate this film. At first, I was struck by the stylized decorations, but I found the rest slow and boring. I thought such a great subject needed Ken Russell's treatment to win. I now find that the imposed constraint (imposed on the production by the widow of Mishima) is an asset. Some of the most sordid aspects of Mishima's life are reiterated and dramatized by the corresponding themes of his novels. I think it's useful to know the novels - that's what made the difference for me. You still think the movie might be a little tighter and warmer, but it is truly unique and deserves serious attention. I love the fact that Japanese characters speak Japanese - not English. Philip Glass's score is fascinating.
