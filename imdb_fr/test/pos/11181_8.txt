Unfortunately, I could not find them anywhere, so I could not try the other entries in the series, even though it would not bother me, and believe me, I looked around. For those who do not know it, this is a point-and-click adventure title. This means that the mouse is what you use to connect to everything you can do in this case, although there is a special case in which this is inaccurate. I will not spoil it here for those who have not tried it yet. Nevertheless, no matter your computer experience, you can sit down and try. There are not even many things like this where you have to be quick or have quick reflexes. Heck, you can adjust the speed of the text (if you have it with subtitles), and thus the conversation it contains, and it's not extremely annoying or forced when it's slow. It's easy to access your inventory, as well as combine or use items. By clicking and holding down the button, everything you can assign gives three options for use (whether a person, a specific part of the environment or an object): Main (push, pick up, open, etc.). ), the eyes (examine, look through, etc.) and the mouth (eat, converse, etc.). All this adds up to a welcoming and friendly environment, where you can tackle the huge enigmas (their number varies according to one of the two levels of difficulty you try) at your own pace, then explore and assimilate the Tens of characters and domains created creatively and individually in your heart. The length of this task will be determined by how much time you spend doing it (you will not hear any complaints from me, they are worth it), and your ability to find solutions. There are some points in this area where you decide if you want the hardest way to do it or not. Everyone can enjoy it. There is no material that is not acceptable to children. This is one of the products that help to prove that this very fact does not necessarily mean that it is intolerable for an older audience. Animation is a quality job, smooth, everything moves as it should, and honestly, the 3rd dimension is not what is sorely lacking when you try this. The story is well done and you never doubt what is happening. There are many well directed cinematics, kept in the same colorful 2D world and mostly bright as the rest, with well-made camera movements. "Cartoony" is an appropriate word to describe this, not just the visual style. This can be applied to all of this. The whole world of this world is very similar to ours, but not quite, with a mixture of past and present, inhabited by people and filled with things that we can somehow recognize or understand, at least in part, but absurdity makes them funny. This is one of the biggest strengths: it's hilarious. This comes largely from replicas (what is said and how), and those who like the British efforts by focusing verbally, like "Allo" Allo or the BlackAdder franchise will want to take a look at this sucker. . However, there are different types of jokes, including but not limited to: satire, intelligence, darkness, parody, irony, coarse comedy (that's not really my favorite aspect) and more. There is self-awareness, with the manager addressing you personally and explaining, for example, why he will not do what you just asked him to do. There are references to pop culture in the last twenty years. Almost everything works, practically no gags fall flat, and if you are not ransacked during this process, I guess the reason is that it just is not compatible with your sense of humor .. a situation that does not warrant judgment, and if one suspects that this might be the case, and would like to know, I suggest the demo version, where you, for free, can see if you care about the game mark and / or laughing. The plot is well written (almost everyone is really), develops nicely and keeps your interest. The sound is excellent, clean and well done. The sound effects are on site. The music is well composed without exception. The dubbing is flawless, with a celebrity or two. Armato is fantastic as Guybrush Threepwood (I must like that name), which you control. Boen is amazing like LeChuck, the nasty zombie dead (and still threatening). The drawings are extremely well done, very imaginative and all in shape. Despite the relatively limited disposition of our hero in piracy, you can engage in some of them. Direct a ship, board the other ship and combine the blades in a rather unique and wonderfully thoughtful way.
