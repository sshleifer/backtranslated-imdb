The duchess is a pretty white cat who lives with her three kittens in the house of her rich owner in Paris. When the bad butler learns that the rich old lady first gives cats what she wants, the butler gets angry because he wants to have everything first. Then he puts them to sleep and abandons them from the side of the road. When the cats wake up, they start a long journey home. Thomas O'Malley, a wise man from the street, joins them and offers to help them. When Edgar sees them coming home, he is furious and starts sending them to Timbucktu. But Thomas's friends arrive to help save the day. The rich lady decides to leave her house for all the cats of Paris corridor. <br /> <br /> It's a charming movie. The songs, including "Everyone wants to be a cat", are lively and optimistic. The voice is excellent, with Eva Gabor (who will later play Miss Bianca in THE RESCUERS Disney films) as Duchess, Phil Harris (Thomas in Baloo in THE JUNGLE BOOK, Little John in ROBIN HOOD), giving a interesting personality to their characters. Supposedly, Walt Disney, before his death in 1966, gave the green light to this film. Recommended for Disney fans or cat lovers from around the world! 10/10.
