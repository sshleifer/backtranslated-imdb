Kevin Spacey, always charming, encourages us to question some truths of our lives. After leading us to believe that he is a little crook mumbling (only to expose the true power of cinematic deception) in the classic movie The Suspect Suspect; this time, he makes us believe that he is Prot, a friendly extraterrestrial who takes a human form while strolling around the Earth. <br /> <br /> Prot is a strange stranger who seems to be out of nowhere, only hospitalized at Manhattan's psychiatric facility. Dr. Mark Powell (Jeff Bridges) is very interested in him and even wonders if Prot is a supreme being on the planet K-PAX, or maybe he's just a forgotten human being with serious psychiatric problems. Although the end can be seen and discussed in many ways, it remains a complex and informative journey that leaves behind many intriguing / philosophical questions.
