Burt Reynolds plays an undercover cop in search of a criminal police chief. Rachel Ward is an exaggerated price caller who is close to her heart..Burt plays well in this role and I think he would have played well in other roles like this .. <br /> <br /> Rachel Ward is beautiful and sexy on his side ... good stimulation and story, but something is missing in the equation ... on a scale of one to ten.7
