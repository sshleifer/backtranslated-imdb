Much has been said about this film and its vital importance in the formation of the language of the film. If you are interested in the film's history, to fully understand the innovations brought by Eisenstein, try to display Potemkin alongside most of the previous films (those of D.W. Griffith offer a good contrast). It must be admitted that Eisenstein was not the only theoretician of editing, and that editing principles were probably discovered in another era. However, even today, few filmmakers have addressed the technique with which Eisenstein created meaning by combining images at such an early stage of media evolution. <br /> <br /> Potemkin is still one of the most beautiful and moving films ever made. You should see it, buy it and tattoo it on your chest.
