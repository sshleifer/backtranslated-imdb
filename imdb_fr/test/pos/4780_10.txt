It was the first published Mickey Mouse cartoon and the first cartoon with sound. In the cartoon, Mickey is not wearing gloves yet. He does not speak again either. He just whistles and plays music. The song he plays is "Turkey in the straw", using several farm animals as musical instruments. For example, he plays the teeth of a cow like a xylophone and pulls suckling piglets like an accordion keyboard. I recorded this Disney Channel drawing and I think it's wonderful. It was based on a silent film starring Buster Keaton titled "Steamboat Bill, Jr."
