"Subconscious Cruelty" must be one of the most beautiful films I have ever seen. However, it is extremely dark and gory at times, so politically correct mainstream horror movie fans should not bother. The film mixes many beautiful visuals with a lot of And it is extremely strange, vicious and disturbing, so weird movie fans will not be disappointed. My favorite segment of "Subconscious Cruelty" is "Human Larva", which shows us a twisted relationship between a young man and his pregnant sister. The delivery scene is particularly unpleasant and hard to forget. The last segment "Right brain / Martyrdom" must It is incredibly hard and blasphemous with scenes of genital mutilations and macabre tortures.We see Jesus Christ captured by three naked women who mutilate him, tearing him the flesh of the torso, him licking a knee injury and pissing it. There is also a statue of Jesus on which is projected a swastika. "Subconscious Cruelty" is a truly memorable movie that should be seen by extreme movie fans.
