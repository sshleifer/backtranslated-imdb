I just had the opportunity to see 'Nuovomondo' (previously known in the US as 'The Golden Door') and I was very impressed by the dreamy and sometimes surreal story from a family that immigrated from Sicially to the United States in the early days of the 20th century. It also worked as a major (proverbial) stuck in the eye of Homeland Security (preferably until the 3rd punch), in its description of the mistreatment inflicted on foreigners who just want a better life than they received from their mother land of origin. The (mostly) Italian distribution, with a few exceptions, works well. It is a discreet and discreet film that is pleasant to watch (the occasional but tasteful use of surrealism is always a pleasure), while the scenario is well written. It's a movie for those who are tired of escaping Hollywood and foolish who only serves to sell popcorn (although I have problems with hot popcorn, notice it: I love this kind of things). You would do well to look for Nuovomondo / The Golden Door (or what is titled in your area).
