Their flashbacks are like children's nightmares. The resurrected students are troubled by the memory of the acts of regret they have committed or committed against them. By experiencing life after death, they bring back real experiences into the present. As they continue to experiment, their memories intensify considerably; so much, some are physically defeated. Thus, they explore and transcend deeper the experiences of death after death trying to find a cure. <br /> <br /> Although the DVD was released in 2007, this film was released in 1990. As a result, Kevin Bacon, William Baldwin, Julia Roberts, and Kiefer Sutherland were early in their acting career . In addition to the extremely intriguing intrigue, the drama-like suspense and the tight and compelling storyline, all the young actors make "Flatliners", which is now a cult semi-science-fiction thriller. Who knew 17 years ago that the film career of this young group of actors would skyrocket? I suspect that director Joel Schumacher did it.
