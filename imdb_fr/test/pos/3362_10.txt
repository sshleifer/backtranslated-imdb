In my opinion, the Father's Army is the best British sitcom of all time. I believe that if you only watch one episode of the series, you can not fully judge this episode (including the movie). the situations in which they find themselves. When you become familiar with the show, it will start to seduce you. Now, the film has some modifications to the series which is slightly disappointing, but it still works. Watch a series or two of the show before watching this. You will not be disappointed. The good episode to watch is "No Spring for Frazer"
