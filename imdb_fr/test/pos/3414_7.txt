A very sentimental story by the author of The Waltons. If someone put the material on me, I would probably reject it as too damn. But dramatization here manages a tear without the expected discomfort. In the 1950s, Arthur Hunnicutt was not as good at the pretty hay beans. His call here is put to use to be used as a mountaineer faithful to a faithful hunting dog. Their destiny is indissociable in the same way as any human link. Well. I see a subtle environmental message here. All creatures go to heaven, because how to condemn a poor devil who only follows his instinct to stay alive. There is no deception in the animal kingdom, and yet with what cruelty we often treat them. A curiously satisfying episode that confirms this important message.
