I saw this film at the 3rd Adelaide International Film Festival, in the Palace cinemas, and I totally listened to it in the first five minutes. Thank God for a movie that ignores all the garbage we see often in Australian films and that seem to revolve around a) race b) gender and c) class, in favor of uh ... dare I to say ... good cinema. The producer, Alex Frayne, a shy, somewhat eccentric guy, presented his film, directed with a group of his pals near the city where he spent much of his childhood. Apparently, he spent most of last year traveling with the film, mostly in Europe. The world the film creates is both brilliant and artistic, especially because of the strange and disconcerting editing style, Gothic characters and the surreal sense of time and place that draws the viewer into his nightmarish realm. <br /> <br /> producer came back for the Q + A afterwards. Someone asked him what his inspiration was - he replied "South Australia". Hear hear! Another asked him what a "day in Alex's life" meant. He replied that he was driving an old Ute, that he was having lunch at the same table as the same restaurant where he has been eating for eight years! and that he plays the piano, which helps him to think. He does not drink alcohol and plays cricket once a week. Then the question and answer session ended abruptly because of the next film screening. So I think that for the next festival, they must extend the sessions after film.
