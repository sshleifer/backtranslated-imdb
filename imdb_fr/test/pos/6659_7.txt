This film worked for me because I see this film as exactly the opposite of "Gone With The Wind". Farm owners instead of plantation owners. Scarlett fights and connives for what she wants; Ada is depressed and turns around until Ruby (Renee Zellweger) shows up to save the day. In a way, in a sense. Deserters instead of officers trying to find their families, the list goes on and on. Even the love story was opposite. If that's what the producer and the writers were trying to convey, it's been successful with me. <br /> <br /> There are only two things I did not like in the movie, the rest that I found well done and that I liked enough to recommend to friends. First, I did not see the attraction that existed between Inman (Jude Law) and Ada (Nicole Kidman) as strong enough that Inman desisted to join her. Inman said he only wrote to her a few times when Ada wrote to her almost constantly. Secondly, something or someone getting killed or dying in almost every scene was a little too much. I must say it was full of action because of that, but after the second scene, I knew something or someone was going to die in the next scene. I like to be surprised by the next scene, without knowing what will happen before. <br /> <br /> I thought all the acting was very well done, with Zellweger the best. She deserved the credit she had for that. I thought she played the role of hillbilly very well. She had to do her homework. Zellweger even said in the film that she was smarter than people thought. I think it was true. Law played well with everything he had to do to get back to Kidman. It must have been a much stronger love to go through all of this than I thought. Now, he showed a lot of emotion on his face during his tests. Kidman's share may have something to do with the fact that I chose his performance after the other two. Except when she was depressed, she did not show much emotion, I do not know if that's how the game was written or if that's how she perceived the game. She still did a good job, I just thought the other two were better. <br /> <br /> I loved the scene with Zellweger, Kidman and the rooster, although it was one of those scenes I mentioned above. I thought the "Home Guard" was exactly what it was probably back then. Although we did not hear much about them, they were part of that time. I thought the landscape was beautiful. The film had everything to be a good love story.
