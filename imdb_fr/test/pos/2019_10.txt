Well, let me say this: I have always been one of the "hardcore brothers"; I have always loved rock, and especially heavy metal! That's why this movie is like a gift from God! I think this movie is one of the best movies of all time (well, with the exception of Neverending Story and Star Wars, of course ...). It's great to hear all the classics, such as "Long live rock and roll" (DIO), "Stranglehold (Ted Nugent)", Jon Bon Jovie songs, Deep Purple, AC / DC, Zakk Wylde and many more legendary rock bands. Heavenly! Absolutely stunning! Wonderful !!! I hope they're going to make more movies like this (otherwise they're just crappy movies, like that "AC in da USA" or what they call, and "8 miles." Bulls *** !) Anyway, I highly recommend it! I miss only a few songs of Stratovarius! But apart from that, it's one of the best movies of all time! Ten out of ten!
