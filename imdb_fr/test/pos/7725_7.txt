It's a beautiful film with good performances by Paz Vega and Leonardo Sbaraglia. Of course, Vicente Aranda is a legendary Spanish filmmaker and one of the great directors of Spanish cinema, but I do not think it's one of his greatest films, even if everything is fine. The scenario plays with the introduction of Merime as a character, it's a nice touch but it's amazing. The music is composed by Jose Nieto, Spanish National Film Award. I mean, this movie is very good in all technical aspects. There are very good actors in supporting roles like Antonio Dechent, Maria Botto and others. I give it 7 out of 10 because I think it could be a better movie, but as it is, it is not boring at all.
