Hey look, you do not watch this movie to change your life! But if you're a woman and you've always had a thing for Richard Gere; this movie is right on your street. Diane Lane and Richard Gere have chemistry on the screen back. 'Nights in Rodanthe' is not an Oscar-winning film and it will probably be forgotten as soon as possible, but if you want a beautiful and successful love story, between beautiful middle age subjects (they do not turn your stomach and even when Gere is 'on top', he does not look too light) so this is the movie for you. I loved the theme of the story and it was very relevant in many ways. Of course, everything was presented in a superficial way, passed over in silence and not really treated ..... I mean, I would have liked to know more about the father / son relationship between Gere and James Franco, but the story was really about the idea that a great love can change you for the better; whether it's a lover, a child, a friend, etc. The film is about love and its mysterious ways. I was a little surprised that James Franco played such a small role in this movie, but he's still good, even for a few minutes on the screen. I really liked this movie because it was moving and kind.
