Do you like explosions? What about fighting? Well, this movie has both. You know the other thing without which you can not have a movie: a motorcycle that bounces on someone's head and knocks them out at the same time. You bet the stabilizer has one. There is even a classic cliff scene. <br /> <br /> In the end, I'm pretty proud to have even seen this movie ... and even more proud that my comment is the first ... YES!
