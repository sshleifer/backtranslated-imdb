I just watched this thriller again, which I once thought was one of Hitch's less important efforts. How wrong you can be! Maybe because I'm older, or maybe because the movie gets better every time, but now I think it's amazing. Every suspense is extracted from every detail, and the final scene of the carousel is breathtaking! Perfect in every way, highly recommended.
