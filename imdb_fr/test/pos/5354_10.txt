There are some aspects of Park's movies, and in particular Wallace & Gromit's, which I would say make them so great. The first is subtlety and observation, whose flagship product is the character of Gromit. He does not speak, he does not make noise, all he has are his eyes, his forehead and his body, and with these, he commands the film. Park manages to give us everything we need from this silent character through his expression. Comedy and emotion are conveyed by the most subtle movements and work perfectly. <br /> <br /> To watch the movie, you must be aware of the whole screen. Normally, you will be guided to the movies, the screen will not be too crowded, there will not be many things to take to look away from the index or the main action. Park seems to need to look away with his films. It throws extra content on its audience, there is action in the background, on the side of the screen, even off the screen, and there is almost always something in the foreground to get your attention. His films deal with multiple viewings and discoveries, they are superimposed with jokes and auxiliary actions. <br /> <br /> Throughout this film, there is a multitude of things on the screen, jokes in the foreground, maybe on a pot label and on a background of shadows that give the action. You can imagine that for Park, cinema has always been an event and the films he loves are movies he wants to see again and again. This is what emerges from his films and his most beloved characters. <br /> <br /> Then there are bizarre and wacky inventions that Wallace does, which is reflected in the story and intricacies of the plot, everything is weird and out of the wall, yet it seems so perfectly normal in this world. You can imagine that inside Park is Wallace's spirit. <br /> <br /> There is one more thing that makes these films so unique is modeling and precise manual animation. I must admit I was worried when I knew that Dreamworks was involved in making this film and I thought they would put their computer animation experience in the foreground. What scared me was that Wallace & Gromit became a CGI entity or, at a minimum, that CGI was used to clean up the impression that modeling brought to the film. <br /> <br /> This is not the case. You can still see thumbprints and tool markers on the characters, and far from distracting you from the movie, it just adds a really real feeling and a sense of physical depth to the characters and the scene at the same time. 'screen. <br /> <br /> And the film? Well, I must say that the turn of the plot was something that I had thought of well before the movie was in the cinema and it was not a surprise, but it did not affect my pleasure. In fact, watching the turn of events unfold and the comic timing of discovery and reactions was all, and it sucked me as much as if it were a thriller, yet I laughed all the time. <br /> <br /> the film was fascinating in different ways. To see the animation over, how fantastic the inventions are, how Wallace is going to get in trouble and Gromit to get him out, where all the cross references are in the movie and where all the jokes are! I must admit that after talking with my friends, I could not believe how much I had missed. <br /> <br /> There is something different in this film compared to others, there is a new level of adult humor, and I do not mean crude jokes (although there is such a British couple that you can not help laughing), I mean jokes that just fly over children's heads but slap adults. The kind you used to see coming out of somewhere like Pixar. This adds even more appeal to the movie. <br /> <br /> Okay, let me try to be a little negative here. I did not notice the voices in this movie, you know how you usually listen to actors and see if you can recognize them? Well, I was too caught up in the movie to care or to notice who they were ... Okay, it's not negative. Let me try again. The main plot was not as strong and captivating as I thought, and I found myself caught in the parallel stories and the characters themselves ... again ... it's not a bad thing, the movie was so rich entertainment. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I can not think of a bad thing to say about this movie. The worst thing I can say is that the sequence of titles at the end is pretty repetitive ... final title! Really, it's the worst I can say. <br /> <br /> The story is very funny, well organized, well written, well done. There are a lot of fantastic characters here, not just Wallace & Gromit. There are so many things on the screen, so many references and jokes (discover the dresses of Lady Tottingham), jokes about cheese everywhere, jokes for the whole family. The characters are superbly absorbent and you will find that you took them before you realize. There are so many things in this movie for everyone. <br /> <br /> There are so many things I could say and write about, but I know this will quickly turn into a frustrating exercise for Park and Aardman, but also in a series of "this piece was really funny "and" there's a little when ... ", and what I'd rather do is tell you it's a great movie, go see it and experience it for yourself. . I will say however that rabbits are excellent!
