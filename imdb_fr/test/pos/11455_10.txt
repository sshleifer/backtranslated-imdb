This film took me by surprise. The opening credits sequence includes a well done animation. After that, we are immersed in a semi-corny production, betraying its low budget. The characters, typically American, are introduced slowly, with more personal details than those that are usually found in movies like this one. At the moment the shlitz hits the fan, we know each of the characters and love them or hate them according to their distinct personalities. It's a slow climb, much like climbing up a slope of a big roller coaster. Fortunately, once the action begins, it's the old school breathtaking! The makeup effects of Steve Johnson are awesome. Quality equal to much bigger budgeted movies. And the frights are bumpy. Kevin Tenney delivers his best film of all time, with breathtaking surprises and breathtaking installations. The ironic, sometimes cheesy humor characterizes this film as pure horror of the 80s, as opposed to the sullen tone of the older genre series such as "Night of the Living Dead" or "Hills Have Eyes". But for real horror fans, this one is worth the detour. Play it as the first entry on a double bill with the 1999 remake "House on the Haunted Hill". The structure and dynamics of the characters are so similar that you have to wonder what movie they were doing again.
