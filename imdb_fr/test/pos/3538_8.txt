I saw MESSIAH 2 a few months ago and I did not have the chance to see the original retransmission until a few days ago, which is far superior to the rest. Okay, it's not millions of miles away from the SEVEN plot but it's still convincing. Much of my praise relates to Ken Stott's performance as DCI Red Metcalfe, a police officer who seems to have led a very unlucky life and has a terrible secret. It would be easy for Stott to do more, but he plays the role in a rather subtle way. Similarly, the murders are very shocking but - unlike the sequel where the murders are done on the screen in a rather OTT manner - there is actually little violence shown. <br /> <br /> My only criticisms are that the red herring was too obviously a red herring which meant that I was not trapped in the shock (And you would probably see the shock happen then I'm not going to m 'bother with a spoiler alert) and that when the real murderer was revealed, he seemed both slightly further recovered and caused some plot holes to appear in the story. If I remember correctly, the sequel had similar problems once the murderer was revealed, so it might be a good idea not to do MESSIAH 3
