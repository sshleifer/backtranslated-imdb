This film, which was dubbed in Italian in a Roman cinema (not so bad as it may sound) after being presented at the Rome Film Festival, is quite an art film and a festival film, guaranteed to charm and delight this audience by its distinctive character. style, funny humor; ability to draw comedy from the suffering of others; an attractive and joyful music; on-site performance; Dominant gentleness and humanity - but doomed to failure and the absence of convincing narrative, let the average public wonder why he looks at it and why it is admired, how it was created. <br /> <Andersson gives us almost a series of dry sketches. Browse them are various themes. Money: a guy at the next table (Waldemar Nowak) hangs the wallet of a rich man talking on the phone of a cell phone in a restaurant over a glass of brandy, then ordering tailored suits; a ruthless son calls his famous father away from a complex gathering to beg him to give him a last loan. A psychiatrist fears for his exhausted investments while his wife sleeps him with a brilliant Viking helmet in bed. <br /> <br /> Depression: A primary school teacher (Jessica Nilsson) breaks down in class because her husband has called her "harpy;" the wife of the carpet seller (Pär Fredriksson) collapses in front of customers because he calls her that way. Many men have depressing dreams. But hey, it's Sweden. Is not everyone depressed? Problems of love: a big bohemian couple is separating; a feminine groupie has fantasies about a guitarist, Micke (Eric Bäckman). Women slam doors when their husbands start practicing their instruments. (Music, of course, is a unifying theme.) Besides the dashing guitarist, there is a tuba and a drummer who play in a Dixierland band and also perform in parades and funerals. of music, which quickly links one sequence to another.) A storm raging behind the window of many scenes, a violent rain, people inside, a thunder so loud that it looks like a battle raging at across the country. It also unifies the tone and gives the impression that different scenes are happening on the same day intimidating. <br /> <br /> Andersson is a master of visual composition and shooting in the static middle distance. The film has a foggy gray- The green look created by DP Gustav Danielsson is perfect because it evokes the sadness of a Swedish winter but also sparkles with the subtle colors of the director's mind, which ends each scene with a smile. We almost never knew that the greyness could be so beautiful. Alexcan Sokurov creates such effects sometimes in very different contexts. In the scenes and in the film as a whole, a kind of silence emerges from the visual style, the rhythm of the scenes and the humanism detached from the global perspectives. There is something in a completely controlled style that calms, reassures. <br /> <br /> Everything does not work as well. One can be impatient to see scenes that are barely connected, sometimes reading too much, like the work of a writer of Saturday Night Live needing Prozac. Since some scenes move or please you, it's obvious that others are falling flat. <br /> <br /> But some scenes are real zingers and one of the obvious highlights of pure magic is a dream - described and then figurative dreams formed another guiding thread) in which the female groupie imagines herself wearing a newly married wedding dress to her ideal guitarist fey, who plays a tricky series of riffs while many admirers gather in front of a large window. The point of view swings outward and the window slips slowly as if the building dreamed of by the dream bride and groom was a train leaving a train station to take them on their honeymoon. It is a fresh, subtle and rather sublime effect. <br /> <br /> Finally, we can feel that everything in you the living is a dream, including the recurring scene where the bartender always hits a bronze bell and announcing the time of the last order, after which all torpid customers get up from their table and go get one more drink. <br /> <br /> An Italian critic has called this film a "great little film", and that's it. It is limited in twelve ways, but it contains greatness. Roy Andersson is a small master (like some medieval miniaturists) of domestic comedies of Scandinavian sadness, and it is a film like no other. Presented this year in Cannes as a selection "Un Certain Regard", it is also the Swedish candidacy of the best foreign Oscar 2007. Hard to say what Bergman would think, but Andersson worked with him. is famous for its elaborate TV commercials, some of which can be viewed on YouTube. Bergman called them "the best commercials in the world". It will be interesting to see if this director, whose job is as subtle as his point of view, will start working in longer segments in a certain time. In the meantime, any good film buff should really have a look at that. <br /> <br /> "Schadenfreude" is not quite the word. It means reveling in the misery of others. Andersson teaches us to rejoice in our misery.
