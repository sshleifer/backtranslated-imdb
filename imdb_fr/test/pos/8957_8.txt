I bought this movie at the local blockbuster for 99p and it's been in my video library for at least a year now. Then tonight, I decided to see it, the movie was quite different from what I expected and I found no mood. All I saw was that it was a dark look at people who were dealing with relationships and sexual orientation. I do not really see the psycho-killing plot having a purpose except to add some tension to the end of the movie. I felt that the person who played the lesbian was doing a great job. I followed her emotions and what was going on around her. Some people would probably have seen some of the things she does in such a funny way, but I could really put myself in her place, love someone but not reject you every turn, no matter how hard you try. I thought it was a very moving film and that I treated all sexualities well. I was expecting something like Bound & Gagged: a love story, but it's a very different film. Not for bigots.
