This short film contains all the elements of a good movie. Whenever I show it to friends (on a digital video recorder), they like it too. The dialogue is so real. The acting is superb. Although the effects / accessories are not as convincing in themselves, taken with the rest of the plan, they are placed / used expertly. The music is so haunting, perfect for this kind of "momentary" film. People who value their beliefs and thoughts are deeply shaken by what they see in this movie. Most go "that's it?", But in the end, they blossom with a new understanding and leave the film with a word to describe it: <br /> <br /> "Beautiful". The beauty of the film is also profound. I like the fact that there are no conflicting opinions, that there are no other voices and that the voices you hear agree with each other. no conflict, but at the same time there is one. And the end made me love more! The harsh reality is sometimes more worthy of a movie than any device of intrigue or twist. <br /> <br /> (Was not Joshua Leonard the Blair Witch project guy?) :) Movie shot by an imaginary dead person ... awesome!
