A monk who visits a burglar sitting in his cell awaiting execution is invited to take note of his last words for posterity and to warn others of the horrible life he leads. At first reluctant, but the language released by alcohol, the young burglar soon tells his story that is full of dead, undead and things that go bump at night. <br /> <br /> The New York horror film (shot in part on Staten Island, which no doubt drew the spirit of Andy Milligan) is one of the best horror comedies in the world. has been producing for a long time. It's a very funny film that only tells its story. The distribution is first rate. Dominic Monaghan plays Arthur Blake, the burglar telling his story. Ron Perlman is the monk Duffy the monk taking the statement and perhaps too involved in the narrative. Both men have clearly grown up and it shows. The rest of the cast is just as good. Jeff Grace's music is excellent. The effects are perfect for this kind of macabre stupidity. The movie is very funny. If there is a problem with the film, it may be that he throws his net a little too wide so that the result is much too heavy. I do not want to say too much, but I do not think we needed the extraterrestrial body. It's still a lot of fun and I'm sure I'll come back to the IFC in movie theaters where I saw it for the first time, and later, I'm sure I'll take the DVD. <Br /> <br /> It's worth a look.
