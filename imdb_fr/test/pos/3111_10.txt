I loved this film because of the dialogue and the beautiful interpretation of Candace and Jacqueline. However, I have never known so far, watching a David Bette marathon on TNT, that this movie is a remake of a 1943 Bette Davis classic called Old Acquaintance. Bette co-starred with Miriam Hopkins with whom she had a terrible quarrel during the film's making, as Bette had an affair with Miriam's husband who had directed her in a film before making Old Acquaintance. <br /> <br /> Anyway, both are worth every minute of watching. I highly recommend this film if you like dialogue and drama. It's a study of women's psychology and their relationships with each other, in my opinion.
