Albert Finney and Tom Courtenay are as brilliant as Sir and his dresser. Of course, the play is brilliant at the beginning and nothing can be compared to the immediacy and collegiality of the theater, and I think you listen better to the theater; but on the screen, we become more intimate, we are "closer" than we are to the theater, we see subtle changes of expression, we "see" better while listening. The play and the film are both wonderful: moving, intelligent, enlightening - from the backstage story of society, the historical context, the two main characters and parallel characters of "Lear". If you can not see it in a theater (I do not imagine it produces a lot these days), then, please, do yourself a favor and get the video.
