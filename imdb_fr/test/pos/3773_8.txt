So, it's a bit dated now, he's almost 30 years old. Surprisingly, I have this on a BETA tape and it continues to play well. If I had to use a DVD, I would put it in motion quickly. <br /> <br /> The humor of drugs is no longer appreciated today, as it was at the time. Then it was not so "harmful". Just like driving without airbags, seat belts and child seats. I remember my father crying, he was laughing so hard at this. I had colleagues in the 90s who had seen him and I could break them by going to the intercom and saying "Iiiiiiiivvvvvyyyyyyyyyyyyyy". <br /> <br /> Excellent lines, great parody of the original and funny for me even three decades later!
