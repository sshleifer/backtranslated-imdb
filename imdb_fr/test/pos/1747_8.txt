There was a time when all the animation was not Disney or Pixar. It's so nice to see this wonderful movie and I got a good copy on DVD. Be careful because it is out of the public domain and there are very bad copies around. I got a really good copy from a company called Flashbacks and it's very good. In the past, I watched it in black and white on television and its magic to see it in color. Much better than some would have you believe. The songs are delicious and the color is great. Interestingly, the characters are really well developed, which is strange in animation movies. I loved Hoppity and the bad guy, Mr. Beatle, is a real guy. It's incredibly imaginative. Inanimate objects such as cotton spools and old cans are now part of the environment and have new functions. The anthropomorphic use of insects is amazing considering the very malignant creatures that most people think are disgusting. Hope we could never walk on an insect again! The enemy of insects is the man. In fact, insects will survive. Even if we try to get rid of ants here in Australia, they keep coming back. The battle has been lost and we must live with them. There are several scenes that stand out, such as when Hoppity and Mr. Bumble are caught in a watering can, the big flood and the ride to the top of the building are all wonderful. It's also rather anthropomorphic but in a way it's charming. The human characters are very similar to those of Gulliver and his effectiveness is incredible. The wedding scene is beautiful. It is a crime that this film was not hailed as a classic. The only shocking note for me is the occasions in the movie where characters slip into worms. Talking verse spoils the narration and it was not necessary, the verse is awful and spoils another good sage. It's great and the kids will love it. It's a joy to watch. There is also a very intelligent end.
