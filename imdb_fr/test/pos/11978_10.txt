All the people who voted a skinny 1 on this film, that's all I have to say: you have not matured enough to appreciate this kind of cinema. It takes a certain amount of dedication to reach this level of appreciation. And this is the segment of people targeted by this film. Not you average viewers by chance! . Back to the movie This one was a gem and an inclusion in the Bollywood Hall of Fame. I would give it a No. 2 ranking of all time, surpassed only by the legendary Gunda of Kanti Shah. This film had an irreproachable history and created a wonderful mix of fantasy and science fiction. The labyrinth of Pan would indeed have been ashamed of the balance created between the parallel stories. And now do I really have to mention stellar and even stellar actors (that's a word from NOW) (a special mention goes to Mr. Nigam for the best first movie of all the movies on the planet). All the actors in this film were carefully selected and their role was tailor-made for them (and for their age too, I must add). Manisha Koirala always looks like she's 18 and wow man, with that figure I would have raped her too. Wondering where this rape case comes from? Yes, the film is based on rape. And it's not like your average Bollywood type movies. If you are atheist or agnostic by chance, this movie is again a must for you. Because this film can heal your faith. I do not think it would go too far in saying that this film can cure cancer. Only the people who need it most do not appreciate his power, charm and eternal beauty. Tchch, so unhappy! <br /> <br /> Only flaw of this film: In your dreams, baby! It was irreproachable. <br /> <br /> Only the minor complains: the director has also failed to interpret Mithun Da. <br /> <br /> I will not mess you up anymore. Just watch it. TODAY. And if you like it, here are some more recommendations from me. Gunda, Desh Drohi, Aparichit, the old horror movies Ramsay Brothers, Loha, Indra the Tiger and Sivaji.
