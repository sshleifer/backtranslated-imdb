This film brilliantly recounts Shakespeare's classic love story, with "perverted sex, piercing and banging". It follows the same spirit as all other Troma movies [except for Combat Shock ... That sucker was depressing] but it's not just for Troma fans. Anyone who appreciates low-low graphics and a hilarious storyline will undoubtedly fall in love with this movie. <br /> <br /> Do not expect a pretentious and artistic idiot like the R & J version with Claire Danes and Leo DiCaprio; he knows it's a silly movie and takes his humor from that. The acting is also surprisingly good, and you can only feel the pain of Sammy Capulet as he tries to get his head back. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack, which contains many original and energetic bands like The Wesley Willis Fiasco, Supernova and The Meatmen are also rated four stars. This film should be seen by everyone, because it stays true to the original story while maintaining its gore / sexual humor.
