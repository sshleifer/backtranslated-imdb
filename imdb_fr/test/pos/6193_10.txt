a real scary drama, there's no other drama that scared me like that, the characters are not your typical Islamic terrorist, you have a blond guy with blue eyes who is as silly as he has he is a converted Muslim. A highly respected businessman who claims to be Jewish and a Frenchman who has converted to Islam, but who has clearly spoken the Koran to a whole new level. The conspiracy hero is Darwyn, an undercover agent of the FBI who has infiltrated the terrorist cell and has to do all kinds of terrible things not to be detected. The first episode gives a glimpse of what will follow. Although they are Islamic terrorists, the drama has a unique way of emphasizing that not all Muslims are extremists, which is comforting for those who are concerned about racism. be afraid of. The most scary drama I have ever seen. The reason she is so scary is that you never know who your friends, your husband or your neighbors really are. Terrorists can be anyone, anywhere, anytime.
