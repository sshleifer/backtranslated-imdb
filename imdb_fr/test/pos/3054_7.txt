Never, since Bette Davis' 1933 vehicle "Ex-Lady", did I see a film so much better than what her star had announced! "Most people" Atoll K "," Utopia "," Robinson Crusoeland "," Escapade "have come together over the years as told by Stan Laurel's horror stories about his production. he had suffered a stroke while shooting, it seemed that the death had warmed up for a good part of his life (from the first two pictures together, you would never guess that Laurel survived Hardy eight years later) and then diagnosed that her diet has recovered based on her condition), we understand why Laurel did not think this movie was the most enjoyable experience of her life. cheap is obvious, the dubbing is awful and Laurel and Hardy were too old to make the energetic blunder of their greatest movies, but it's still really funny, and the story of Leo Joannon introduces elements of political satire ( perf libertarians, sometimes communists) that one could hope to see actors more aware of society, such as Chaplin or the Marx Brothers, but never Laurel and Hardy. The film deserves the credit of being different (although its debt to the classic "Passport to Pimlico" Ealing studios, made a year ago, is rather obvious) and to have integrated the comedy Laurel and Hardy in a context rather annoying, completely different from everything they had used before. It's not a good movie, but it's certainly better than the eight skinny Fox and MGM movies of the early 1940s. I guess only the film's technical crudeness prevented it from winning the cult, which has was made by the "duck soup" of the anti-establishment "Marx brothers" in the late 1960s and early 1970s.
