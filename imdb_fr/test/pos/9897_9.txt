I too had the chance to see "Checking Out" with Peter Falk at the Phoenix Film Festival. It is an extremely soft and character-driven film that leaves the audience fascinated by the difficult situation of the Applebaums. More than funny, each character in the family brings an inestimable comic relief that not only gives rise to laughter, but also inspires some tears of joy. Peter Falk was born to play this role. He plays the role of a "young" father of three 90-year-olds who reunites his adult children in a time that could be one of the most important of his life. The Applebaum family's two-day trip to the enchanting setting of New York (with carefully selected characters) not only leaves the public wanting more, but also nurtures a sense of family. "Checking Out" is a must see movie, not only for all those who love the family, but also for all those who are not !!! Thanks to the director who took the opportunity to present this gift to his audience. Robin Sly, Scottsdale, Arizona
