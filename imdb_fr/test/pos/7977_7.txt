I really enjoyed watching Hell to Pay. I've been a Western fan for as long as I can remember and it reminded me of a lot of 1960s westerns (although I was too young to have seen them on their first visit). The only thing that bothered me about the movie was the constant music. It was distracting sometimes. One thing I noticed, and I wonder how many other Gunsmoke fans have noticed, is the name of Buck Taylor's character. It was a play on the name of Doc Adams of Gunsmoke. Instead of Gaylan Adams, Buck Taylor used Adam Galen. I wonder if it was his choice or that of Chris McIntyre? In any case, I would recommend this film to fans of westerns. Do not expect anything too deep. Simply old entertainment.
