Isabelle Huppert must be one of the greatest actresses of her or any other generation. "The Pianist" really confirms it. As if that were not enough, Annie Girardot plays her mother and Annie Girardot is one of the greatest actresses of her or any other generation. So, as you can imagine, these casting pieces are worth the effort. Isabelle and Annie play characters never seen on the screen. A mother and daughter, yes, but with such intrepidity and virulence that I was sometimes unable even to blink or breathe. Personally, I do not believe in the intentions of the director, I do not think they go beyond the shocking anecdote and that the end made me scream with frustration, but I was fascinated by the story written to the face of men. Huppert sensational and the ferocity of Girardot's strength. I highly recommend it to movie lovers from all over the world and collectors of great performances like me, you can not afford to miss "The Pianist"
