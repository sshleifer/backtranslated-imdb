I just saw The Big Trail at the Filmmuseum in Vienna for the first time. Immediately, I was amazed by both the high optical quality of the images and the unusual format and wonderfully detailed story. Who has ever seen such a Western documentary style with John Wayne? And there is so much time, you can actually look around the screen, there is so much to see! We are always grateful that the scenes are often static, because each shot is well composed and you want to take it. Even the acting is good and fits well. The long duration of the photo is beautiful, you do not want to miss a minute!
