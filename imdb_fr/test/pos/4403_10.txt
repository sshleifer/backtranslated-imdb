The Coen brothers really outdid themselves in this wonderful saga of three escaped convicts. Although based on "The Odyssey", Homer's ancient work, you do not need to read "The Odyssey" to follow the story. The Coen brothers wove a tapestry of celluloid and ear candy! The soundtrack is intrinsic to the film, indeed it's as if the soundtrack was the product and the film was wrapping paper. Each character is wonderfully exploited and goes back to the time when the movies were full of character actors whose appearance even in the film adds richness, texture and authenticity. George Clooney is magnificent, like Everett Ulysses McGill, an honest man whose linguistics and pompous vocabulary are comical and endearing. O Brother, Where Art Thou is undoubtedly Coen's best film to date, as well as Clooney's best efforts. Clooney has the goodness to deserve a Best Actor nomination, as does Tim Blake Nelson's portrayal of the obscure friend Delmar, while the film itself deserves the title of best film.
