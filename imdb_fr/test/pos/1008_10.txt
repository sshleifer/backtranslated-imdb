It was one of the few Norwegian films that I was looking forward to. He began as a few commercials with a motley group at football matches. Then they made a movie. Leads are not pros (and you can see it) but they still do a great job and the movie just dazzled me. <br /> <br /> Norway is known for making shitty movies (no offense) but I had a good feeling about it. Even though football does not interest me, I wanted to see him. the story is much better than expected and the laughter keeps accumulating. there are many celebrity cameos and Norwegian players. the characters are well described and you feel good. IF YOU NEVER GONNA, SEE A NORWEGIAN FILM. May he be that one !!!!
