In England, we often feel very attached to the British films that we like, because we are so used to the usual American settings and accents. Being from London, where virtual sexuality is established, I felt a strong emotional attachment. The characters of Virtual Sexuality, especially women, are exactly what British teenagers are. I felt almost in the movie. I immediately talked about Alex's character in the movie. His shyness is quite common among most British teenagers, especially girls. Virtual sexuality made me feel really good because it's one of the only British movies that does not concern gangsters or the middle class, but the people who watch the film, the average teenagers. Americans would not really feel the emotional attachment, but every British teenager should watch it. Everyone in London will recognize parts of the movie city, it definitely has a special place in my video box!
