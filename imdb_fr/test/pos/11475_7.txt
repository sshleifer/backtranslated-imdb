Since number 1, you know that the good guy in the suit and tie is doomed ?? He has no luck ("Sorte Nula"), at least he believes it with this music on the car radio and the dubious speech of his best friend and partner of the company that takes him to unknown places through a deserted road. Alberto just wanted to be left alone, take a flight abroad the next day, with ?? Well, someone lets us guess. <br /> <br /> The film goes a long way ?? it will find short ?? at a closing scene with the man hearing the same music in a taxi to the airport. In the meantime, a number of lucky people have found different ways out of history, some dying, some born, others falling into deep distress. This time he is really doomed ?? Where is he? The film is a kind of one-man show by director Fernando Fragata who has left the sound recording and special effects only to other competent people. Those who generally refuse Portuguese films due to sound problems and confused speech recordings should look for other topics to criticize. The car accident (it's not a mistake, the film is too clever for THAT) gives a beautiful scene, and has apparently been done with cheap equipment. (The American studios are warned: you can save a dollar or two by hiding competent Portuguese directors!) <br /> <br /> The rest was made by Fragata, from scenario to dialogue, from work with the camera to editing . If part of the dialogue was adjourned, he had to be congratulated again for acting and casting with mostly inexperienced actors. A large number of non-spoken parts are credited, but most of them were used for the video clip and the making of, widely used in the film's promotional trailer. The cast includes a dozen actors and actresses, including ten personalities and a large number of relationships ?? which are revealed step by step, in a thrilling and moving way, reminiscent of the best genre writers. "Alfred Hitchcock" (qv) and "Claude Chabrol" (qv) come to my mind during the cat-and-mouse game between the director and his audience and the nature of his characters. <br /> <br /> I recommend this thriller and this comedy to Portuguese speakers and, if the film manages to get a decent translation of its spoken dialogue, to all those who love these genres abroad.
