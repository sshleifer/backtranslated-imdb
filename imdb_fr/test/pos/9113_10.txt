Tenacious D: In The Pick of Destiny tells the fictional story of Tenacious D's band formation and their quest for the Pick of Destiny, a guitar pick with supernatural powers made from Satan's own tooth (played by Dave Grohl). JB (Jack Black) and KG (Kyle Gass), united by fate, have to visit the Rock N 'Roll Museum and steal the Pick of Destiny to become the largest band in the world. The film is hilarious and offers bursts of non-stop laughter. Jack Black and Kyle Gass work together perfectly, having been friends and co-workers in real life for over 20 years. The film is partly a musical. All the music (or most) was written and performed by The D. All the songs are new material and many of them are classical. The soundtrack is definitely worth seeing. This movie will be especially appreciated by Tenacious D fans, but if you're not a fan of The D, I still think you'll enjoy it. If you're a D fan, then you have to see this movie. The acting is not as bad as you might think, and the laughter and rudeness never stop coming. I highly recommend this movie to anyone looking to get their socks on and laugh as hard as they have for a long time. Look for Dave Grohl, Ronnie James Dio, Meatloaf, Ben Stiller, Amy Poehler, Tim Robbins, John C. Reilly and Neil Hamburger cameos. Stay tuned for an extra scene after the credits.
