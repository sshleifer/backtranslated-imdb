The marriage of a chic couple with a child in New York City breaks up when the woman wants to go out ("It took a lot of courage for her to go out that door!", Tells a neighbor); the busy and distracted husband assumes "maternal" responsibilities and gets closer to his son, but the woman returns soon. A highly manipulative image does not give us a very realistic family unit (the young Justin Henry certainly does not resemble the product of a marriage between Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep!), But the dynamic is intriguing and catchy, and the director Robert Benton keep the rhythm popping with great intelligence, marvelous classical music, skillful editing and infallible snatches of humor. Streep's character is meant to be a cold, selfish witch, but I was ready to feel for her much more than Benton probably wanted. Everything must be described in terms of black and white, good and bad, Hoffman learning how much his wife has had and had a second chance to be a good parent. The film never fades from its preconceived trajectory, and a beautiful performance almost saves it, but I'm not sure where Benton directed the film in the final act, and the closing scene is terribly abrupt. *** of ****
