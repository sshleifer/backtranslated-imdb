Harry Langdon's "Saturday Afternoon" is often rated as one of the biggest silent comedies, at least for short stories, and may be a little disappointing for some. Unlike some other well-known classics such as Keaton's "Cops" or Chaplin's "The Immigrant", this film is in some respects a classic and familiar sitcom and does not offer a lot of belly laughs; one might even wonder if Langdon belongs to such a rare enterprise. Nevertheless, in my opinion, it is a comedy quite charming in its way of playing the main role, and Harry is fascinating to watch. <br /> <br /> For a modern television viewer, the "Saturday Afternoon" plot may suggest The Honeymooners or its many spinoffs: two slim types, one of which is married and quite under the thumb of his wife, try to sneak with two or three good girls for an afternoon of pleasure; but everything goes wrong, and they end up fighting against the girls' tough little friends. Sound familiar? And maybe a little sad? Well, the premise was already a store affair when this movie was shot, but beyond that, nothing is typical of Langdon. It was strange, starting with the fact that he looked like a middle-aged baby half asleep. All Freudians who catch "Saturday afternoon" will have a busy day with scenes between this shy and chubby baby-man and his stern, gentle, domineering mother. When Harry tries to hide money under the rug but surprises him in the act and forces him to give it back to him, you swear that you're looking at an interaction between a 6-year-old boy and his mom. . . and maybe that's why Harry Langdon has given goose bumps to some people, and he always does. <br /> <br /> But he is a convincing screen figure and that's not what he does, but his way of doing it. For example, in this scene with the coins under the rug, Harry finds the coins by placing one foot in front of the other, cautiously, like a tightrope walker, counting his steps until he finds the good place, and his technique is hypnotic. Langdon moved like nobody. Whether he makes you laugh or not, the guy is fascinating, apparently in a world all his own. As for the plot of his films, Harry is oddly passive and almost never advances the story itself. In the "Saturday Afternoon" finale, when the big fight takes place, Harry's co-star, Vernon Dent, is in the thick of the action, but Harry is in a state of stupor for most of his time and ends up having some kind of punch. drunk between two cars (sitting on the step of one but the feet on the other) during the race in the streets. This image is memorable and, as critics Walter Kerr wrote, it perfectly sums up Langdon's character on screen: he is a passive character who finds himself in the middle of a frantic action, blinking his eyes. asleep while the world rushes. It is also interesting to note that Langdon and Dent, who have often worked together, have a report in this film that suggests a detailed plan that Laurel & Hardy would follow when they teamed up, about a year later. Langdon's style probably influenced Stan Laurel, especially in this place. <br /> <br /> "Saturday afternoon" and his actor may not be for everyone, but the film is definitely worth it, and you may find that Langdon makes a difficult impression in shake.
