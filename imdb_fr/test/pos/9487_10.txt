This set of two disks is amazing! If you are like me and have never had the opportunity to see the band live, this is the next best thing to do. Jimmy Page, who in my opinion is the second best guitarist to ever walk on the earth (second behind Slowfingers himself), has made an incredible show in all the sequences of this film. John Paul Jones, although he is not as direct as Page, gives the show. Although, in the live atmosphere, his rhythmic bass lines are not as defined as in the studio recordings, except of course in songs like Dazed and Confused well displayed in these DVDs. John Bonham is John Bonham, what can I say? There is no comparison possible, its rhythms stand out like no other, and this DVD is the proof. Last but not least, Robert Plant cries as no one can moan. If you've ever read Hammer of the Gods, you'll wonder the same thing Page was when he first met Robert Plant, why the hell is not this guy already famous? And so concludes my comment, sorry for my misspellings or grammar, Zeppelin is great.
