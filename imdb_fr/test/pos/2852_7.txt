This is the story of a guy who went to see a comedy and turned out to be a horror movie. The true story of a guy who loves pictures and who is afraid when he unexpectedly identified with one of them. The incredible story of a guy who was scared when the woman-hero was deluded and the bad guy. My God, is that what life made us be? Do people delude themselves about the perfect face by imagining how this face should be perfect on the inside? "Toto, I think we're not in Kansas anymore."
