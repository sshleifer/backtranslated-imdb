After spending five years in prison, Dr. Thomas Reed, played by the incomparable Vincent Ventresca, exiles himself to the Purgatory Flats and ends up getting excited. He soon meets Sunny (Alexandra Holden). "You are mean." he tells him. "You have no idea." she replies, sipping on her Slo Comfortable Screw and crawling on her cigarette. Reed finds herself mingled with the violent turmoil of her family and the story of the femme fatale unfolds in the face of the desolation and despair of the oil-stricken western city. <br /> <br /> Canny direction. Great performances. Superb work of entourage. And scenes of lust that sizzle like the sun in Purgatory.
