This Columbo is unique in that we do not really know the exact result until the end. Our favorite detective of black horses suspects two identical twin brothers of killing their rich uncle; each one points his finger at his brother. In a mysterious series in which the crime is shown at the beginning of the drama, this turn could only reasonably be used once or twice, and it was the time of Columbo. Outside of this ride, this episode fits well with others in the series. It has a lighter tone than some, with a very amusing performance of Jeanette Nolan in the role of the demanding and loyal housekeeper who takes a moment for Columbo to hate.
