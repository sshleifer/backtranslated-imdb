A masterful performance by Jamie Foxx is one of the highlights of "Ray", a 2004 film starring Kerry Washington, Regina King, Curtis Armstrong, Richard Schiff, Sharon Warren, Patrick Bachau and others, who all provide excellent support for the film. <br /> <br /> The film has several main axes: the first is the childhood of Charles - the drowning of his brother George who haunted him for years, the glaucoma that blinded him and the strength that he learned his mother - Do not bend, do not break, never be crippled. She eventually sends him to a special school where Charles' gift of music is discovered. The next step is Charles' artistic evolution as a singer of Nat King Cole's style, his gospel music arrangements, his foray into country music and the unique sound that has become Ray Charles. The third objective is Charles' personal life: his marriage to Bea, his many belongings, his addiction to heroin and his eventual rehabilitation. <br /> <br /> Charles having lived 74 full years, there are many things that have been ignored. Although Charles was an orphan when he was a teenager, the death of his beloved mother, his rock, is not in the film. While he is shown on the Chitlin circuit and refuses to play in separate clubs, his near-famine as a musician is not covered. At one point he found a jar of jelly and tried to eat it, but the pot broke. He was like that. Bea is introduced with him when the state of Georgia, which banned him, adopted "Georgia on My Mind" as a theme song in 1979 and welcomed Charles to his home state. Yet, he and Bea divorced him in 1977, which is not mentioned. . She was probably there, though. Besides, she was not his only wife - he had married once before meeting her; this marriage is not covered. In the film, we are told about an illegitimate child - there were 12. It would have been impossible to get all this and more in a movie. <br /> <br /> What is not skipped is his glorious music, which seems to continue throughout the film, constantly strengthening his genius and artistic sense. <br /> <br /> Charles's story is fascinating and keeps the audience interested throughout his career. Those who make fun of him like a TV movie do not give it the credit it deserves. The management of Taylor Hackford gives "Ray" a good rhythm and the film has a lot of atmosphere and beautifully evokes the different decades. <br /> <br /> As Ray, Jamie Foxx lives in the character and makes him forget that he is an actor. a part. Foxx wore prosthetics, played his own piano and spent a lot of time with Charles preparing for the role. He nails it, but it is not a usurpation of identity - he is a man of flesh and blood suffering from hallucinations, which consists in staying in the water and finding his brother's body; a man full of denial about his addiction, hating the word junkie and believing he was not addicted; and he denies his family life by thinking that his wife is unaware of all his illegitimate children and affairs (in the film, child); and a man has benefited terribly from the beginning of his career because of his blindness who refuses to walk later. He asks to be paid in dollar bills in order to count them. when he discovers he is a coach for a club owner and his partner and is almost deceived by a registration contract, he concludes his own contract and quits his job. <br /> <br /> We do not marvel so much Foxx's performance will accept him as Ray from his first appearance on camera. <br /> <br /> This is an excellent biography that, like "Walk the Line", is punctuated by the fantastic music of the artist. Whether you are Ray Charles fan or not, "Ray" is an experience to live.
