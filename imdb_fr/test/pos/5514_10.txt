Strangeland seems to have a romantic / hate relationship with many of her viewers. Personally, I really liked the film and everything about it. <br /> <br /> We could improve the acting in some places, but shooting adds to the atmosphere where it is not possible to play. In some areas, the dialogue is a little old-fashioned and dramatic, but really, what are you waiting for in the late 90s? Overall, Dee did an amazing job writing what I believe to be one of the most terrifying thrillers I've ever seen. It plays on the fears of many age groups - adults, parents and children. All parents worry that their children will get too involved in discussion forums and meet strangers on the Internet. And this happens in the real world. And every child and every adult fears being kidnapped and tortured against their will; this also happens in the real world. What makes this film such a sensitive topic for many. <br /> <br /> My only warning is that if you know that you are sensitive to acts such as violence, visible torture and gore, then you will * not * want to see this movie. If you do not know if this movie will entertain you, read as many reviews as possible, ask people you know who have already seen this movie and be ready to turn off the movie at any time, if you are disturbed.
