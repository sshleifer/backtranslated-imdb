This series has recently been discovered and extracts can be viewed, at least in Great Britain, via http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/527213/index.html Presumably the series could eventually become more widely available. The problem is that this series was followed by the series "THE WAR OF THE ROSES", whose distribution is also stellar, and which was offered on cable television, or at least the market. <br /> <br /> The two series are quite different in dramaturgy; THE WARS consolidates the pieces by a major rewrite and shift of the scenes; AGE OF KINGS follows Shakespeare more closely. Both series benefit from the integral casting.
