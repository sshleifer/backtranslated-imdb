I loved this thing. The most wonderful thing about Pink Flamingos is that she desperately tries to have a horrible taste, but that she has really won a cult around the world. It says a lot about us (we are people), is not it? Pink Flamingos succeeds because Waters made the film he wanted to do. A movie does not have to be disgusting to succeed, but it may be. When you watch this film, you see things that are disgusting, but that are ultimately brilliant because they are freely displayed. What we have here is an honest piece of personal creative expression. This film is within the reach of all movie lovers, be it a movie or any other media.
