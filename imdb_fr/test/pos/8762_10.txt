Traffik, beautifully constructed, tells the story of narcotics use and trade from many angles. From the point of view of a police officer, a politician, an addict, a smuggler and a farmer.

Stunning shots in the poppy fields in Pakistan, from downtown Karachi to the entry points to Frankfurt and London airports, to the dilapidated buildings where smuggling takes place, you can see the vastness of drug consumption.
