I do not know if it's in the comments on the television series that the comments should be made, but it's on television that The Lone Ranger really made a name for himself. I'm not even referring to the original radio broadcasts of this moped runner from the plains, I referred to a point where, in a little boy, 9 or 10 years old, I had to see the movie "The Lone Ranger" and never forgot it. I remember I was on a line or moving to the Paramount Theater - the theater was located in the theater district, if I remember correctly. It was right across, going from east to west of the building that was the balloon that falls on New Year's Eve - that's of course if anyone does not know, New York City.High Above the street, on the rooftops, there was a time and maybe to be still today, huge billboards would advertise what was being presented, etc. It was at that moment that I looked up and was never as impressed as I was when I looked at this billboard to see the Lone Ranger on the rooftops-it was great- He made an impression and was never forgotten.The day we went to see the Lone Ranger - It was the story of the birth of the Lone Ranger - The terrible ambush that Texas The rangers came into the film and the rebirth of one of his fallen heroes. It is in this film that we learn that The Lone Ranger will not shoot to kill, but to harm, so as to let justice be the judge.This type of thought is so useful This is where we learn that Tonto discovers the fallen Ranger and seeing the symbol of childhood friendship that The Lone Ranger had established years earlier, when he had come younger to help a young wounded man in Tonto-For help Tonto gave his faithful friend a thank you symbol that was now part of a necklace recognized by Tonto. Tonto said: "You are Kemosabe" .The Lone Ranger said: "kemo -sabe, is it familiar? Tonto tells the story of this rusty scout" (meaning Kemosabe) I think the Lone Ranger is one of the true heroes of the big screen and one of the great heroes of television. It should also be noted that these highly respected individuals, Clayton Moore and Jay Silverheels Live Over there, live according to the legend of The Lone Ranger-It is quite possible that there is an inspiring story in the history of Lone Ranger and his faithful companion Tonto.I have been delighted to find and buy the DVDs, have been awake all Saturday morning and have watched the many episodes now available.Live Live The Lone Ranger and his faithful companion Tonto-Hi-Ho Silver-
