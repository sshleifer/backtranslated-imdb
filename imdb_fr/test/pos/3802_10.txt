It must be one of the most beautiful things I have ever seen on film. I do not know if it's as bad as it seems to be, but it does not matter. This film is extreme, absolutely wild and surreal. Packaging and marketing just make it all the more true because you * know * that from time to time a mother has to reprogram her child to accept our reality, after he has pulled out of the video store hoping for something completely different. Look at the road map, for one thing! And where else in the United States can you see a child of ten years swear as much as this one, then be looted by the perverse rival of Zed, Pulp Fiction? And this scene of food inspector is the best! The amount of well-known actors in this film that are loosely recognized is one of the best things about it. Soon, much sooner than you realize, you'll find yourself saying, "Is it meatloaf, is it Drew Barrymore?" Holideck Star Trek doctor: Voyager "It's this chip?" The owner of the Twin Peaks sawmill squirting squirrels with car exhaust, "And this guy from the new Rob Zombie movie?" He looks a lot like Shrek. my favorite scene is at the very end, with Phil in a whole body cast. I mean, please, why are there not more movies like this on planes? This director has hardly any other name to his name than Return to Salem's Lot, but he shows a real genius stumbling man-child in this creation! If you are an intellectual looking for something to spend the evening, I highly recommend you watch this movie. The plot of this film is too ridiculous, but imagine that it is extracted from its context: * a boy waving a Meat Loaf too aggressive, who seems to want at any cost to overcome his anger not to be accepted in Guns N Roses, look over his shoulder and see Voyager's doctor come into the bar * Can you imagine what a channel surfer to half of the active brain in the last six years would think about seeing this? Now imagine if you were interested in Meat Loaf or Voyager first! Or imagine if you are a fan of chips. Rocky Horror Picture Show, this movie contains remarkable music, but its soundtrack is more plastic than Mad Max 3. What does this mean to you? This is the delayed, inverted Mongoloid cousin-sister-mother-puppy from The Rocky Horror Picture Show. And if Gus's sleeve fell on his arm in an act of mastering the special effects of cable access? When I saw this film, it was at the suggestion of my cousin who had seen half of it in the early 90s, during an almost conscious childhood, and who had since been haunted by vague memories. not slept in three days. That made me laugh! Of course, it's also an anxiety film. The music does not encourage suspense, but we finally get to the point where it is clearly established that the US Censorship Committee has obviously missed this film and that anything can absolutely happen and that probably everyone will arrive. as long as the camera angles change. I found myself obsessed with the possibility that these cards would fly out the window at any time. Watch this awesome movie!
