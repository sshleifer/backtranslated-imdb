When the noble Hanabusa clan is decimated by the usurpation of the Samanosuke clan, the faithful guardian Kogenta (Jun Fujimaki) escapes with the son of his lord, Tadafumi, aged eight, and his daughter Kozasa. They are lodged by priestess Shinobu (Otome Tsukimiya), who serves the Hanabusa clan god, Majin, a vengeful spirit trapped in the giant stature carved on the mountainside. Ten years later, Kogenta and Tadafumi (Yoshihiko Aoyama) take revenge against Lord Samanosuke (Yutaro Gomi), but are captured during the attempt and sentenced to death. Priestess Shinobu, desperately trying to save her master, threatens Samanosuke with God's discontent, only to be put to death for his efforts. Samanosuke, a vain, cruel and narrow man, ordered the destruction of Majin's statue in order to crush the last vestiges of hope among the remaining loyalists of Hanabusa. But the god Majin, hitherto implacably silent, has other ideas ... <br /> <br /> Daimajin is a captivating fairy tale, timeless and deeply moving. Producing sumptuously on a respectable budget, it is a film about values: the values ​​of nobility, justice, decency, loyalty, self-sacrifice and love. It is the hierarchy and the rule, as well as the consequences of not taking responsibility. These are things we do not talk about much in our demotic times, except by scribbling toads like William Bennet, but they are nevertheless relevant, and Daimajin explains why. <br /> <br /> Daimajin is a perfect example of why Japanese cinema is so glorious. The values ​​listed above are of palpable relevance to the people involved in this film, as are many Japanese filmmakers. There is no talk, no condescension, no irony here. Instead, there is a genuine effort to create a world where these values ​​can come alive again, and to show what happens when they fall into disuse. Just compare Daimajin, or the Lone Wolf and Cub series, or any other Kurosawa movie, with Tarantino's huge Kill Bill b * llshit, to see what I mean. <br /> <br /> In a film with so excellent uniform contributing talent, I would simply like to highlight the majestic score of master Akira Ifikuba, the talent and beauty of actors Jun Fujimaki, Yoshihiko Aoyama and Miwi Takada; and the magnificent representation of Otome Tsukimiya. His scene of death is one of the most moving and significant I know.
