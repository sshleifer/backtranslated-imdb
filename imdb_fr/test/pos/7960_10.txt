A photographer in the small town of Gunsan, South Korea, learns that he has a terminal illness, but understates the severity of his illness for his family and friends. We never discover the nature of the disease, but the main goal of Hur Jin-ho's first poignant film, Christmas in August, is not his illness. It is the grace in which he leads his life - his ability to accept what life has in store without remorse. Unfortunately, it was the latest film shot by director of photography Yoo Young-kil before his death. The film is dedicated to his memory. <br /> <br /> The photographer, Jung-won, is played by Han Suk-kyu, once Korea's most popular star. A handsome man in his thirties with contagious laughter, he is so warm and full of vitality that it is difficult to imagine him at the end of his life. Jung-won owns a small photography shop and lives at home with his hard-of-hearing father (Goo Shin) and his sister (Oh Ji-hye). He teaches his father how to play movies on the VCR and orders him to take things in hand. his shop if he were to die. As Jung-won begins to clean up his day-to-day business, Dar-im (Shim Eun-ha), a meter reader, enters his store with an urgent demand for photographic enlargements. <Br/> <br /> Abrupt and impatient, he treats her with disdain but later apologizes and she becomes a regular customer. Without manifest expression of love feelings, their relationship develops a growing intimacy. Love is not something they say or do. It's their land of being, the place they come from. To protect Dar-im from suffering, Jung-won does not tell him that he has little time to live, but that does not make it easy for him. Inevitably, her growing absence in the shop makes her feel betrayed and frustrated to the point of throwing a stone through the window of the shop. Although Jung-won's decision to deny his illness to Dar-im is questionable, it seems organic to his character in the film and is not simply used as a plot or an excuse for the character to "live life to the full." ". playing. <br /> <br /> One of the most touching sequences of the film is that of an elderly woman returning to her studio to take a commemorative photo. Jung-won makes sure that the photo is an exact likeness, knowing that he will soon take his own photo of the memory. Christmas in August is an unpretentious film that never uses melodrama to make itself understood. It's about having fun in ordinary moments: riding a bike, sharing a joke, eating ice cream, being thoughtful and considerate and feeling good about what life has to offer. It's a love story where love means having to say you're sorry. Although there have been many films about the process of death, Christmas in August propels the genre into a new direction and, in doing so, offers an unforgettable commentary on the human condition. Incongruously, this film about death is an experience of the greatest joy.
