The trio is a pleasant and nostalgic journey to this first sign of desire - when it was still a simple exploration of the unknown - before "growing up" and adding these complexities of HIV status, emotional baggage and a foot race. -Pager-Just-Off-Off in the emotional mix. <br /> <br /> The anxiety depicted is pure teenage anxiety, but it sounds right in all three stories. Their softness and positivity make you feel good that you are gay. And these types of movies are rare. <br /> <br /> Good news! Boys Life and Boys Life 2 are now available on DVD as of September 1999.
