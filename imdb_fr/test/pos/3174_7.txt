A western rodeo extremely realistic, well done and very effective. No dazzling stars are needed here because all the members of the cast were ordinary people telling a real story of the life of a rodeo dealer and his entourage in the west of the 60s and 70s. But particular hat to Slim Pickens for giving what I thought was his signature performance, especially since he had been a rodeo clown in real life. His role went well beyond the role of clown as he tackled in depth all the "ups and downs" of the hard life of the rodeo and the psychological devastation that so often surrounds this lifestyle. He and Coburn collaborated very well as partners, not only on the circuit itself, but also in the real world outside the corral. Also discover Anne Archer, the love interest of Coburn in the last part of the film. This must be one of his first roles. <br /> <br /> Not as flashy, perhaps, as "Junior Bonner", but also a rendering of heart and impact in its representation. Thanks to Encore Western Channel for showing this real grain of an underrated film from time to time.
