"The Dresser" is a small but absolutely beautiful film, brilliantly performed by Albert Finney and Tom Courtenay. How in the world this tiny film has attracted enough attention to garner five major Oscar nominations in 1983 is a mystery to me, but it's good to know that the Academy may be guilty of showing good taste from time to time. time (of course, they awarded the prize that year to "Terms of Endearment" - after all, they do not want to be accused of showing too much taste). <br /> <br /> Albert Finney is a drunken Shakespearean actor in a production of "King Lear"; Tom Courtenay is the man who works twice behind the scenes to keep this actor in the spotlight. It is both hilarious and pitiful to see the character of Courtenay mourning Finney's attention and affection, but to see his efforts completely ignored and rejected, even to the end. Finney and Courtenay work wonders together, and although Finney gets the most spectacular moments (he has to recite Shakespeare after all), Courtenay is the heart and soul of the film. <br /> <br /> Grade: A
