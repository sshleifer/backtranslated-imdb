I love the Promised Land. The first episode I saw took place during my 2003-2005 mission. I really liked the rich family described in the series. Here was a family with its own difficulties, but instead of lingering there; they are lovingly addressing other people who may have had the same problems, in order to forget themselves and go to work. That made me fall in love with the show. All actors; especially Gerald McRaney; had demonstrated the true meaning of "family" that has left an indelible mark in my life. I followed the same path, but it took me a long time to develop that kind of character. I love this show so much that I wanted to share it with friends; but I was really stunned when I heard that it had been removed from the air. I thought and still think they should bring it back! So many lives can benefit from sky-inspired media. I sincerely believe that this show was divinely inspired; because he brings the spirit whenever I see a single episode. This show really (in my book) really defines what a "promised land" is. It is the love you keep in your heart for others; which brings you to a higher destination. The spirit of love is one of the most powerful messages in this series, and all I can say is: Bring it back. -Robert
