This soap for the hardworking goes to the devil is a candidate of the time capsule, thanks to its immaculate physical production, to the costume designer of the 50s (look at all these bows and pearls), to the creamy theme song of Johnny Mathis and his attitudes Sexuality so daring. Rona Jaffe's novel, on which the film was based, continues to be republished and just a few years ago, Vanity Fair devoted an article to this delightful film. Watch the new DVD transfer and you'll know why. <br /> <br /> The three stars - Hope Lange, Diane Baker and Suzy Parker - echo the girls of "How to marry a millennium" or Carrie Bradshaw and her friends of "Sex and the City". "Gentlewomen songsters on spree ..." Their romantic adventures and their sexual entanglements make the lads happy: empty caramel corn calories, devoid of nutrition, impossible to resist snack foods. Lange is truly moving in her neo-Grace Kelly way, Baker is dark enough and idealistic as a shy virgin who gets caught by a (hissing) cad. This helps that the cad is interpreted by Robert Evans, the movie mogul sniffing coke that has surely led many innocent young lambs to the massacre in his Beverly Hills room. <br /> <br /> Suzy Parker fascinates the first half of the film, all self-assurance blithe and enlightened remarks. She struts with the panache of the icon of fashion that she was in the 50s. Unfortunately, it is not up to the film: in madness and obsession. But she breathes glamor and savior and her acting is at least enough. One wonders why the critics hated her, virtually chasing her out of movies a few years later. Maybe a distant attitude from a pretty woman is too hard to bear. Ali McGraw's career sank a generation later, and when you think about it, Ali McGraw and Suzy Parker were basically the same actress. <br /> <br /> The only major flaw of the film is a weak end. He ended up falling into a romantic faint at the end, rather than ending up in a dramatic melody, like Jerry Wald's famous soap opera, "Peyton Place", in which Lana Turner was crying and grinding her teeth during a rape. trial. There, Hope Lange walks on the sidewalk of New York, sees a heavy mass eternally suspended (but now, of course, sober), Stephen Boyd and they simply go together ... at sunset, presumably. Otherwise, that's pretty much the definition of guilty pleasure. <br /> <br /> Oh yes ... there is also Joan Crawford who spits fire on all the girls and smokes the cigarette while she whistles to her married lover phone. And the titles are bright pink, with a ribbon lettering reminiscent of advertising department stores of the late 50s. Do not miss!
