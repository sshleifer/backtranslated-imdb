Much more than any other movie of this period, Night of the Demons represents the brainless horror pastiche and extremely enjoyable. It's an undemanding pleasure with tons of unpleasant makeup effects, attractive (and sexy) teen girls, and adorable clich√©s. A group of partygoers, led by alternative Angela, goes to celebrate Halloween in an abandoned funeral home that carries an ominous urban legend. Everything starts in a typical and "innocent" way with the dance, the drink and the occasional flirt between young people who can not control their hormones, but very quickly, a bloodthirsty demon owns the hostess. In the most ingenious way you've ever seen, the rest of the cast is viciously slaughtered to return only as hideous creatures in search of blood. What makes this film better than most of the eerie 80s horror movies is finding a good balance between the lighthouse camp and the atmospheric horror. Some sequences are really scary and the staging of the funeral home gives Night of the Demons an excellent sound. The director Tenney uses the scenery a lot (coffins, a crematorium, endless dark corridors ??) and his enthusiastic young cast obviously loves what they are involved with. There are of course the obvious aspects for the fanatics of love and horror who will love the large amount of cut limbs, wide-eyed and crushed skulls! The ultimate highlight, however, is Linnea Quigley's feat with the endangered lipstick! This bimbo nymphomaniac drives a tube of lipstick in her nipple and continues his sexual slaughter! Creepy! Night of the Demons received two sequels in the '90s, and while still deserving of viewing, they focus more on comedy than chills.
