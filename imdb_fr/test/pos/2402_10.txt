Internet is a wonderful thing, is not it? I am watching a recorded episode of one of my favorite documentaries of all time, "Vietnam: The Ten Thousand Days War", from my DVR in Florida (USA) to my laptop in Kuwait; I am writing a review of this series and have just read another review of someone who actually lives in Vietnam! Unbelievable. I would simply say that, for Minh Nguyen, to say that America brought the war back to Vietnam is a bias. I know that the United States was the main player in the West, but it takes two camps to wage war. The Soviets and the Chinese were important arms suppliers to the North, so why does not Mr. Nguyen mention them in part to show that he is partly responsible for their ignorance (well, we all know why he does not mention them in a communist system and his political dogma, or because he is afraid to tell the truth for fear of being arrested.). In addition, Mr. Nguyen, I suppose your country has not been shown in the north as the main aggressor and there has been no war in your country. Blaming America, again, bears witness to his ignorance. Anyway, it is interesting to read a Vietnamese review (of course, it could be invented but I will take it for real), at least the Communist East is a bit open. Regarding the mini series; why do I like it? It does not focus solely on American participation. It was a war that began 15 years before America was involved and the series covers all facets of history, so it's a real plus. The footage used is of first quality. All the programs of the Vietnam War that you are currently viewing use the same footage so you do not miss anything by watching this older series. The date on which this series was made is another advantage. All the main actors interviewed can not now because they are dead, it is a major historical reference. Thirdly, Richard Basehart adds a very distinct narrative voice, his voice is as distinguished as that of James Earl Jones and I think it is a very abrupt eulogy. I do not think we can find a better documentary of war, it's like taking the relatively modern technology of 1980 to transplant it in 1950 and questioning all the generals and politicians on both sides of the Second World War. World. Vietnam War. <br /> <br /> OK, I see a bias, its subtle, a subtle prejudice in the manner of the years 1970-1980, a bit like the NPR, a bias "all that is considered" where everything seems so simple but when you blink, you end up shaking your head. In this case, subsequent episodes do not shed much light on the role of the media and propaganda in general, all useful tools for influencing the outcome of a war, DO NOT THINK THINK ????? <br /> <br /> Twenty years later, a veteran of the OIF lives the same thing.
