A recent reissue of the French detective film (from the original title "Du Rififi Chez les Hommes"), with its famous 20-minute sequence of silent gems, now comes to the United States in a beautiful new print of The Criterion Collection with enhanced subtitles and some extras. Jules Dassin was an American (born Julius Dassin in Middletown, Connecticut) who had been forced to make films in Europe because he was blacklisted. Rififi has been well advertised in the United States and has performed well in art houses. Later, Dassin became much more famous in the United States for "Never on Sunday" (1960) starring his wife, Greek actress and political activist Melina Mercouri. (Greece was once again glamourised and popularized for Americans and others with Anthony Quinn in Mihalis Kakogiannis' 1964 'Zorba the Greek', which was even a huge success in Cairo.) The new Rififi DVD includes a recent interview of Dassin. I did not know before that one of the main thieves, Caesar the Milanese, was played by Dassin, who stepped in when the original actor became unavailable. He is one of the most memorable characters, a dandified Italian cracker who does not speak French. <br /> <br /> Although this classic has all the attributes of the French film noir - the black and white world of well-lit apartments, brilliant black cars, men in suits, nightclub scenes, including a title song Dramatically filmed and illuminated played at the club, stony faces and Gauls in the hand or mouth - I do not think it's as atmospheric or as distinctive a style as Melville's movies do. But there is the hypnotic flight, which is still today a tour de force. It works like clockwork, with a keen sense of craftsmanship and teamwork among thieves. Some curious cops are effectively treated. Things spoil quickly once home and distribute the loot when one of the players becomes sloppy and gives a ring to a lady with a rush of a million dollars. Has there ever been a holdup movie whose minds have lived happily ever after? <br /> <br /> This is the sequence of words without words that guarantees a special place in this place, and Dassin, an American director who has had an unusually varied and exotic career, deserves all the credit he deserves. He took a novel so conventional that he was going to reject it and added some key elements that make it special. In this case, he could not miss the adaptation: he needed too much money. Jean Servais, who plays the main character Tony the Stephanois, was a rather unlucky actor. His dark face is perfect for the role. He was later to play the lead role in Dassin's He Who Must Die Die (1957), which used French actors in Greece for a political narrative. 'Topkapi' is a somewhat disappointing 1964 caper movie (it is pale compared to 'Rififi') which has also been distributed in the United States. There is a good decor, but it is wasteful, fade, brilliant and pretty. Dassin's "Never on Sunday," with his catchy theme song and charismatic heroine, "is the popular choice (and won the best film award at Cannes in 1960); "The one who must die" the political choice; 'Rifified' the choice of genre. A strange piece is his "Phaedra" with Mercouri and Tony Perkins (1962). The purists of the hard Hollywood genre would dismiss these ideas and favor Dassin's first films, including the prison drama "Brute Force" (1947), the detective film "The Naked City" (1948); and two hard cores, "Thieves' Highway" (1949) and "Night and the City" (1950). Personally, I tend to like the fallout of French black and American neo-black better than the original American black source material - hence my persistent fascination with "Rififi". But Dassin is rather unique in that he not only did dark Hollywood, but then traveled to Paris and produced a memorable example of his French derivative of the fifties.
