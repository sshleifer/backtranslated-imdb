The adaptation of Sarah Waters' novel by Andrew Davies was excellent. The characters of Nan and Kitty were superbly described by Rachael Stirling and Kelley Hawes respectively. The whole series was a total joy to watch. This has drawn the imagination of all members of society, whether heterosexual or homosexual. I wish there could be a sequel!
