For the curious, this episode is based on the theme of Pirandello's play, "Six characters in search of an author" and the play by Jean-Paul Sartre, "No exit" (as indicated by the title more obvious), but a Sterling twist. <br /> <br /> Five very different people find themselves in a round room without any idea of ​​who they are, if not the indication of their dress. A bell rings intermittently (perhaps also a hint of Hemmingway?), Increasing the pain of their incarceration. The newcomer to the group, a major, is determined to escape, while the others are resigned to their fate. <br /> <br /> Unlike Pirandello, these characters do not even have a story. They have nothing but the experience of the play in their consciousness, and nobody to write their non-existent story, their position is therefore even more desperate than the characters in Pirandello's play. Unlike Pirandello and Sartre, there is no relationship between the characters and therefore no real conflict between them, although the theme of personal responsibility versus apathy occupies a preponderant place in this story. <br /> <br /> Although it diverges significantly from the authors' scenario mentioned in the title, the themes of Sartre and Pirandello (and many other twentieth century authors) appear with absolute clarity. Clearly, this article addresses the post-modernist perspective in the context of the Cold War period. The focus is also on issues of personal insignificance. <br /> <br /> It's easily one of the best episodes I've seen, and it's still exceptionally relevant to the current experience (as Sartre and Pirandello are). Exactly what makes a good piece of writing a classic.
