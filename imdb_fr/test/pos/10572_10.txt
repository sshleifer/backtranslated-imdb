I watched this movie recently and fell in love with it. I loved the script and the actors. He has a bit of everything. I was completely taken by the unfolding of the story. There are so many surprises along the way. I highly recommend it. In fact, I loved him so much that I ran out and bought the book. I felt that I had to read it in order to appreciate the art behind the film. I also wanted to make sure that nothing in the book escaped me but stayed out of the movie. I recommend to people who like the movie to read the book because there are enough differences in the book, especially in the second episode, to want to read it. It became my favorite movie. I am now a fan of Sarah Waters and Elaine Cassidy !!
