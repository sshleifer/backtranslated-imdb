This has nothing to do with Virtual Encounters 1, so it's not really a sequel. The two videos simply share the general concept of people having simulated sex using a virtual reality machine. So, if you are really impressed by the story and the dialogue in VC 1 (yes, right), and if you wait for a continuation in VC 2, be warned. All the actors and actresses are new, but the same excellent director, Sybil Richards. <br /> <br /> But as in VC 1, you have a lot of beautiful women and a lot of great sex scenes that push Soft Core back about as far as possible. <br /> <br /> If you have VC 1 and you like it, you will like VC 2. If you have neither, but really like the right sex, get both .
