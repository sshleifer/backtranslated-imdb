An intelligent and biting drama came out of nowhere in 1979 and soon made the cover of every newspaper in America (when life imitated the film). A nuclear plant employee in southern California is threatened by his superiors when he decides to publicly disclose the true story of an accident at this plant. The film of a television news group apparently shows that it is an accident of catastrophic proportions - and even worse, the security conditions are removed to save millions of dollars, a concealment that endangers the everyone's life. The film sometimes becomes too technical (especially in the second half) and could use more human interaction, however the performances of Jack Lemmon, Jane Fonda (as a flaky newspaper woman at the right place at the right time), and Michael Douglas ( as an independent cameraman) is superb. The disposable items involving nuclear protesters are both thoroughly accurate and bitterly satirical, and the news biz (with its corporate structure and insipid yes-men) is captured in a vivid manner. *** 1/2 of ****
