Lackawanna Blues is an excellent movie. The cast was perfect. Each actor and actress was perfectly adapted to the role they played. Their chemistry together was amazing. The acting was superb. I felt like I knew the characters. I could almost "feel" them. They reminded me of people I knew in my childhood and who grew up in the 50s and 60s. Oh, memories !! My personal belief is that this film should have been on the big screen so everyone could see it. I have watched this movie so many times that I can almost recite the lines as the characters say them. I can not even list my favorite part because I have LOTS of favorite parts. Thank you for bringing back a part of my youth that I never see today ... and it is that the blacks love each other, watch each other, respect each other, care about each other, can help each other. I have to go now. I have to go watch him again.
