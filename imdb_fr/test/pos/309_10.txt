Of all the movies about the war in Vietnam, it's probably the scariest and the most disturbing. It's really saying a lot of things with so many spectacular movies coming out. He has that weird feeling about it. Everything is so chaotic in the movie that it scares you. It's not like it shows a lot of different things from other Vietnam war movies. What grows to such a high level is: <br /> <br /> The staging was spectacular here. Francis Ford Coppola shows off his talent in his latest epic film. Unlike other administrators, it makes you feel like you're at war. Most others post and show you the horrors of war. However, Coppola makes you confused, shocked and scared. These feelings of war are usually told to us from a movie or story. It's something that I have only very little experience watching a movie. The writing was of course amazing too. This led you to write in the middle of the film. It never made me bored and this film lasts three hours. Cinematography goes hand in hand with achievement, which adds a lot to the monstrous experience of watching this film that shows all the chaos around you, even when everything seems calm. <br /> <br /> The acting was terrifying. Just look at Marlon Brando who also gives his last big performance playing with an illusory and disconcerted colonel. When I think of a mad soldier, I think of Marlon Brando in Apocalpyse Now. With Brando n this movie, you do not want to look in his eyes. Like the movie, he was weird. For me, this performance is as memorable as the one he gave in The Godfather. Martin Sheen gave a very deep performance and probably the best of his career, allowing you to see everything through his eyes, all the madness he experiences while wanting him to reach his goal. It's just amazing that these two people were not nominated for the Oscars. Robert Duvall was able to show some of this madness with his ridiculous battle strategies, among those who play music to tell the enemy he's coming. In addition, Duvall's character asking one of the soldiers to ride in the middle of a battle was shocking but believable. Laurence Fishburne, Sam Bottoms and Frederic Forest, who all summarized the attitude of many soldiers of the time at the time, did not become a clich√©. For once, the cameos were well used by Dennis Hopper and Harrison Ford whom I love both. <br /> <br /> I would definitely recommend people to watch this movie. There is a message and everyone involved in its creation is at its best. I could not ask anything more for this film with its acting, its director, its writing, its cinematography and its great end. Look and you'll see why he lives up to his Apocalpyse Now title.
