The best screen performance of George C. Scott. Chayefsky's script, the ironic dialogue, is almost perfect ("Where do you train your nurses, Dachau?"). Rigg is wonderful as a savior angel who saves Scott from fate, just like casting. It's a hilarious and serious film. It's a film from the 60s, but it's never dated. The chaos and irrationality of the system in relation to the mental health of the individual are timeless. And the monologue "We do not heal, we heal nothing" (delivered, shouted, no one but Scott could) with his references to cloning and other "wonders" of modern science could literally have been written this morning. > <br />
