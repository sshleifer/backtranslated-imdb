One of my favorite Hartley movies. (As if there could be a "bad" one.) Although it may be a little more religious than we normally expected. Nevertheless, he still maintains that Hartley inclination to which we are all accustomed. <br /> <br /> First image Jesus and Satan discussing their ideas, opinions, hopes and regrets about the imminent end of civilization. Now imagine that the conversation takes place over a few drinks in the bar of your neighborhood. And as a conversational (not to say visual) distraction, let's add PJ Harvey as a sensual companion (alias Magdelena) to Mr. Chist. Then, just for the smiles, in the background, an ever-present Salvation Army orchestra (played by Yo La Tengo) that will serve as additional entertainment. The path of moral justification has never been such a pleasure. <br /> <br /> It is quite possible that the number of questions asked exceeds the answers, but that is where the pleasure lies. And Mr. Donovan is as always brilliant.
