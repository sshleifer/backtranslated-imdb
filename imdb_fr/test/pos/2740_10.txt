My father had this film in 8 mm. I loved it when he took out the projector, glued a leaf to the wall and played Gerald McBoing Boing. The thought of a child communicating through sounds fascinated me. <br /> <br /> Nine years ago, my son was diagnosed with autism. The doctors asked me about my son, such as "How does he communicate with you?" I would say, "Have you ever seen the cartoon, Gerald McBoing Boing?" I would love to have a copy of this caricature to show my son and his educators that my son sees that he is a world. <br /> <br /> Recently, I spoke to a digital transfer specialist who listed most 8mm personal movies. does not contain sound until the mid-1970s. I guess I was very lucky to have had Gerald McBoing Boing's images and sounds in 1972.
