A jewel of a British comedy. Poor American colony Pinky Green (Richard Jordan, playing another nasty but adorable one this time) comes out of a British prison and tries to get it right, but his job as a maintenance worker in a bank is too attractive for his never-reformed criminal friends, led by a very nasty Ivan (David Niven in one of his last roles). Pinky resists, but the lure of all this money is too much for him. Things fall apart and come back and it's all joyful to watch. Jordan had to play 20 villains in his career, but he never played the same two times - this one is too kind to be hated. Niven never played a slick villain, oil everywhere. We lost two good actors that I would like to have back.
