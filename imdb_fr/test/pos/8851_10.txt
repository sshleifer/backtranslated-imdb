People who have an aversion to gore can find some difficult scenes, but The Thing is far from a classic horror. The fact that the extraordinary special effects stand against most modern images is only a small part of the reason why this film is finally rightly considered a masterpiece. Technically brilliant in his camera work and editing, superbly scripted and interpreted, one of the best openings, one of the best endings, tension and paranoia persisted throughout (with countless views), an excellent soundtrack, and open to multiple readings and analogies, there are simply not enough superlatives to make this movie justice. Absolutely essential look.
