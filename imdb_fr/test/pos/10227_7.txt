It's a horror story though. But maybe not as you know. The real monsters of this movie are humans. While monsters, are humans and prey. As strange as it sounds, I see this as "Monsters Inc" for horror movie fans. <br /> <br /> Of course, the effects are those of a standard horror movie, the monsters are there as in any movie based gore is there too, there is even a slasher in the form of Dr. Decker (played by David Cronenberg, I see a flash of Cillian Murphy like Dr. Jonathan Crane in Batman Begins here - or is it the other way around?). And it's Decker & c who are the bad guys. Monsters especially want to take care of their own affairs, avoiding intrusive humans more or less misplaced, wanting to be part of society. <br /> <br /> At the end of the movie, you will really love the little monsters (and the dog) - maybe not what you expected from the first scenes ...
