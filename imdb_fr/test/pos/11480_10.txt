I consider this film as a complete masterpiece. In fact, I consider it to be Fernando Fragata's best work and without a doubt the best of all Portuguese films. I do not think you can find a film as "budget zero" as impressive and as amazing as this one. <br /> <br /> The staging is done perfectly at an incredibly fast pace and the music is also composed by Fragata is especially excellent. The story is both frightening and humorous, and it is certainly an advanced study of the old adage that says "Misery loves company", a kind of situation interspersed with a bewildering mystery. A recipe more than perfect to stick the eyes of the spectators on the screen of the first to the last frame. <br /> <br /> It's called Neo-Hitchcock, and I agree. Like the best Hitchcock, it made me guess throughout the movie and most of my assumptions were far from what we ended up revealing intelligently.
