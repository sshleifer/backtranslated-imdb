Having just seen this with my mother (who had it for Christmas), I was thrilled to find something different from the things I'm used to watching. All the stories were detailed and you are able to feel a strong emotion towards each character from the beginning. Each scenario is followed brilliantly, making you feel completely different things for each character. The cast is amazing, my favorites being James Read and Lesley-Anne Down, George Hazard and Madeline Fabray / LaMotte / Main. Everything is deep and wonderful, making visualization very compelling, I recommend it to almost everyone.
