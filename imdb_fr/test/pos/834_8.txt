Well, it's a good movie. However, you must admit that Van Dame's films have not been so good lately. On the other hand, if you are a fan of Van Dame, you should look at this because there is a huge improvement with the fight scenes. Also what I really liked is the beautiful music music. I'm sure it will kill time if you're a fan of action. As for Isaac Florentine, the director of Undisputed 2, I do not think he did a good job as he did with Undisputed. Maybe one day :). <br /> <br /> In the end, it's worth watching if you do not have other action movies to watch, it could make your hour and a half fun.
