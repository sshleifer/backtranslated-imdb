I was very impressed by Martha's story and its impact on the public's emotions and the impact it had on the family. The front-rear movement of the plot was well done and normally I do not appreciate movies with flash-back / flash-forward effects. Throughout the evolution of the film, I felt that "Tommy surely did." This gives you a glimpse of how these people lived their lives almost completely without each other and the consequences of not having the desire to answer the question "It is 10 am Do you know where your children are?" And besides, "What the hell are they doing?" !! Or "Do I care?" !! The rich and spoiled kids get away with the murder. Or so they thought .......
