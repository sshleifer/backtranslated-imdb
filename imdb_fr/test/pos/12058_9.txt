Certainly not a good show, but better than most other sitcoms right now. This is reminiscent of shows such as Married With Children and Roseanne who visit places that are not usually treated in sitcoms. It's sometimes funny even if you skip the laughs, but not hilarious. <br /> <br /> Some of the characters are pretty funny (the gay friend) and some of the drop-ins. This is also one of the few series where the character monologue (sorry for the spelling depicted) is really effective and fun. <br /> <br /> Is this an All in the Family or Seinfeld show? Absolutely not. However, it's certainly better than a show like 'Til Deat (probably the worst TV show of all types right now). <br /> <br /> Oh, the mother is not too mean and Hilary's character is a little hottie.
