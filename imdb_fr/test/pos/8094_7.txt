Written, produced and directed by Charlie Chaplin, this is the anti-Nazi propaganda of the great actor, who embraces Adolf Hitler. <br /> <br /> Chaplin plays Adenoid Hynckel, the dictator of Tomania, as well as a Jewish hairdresser Image spitting out of Hynckel. His parody of Hitler is brilliant. Anyone who has ever seen Hitler's current movies will recognize the strange resemblance of caricature. <br /> <br /> I thought the film started slowly with a typical Chaplin slap-stick that focused on the adventures of the Jewish barber during the First World War. Having never seen this before, I must admit that after the first 20 minutes or so, I wondered what was all this fuss. But the film quickly picks up speed. There are very entertaining moments and enough emphasis on the anti-Jewish nature of "hynckel-ism" to get the propaganda message across. The highlight of the film is a brilliant anti-Nazi speech by Chaplin at the end of the film. <br /> <br /> Even though Chaplin is in this movie, I thought it was stolen by Jack Oakie, playing the dictator of "Bacteria" - "Benzino Napaloni". Our first look at Oakie shows how well he had studied his subject - he had the arrogant posture of Mussolini. The scenes in which Hynckel and Napaloni negotiate on the fate of Osterlich scared me. <br /> <br /> It was a very good film, which deserves to be watched.
