bottom to its highest absolute perfection. who always said that comedy slap stick was dead and boring completely wrong. not that this film will please only those who are male in nature. It's another British-quality black comedy with a lot of jokes not related to violence, but it helps if you can let your senses go and laugh at the sheer stupidity of it all. <br /> <br /> it's a real success story British ingenuity and local talent pay tribute to them. at the performance level, it reminds me a lot of the early works of the marx brothers where the same level of enthusiasm and devotion are present in their playing styles, resulting in a performance where the audience can really engage in the innate desire of see others suffer, still to be detached and always feel safe, much like the principle of many TV chats are working. a truly wonderful manipulation that allows all parties to feel better.
