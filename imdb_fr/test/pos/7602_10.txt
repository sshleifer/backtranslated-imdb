I thought this movie was great, not only because of his screenplay, but also because he was very well portrayed by the excellent casting. I read that Drew Barrymore was not exceptional as Josie Geller because she is beautiful. Yes, she may have played in the film she played outside of herself, which led an ordinary girl to look who she is in the world. The story is sweet and certainly for the hopeless romantics out there, I'm for sure. David Arquette is crazy like his brother Rob and Michael Vartan is gorgeous like Sam Coulson. Leelee Sobieski did a great job as his friend Aldys, someone who was not afraid to be herself. I think this movie should have more credit than being considered a "teeny boppy" movie
