The genius Stephen Sondheim has never been more visible than in his "Thriller Musical" of 1979, SWEENEY TODD, a gothic, bloody, but also delicious musical mix, about a crazy barber who returns to London to take revenge for bad judge. who not only had definitively exiled him from London, but also raised his daughter and planned to marry her to "protect her from all the evils of the world". The barber finds the love, the sympathy and the help of a lone pastry owner who has his own agenda for Todd. This music rocked Broadway and won nine Tony Awards, including best music and best actress in a musical (Angela Lansbury). The production was filmed entirely in 1982 with Angela Lansbury reproducing her Broadway role as Mrs. Lovett, the owner of the daffy pastry shop, who finds a practical use for the heads that Todd makes mincemeat. George Hearn, who replaced Len Cariou on Broadway, is electrifying in the title role, so much so that one has to wonder why he was not chosen for the role. Lansbury and Hearn are captivating from start to finish and are 100% committed to their macabre characters helped by a first-rate Sondaheim score, probably the closest thing Sondheim has written for an opera. Lansbury shines on "The worst pies in London" and "At the seaside". George Hearn stops the series with "Epiphany" and is also convincing at "Pretty Women", a duet he sings with Judge Turpin, the man he swore revenge on. Cris Groendahl is vocally impressive as Antony, the young navigator who saves Todd and falls in love with his daughter Johanna. Betsy Joselyn is a little exaggerated as Johanna and really pushes that during "Green Funch and Linnet Bird" she really pushes her voice for a few moments. The rest of the cast is first class, especially Edmund Lyndeck in the role of Judge Turpin, who plays "Johanna" in this production, which was cut from the original production, and Ken Jennings in the role of Toby, whose superb tenor occupies the auditorium in "Not While I'm around." But it's a breathtaking score by Stephen Sondheim and the mesmerizing performance of Lansbury and in particular George Hearn's making this gothic musical theater evening a experience that stays with you long after the curtain call. Not for all tastes, but if you are a player and have a strong heart, SWEENEY TODD is a joy for all lovers of musical theater and a must for fans of Stephen Sondheim and Angela Lansbury.
