If done right, no shit CGI. Has anyone else ever done the "Jumping Crocs" tour of Adelaide's Darwin River? Black Water was realistic WAY. Snape was a bit crazy. <br /> <br /> I thought the blonde girl was excellent, I had not seen her before. And the other chick is a baby, she is always excellent. <br /> <br /> V. Suspenseful - I would compare that to Jaws compared to any other man who eats an animal movie. <br /> <br /> Got the Australian hole pat pat without going without OTT with struths and crikeys, as well. <br /> <br /> I loved it!
