David Attenborough brings his fascination for wildlife, this time the creatures under the sea, in this extraordinary journey of 8 episodes to all animals under the sea! <br /> <br /> The cinematography is stunning, bringing truly breathtaking images of these whales! But the best thing about this, as well as seeing each episode, is the way they did it! Whether it's making models of creatures or photographing whales, they tell you in about 10 minutes how they did it! <br /> <br /> 2001 had some great TV shows on our screen. But unlike this documentary gem, they make them rather lame! But even presenting this documentary series as the best television series of 2001 does not simply summarize the brilliance that this series provides for quality entertainment! <br /> <br /> Overall, it's the best TV series of 2001, with no competition, and perhaps the best television series of the 2000s!
