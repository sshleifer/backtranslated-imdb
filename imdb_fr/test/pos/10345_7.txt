Nynke is a film shot in the same style as the Oscar-winning character, Character (1997). But this comparison immediately pushes me to add that the latter was much more exciting ... <br /> <br /> Of course, Nynke is a beautiful historical and costumed drama (with a fantastic interpretation of Monic Hendrickx!) In which growth of 'Nynke van Hichtum' in his marriage to Pieter Jelles Troelstra. The subtitle of this film is "a love story". It starts then and ends with their marriage. <br /> <br /> But that's where the director makes a crucial mistake! The exciting and independent life of Nynke began at the end of the marriage. She has written several children's books and traveled around the world. What a beautiful life she lived. But Pieter Verhoeff shelters Nynke from the conventions that depressed her and in which she struggled: to think that her life was only prolonging her marriage with Troelstra, being none other than the mother of their children. /> Let's all hope for Nynke II!
