I have always loved Sean Connery, but as a James Bond I have always favored Roger Moore. Still, it's still Connery who established the Bond standard and established himself in 1983 as an entity other than James Bond, but the money would have to be irresistible to make another appearance in 007 and save the world from perverse plans of Spectrum. <br /> <br /> And what are their designs in Never Never Never Again. SPECTER, with the help of a foolish young officer, a member of the Air Force, is the brother of Kim Bassinger who stole two nuclear missiles during a wargaming exercise. Now, SPECTER led by Blofeld and played by Max Von Sydow threatens the blackmail of the world. <Br /> <br /> Von Sydow's operations manager, Klaus Maria Brandauer, is also courting Bassinger and is a bit crazy. And he has a murderer who works for him at Barbara Carrera's and makes Angelina Jolie look like Nora Croft to Mrs. Butterworth. <br /> <br /> But before Sean Connery can begin, he has to face a new 'run things at British Intelligence'. Edward Fox thinks that Connery is outmoded in his methods and is costing British taxpayers too much with his violent methods. I really enjoyed Fox's performance, he's like Colonel Blimp's great-grandson. <br /> <br /> I also liked Carrera, she is something to look at and her methods are very ingenious. When she goes scuba diving with Connery in the Bahamas, notice how she puts Mr. Shark on the 007 affair. <br /> <br /> Will Connery do James Bond again? He was widely quoted as saying who would put him on the scene at that time, Roger Moore's father? But I think Connery would still be great in a wheelchair.
