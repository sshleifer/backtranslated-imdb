Charles Chaplin's 'Shoulder Arms' in 1918 is his longest film to date, although it is not quite a feature film, just over 45 minutes long. As the First World War drew to a close, many popular artists of the day did their part to inspire their native troops and Chaplin was no exception. And so the amiable Tramp went to war! The film begins with Tramp training, and the character is hilarious unable to attend the simplest military exercises, including walking and gun attacks, much to the chagrin of the drill sergeant. The tramp then finds himself in the trenches, facing a more formidable enemy, even if the Germans end up being infinitely more incompetent than himself. The tumult of the moment when the tramp declared that he had captured thirteen German soldiers "by surrounding them" had put me on the back burner. <br /> <br /> There are many other great moments in this film. Chaplin waking up to find his barracks asleep underwater and being unable to find his own feet is hilarious, as is his ingenious use of a record player tube to sleep under the surface. <br /> <br /> The memorable scenes of the film undoubtedly imply Chaplin sneaking behind enemy lines disguised as a tree. The reactions of the beleaguered German soldiers, unconsciously a few meters away from a sworn enemy, are particularly amusing, especially when a soldier catches an ax in order to cut a tree for firewood. <br /> <br /> This is a very enjoyable film, and one of Chaplin's best efforts before 1920. Highly recommended.
