The comedies of the 80s (especially those with John Cusak) are great. Almost all are classic and instant and this film is no exception. Many nods to other movies (Godzilla and Jaws, for example) are so spectacular that you will laugh for hours. Some may complain that the movie is a little cheesy sometimes but it was the 80s and things were always a little tacky. Add a young Demi Moore and a Bob Cat even stronger, and you will especially enjoy your fans. If you have not seen this, you'd better soon !!!!!!
