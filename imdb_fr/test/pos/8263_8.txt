In the early 19th century, a young woman with a harelip disagrees with the ambition of her family and the superstitions of the local community, but meets a man who can see her differently and can change Pru's life forever. <br /> <br /> Precious Bane is an adaptation by the British Broadcasting Corporation of Mary Webb's acclaimed novel. This is a beautifully filmed and played piece with an incredibly high level of quality, the scenario {Maggie Wadey's scenario} is excellent, and the detail of the time and the use of the dialect are unparalleled. It's a shame that this movie has not yet released on DVD. One would have thought that with Clive Owen {awesome here while Gideon} became a star, the BBC would broadcast it, but unfortunately no, the only way to catch is in the very rare occasions that TCM shows it. Janet McTeer's main performance as Pru Sarn is simply brilliant, courage and sincere emotion go hand in hand when McTeer gives her everything. Pru must not only fight against the disfigurement of his face, but also against the insidious and constant suffering of ignorant villagers. This is a time when people thought that if a hare presented itself to a pregnant woman, it was a misfortune, a time of attack for bulls, a time of superstitions and discussions about witches. Despite constant setbacks, Pru is strong and resourceful, even his own family reverses his dreams without realizing it, but this road may be terribly bumpy, but hope is eternal and Pru hopes plenty. <Br /> <br /> 8.5 / 10
