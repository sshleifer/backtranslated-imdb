The masterpiece of Visconti! I admit that I do not know much about his work, but I can not imagine that his other work goes beyond this fabulous film. Last night, I watched Death in Venice after an absence of about 25 years and was totally captivated by everything I saw. This captivation was a pastiche composed of many elements: The extraordinary plans made by Visconte, mainly his love for the long languorous plans of people who dined, swam, walked and contained an important personage crossing this mass of people; the brilliant interpretation by the filmmakers of Visconti's selection of shots; act according to the principles without dialogue and without transmitting the complexity of the scene through facial features only. <br /> <br /> It is true that young people watching this film for the first time should be aware that they are watching a single film. film, a film that could not be shot in 2006. A film whose time lies in these brief years in the sixties and early seventies of the last century, when the artistic license was passed to filmmakers and that men of money assumed secondary roles. As many recent commentators of IMDb have written, this film is long, boring (insufficient action) and pretentious. I guess, by the standards of the Hollywood dad, these comments are based. Unfortunately, they tragically downplay the incredible beauty and depth of this and other works of this kind. <br /> <br /> Please, if you have not seen Death in Venice, rent a copy and immerse yourself in a movie and a story. from another time. You will be rewarded
