I have not seen this movie since 1979, when I was a teenager. I grew up with the muppets of Sesame Street and then realized the effort and time needed to bring these characters to life. Jim Hensen was a genius and a master muppettist. When I watched this movie the other day, it brought me back in time when I was younger and things seemed so much simpler. For this little trip back in time, I give a score of 10 to this film. <br /> <br /> The plot explains how Kermit goes from the swamp to Hollywood. Laughter and gags are a classic muppetism. I'm glad these films are still there for the next generation. I hope I will never cultivate the magic of muppets.
