I probably liked a little more than Terror by Night but not enough to give it extra *. The beginning is simply brilliant, as we take a closer look at the Nazi agents seeking to get their hands on a new bombshell and its inventor in a small Swiss village, to be countered by a disguised Holmes who brings the scientist back to London. Once there, he does everything in his power to prevent the scientist from falling into the hands of the man behind all this - not Hitler, but worse: Holmes's arch-nemesis, Moriarty. Of course, the scientist disappears, leaving a tempting code note, and Holmes goes after him, again disguised. The climax of Moriarty's hideout is exciting, and we can all guess that everything is coming to an end, is not it? A patriotic message slightly exaggerated at the time of the credits. Now that I think about it, the good sense of place in spite of the obvious decorations, the disguise of Rathbone and the way in which so much of a plot is going on in a little over an hour - what more does that give? * of the 5 Rathbone / Bruce films I have seen so far. <br /> <br /> Watched on DVD, part of Mill Creek Entertainment's "50 Mystery Classics" set. Most of the transfers on these el cheapo packs are of very poor quality, but Holmes fans note that the Rathbone / Bruce films (there are 4 on this game) are all quite watchable and reasonably clean.
