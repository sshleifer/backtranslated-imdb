Now, ladies, I loved this movie, but not as much as the Farewell to the King, another beloved epic of John Milius. It was fun, a lot more than if it was based on a Tennessee Williams drama. It is an excellent thread, with a whiff of political correctness. I love this film for its beautiful photography, its humor and its attenuated criticism of the Bad Guys (Berbers) and REAL Bad Guys, carriers of the harness of the "civilized" world, with their rifles, their artillery and their big gunboats there In the harbour. <br /> <br /> The scene that stands out is that of the Berber camp with the blue-gray smoke of the kitchen fires that rise in the cold and desert desert air. He is visually eloquent and highly evocative. <br /> <br /> Established in 1904 in Morocco, WIND staged a defenseless American (Candace Bergen) hijacked by a dashing, though shameless, Berber bandit (Sean Connery). model of a Scottish Muslim nomad). The exciting story is based on some historical facts. The photography is of fine quality Milius, punctuated by the exceptional score of Jerry Goldsmith. <br /> <br /> Mrs. Pedicaris and the Raisuli perform prolonged preliminaries and sway in the desert between oases. Even though the Raisuli proudly traces his lineage to the monkeys, he is a perfect gentleman - he even lets her keep her head after beating him in chess! A Navy detachment storms the Bashaw Palace, extinguishing competing hegemonies with gasoline. Do not mess with the body, Abdul. <br /> <br /> There are many funny stereotypes: <br /> <br /> Naughty Sultan - looks like a dissipated ferret. He is certainly not a Liberal. <br /> <br /> A cruel German officer - a big belligerent dachshund sporting a monocle. He gallantly chooses to fight the Raisuli with swords instead of slaughtering him like Indiana Jones. Nobility forces, through Von Clausewitz? <br /> <br /> A dashing sea officer - lays the foundation for Bashaw's army of Tangiers and storms his palace by chewing tobacco. His speech is slightly aphasic. The Bashaw begged him not to breathe it. <br /> <br /> The Berbers - a horde of creepy sycophants led by a charming megalomaniac. None of them take a bath, except perhaps in the urine of a camel. <br /> <br /> President Teddy Roosevelt is improperly portrayed as an empty person concerned about firearms, toys and teddy bears. <br /> <br /> Beautiful American widow - gives men a lesson in courage, as her two children do. Obviously, she has a huge supply of clean, starched clothes and rarely has a bad hair in her place. <br /> <br /> The Raisuli sends a message to Teddy Roosevelt, thanking him for the gift of a Remington rifle, declaring: <br /> <br /> "MEESTER ROOSEVELT, YOU ARE THE LION AND AIEE AM WIND. "<br /> <br /> How true. <br /> <br /> Do not take my harsh remarks to say that I did not like the movie. I had almost as much fun writing this as watching Pitcher.
