One of the most amusing of all silent comedies is Pudovkin's short 'Chess Fever', a crazy story about how a rigorously intellectual board game could disrupt even the most carefully planned central economies. A comic subject as unpromising as chess has found an outlet earlier in this enchanting short film. Two young men play the game seriously against an artificial background, a painted decoration. This contrasts with previous Lumiere shorts such as "Arrosseur Arrosse" or "Baby Meal", in which human activity was deliberately framed by a natural setting. The difference in activities (natural = feeding the baby, watering the garden, artificial = failures) may be important. <br /> <br /> The main contrast of this film is between this motionless background and the serene and serene chess game, and the ferocious passions that it causes, as accusations of cheating lead to a most unworthy scrum. The intellectual game becomes a pure physical tear, just as the pretensions of the artistic filmmakers are forever weakened by the "more raw" demands of the public. <br /> <br /> What's more fun in the movie is not necessarily this descent to the devil. but the way it is filmed goes on long after the first joke has been made; how the camera refuses to give full attention to the fight, focusing instead on filming, while we see trembling feet and dislodged clothes. The refusal to edit the film is daring, so that the humor seems to come from something other than combat, reflecting our need for physical contact with intellectual stimulation, our reluctance to let go. <br /> What is particularly interesting The outcome is brilliant, because these valets of the upper class are caught by the jack who picks them up like two schoolboys astray, as if he was about to break his head. If we can not expect teachers to keep their place with decorum, someone will have to do it for them.
