While playing in this film, it is sometimes difficult to NOT imagine that the actors are what they claim to be. Unbridled passion and play sometimes make it a very enjoyable and engaging film. I would not have known except HBO late at night. And the main reason I like British movies much better than American movies is that actors are not afraid to play what is needed.
