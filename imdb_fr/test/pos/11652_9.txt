Tim Robbins makes a wonderful movie. His wife (susan sarandon) gives a wonderful performance as a sister Helen Perjean who wants to help Mattew Poncelet (Sean Penn), accused of murder and who will also die from an injection ... 120 minutes of actor and touch scenes enamelled what you get. A good acting and it's a sobering film! <br /> <br /> Susan Sarandon deserves the Oscar for best actress of 1995. It's probably one of her greatest movies. <br /> <br /> I did not see "The Cradle Will Rock", but I have to see more Robbins movies. <br /> <br /> Note: 9/10 or *** 1/2 of 4. Go see .....
