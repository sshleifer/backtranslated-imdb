This film recreates Lindbergh's historic flight across the Atlantic while conjuring episodes of his aviation career through flashbacks. Stewart was about 20 years old too old to play the young driver, but his great performance, especially in the solo flight sequences, makes it a minor puzzle. Waxman's exciting score is a big plus. Despite the long duration, Wilder manages to make the film exciting and to support the drama even if the result is known. In 1957, Wilder realized in addition: "Love in the afternoon" and "Witness of the Prosecution". And his next two were "Some Like It Hot" and "The Apartment". What a race!
