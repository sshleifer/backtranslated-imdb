Who would have thought that a non-disabled actor could act as realistically and powerfully as a disabled person in a movie? Probably someone. But no one, really nobody, has ever been able to compare their expectations with the surprisingly emotional and powerful performance of the two actors in this film. <br /> <br /> Michael (Steven Robertson) lives in a home for the disabled. people. He has Cerebral Paulsy and, as we have shown from the beginning, he has great difficulty communicating. It is therefore vital that Rory (James McAvoy), a disabled member, who speaks normally, understands it. Thus begins a friendship which rests mainly on (ironically enough) a communication. <br /> <br /> In a hilarious scene, they manage to leave their homes. After Rory's rejection, Michael, a man of heart, applied for immigration to his own home. Rory, who already had a bad reputation with the "judges", had to be his interpreter. <br /> <br /> But trouble comes quickly. They begin to stalk a girl they met in a pub some time ago, wanting her to be their assistant to do the little things that matter. She is initially reluctant; she does not know these men, but it seems that they might be harmless; then start another friendship, but not necessarily a good friendship ... <br /> <br /> In addition to being poignant, this film is really about the actors. But that's not a bad thing. For a non-disabled actor, you see Rory, although he can communicate properly, frustrated with the way he is completely dependent on others and who has no real life. But the real star for me is Steven Robertson. He acts with such emotion, aspiring to fit in and sadness / happiness, which really sees him winning the whole movie. <br /> <br /> Excellent. <br /> <br /> Overall: 5 out of 5
