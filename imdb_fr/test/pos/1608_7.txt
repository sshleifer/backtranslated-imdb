In Luchino Visconti's film Death in Venice, it is not only the beauty of the surrounding world that breaks down, but in search of beauty itself, Gustav von Aschenbach breaks down into a simple human shell. To understand decay, we must recognize the beauty that enchants us, it is best described and explained in a quote from Socrates found in Thomas Mann's version of Death in Venice, "Beauty alone, is both pretty and visible? " the only aspect of the spiritual that we can perceive through our senses? Otherwise what? if the divine, if reason and virtue and truth were to speak to us through the senses? Should not we perish and be consumed by love? "We see in the film that this happens, the man is wrapped in a desire for beauty that turns into a desire for the boy, Tadzio.Although the quiet part of his mind tells him that the adoration of beauty can lead to sensuality and abandonment, it can not contain itself. <br /> <br /> It would be easy to describe it as a beautiful film From the beginning we see the extravagance of the parlor and we let's see a perfect summary of the life of the upper classes at the turn of the century, all perfectly captured by Pasqualino De Santis, director of photography, but Visconti does not bend to the picturesque aspects of Venice. Glorious and sensual artistic achievements of the past are based on materialism and sensual beauty, and these things are relegated to the past.The city we know as being of incomparable beauty and uniqueness is nothing more than a place of leisure rs endowed with a curious staff. The streets become exhausting labyrinths filled with disgusting filth and rot, the city disintegrates at the same rate as the protagonist. It is only through the backslides that we have been able to understand why this famous composer is a fragile and harmless man. The death of his daughter, and probably his wife, as well as the failure of his music allow us to understand why he is destroying himself. <br /> <br /> Alfred, with whom Aschenbach discusses in depth the meaning of beauty and who can create it; but Alfred is more than a friend, he is Aschenbach's alter-ego and what Alfred says expresses the doubts and fears of the composer. The scene in which Aschenbach decides to leave Venice is immediately followed by a clip of Alfred indicating that he is weak, alienated and lacks feelings. In the end, we might conclude that these backtracking is not a reality at all. It is a degradation of memory, rather than objective renderings of the past, these flashbacks become distorted memories. We can say that they are decomposed memories, for even Aschenbach alludes to it, he declares, "reality distracts us and degrades us"; and, after the scene in the travel agent's office, we see Aschenbach confront Tadzio and his family and warn them - leave Venice, but immediately after the meeting, we see him again sitting with the clerk and realize that everything was in his imagination he uses it for a long time. scenes without dialogue framed by the poignant music of Gustav Mahler. He lets the viewer's mind wander as we observe Aschenbach's life and its respectability in decay with the beauty that surrounds it. <br /> <br /> Slowly, the viewer realizes that our hero is overwhelmed by exhaustion, mixed with growing awareness that the city is suffocating. The city in ruins opens the way to the attraction of Tadzio for men of a certain age. It's a romantic desire for something as idealized and ambiguous that it can never be consumed, even in a fantasy world. The beauty of this Polish boy lights a fire that makes him shine at first, then consumes him. The film ends as von Aschenbach sits on a beach chair and dimly watches Tadzio fight with his friend. We see the black dye of his hair running down his cheek and he looks like rotten blood. before his last breath. The final decay has arrived, all around him, the city is dirty and with it, he has become what he hates. At Aschenbach's death, he has the same painted face as the old man on the ferry at the beginning of the movie, a man who had bothered him. It was the pursuit of beauty that brought about its decline, but in the pursuit of artistic beauty, he could not feel his own vanishing or that of the city that surrounded him; his sensuality is seduced, while being constantly under control by the presence of death and decay. It is these three themes that link Damned and Death in Venice, beauty, death and decline, these themes are the art of Visconti, the beauty of his work lies in the decline of beauty itself. <br /> <br /> In this film, we witness the decay of a great man. We see the honored composer Gustav von Aschenbach in search of true and pure beauty, and it is in pursuit of this trait that he disintegrates and leads him to a miserable death and lonely looking at the target of his affection. I believe that through these films, Visconti tries to tell us that what is beautiful can not last. Decomposition is intrinsic to the world around us, and when we are distracted, it can destroy splendor. In Death in Venice, it is because of culture and the search for beauty that everything is removed. The beauty and the deliquescence are woven like thorns in Visconti's works, both beautiful and destructive, it is these themes that define his art.
