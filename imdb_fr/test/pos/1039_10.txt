... a real geek-girl dream: high tech, high drama, smart guys, hot sex and big explosions. (VERY big explosions.) Sam Waterston is so natural in the role of Oppenheimer that the recordings of TRUE Oppenheimer seem strange: apparently, he had a voice similar to that of Ronald Reagan! The triumph and tragedy of Oppenheimer is one of the most moving dramas of the twentieth century. This film is a model of what should be the docu-drama: the facts are allowed to speak for themselves, the fictitious parts are filling the record, do not draw attention to themselves. Interestingly, some of the technical details used were declassified only recently and are therefore of particular interest. A must see!
