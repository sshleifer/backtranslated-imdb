I will not bore you with stories and intrigues because they have already been featured on this page several times, so ?? I have not seen such a movie for a long time. Beautiful, elegant and sober, with a narrative rhythm at the height. A film with a sensitivity and discrete qualities that is rare in these times of scheming plots. The beautifully attenuated photograph, saturated with rich and luxurious colors, and lack of more precise words, each frame is filled with an air of tension. The sets and locations are used repeatedly, but the film manages to bring them back to life each time they are presented. There always seems to be an essential accessory, a light or a play to lightly indicate to the audience where we are in the characters. world. <br /> <br /> The acting game reminds me of the "bicycle thief", not the style, but the fact that you forget that you are watching two actors involved in their art. There is a meaning behind every gesture and almost every movement has assigned a meaning to explain the inner world of the characters, the relationship, the feelings and the situation of the two lovers. The dialogues are sparse, but like the rest of the film, they are imbued with meaning. Speaking of meaning, the soundtrack is contagious. Used here, it becomes a storytelling device. And although the film is of Chinese origin, even a song sung in Spanish by Nat King Cole gives it a subtle meaning. The orchestrated soundtrack is repetitive, but repetition is what makes it comfortable. It is used in conjunction with the story, and not just as a means of setting to music, to invite the audience to feel somehow at a certain point of the plot. <br /> <br /> I would not recommend this movie. I'm afraid most people will not be jaded by the quietness of the story, but I would recommend it to someone looking for an alternative to the romantic schlock that fills the multiplexes on our side of the world. I must say that I am completely taken by this movie and I kept watching it night after night. The story takes time to present itself and allows repeated viewing because very few films of this kind are open to such a broad interpretation. A very beautiful film.
