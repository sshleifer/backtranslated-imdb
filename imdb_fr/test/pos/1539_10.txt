This film hits the heart with a reality like no other I've seen. It shows what we take for granted in a democratic society and what we are fortunate not to experience. The game in the movie is superb, sometimes you have to remember that the movie is a dramatization, and not real life. Mr. Rickman does wonders with his role (as he does with all roles) making the interrogator fully dimensional and human. The whole is incredible. This gives a sense of theater "in circles". This does not add to or dissipate the emotion of the action. This film seeks to open the eyes of the viewer, and I would say they have achieved this goal. .
