I have just seen this movie again, I believe for the sixth time. I will probably see him much more often. It's one of the most brilliant French films ever made. Even if the film is mysterious, what happened to the writer and director Gilles Mimouni is even more mysterious. For ten years, he has not shot a movie and it's the only one. The story and execution of this ingenious film are perfect and clearly pays tribute to Hitchcock and Buster Keaton. The timing in a fraction of a second of the movements is just as meticulously controlled as the scene where the side of a house falls on Keaton in Steamboat Bill Junior, and it is not only killed by centimeters. In this film, people bend over, torment each other and cross each other unexpectedly, and if they stayed for a second, they would have crashed. The scenario thus traverses the tightrope of random events to a degree that you can not leave the eyes of your screen even for a millisecond, otherwise you will miss a crucial element. Peter Chase's haunting, though intentionally repetitive, music is reminiscent of Hitchcock's "Vertigo," and the entire film has the same disturbing quality, but while Hitchcock had a wife for two women, Mimouni has two wives for a woman, reversing thus the structure of the plot. There are transient references to other Hitchcock films, but it is "Vertigo" that is at the heart of this film's inspiration. The theme may seem superficially to be an obsessive love, but the film really speaks of the magic of the daily hazards, the invisible threads behind the tapestry, the ineffable. Everything is hyper charged with passionate love and desire, but desire transcends its object and struggles towards something behind and beyond the object. That's why it's so easily transferable from Lisa to Alice, when you realize that Alice is more mysterious than Lisa, and it's Alice who really embodies the eternal mystery. The film is finally "realized" by Romane Bohringer. She is so fascinating that she surpasses Monica Bellucci, which is really something to draw, since Bellucci is an exceptional beauty, while Bohringer is what the English call "plain". However, Romane Bohringer already had a good command of the art of "personality domination", in which beautiful girls fall away and are not noticed because Romane is so fascinating that it is impossible to leave her. eyes. enough even to look at beautiful girls, and you end up thinking only of her. Most of us remember, I'm sure, his father, Richard Bohringer, lying in a bathtub listening to the opera in the movie "Diva" many years ago. I'd rather watch Romane than Richard lying in a bathtub, but there seems to be a genetic secret to be fascinating because Richard Bohringer is also captivating and he's not even a woman. Romane seems to be able to turn into Anna Magnani when she is much older, which means that she will get an Oscar if someone can only write another "Rose Tattoo" for her. The girl has so much passion in her, she could set fire to the Seine. Would not it be wonderful if Julie Delpy and her teamed up? This film has wonderfully used the Parisian places. But where is this "place in Luxembourg"? It looked like Furstenburg Square. Maybe I missed something. I have to watch the film six more times, to study the accuracy of the timing and to know who is passing in front of who, and to make sure everything is done right. All of this looks like ten gigantic simultaneous chess games played by a big blindfolded master. How exciting! Romane, you can look through my window at any time! Mimouni, come on, discuss impossibilities, improbabilities, coincidences, synchronicity, everything that happens is invisible and how it affects the visible. And again, here we have the spirit of Breton's novel, "Nadja", embodied in a great work of French art. More! More! More!
