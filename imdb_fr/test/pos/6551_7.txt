To be honest, I thought this film would be a Japanese drama. I was completely wrong. This film is based on the popular Japanese anime novel of the same name. It tells the story of a cursed city by Uzumaki or The Spiral in English. Gradually, the inhabitants of the cities slowly begin to become dangerously and violently obsessed by spirals and some residents begin to transform themselves into living beings by having a kind of spiral in them, like a snail. <br /> <br /> The film was a giant acid trip, random, twisted with romance and drama. A bit like a "twisted" drama. What makes this film disturbing is the way some people are obsessed with The Spiral. For example: one of the fathers has a garage filled with household items with spirals, a girl took her long hair and mocked an incredibly huge spiral style, a child slowly turned into a human snail , a man could twist his spiral-shaped body, a woman tried to cut his ear to get the cochlea inside and a teenager crashed on himself to be wrapped around a tire car and a child got into a washing machine so that he could become a spiral. <br /> <br /> Another very disturbing aspect of this highly syndicated film is the atmospheric tone and style in which this film was shot. The angles of view add to the psychotic and twisted history, in other words, a very good cinematography. The general coloring of this image makes it a somewhat crazy story. The coloring is a mixture of lime green, yellow and a little orange and the special effects with some spirals are remarkable. <br /> <br /> However, like many Japanese movies, this one has a hint of forbidden love and romance between a girl and a boy. However, with all the spirals and strange events happening in the city, it's hard to follow the relationship between the two teenagers. But, in a way, it's very irrelevant, more like a second-hand story that has nothing to do with the history of the city obsessed with the spiral. <br /> <br /> Overall, I would recommend this film to anyone who loves very different and bizarre foreign movies. He has just enough craziness and madness, it touched me.
