The melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya is an anime that left me with an impression. Partly for the characters, many of whom fall into fantasy stereotypes / animated science fiction, but placing these stereotypes in the rather mundane setting of high school is a turning point that I enjoyed. Then there's the somewhat crazy titular character who is something else: a stubborn, almost amoral girl, with a ridiculous amount of talent and a secret of which she is unaware. <br /> <br /> The editing of the series is a bit of a trip of the mind. Originally, Suzumiya, unbeknownst to her, is a kind of superpowerful being, capable of achieving deeds of creation and destruction worthy of God, to the extent that she can destroy and reconstruct reality as she pleases. Our narrator and main character is Kyon, a high school student whose sympathy / curiosity for Haruhi seems to push her to drag him, against his will, into a club where she begins to spice up her life, because she misses the normal life. In search of adventure, she claims three other unusual members, each with secrets and they all end up being dragged into her crazy maneuvers. <br /> <br /> There is a bit of madness, but nice, philosophical consideration from the beginning to debate to know if the world is only the creation of Haruhi while she is bored of the old and if our characters exist to serve it or to continue to exist or if they could exist without it. It's a bit of an enigma, but a nice one anyway. Although sci-fi / fantasy scenarios occur from time to time in the series, I think the joy of the series lies in the way things are normal, while this tension remains with the knowledge that if things are too boring, Haruhi could destroy the world making it more interesting. <br /> <br /> The art is clean and corresponds to what I expect from the anime which is generally imported in the United States; I like the design of the characters and, even if there is not a lot of action in the series, I think it's better. The series is told in Kyon's mind and he does not play an omniscient narrator, but merely comments on what he knows and feels. He has a lot of things in mind, but he does not speak much, so it is good that we can hear him. <br /> <br /> The voice played in the English dub is quite acceptable, but I prefer the Japanese acting over it. There are strange aspects to the series, some of which are both parodic and passionate about the fan-boy, which I found amusing. For the first season, I must admit that there is a lack of closure, because the series does not really have a scenario, it seems to take things one at a time, so it's an easy series to take back and put in place. , although I think that because of its rather amusing qualities, it is still difficult to shoot it down. It is also based on a series of light novels and the author was directly involved in the writing of the series. <br /> <br /> Even though it's based on novels, I'd still like the higher series to have stronger storylines, but I like the way we naturally see these characters grow and how the series can play both the quiet moments and the wildest. To see Haruhi grow up was a real treat, but also to see the relationship between the SOS Brigade (the Haruhi Club) grow. <br /> <br /> This is not for everyone, because of its sunflower principle and its "extraordinary beings in a mundane world". It probably will not accept fans who are in action / sci-fi / fantasy and who may be a bit too off-beat for more relationship-oriented drama lovers, but for those who are willing to try something a little different, or who like strangely bizarre like that, I think The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya is a rather refreshing, unique and enjoyable series. More please. 9/10.
