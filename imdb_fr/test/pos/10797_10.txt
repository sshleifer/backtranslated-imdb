In one of the most implicit films of the late 1980s, while Oliver Stone climbed very high with Platoon and Wall Street (and before his opus Born July 4), he co-scripted and directed look at the world of radio, especially a radio host in central Texas. This man, Barry Champlain, was shot once in his career by Eric Bogosian, who wrote the original piece and also co-wrote the screenplay. Barry is like a mix of Howard Stern and one of those experts you hear on the radio that many of us could turn off. He has ideas in his head, opinions, and he is not only afraid to express them, but also to stand against the interlocutors. The appellants, indeed, are the driving force of the film, since Barry must fight against the foolish, the obscene, the racist and the purely distracted. To do this, he must also face his boss (Alec Baldwin) and a random chord to travel throughout the country, outside the limits of the South station where it is located. <br /> <br /> I was curious to see how it would have been on stage (I imagine it was a one-man-show, as Bogosian had several on the side), the direction of movie is phenomenal. Stone is known, almost typified, as a director who loves fast cuts, unlimited effects editing and effects with camera work styles and other tricks, which give his 90s movies a distinctive, almost d 'author. But in the 80s, he had that energy and feverish quality in the look of the movie, and was not as frenetic as the other movies. In order to add the appropriate intensity in Barry Champlain's studio and main space, he and the DP, Robert Richardson, give the space an air that is sometimes claustrophobic, grainy, uncertain, and perfectly comfortable. The scenes in the middle of the film, when Barry is not in the studio, are pretty classic, but the style and substance of the radio are some of the best I've seen in the Stone / Richardson combination. <BR /> <br /> And we can not miscalculate Bogosian's performance, which can be odious, offensive, angry, passive and all that we like and hate among radio hosts. There is also a fun and almost entertaining support role for Michael Wincott, in the role of Kent / Michael / Joe, who nicknamed him one night, and the next is invited to the studio. These scenes are a little uncomfortable for a viewer, but it is very much in the space of the 1980s subculture that Barry is as intrigued as he is critical. The stoner may not have "understood", but as he says "it's your show". Indeed, it is difficult to cover everything that happens in the speech, and there are many. But it's never boring and, like Champlain himself, it's not easy to ignore. And when Bogosian begins his tirade in the air, with the bottom scrolling in a continuous 360 Â° movement, it becomes intoxicating and is a reason why freedom of speech is so powerful. Filmmaker of current affairs, who discusses controversial topics or who are still controversial, and gives them a life force that is not always great, but which belongs to him. Here, his talents and ambitions do not go against those of Bogosian. This stimulates the extremely skilful vision of what is essentially a solo show, which in itself is already well written.
