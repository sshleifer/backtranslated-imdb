I saw the Messiah: - The First Killings and I thought it was absolutely one of the best programs I have ever seen. It's one of those programs for which you think oh, no, I can not watch the rest of the show, but you feel compelled to watch it only to see who did it. Jamie Draven was an absolutely amazing actor, able to switch between two totally different characters, including the wicked villain who did it and the other person, Jez Clifton, the cop. To be able to do it, well, I certainly would not be able to do it, at least not without cracking anyway. I really love and care Jamie Draven with all my heart and I will always do it until the end of time, I think that Jamie is the sweetest, the cutest and the sexiest guy in the world. I absolutely love Jamie in Ultimate Force also because he looks damn sexy in the blacks he wore. I love Jamie Love Paula Draven <br /> -X-
