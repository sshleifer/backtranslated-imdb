This movie is very stupid and very funny. You can never blame him for taking himself seriously. If you've heard their previous album or seen their HBO videos, you can imagine the extremely disgusting and rocky moment of this movie that tells the tale of the formation of the band Tenacious D. <Br/> <br /> Full of cameos, he not only gives a fictional tale of Tenacious D, it is also an introduction to musical history. The humor is reminiscent of something about Mary in the sense that they "go to places where we would have thought they would not do it", but it lacks the scatological humor of South Park. This film contains no nudity, except for the mooning.
