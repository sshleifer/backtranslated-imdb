What we have here is a perfect film for anyone involved in the post-industrial world: those who sit in their privatized homes, who earn money buying and selling products without sensuality and perpetuating a system that does not values ​​that self. <br /> <br /> The beautiful shoot (I still appreciate the 35 corrections and the soft boxes) makes it an even stranger place to travel, both fun to watch but scary to understand (maybe too much dramatic, but true). <br /> <br /> Andreas's journey through his hell is tragically tragic. His quest is honorable, laudable and precious. The conclusion is necessary and we are not sure that it is better, which is the perfect conclusion. <br /> <br /> Breve! Highly recommended to anyone who views their world with a critical eye and especially those who do not see it (this may encourage reflection or two).
