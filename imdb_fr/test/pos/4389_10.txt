They loved him and turned him into a toad! God, it happens to me every time. <br /> <br /> It's a fantastic movie. Memorable lines, "Thank God, your mom died for giving birth, she saw me that she was ashamed" to "I do not understand, Big Dan." Great scenes, from the scene of the opening train (I cried so loud) to bluegrass. <br /> <br /> Look at her. It's good, it's great, it's funny, and it's based on a famous story. Believe me, it's worth it. Do not watch this if you have a weak bladder, you will definitely wet your pants with a laugh.
