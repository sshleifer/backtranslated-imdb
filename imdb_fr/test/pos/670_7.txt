Ida Lupino is trapped at home by crazy Robert Ryan in "Beware, My Lovely," a 1952 RKO movie. Lupino and Ryan made three films together and worked well as a team, both accomplished professionals and performing artists. In this film, based on a Broadway play entitled "The Man", Lupino is a widow of the First World War who rented a room at her house. She is very active and appreciated in her community and although her husband has been dead for two years, she is not ready to move on. The man renting his room goes on vacation and Lupino hires Robert Ryan to help with intensive house cleaning. He is friendly enough to start, but later terrorizes her, locking her in the house and not allowing her to answer the phone or the door, because he becomes violent and more out of touch with reality. <br /> <br /> The character played by Ryan is shown at the beginning of the film fleeing when he finds a corpse in another house where he works. It is not clear whether he is the killer or not, since he seems surprised to see the body. It may be a split personality, because when his personality is aggregating towards Lupino, he seems to have no memory of his activities. He does not know he has the keys to Lupino's house in his pocket or why he has tickets for a party he bought from young children who came to the door. <br /> <br /> "Attention My Lovely" is a very suspenseful film, and the two main films give fantastic performances. The tension rises to a very high level and ends unexpectedly.
