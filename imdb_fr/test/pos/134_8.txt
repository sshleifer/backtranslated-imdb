(This has been changed for space) <br /> <br /> Chan-wook Park's new movie is a complex film that is not easy to categorize. Nominally a horror movie, the main character is a vampire, the film actually contains elements of comedy, theology, melodrama, cultural invasion (and its analogue viral invasion of a body), romance and few other things. It's a film that is almost too much in mind. The film takes its own business and mixes them with classical European literature, in this case "Theresa Raquin" by Emile Zola. It's a strange mix that does not always gel, but still has incredible power. It's been almost 24 hours since I saw the film at the Lincoln Center (with a post-film discussion of the director) and I find that my cage is more and more shaken. What is happening is not so disturbing, it is rather that its history and its themes sound retrospectively. <br /> <br /> The plot of the film has a will loved by a priest who decides that the best way to help humanity is to volunteer for a medical experiment to find a cure for an illness terrible. Affected by the disease, he succumbs and dies, but following a vampiric blood transfusion (which is not explained), he really survives. Hailed as a miracle worker, the priest returns to the hospital where he cared for the sick. Unfortunately all is not well. The priest discovers that he needs blood to survive. He also discovers that he has all the typical problems of a vampire and that it is not impossible for him to go out during the day. Things get even more complicated when he meets a childhood friend and his family. The priest, some of his animal passions aroused are taken with the wife of his friend. From there, everything goes on the side. <br /> <br /> A film in constant evolution, a story that runs through a variety of genres and tells the very human story of a man who discovers that his life has been radically altered. by chance and finds that he is no longer what he thought he was. It's a movie you have to stay up to, because the movie is constantly moving towards something else. It is also a film that has a lot in mind and the themes on which it plays are constantly explored in different ways. <br /> <br /> The movie has enough that could be, and people will probably, write books about the film. <br /> <br /> The two strongest parts of the film are its vampiric elements and its romance. The vampire part of the tale is brilliant. There is something in the way he states the basic rules and the nature of "affliction" that is so perfectly logical that it somehow pushes back the old vampire ideas. Sitting at the theater last night, I was amazed at how well it worked. I think the fact that he plays more or less directly is what makes the earth tremble. Here's a vampire who just wants to have a normal life. This contrasts with what happens later, it's clear that living an existence of chasing humans really does not go to work. It's not the dark world of Twilight or Lost Boys, but something else. Personally, I think the film changes the playing field from an idea or connected dream to something more real and tangible. (The sequence where the powers come into play is really cool) The romance is also wonderfully managed. Of course, the sex scenes are steamy and well executed, but it is the other elements, looks, discussions, gestures outside sex that make this special event. I like the looks, the calm looks while the forbidden couples look hungry and unable to act, the disappointment and sorrow of betrayal as real and presumed, and the crazy passion for a possible consumption. It's one of the biggest romances of all time on screen. It perfectly captures the feeling and emotion of a deep passionate love (and lust). If you've ever loved deeply, I guess you'll find some of your hearing on the screen, I know it. The statement "I just wanted to spend eternity with you" has a poignant intensity. It is both a statement of intent and the depth of emotion. The tragic romance will break your heart. <br /> <br /> I will not lie to you and say that the movie is perfect and great. This is not the case, as good as they are and almost all are excellent (especially the actors that I unfairly failed to describe as amazing), the whole does not always meet. Different genres, thematic elements and tones sometimes contradict each other. I often wondered where the movie was going. I clung to it even though the movie seemed to wander aimlessly. <br /> <br /> I really liked the movie. I liked the pieces more than the movie as a whole. It's been in my head since I saw him, and I suppose he'll do it again for several days. Love or love does not matter because it is a film that really deserves to be seen, because there is so much to do that it will provide you with enough material to think and talk for days. One of the hottest and most filling movies of the year.
