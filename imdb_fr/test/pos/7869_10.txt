"The Beguiled" is one of my favorite Clint Eastwood films and is a break with its typical lead roles. Directed by Don Siegel, with whom Eastwood collaborated on several films, he was shot a year before his directorial debut with "Play Misty For Me". An alternative title considered for the film was "Pussy-Footing At The Old Plantation", which fortunately was not used, otherwise I would be sure that jokes about the fact that it happens in a girls' school would be hard to avoid . I saw this movie for the first time in one of my cinema classes in the mid 70's and was immediately caught with it. I only had one old VHS tape until I recently bought the big-screen DVD, which also includes the hilarious and ugly trailer that makes the movie look like a soap opera "Peyton Place" and that does not transmit the goosebumps of the film. . <br /> <br /> Interesting notes: Eastwood and Siegel had to fight against Universal Pictures to keep the original end, and they won. and the film was presented as a standard western of Eastwood, which is certainly not the case. It is a Gothic story of deception and horror unfolding at the time of the American Civil War, with an underlying tone of eroticism and sexual tension. <br /> <br /> I do not put any spoilers in this article, and if you want to see the film as it should, so be careful to watch it on the Internet, because the critics are not lacking. In addition, critics are not lacking. <br /> <br /> Clint Eastwood describes John McBurney, a Union soldier who is shot on Confederate soil and discovered by a girl from a nearby girls' school. She saves him and brings him back to school, but instead of informing the local patrol of his presence to be taken to prison, the director, Miss Martha (Geraldine Page), her assistant Edwina (Elizabeth Hartman), their servant Hallie (Mae Mercer) and teenage girls, for the most part, welcome him, heal him and fall under his spell. The film sets the tone of goosebumps and gothic horror right from the headlines, as it shows real scenes from the war, while Eastwood's voice gently sings a funeral song of the time. <br /> <br /> The opening scene of his meeting with the little girl who saves him defines the tone of his character and that of the whole film. To say more, it would spoil the surprises of this first scene. To say much more about the film itself could ruin it for those who would not have seen it ... if you like gothic stories, find it and praise it. Eastwood is excellent in the film and it is interesting to see him play an early role, or any role, in which he embodies a character for the most part very unfriendly. <br /> <br /> Geraldine Page had a pioneering role in the film as director, and I can not imagine another actress of the moment as good in the role; Piper Laurie may have been playing for a long time, but I do not think Laurie could have played the role in the same way as Geraldine Page. <br /> <br /> Elizabeth Hartman (whose stunning performance in the movie "A Patch of Blue" as a blind girl who falls in love with the character of Sidney Poiter is another highlight of her short career) is at her apogee here, delicate and masterful at the same time. Unfortunately, his delicacy in the cinema was also part of his real life. she committed suicide at the age of 45. <br /> <br /> I end this analysis by observing this: a manipulative man, liar, does not lie for a servant full of beautiful and southern misleading and libidinous.
