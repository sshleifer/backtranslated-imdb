SPOILERS AHEAD <br /> <br /> 15 PARK AVENUE: My humble film about this film <br /> <br /> Now, for a moviegoer with tastes as severe as mine, niche movies like 15 Park Avenue should be acceptable to my sensibilities. With this thought and a slight sense of embarrassment that I did not see the full movie before, I watched this movie last Saturday. There are some similarities with other works such as the legendary Mulholland Drive (David Lynch), to which this film borrows at least 3 concepts: - <br /> <br /> a) These truths (at least some) are relative b) The first scene in which Shabana and Konkonam are driving while the opening credits are great, is strangely similar to the ride Betty and Rita drove on Mulholland Drive. In both cases, the object of the investigation turns out to be a place that is probably mythical in both cases and perhaps more openly symbolic in Aparna's film. C) The incident around the crazy beggar woman again recalls extremely the "phenomenon behind Winkies". involving an ass but while this frightening creature is an incarnation of something and that this "something" as well as the character by is perfectly related to other works of Lynch (note carefully long hair tousled), the effect The beggar's wife in 15 PA appears as a tribute and is therefore insignificant in the context of the film and its message. <br /> <br /> The other films borrowed by 15 PA are also Blow Up (the last scene is a return to the truth against perceived truth, poseur presented towards the end of Antonioni's masterpiece). Of course, the professor and the angle of schizophrenia also bring to mind, "A beautiful spirit". Although, certainly, the subject we are dealing with is the physics of the eyebrows and Shabana, who professes it, inadvertently ends up becoming the brilliant antithesis of the delusional hallucinations of the Konkona character through these same prophecies. In an exceptional film scene, some of these elements are juxtaposed and are located in the real world of Shabana, where quantum physics and the theory of relativity justify the finiteness and composition of the universe, the artificial edifice of the Mithi 'pretend' world But despite all their differences, the sisters are similar too. Both are unable to form lasting relationships, one out of choice and the other out of nature. Thus, Mithi's pain of being rejected lovingly by Joydeep is in harmony with Shaban's inability to create a special bond with Kunal (Dhritiman) or Sanjeev (Kanwaljeet). But I'm getting ahead of myself. Spectators generally tend to watch this film in one of the following ways: - <br /> <br /> Hypothesis 1: "It was all the time Shabana" There is a certain part of the public who thinks so. But this explanation is not only exaggerated, but also artificial, which would mean that she imagined so many other characters (that is, all the characters she visualized as visualizing Mithi with her). <br /> <br /> Hypothesis 2: "There was a real Mithi and the end is a metaphor" This POV says that the essence of the film is summed up in a dialogue of the film, while in response to a statement of Joy (Rahul Bose), Mithi is looking for something that she will never find, her wife Laxmi (Shefali Shah) philosopher in asserting that we all seek this illusory utopia, the end of the rainbow where seems to find the mirage of happiness and contentment. <br /> <br /> There are other Hypotheses 3: "Shabana and Konkona are alter ego of the same person" Hypothesis 4: "Shabana is also a fruit of Mithi's Imagination" Hypothesis 5: "The old, haggard, perhaps crazy, beggar is the real protagonist of the story "<br /> <br /> Do these hypotheses deserve to be tested? Well, your hypothesis is as good as mine <br /> <br /> "Why 15 Park Avenue?" Contrary to popular belief that she was thinking about Park Avenue in New York, I believe it gets its name from the brand name of a semi-popular bath soap. Do not forget that she said that Jo Jo was the "Shikakai prime minister" and that, as you may know, this is a popular ingredient used in the shampoo industry. The prefix '15' is used because it was on December 15 that Mithi had become engaged to Joydeep and, after her departure, she remained forever in a time chain. The film has its share of flaws - the lack of use of a solid background score that, in films like these, can really enrich the storytelling, some dialogues slopped relentlessly by a forced delivery of dialogues . The incoherent performances (Shabana and Dhritimaan are excellent with the IMO) of some members of the cast, though many cast members have been wasted. Shefali Chaya's sudden insecurity towards her husband seems to be a dimension unimaginatively introduced into the plot. I give it 7/10 as it made me think but not higher than that because I can easily understand its sources of inspiration and after experiencing (and most of the time, fully appreciated) these before, I have already thought of similar lines before. The post-AP experience will therefore necessarily be without a certain degree of novelty. Where I come from? I gave 9.5 / 10 to '36 Chowringhee Lane '(although rumors persist that a Satyajit Ray ghost would have directed him), 7.5 to' Parmit Ek Din ', 7 to' Mr and Mrs Iyer 'and 5 at' Paroma '. On an existential level, he failed to arouse my interest, not even as much as to say a "Truman Show"
