The film begins almost painfully slowly, a "romance" (yawn) that seems to deviate from the course (it's all part of the plan ...) Then, about an hour after the start of this solemn film is The Feast. It is worth paying attention to this first hour. The party is always solemn, but humorous. Suddenly, the retired and slightly skinny characters come to life, and everyone (you AND the characters) leaves enriched by the experience. <br /> <br /> Women will love this. Christians of all kinds will appreciate the deep faith shown by the characters. It's not my favorite movie of all time - no dinosaurs OR laser beams, after all - but it's a movie I'm happy to have seen. Do not miss. <br /> <br /> Jim
