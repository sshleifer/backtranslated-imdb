This is a cut above other movies of the genre: truly suspenseful, intelligent, brilliantly played and visually stunning. Yes, the plot can be confusing, but it's partly what makes it so powerful. Look at it twice if you can. You will have almost as much to watch the movie when you know it as watching it the first time. <br /> <br /> Do not be put off by the fact that this film comes from Korea, a country not too familiar to most Western audiences. Although some elements of the film are culturally specific, the underlying themes are too universal - guilt, anger, loss, madness, and punishment. All these elements are superbly managed by Lim Su-jeong as the main character, Su-mi. Yum Jung-ah also deserves special mention as she offers a deeply frightening and disturbing performance as a stepmother. <br /> <br /> Even if it presents scary moments, it's not really a horror movie as most people imagine. It's more of a psychological suspense story with an element of mystery. It takes you from the beginning and will let you guess until the end - and maybe even beyond!
