If you're a fan of Duke's early movies, this oldie Lone Star is a good one. What more could you ask than Duke, Yak and Gabby. Lots of good ridin 'and shootin' !!! I found it unbelievable that Duke's singing voice was Bill Bradbury, who is none other than Bob Steele's twin brother. It was reported that Bob Steele was a high school classmate and a friend of Duke, so his twin brother, Bill, may have been too. Anyway, if you like quality Western movies, clean and clean, do not miss this one. We should not question the hidden meanings or try to understand the underlying themes. Sit back, relax and enjoy a Western movie of a day and an hour simpler. It's called entertainment people !!!
