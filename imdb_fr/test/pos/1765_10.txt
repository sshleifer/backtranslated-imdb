In this short film about 34 seconds produced by Thomas Edison, we see Annabelle Moore perform the "Serpentine Dance" choreographed by Loie Fuller in two fantastic and fluid dresses. <br /> <br /> Moore was one of the greatest stars of the late Victorian era. She has appeared in several Edison short films, including this one, which was one of the first motion picture films shown in London in 1894. <br /> <br /> Loie Fuller had in fact patented the snake dance, which Moore plays dresses (as well as entire frames) that are frequently hand-tinted in the film, presaging one of the most common symbols of the era of silence. Supposedly, Moore's films were popular enough to have to be frequently redone (including re-filming). The version available to us now may be a later version / remake. Moore became even more popular when it was announced that she appeared naked at a private party in a restaurant in New York. She then played the role of "Gibson Bathing Girl" in the Ziegfeld Follies in 1907. She appeared there until 1912. <br /> <br /> The short film is notable for its framing of the movement, which "second half ", becomes almost abstract. It sounds a bit like a Louis Morris painting, even though it's been almost 60 years before his work is relevant. <br /> <br /> You should be able to find this short film on DVD on several anthologies different from the first films.
