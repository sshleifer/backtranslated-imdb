You can read all kinds of references in the world of Idiocracy. A futuristic world populated by spoiled and complacent idiots fed by the technology of a bygone era: this idea has its precedent in HG Wells' "The Time Machine" and in "Brave New World" by HG Wells, among other satires . /> <br /> At the beginning of the film, a narrator explains the rapid degradation of humanity in five hundred years, but does not fill the gaps regarding the origin of futuristic technology. Most critics of this very amusing (and amusing) film seem to surround this omission and the resulting complaint that the world is not "realistic". As if "realism" had always been a necessary quality of satire. Is "Brazil" realistic? How about "Futurama" or "Transmetropolitan"? Damn, how about "Gulliver's Travels"? I did not think. "Idiocracy", even though it may not be as sharp as the best of its kind, hits the same notes and usually does so successfully. <br /> <br /> Moreover, I did not find the problematic futuristic technology. It's pretty easy to understand that Mike Judge satirizes the current trend towards automation and simple product interfaces, so that even complete idiots can use them. As in "Brave New World," the movie company seems to have reached a stage of automatic self-sufficiency (apparently created by the "smart people" now gone to appease an increasingly stupid population.), Leaving the rest of free humanity to indulge in all the selfish and selfish impulses they can imagine and even become more stupid. The film takes place just at the last breath of humanity, while everything begins to fall apart for good. It may still be "unrealistic", but if it is, it is a mark of unrealism remarkably well presented. <br /> <br /> Silly people mostly sit on screen, of course, but they are just victims - they do not know better. Mike Judge keeps his true hatred for the ruling intelligents who died at the beginning of the film, but who are very much alive in the 21st century. People like scientists who hunt "hair growth and prolonged erections" for no other reason than the opportunity to make their snake oil treatments profitable. People like politicians who leave companies just buy the FDA and the FCC. People like media executives and their yuppie buddies who promote stupidity - who allow the destruction of any culture, morals and health to earn money quickly. <br /> <br /> After all, who is really to blame, the Morlocks or the Eloi? The Parisians of the world, or the brilliant leaders and advertisers who broadcast it on television and lowered our cultural norms enough to leave it there? All of this is implicit in "Idiocracy", however. A line here, an allusion here (see the hilarious self-doctor who literally does all the work in the health system). This is one of the few aspects of the film that the useless narrator did not crush. It's just there for the viewer, or not, but it's one of the most interesting themes in a much smarter movie than any other comedy of the year. <br /> <br /> Too bad that so many people want to leave the film thinking that it's just a pretext to show that the hind end is farting and that people are touched in the groin. Not that this kind of thing is not funny too, and maybe it's a bit complicated. But in "Idiocracy", it's just not as simple as it sounds.
