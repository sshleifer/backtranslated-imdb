I read most of the reviews here where everyone only saw the flaws of the movie. I agree, the director is not Kuprik, the actors are not Oscars, but everyone can understand each other. I do not want to spoil but to tell more than the plot - the completion of school and the trip for a big party, or if you like to see beyond the metaphor, it's choosing the path of life. Remember those days of youth? the days when you or our friend acted like the characters? Or do you think you should act as one of them and now you regret not doing it? If you can come back to that time and if you can ask yourself all these questions, maybe the film was not so bad.
