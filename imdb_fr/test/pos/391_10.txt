Beautiful .... this word sums up just about all this movie. All about cinematography, staging, acting ..... awesome. At any point in the film, you can hang it up and you will probably look at something tiled or "wacky artistic" as some people would say. I assure you that after a viewing, "Bobbycrush" will get stuck in your head. I know it from experience. Even the soundtrack is great. It goes very well with the tone and rhythm of the film. Be thankful that Cam Archer exists in this world. We need more people like him to make movies showing love and shame in a totally real (and surreal) imagery.
