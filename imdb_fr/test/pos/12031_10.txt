I was a schoolboy when I watched this movie for the first time. The next day, I knew that all the students in our universe were watching him and were fascinated by the film as I was. I think the same situation has occurred in all forms of our school and throughout the Soviet Union. Later, I watched it every time it was broadcast on TV and I want to watch more. I think the comparison with "Back to the Future" or other science fiction movies is not appropriate. "Gost'ya iz budushchego" is unique in many ways, once you have watched it, you never forget it. <br /> <br /> This film is full of conviction about peaceful scientific achievements, and full of faith in the future of our world. It is not only the film, but also a forecast of many inventions and scientific achievements. The time indicated in the film is the year 1984 (the year of its creation) and the year 2084 (where a schoolboy Kolya Gerasimov traveled for a time and from where was his friend Alisa Seleznyova). The year 2005 is now, many inventions and achievements planned in the film are not yet realized. Such as "Mielophone" (a device capable of reading the thoughts of all animals and all humans), expeditions to Venus and Mars (as easy as going for a picnic on weekends), creating and launching satellites as duty for students, easy-to-drive flying machines (which have completely replaced cars), biorobots, a "historical identification" of any type of material or creature made in minutes, and many more. Meanwhile, some of them became much more realistic than they seemed in 1984! Wait 2084 :-) <br /> <br /> The film also describes typical Russian schoolboys and schoolgirls (and does so naturally!). With their inventiveness, their curiosity, their humor, their reverie. Look for example at Fima Korolyov, you can find such a character in almost all forms of all schools of the Soviet Union, a similar character was also in my form! Alisa Seleznyova ... myself, as well as many of my classmates, fell in love with her! By the way, later, an actress who played Alisa became a scientist - I think she was as much influenced by the film as the people who watched her on television. <br /> <br /> Beautiful idea, beautiful realization, beautiful actors, beautiful music, beautiful song "Prekrasnoye Daleko" ("The wonderful in the distance") ... Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful ... <br /> < The last thing I want to say is that different remakes and "new versions" of the movie's song and even the film itself were made later and broadcast on TV and on the Internet. Not all are comparable to the original. I should not even comment on them, my comment only concerns the original. So, ask for the original and enjoy!
