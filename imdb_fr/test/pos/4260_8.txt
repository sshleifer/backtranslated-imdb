This film shows that the free enterprise system and the almighty quest transcend all racial and ethnic barriers. In the end, the market determines the message sent to the public. This film dramatizes this point. A white-collar conservative advertising company is being taken over by a group of African-Americans in the street presided over by a sensible black man who wants to make money and believes he can sell products by telling the truth. But the film shows that no matter how difficult it is to try to do something different, the market and the political system require it to conform, not making it different from its predecessors. Interesting film, offbeat.
