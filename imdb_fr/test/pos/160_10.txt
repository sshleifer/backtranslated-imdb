Not for dummies, but the number of twists, inventive uses of situations using vampire mythology, beautiful visual extremes, as well as interesting and offbeat characters make it one of the most breathtaking horror movies I've ever seen. have never seen. He falls into total madness with the characters, but never seems to be an exploitor or horrible aimless. There is a lot of bleeding accompanied by sucking and compression noises, but also subtle moments where you laugh with laughter. As it tends to do, Chan-wook Park keeps you deconcentrated by jumping in time, in the plot and in the situation that you have to solve yourself by forcing yourself to get involved in the story and the characters. <br /> <br /> And there are a lot of literal jumps. True to the myth of vampires (pun intended), they have superhuman strength and can almost jump tall buildings in a single bound (to forge a sentence).

The character borders a kind of black film of black widow. She goes from innocent to mischievous demon demon with absolute conviction. It's a really sweet and nervous performance. <br /> <br /> If you love real horror art or if you're a fan of Oldboy, do not wait for the video, watch it right away.
