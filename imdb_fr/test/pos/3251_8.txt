I'm afraid I disagree with Mr. Radcliffe, because even though he's right that it's not a comedy, he has many other merits. The plot is a little crazy from side to side, but I think everything fits perfectly to create a satisfying and enjoyable film. The last scene was rather abominable compared to the rest of the film, but the real end of the plot, a few scenes before, is very interesting and shows what someone will do under stressful circumstances. <br /> <br /> I would recommend This movie is for fans of thrillers and action movies, but if you are a fan of gangster movies, as long as you do not expect something so deep Goodfellas, you should still find it nice.
