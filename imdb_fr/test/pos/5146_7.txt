My family (two 40-year-olds, an 8-year-old mother, and my 71-year-old mother) first saw it on April 29th. We all enjoyed the movie. It was a good story and the knowledge, based on real events, made it even more enjoyable. Luke Wilson was very funny (pun intended), as was Tim Blake Nelson. And seeing Neil Flynn play anything other than "Scrubs's naughty janitor" was nice. The children in the film have done well and I'm sure they'll all like a certain idol-level demographic. The graphics were simply beautiful and Jimmy Buffet's music was added to the "Florida feeling". OK, maybe the story was a little too neat and well prepared for some adults, but hey, we do not care. I can not compare it to the book, honestly, I had not heard about it before the movie was released. <br /> <br /> It was just a nice movie and the message was good. Clear and simple.
