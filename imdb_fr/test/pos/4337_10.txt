Death Wish 3 is exactly what a bad movie should be. Terrible game! Unplausible scenarios! Ridiculous death scenes! Creepy, bad guys for no reason! The last 30 minutes of this film may well be the best of the last 30 minutes, especially in the scene where honest and hard-working citizens chain chains in the street, shoot the bad bikers and shoot them, to be joined by neighborhood children (!!!) in celebration. And how can I forget the old woman with the broom? She sweeps the foam! And if that's not enough, let's not forget how fast the punks give up after Fraker's death. I laugh while thinking about it. <br /> <br /> I also like the death scene of Kersey's girlfriend. He has just * gone * after seeing it explode. It's such little things that make Death Wish 3 such a bad movie. And I do not even talk about the weird soundtrack. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie because of Martin Balsam, who, I think seriously, is one of the best character actors of all time (and who's own "to be beaten by the scum "scene is hilarious) and I left with a new favorite movie. Thank you, Death Wish 3 for making me laugh so hard. <br /> <br /> Some other things I forgot to mention: 1. The strange sound effect after Kersey said "Cash!" when buying his used car. Ha! It's so bad. 2. MANDY Fraker. Mandy! Have the writers exhausted their names? 3. The fact that gangs apparently have a rogue exchange program "lend and rent": "I need more guys." And that Mandy has a working phone line in an abandoned building. 4. At the end of the film, after the Kersey explosion, is Fraker: Is it just me, or is the street gang about to embark on choreography when it gives up? Just look at how they are synchronized after the female punk gives the "stop" signal. <br /> <br /> I like this movie. Nothing makes me happy like Death Wish 3!
