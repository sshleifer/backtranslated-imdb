<br /> <br /> As a teenager, I have about a hundred years of movies to catch up with. I try to see a mix of classics, mainstream movies, art films and more. The 70s represent one of the most important decades for films: it was at that time that classical classic films turned into messages and antisocial behavior. It has become like never before. What a decade under influence has shown is the importance of all graduate films to Star Wars. <br /> <br /> Richard LaGravenese and the late Ted Demme are the main interviewers of this documentary, which interviews Dennis Hopper, Francis Ford Coppola, Martin Scorsese, Robert Altman and Jon Voight, among others, explain how these few years have changed the cinema forever. It is a very professional and refined documentary, financed even by the IFC. However, as this is a very professional project, I think they would at least reduce the sound of someone laughing as they look behind the camera. For me, it allowed me to see how everything was neat and clean. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, it is a very interesting documentary, about the film, made by the people who realize it. Of course, they do not criticize their own movies or anything else, but they honestly describe what they thought about the movies and what they meant. I do not know much about cinema (but I want to be involved in this film when I become an adult), so I feel like someone like me, this film is a considerable asset. I've seen a lot of the movies they mentioned, like Chinatown and One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, but a little more insight into these movies was very informative. <br /> <br /> The main reason, however, I do not have 't love love is, as clever as it was edited, it seemed to take its time at first and be pretty relaxed, so do not to have enough time for everything he wanted to show. They crammed into Star Wars and Jaws in the last few minutes, when they were two of the most important. It seemed like they had tried too much to show a lot of clips, and that's fine, but some of them did not matter much, like an extended excerpt from Network. <br /> <br /> Overall, Influence is an exciting experience. informative documentary that helped me, at least, to learn about a second "golden age" in American cinema. <br /> <br /> My rating: 7/10 <br /> <br /> R rated for language, and images of sexuality, violence and drug use.
