I watched this movie on HBO and had a good time. <br /> <br /> The director did a great job. I found myself totally absorbed by this movie once it started. The performance of Norman Reedus is cool. I expect more chilling movies from him. <br /> <br /> I was so absorbed that sometimes I wanted to take a gun from Norman and shoot that snake-girl. Eh eh. I like movies when innocent looking girls play cleverly with men. The end was what I wanted :)) <br /> <br /> This film is full of twists and turns. You expect that, but something else is happening. <br /> <br /> At first, these massive picture scenes were really painful for the eyes. <br /> <br /> Although this is not visible when Norman Reedus changed his bank note? Or am I standing in front of the fridge? :)
