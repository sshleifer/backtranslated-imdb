The plot of "Sally of the Sawdust" is the usual melodramatic trick - an orphan, rags to riches - but the film rises above most silences thanks to three people: <br /> <br /> > This is not, of course, the masterpiece of DW Griffith, but it highlights his sense of making films in full maturity. He uses all his innovations, which are techniques we take for granted: close-ups, intersections, a mobile camera and the ability to change the acting from theatrical exaggeration to cinematic subtlety. <br /> <br /> W. C. Fields also showcases his skills - not his unstoppable signature, but his remarkable dexterity as a physical comedian. He makes some inventive juggling, cut too short to be fully appreciated, and very skilled pickpockets, but it seems that every accessory at hand is handled for a comic effect - hat, cane, car roof, dog, money. It's a joy to see. <br /> <br /> Finally, there is Carol Dempster. Much has been said against this actress, but her performance here is also richly comic. She was 22 years old at the time and was playing a teenager. Her role is a combination of grace and awkwardness that may not be quite convincing, but she really hits the mark when she's on the screen - especially when she's dancing. She is not a beauty - although she is positively luminous in the scene where she is assailed like a sister Talmadge - but her clarity only adds to Sally's character, especially in the many times she shows a obvious affection for Fields as guardian / "father." Few or no Hollywood artists could compete with Fields in comedy, but Griffith gives his main wife every chance of competing with his co-star and Dempster absolutely holds his own.
