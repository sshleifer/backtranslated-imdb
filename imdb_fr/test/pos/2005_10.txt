Eve opens our eyes, because of the beautiful landscapes and techno-no music in the background, we hear. This film shows a positive aspect of the fact that the human body is the creation of God and, to take this into account, viewers can gain greater respect for the legendary story of Adam and Eve watching this film. The portrayal of Eve by actress / model Inger Ebeltoft is so good that there is no right word to describe her performance, and I can not imagine having another actress in the role of Eve. For me, this movie is very useful for the type of stress relief therapy. We had never fallen so relax then before watching this movie. This film is a masterpiece. God would have liked this film to be done in the first place! <br /> <br /> Mr. Razbin!
