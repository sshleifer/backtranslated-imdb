"What Alice Found" is the greatest movie nobody has ever heard of! I underestimated it when I heard about it and I thought it would be sex, not a plot, and totally stupid, but in reality, it was really good. They say that all independent films are void, but this one and Napoleon Dynamite are not void. I asked my friend, who had already seen her before, and she said that Alice had all these things to three, and you see all this nakedness, but no, there are no three ways that I remember and a little nudity. The film was right, and it taught me to never trust the hitchhikers. I liked that in the end, they had a little dolphin to Alice. In the end, she headed for Flordia. I totally suggest to see this movie.
