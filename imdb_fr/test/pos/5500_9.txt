"In the Line of Fire" is one of those Hollywood movies that quite often goes on television, but even though I have seen it many times before, I usually end up sitting again. Why? - Its good! Clint Eastwood is great, as usual, and the character he plays is interesting and more elaborate than usual. The character, Secret Service Agent Frank Horrigan, is haunted by the fact that he was on a detail that failed to protect President Kennedy in Dallas, and he is now forced to compete with a professional assassin who declare openly that he will kill the president. . However, the film does not make him a depressed, dark and obsessed character. He is charming and charming, and is realistic like a guy who has lived a lot in life and is comfortable with his skin. He is even quite convincing when he flirts with the young agent played by Rene Russo. The murderer, played at his best by John Malkovich, is cerebral, deliberate and likes to play large-scale games involving life and death. It even bears the name of another presidential assassin, John Booth. <br /> <br /> The film is always nice and offers all the goods - suspense, action, novel and drama - all in the desired proportions. It's a funny movie that is really helped by the big actors!
