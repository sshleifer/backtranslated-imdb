Well, I do not agree with Leonard Maltin on this animated short. He loves it and claims it's hilarious. I enjoyed it but I did not see any humor. He does not even like hockey and knows nothing about it. He still loves history. Living on the other side of the Canadian border, I watched hockey for 50 years, in Buffalo and beyond ... but I did not think much about that drawing. Oh, that was interesting and I know what would happen if you wore a Toronto jersey in the Quebec City area - a disaster! This is especially true in the glory years of Canadians. However, that does not make the story funny. <br /> <br /> In the 1950s, everyone in the provinces of Quebec loved the Montreal Canadiens and their star player Maurice Richard, and everyone wanted to be like him. When his mother orders a new sweater, he wears the Toronto Maple Leafs emblem. The young man does not want to be surprised to wear it. When he does it and goes to the local rink, he gets ostracized. of his hockey pals. What's so funny? I could see the same thing happen for a Boston kid, who is extremely tough and his mother offers him a Yankees shirt! Horrors! You can not wear it, and vice versa. <br /> <br /> Maybe for someone who does not follow the sport at all, like Maltin, this situation seems strange and funny to him ... but it's a fact of life or of everything short-time sports lover and his favorite team. It was an interesting and totally believable story, but nothing made me laugh. Art was fun to watch all the time, almost like watching a long series of pencil paintings by a talented schoolboy. The French Canadian accent was good too. This film was part of the National Film Board of Canada's "The Leonard Maltin's Favorite Movies" DVD.
