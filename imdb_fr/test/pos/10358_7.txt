I saw this black and white comedy yesterday at the London Film Festival. Structurally, he has been compared to Pulp Fiction, but he is perhaps closer to the structure of Amores Perros and the more relaxed atmosphere of Kevin Smith's clerks. Four floors intersect at a French highway restaurant. The first vignette to Franck (Edouard Baer) who hangs out at the restaurant. The waitress Suzie (Anna Mouglalis) has pity on him and tells him his story. The second has two incompetent kidnappers, Leon (Bouli Lanners) and Paul (Serge Lariviere), a girl from his wealthy family. Unfortunately for them, she is suicidal and her family does not seem to want to get her back. The third is a dialogue between two aging rock stars who meet at dinner (Alain Bashung and Arno play). The last part concerns about four former criminals who put their former partner out of the hospital to visit their old hiding place which has since been transformed into ?? dinner. An "epilogue" returns to Franck and Suzie to complete their story (not really an epilogue, but a conclusion). <br /> <br /> The structure does not really work. The stories are not sufficiently related as in Pulp Fiction. The dinner is not crucial for the action either. At least two of the stories told in the way the car accident was crucial in the four stories of Amores Perros. The quality of individual stories varies. The story of the hiding place is a cute idea, with some good gags, but does not come off; and the rock star meeting is uninteresting and dull. On the other hand, the story of the kidnappings is hilarious, although its link with the restaurant is tenuous. The most balanced and successful story is that of Franck and Suzie. <br /> <br /> This film has not been successful, but has moments of interest and hilarity. I'm looking forward to seeing more of Samuel Benchetrit's work, screenwriter / director.
