"Blind Date" is one of three stories from author Vida Hurst's film. Many familiar faces in this old 1934. Mickey Rooney like a little punk in his mouth. He seems to be in the film for "family values" comical and welcoming. Jane Darwell plays the mother again with strong will, as she did in Grapes of Wrath and the Oxbow Incident. Ann Sothern is Kitty, who goes out with Bill (Paul Kelly), but meets the rich Bob Hartwell, played by Neil Hamilton, who might not be better for her. You can certainly say that this was done at the very beginning of the Hays production code - at one point, Kitty said she could not be alone with him if there was no one else in the house ... change just a year or two before, when everything and everything was OK. Good solid plot, but a lot of conversation and lover chatter. This raises the question of what a girl should look for in a man; should she be considered a man of integrity who treats her gently, or just find a strong man, as most movies of the last 20 years ...? and how do men change when their situation changes? Watch out for violence in the strange scene of the dance marathon. Viewers in the 1960s will recognize Hamilton as Commissioner Gordon of Batman ..... In addition, some strange dramas unfold in life on screen for some of the players in it: a love triangle. Mickey Rooney had an affair with Norma Shearer, who was 20 years older; Rooney ended up being married eight times. Tyler Brooke (Emory) and Spencer Charters (Pa) both met face-to-face. The title "Blind Date" has been reused several times, for movies, TV series and even cartoons, but none of them seems to have the same plot as this one.
