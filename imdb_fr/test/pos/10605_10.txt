Haggard is one of the funniest movies of all time. He presents the cast of CKY (movies) and also has an excellent soundtrack. If you have seen a CKY or a Viva La Bam, you will notice that everyone (of these two) is there. Including Bam's parents and many other people. <br /> <br /> The story goes that Ryan Dunn's girlfriend, Glauren (Jennifer Rivall), cheated on him and tried to get her back. He does this by vandalizing his house with Valo (Bam) and Falcone (Dicamillo). There are many different characters with many different stories. <br /> <br /> There is good music on the soundtrack. Groups such as Him & Her, CKY, Gnar Kill and Daniel Lioneye. Iggy and Stooges Pop and New Order. <br /> <br /> If you do not like Viva La Bam or CKY (movies), I doubt you like it. If you like that stuff ... this movie is awesome.
