Unlike the many people who have posted here, I do not know cinema well. I stumbled upon this movie (surf on channel) and I could not surf far. This is a truly incredible movie, worthy of all the praise of the critics and those of this site. The actors are great. Tatiana is beautiful and innocent. His fianc√© Boris is gentle and patriotic. You could not help feeling the exasperation and sorrow of Boris's father as he reproached his son for being so stupid as to volunteer for service in the Great War. It is enough to mention some scenes which moved me the most. When the brother of Boris reveals to his family that he does not trust his brother and that he "must marry" Tatiana, his crooked mouth shows his disgust at this betrayal (even if his share in the infidelity could have to be a rape). You fear that the rest of the film corrects what is wrong by visiting Destruction and Tatiana and her brother, or worse, show Tatiana destroyed by an immoral descent into the decadence of smoking. Since it is not "French existential cinema", it does not happen. Fortunately! <br /> <br /> Another heart-rending scene is the one where the nameless soldier "musician" who was saved by Boris returns to announce to Boris's father the death of his son. He unintentionally announces the news to Tatiana. I can not describe the sorrow of this scene ... Yet, Tatiana finds a straw to seize and hopes that Boris will return home. The musician never saw Boris being buried, after all. <br /> <br /> I will not mention more scenes, but I want to emphasize that the keys of Soviet political correctness did not hurt the film. Boris's brother is revealed as the piano playing an anti-Soviet loafer that someone who steals the future wife of his brother should be. No doubt he gets at least one "tenner" at the end of the film! The end, when Tatiana finally learns with certainty that Boris is dead, always manages to finish with joy and hope for the future. You do not even want to imagine the tears and catharsis that had to sweep over the theater when the survivors of this war, with their own losses in mind, saw this film for the first time. <br /> <br /> Incredible. Go see him.
