I am a sociologist / anthropologist specialized in the field of symbolic interactionism and I must say that this film presents a high quality in the symbolic context throughout the film. To all those who have not seen it yet, I recommend you also read Victor E. Frankl's "The Search for Man for Ultimate Significance". I think you will be able to draw amazing correlations. <br /> <br /> That said, I would like to say that, despite the fact that the main characters are homosexual, it's not a story of being gay. This is a story about research and the meaning of life, despite the difficulties and challenges, the pain and the terror that stand in your way. It is a story of research and search for balance, wholeness and happiness.
