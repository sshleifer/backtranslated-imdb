I am Czech and soldiers (not only pilots) who fled Czechoslovakia after the Nazi invasion in 1939 and who fought abroad are true heroes and brave men in our history. This film by the director of "Kolya" (1996), winner of an Oscar, is a tribute to these men. This is the first big-screen film about Czechoslovak soldiers of the Second World War since "Nebesti jezdci" (1968). I think "Dark Blue World" is a good movie - good acting, good special effects, nice music, etc. The film is half English and some actors are British. But the greatest asset of this film is its pure existence. It is an excellent opportunity to show the world (and many people in the Czech Republic as well ...) that Czechoslovakia's role in the Second World War was not only a busy country, but also an active member of the Allied Campaign. <br /> <br /> The main characters are Frantisek and Karel, older and wiser. They escaped together from Czechoslovakia, they fly in the same squadron and fell in love with the same woman ... It may be a clich√© but fortunately, this scenario is not so aggressive and is in good balance with other scenes (including big fights). I do not want to compare "Dark Blue World" with "Pearl Harbor", someone would like more PH and someone would like DBW. But if you like happy ending, DBW is not for you. So, I think it's a very good movie for all those who love this type of story and a very good movie that wants to know more about this chapter in the history of Czechoslovakia. <br /> <br /> BTW, main theme "Dark Blue World" is from the Czech composer Jaroslav Jezek from the 30s and 40s. He wrote this theme when he lost his eyes ...
