In Spain, former sailor Ramón Sampedro (Javier Bardem) has been tetraplegic for 28 years and is fighting in court for the right to practice euthanasia through an association defending freedom of choice and led by his friend Géne (Clara Segura). . Ramón is presented to the lawyer who defends his case, Julia (Belén Rueda), suffering from a fatal degenerative disease; and meets Rosa (Lola Dueñas), an isolated worker who has been abused by men. Their relationship changes the behavior and point of view of Rosa and Julia's life. <br /> <br /> The Chilean Alejandro Amenábar is, in my opinion, one of the best contemporary directors. His filmography released in Brazil is composed of excellent original films: "Abre Los Ojos", "Tesis", "The Others" and "Mar Adentro". Javier Bardem is probably the best actor in Spain today. Their association produced this sensitive drama on a very controversial theme, the right to commit euthanasia. This drama is never cheesy or depressive, as the script uses humor as a relief valve in the most dramatic situations. The casting performances are perfect, the characters having and defending different positions on this unpleasant theme. Dialogues and lines are very solid and intelligent. I noted in the outline of the IMDb plot that this movie is based on the real story of Ramón Sampedro. Unfortunately, neither the film nor the DVD gives this important information. My vote is new. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Mar Adentro" ("The sea inside")
