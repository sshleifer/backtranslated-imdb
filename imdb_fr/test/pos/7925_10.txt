I was looking for this movie after reading Tom Clancy's novel "Red Storm Rising". Timeless masterpiece of the 13th century Russians invaded by the Germans. The film was shot in 1938, by order of Joseph Stalin, to warn the Soviets of Hitler and Germany. Battle scenes are beautifully done, showing that you do not need computer animation to make a big fight scene. Probably the greatest work of Sergei Eisenstein. See also 'Potemkin Battleship'. All history buffs or politicians should watch this film. 10 of 10.
