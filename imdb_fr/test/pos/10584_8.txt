I bought this movie just to see Bam because I really liked it, but after seeing it, I do not like it much anymore. I mean, his playing was good and all I suppose, but every time it showed totally useless skateboarding scenes, I just thought, "Well, we know you're a professional skater, can we come back now to Ryan Dunn? " Dunn, Rake and Brandon really made the film from my point of view. <br /> <br /> I noticed that Jenn Rivell (obviously) and Missy Rothstein were both in Haggard, but who did Bam come out with at the time? Anyway, I really enjoyed Haggard and I think it's really like no other movie I've ever seen. It's sort of in its own category.
