It was a good movie. Something not only for the month of black history, but to remind people of the goodness of people and the affirmation that it really takes a village to raise a child. S Eptath's performances were exceptional. Mos Def and his singing were off the hook. I had to make a double take when I saw that it was Rosie Perez. But the cast of actors and actresses was worth watching. All the different stories they had was amazing. And how Nanny protected Jr and literally everyone who was in his presence. I can really understand that she is the matriarch of this period and even more of her tiredness to help everyone. I can not wait for him to come out on DVD. This would be a welcome addition to any movie library.
