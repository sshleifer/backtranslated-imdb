Jamie Foxx is absolutely Ray Charles. His performance is just great. He owns the movie, just like Spacek owned "Coal Miner's Daughter" and Quaid "Great Balls of Fire". In fact, it's hard to remember that Ray Charles's role is played, not by the man himself. Ray Charles is legendary. He is well established as a musician and the music is deep, complex and innovative ~ even more innovative than I realized before watching this movie. The film should make new fans of a young audience who could enter without too much knowledge of his music. Ray Charles's life provided excellent biographical material for the film, which goes far beyond a film about a musician. I admit that I knew very little about the life of this man before seeing this film. I came away impressed by Ray Charles's courage, strength and innovation as a man and musician.
