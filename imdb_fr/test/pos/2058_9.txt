I really enjoyed this movie. I really like movies in which women have a lot of trouble, so this movie was already hoping for decent entertainment. My hopes were satisfied and exceeded less than 20 minutes in the film. The action, humor and wit that this film easily contained made it one of my favorite movies of all time. There was Sam Jackson and his undeniable presence on the screen, Geena Davis as I had never seen before, demanding your respect and your enthusiasm to take it even if you do not want to give it. <br /> <br /> Geena plays Samantha Caine, an amnesiac who desperately needs to remember her past, but soon realizes that the more she discovers, the more she wants to forget and ends up burning until she that finally Samantha is so much more and that Charly is all that remains. But now, can Charly and Sam, two completely different women, possibly exist in the same body? We have characters coming in and out of the movie that feed each side of Sam / Charly, like Sam Jackson and Craig Bierko. Craig is also irresistible as Timothy, the sexy naughty without conscience. <br /> <br /> This film was perfectly performed and played, above the stage and wonderfully entertaining. You watch the impossible happen and applaud when that happens. So much is your time. Look, you will not regret it.
