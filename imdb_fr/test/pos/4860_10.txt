Most people who attend this film will have no idea of ​​the great Arthur Miller novel that is the basis. It's a novel that should be read by more people to see how prejudices affect and alter people's lives. <br /> <br /> At first, Lawrence Newman is an ordinary man. The glasses that his boss makes him do change everything he worked for and his whole world collapses around him, little by little. It was not possible to find an actor more able to present this intelligent performance on screen than William H. Macy. Not only is he a talented theater and film actor, but he projects honesty behind every character he plays. He is an ordinary man caught in his own insecurities. His anxiety intensifies when he takes a stand and leaves his job. Suddenly, he has to face the problems he tried to avoid all his existence in the middle class in Brooklyn in the 40s. Is he Jewish, is not it? The cinematography of this shiny and atmospheric film, made with a sure hand by Neil Slavin, reminded me of some paintings by Edward Hopper, especially a sequence at the beginning of the film when Newman was coming out of a building and the night filmed when his wife and are followed with long black shadows behind the couple, threatening and anticipating the confrontation with the bullies. Laura Dern, David Paymer and especially Meat Loaf, who breathes incredible depth to the bully next door, are excellent, but they are all pale compared to William H. Macy's stunt (H must represent Honest ..) If you have not read the book, I would sincerely recommend it because no one has written more convincingly and convincingly than Arthur Miller.
