I own this video as well as the concert version of the musical with Patti Lupone and George Hearn with the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra. George Hearn is fantastic in my book, as is Angela Lansbury and composer Stephen Sondheim. This musical has a lyrical scope and shows a lot of ingenuity in the composition. I certainly hope this VHS will be available on DVD !! Hearn's performance is terribly friendly. The annoying performance is the young woman who plays the role of Joanna. I think this performance took place at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion in Los Angeles, rather than on a Broadway stage and I'm not sure that the minimalist decor was used in New York, as in this production. But I found that the scaffoldings dragged on the stage were quite effective in "representing" the streets of London. I highly recommend this movie.
