What makes this low budget production one of my favorite movies? I'm not kidding, I was already looking at it about 10 times and I did not get tired. Is it tender melancholy on the whole? Is it similar to classics like "Niagara"? I had thought about it for a long time. And I understood: I guess so: there are no heroes, there are only people. Some are trying to be good. Some have stopped trying to be good. Some are hopeless cases, but still carry the spunk of being human inside. This is the story of a catastrophic night in a motel at the end of the world. On the one hand, disaster is only the end of a chain of coincidences. The other way, this night, reveals the logical consequences of the life of these people, because they are in a certain constellation isolated from the rest of the world. It has something of a Dostoevsky tale.
