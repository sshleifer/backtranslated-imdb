Dr. Bock teaches at the hospital and he succeeds very well. The thing about him is that he's depressed. Dr. Bock and his wife are separated, his children are deviant, he can not happen in the room and he feels he does not do a very good job of healing people. He becomes suicidal but meets Barbara who changes his ideas for the better. All around this story is a mystery of murder and a group of angry protesters outside. <br /> <br /> The film is well done and the character of Dr. Bock is well played. It's a little sad, a little funny and a bit dramatic. It was nice to see some stories told around the hospital, even if they had nothing to do with what Dr. Bock was doing. Super movie.
