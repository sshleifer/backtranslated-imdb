I consider this film amazing but misleading, because it seems so simple and straightforward: a survivor from Vietnam tells his poignant story and part of the story is reconstructed on the spot. Critics sometimes claim that Herzog's presence in the film is minimal, but how wrong they are. We know that all documentaries are "mediatized" to a certain extent and that this one carries the subtle hand of Herzog, especially in the breathtaking music, the incredibly expert selection of archival images and the cascading image management. . The evocative power of this film is astounding, starting with its title, the opening title card of the book "Revelation" and the original voiceover. It's a film that can be watched over and over with a growing wonder, not a simple product that is swallowed with its favorite drink on the way to the evening paper. This is one of those movies that can resonate with you for a lifetime.
