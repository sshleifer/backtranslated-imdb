It's my favorite movie of all time. And I still see him as John Huston's requiem. <br /> <br /> I must have seen it at least 20 times and I do not get tired of it. The atmosphere, the script, the songs, the dinner is like being invited to someone's place and watching the events without being able to participate even if you wish ... It's a rare treasure, this film and I can not write enough. praise about it. <br /> <br /> The casting is amazing, with a lot of faces from the Abbey Theater and Frank Patterson's wonderful tenor voice. The poem of Lady Gregory recited in the film is one of the most poignant ever written. The Anjelica scene descending the stairs listening to the song is one of the best performances of all the films. I cry every time I see him..for all the right reasons. <br /> <br /> We all lost love very early and cry for our young hope. <br /> <br /> Donal McCann has played in too few films for my taste, he loved the work on stage and held it. It is our loss that we no longer have his performances in the cinema, as he does so with this delicate role of expression and representation of a deep love for his wife that will never be reciprocated and he expresses such inner sadness to know that. <br /> <br /> If you want your action and plot movies to be packed, avoid that, there's really no beginning, middle or just a lens on the characters when a dinner in Dublin 80 years ago and all the small nuances and nuances of the personalities portrayed so beautifully. <br /> <br /> Congratulations to all who participated in this production. 10 of 10.
