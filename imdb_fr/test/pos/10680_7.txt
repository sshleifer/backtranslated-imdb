When I saw that this film was broadcast on television late at night, I first decided not to watch it. I'm happy to have started watching. Yes, the special effects are the same as Gerry Andersen's. Some of the actors / actresses are from his other productions, he obviously used the same composer later, because the soundtrack of cheese could only come from one of his productions, and the plot is as slow as wet weekend. Get all this and you have a movie that shows intriguing possibilities. Is there a planet on the other side of the sun? Is it a duplicate land? Is everything reversed and if they speak English upside down? I love this dated SF, if only for Gerry's awesome models of cars, planes, buildings and spaceships. Some of them are not as far as they seemed at the time. And did you see the logo of the European Space Center? This is reminiscent of the logo of today's euro. Suspend your convictions and spend a few hours watching them, you will not regret it.
