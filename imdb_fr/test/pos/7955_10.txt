This film would have shamed the "rippers" of Hollywood. The emotions depicted are controlled and minimized in a very comfortable way. The plot is pretty cliched with a lead role having a terminal illness (it's not a spoiler and it was well established quite early in the film). The execution method is somewhat unique in most love stories you have ever seen - not even a kiss exchanged and yet you will feel the huge flow of love between the two sons. At first, I imagined that this "restriction of emotions" was analogous to the typical "oriental values", but I finally decided not to take it. <br /> <br /> This film is so underrated that if you compare it to films like "Cin√©ma Paradiso", the CP would have felt openly manipulative by comparison. So, this is definitely not everyone's cup of tea. <br /> <br /> After watching the movie, I have the strong impression that Hollywood love films (or love movies all around, to be precise) glorify romance. or passion and label as "love". I'm sure we all have our own definitions and I would not say that these qualities are mutually exclusive. But I would venture to say that the film will let you ask if there is an extra dimension you have with a loved one. <br /> <br /> It's obvious that I really enjoy this movie. Considering the fact that the film is so simple in appearance, it's paradoxically one of the most "cinematic" movies I've seen recently.
