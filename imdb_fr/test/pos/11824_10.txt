For unknown reasons, this beautiful masterpiece has not been recognized and has been largely underestimated by many American film critics. It is easy to understand that I had a lot of trouble finding this movie. Finally, I watched it and it was so beautiful, sincere and moving that, for the first time in my life, I watched a film five times in a week after getting the tape. The story centers on the friendship between two young boys, Erik and Dexter, aged eleven and twelve, who are very different but who become the best (and only) friends. The beauty and sincerity of their friendship has been demonstrated in the cure, so sincere and natural that it never has been. There are so many beautiful, touching and poignant scenes (especially on the river) that strike the heart and can not leave any human being indifferent to them. The film also contains an incredibly powerful and emotional symbolism (particularly strong with Erik's shoe), which greatly enhances the visual impression of this magnificent work. The story, written by Robert Kuhn, is well written and unlike the overwhelming majority of modern Hollywood products, virtually every scene, every sentence and every sentence in the film is meaningful and brings something of significance to characters and relationships who unite them. Peter Horton, who, to my knowledge, had no significant experience in filmmaking before, showed his great abilities and his talent in this field. The cinematography is also superb with perfectly chosen locations for the film, but the most important is the perfect game, which makes The Cure one of the best movies of all time. Brad Renfro as Erik and Joseph Mazello as Dexter have created a wonderful atmosphere of sincere friendship and beautiful chemistry between two main characters. Only one film (I have not seen most of their works) is enough to name them as one of the best actors of their generation. Annabelle Sciorra also gives an excellent performance as a mother of Dexter. It is terribly sad that such talented actors have not been widely recognized, while many overrated stars are receiving huge publicity and pay. Finally, it would be unfair not to mention David Grusin's amazing soundtrack and Mark Cohn's great song (one of the best songs I've ever heard in the movies), My Great Escape. So, all I can say about The Cure is a simple word? awesome. In all respects, this film is a beautiful, sincere and inspiring work of all involved in the realization of this masterpiece. I must thank everyone who put their heart and soul into the film and Universal Pictures, who, among many commercial projects based on formulas, found a way to make such a magnificent film. But this kind of film happens so rarely in movie theaters that very often, the studios themselves do not realize the jewel they have created and are unable to provide a respective marketing campaign. The only minor drawback of The Cure for me is its short duration (only 97 minutes). <br /> <br /> I do not want to write more about the film because it is simply impossible to put into words its beauty and sincerity, so if you have the opportunity to watch The Cure, rent it or buy it and you would not be disappointed. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10. Sorry for my bad english.
