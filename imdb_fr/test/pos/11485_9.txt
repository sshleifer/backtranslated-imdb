Do not hate Heather Graham because she's beautiful, hate her because she's fun to watch in this movie. Like trendy clothes and funky environments, the actors in this film work well together. Casey Affleck is hysterical and Heather Graham literally lights up the screen. The minor characters - Goran Visnjic {sigh} and Patricia Velazquez are as talented as they are ravishing. Congratulations to Miramax and director Lisa Krueger!
