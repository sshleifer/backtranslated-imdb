If the war between states interests you slightly, this film is worth watching. It's a great historical narrative. No blazing swords, no cavalry charges, no carnage - just the story of a desolate group of Union soldiers who stumbled on the farm of a Confederate woman and her son and took as many as the conscience of their captain permits. This quantity rises and falls as events affect his sense of humanity in conflict with his sense of duty to his men and his cause. In the end, he reaches a compromise that each of us would have trouble putting forward. <br /> <br /> I appreciate the historic treatment of the war in Kentucky, a slave state that tried to remain neutral, but ultimately chose to remain in the Union under mysterious political conditions involving the detention of some legislators . About half of the Kentucky soldiers fought for each camp, but nothing was ever treated the same way as it was to live there. This film makes a great contribution simply in the "look and feel" of time and place.
