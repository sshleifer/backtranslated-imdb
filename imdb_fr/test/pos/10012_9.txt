My wife is a mental health therapist and we watched her from start to finish. I am the typical man and I can not stand girls' movies, but this movie is amazing. If you want to see what it is for someone who goes through this type of struggle, it's the movie for you. Looking at him, I felt sorry for him and others like him. <br /> <br /> *** Spoiler *** The fact that all the characters in the movie, including those in the psychiatric establishment, were the real characters in real life, made this more real. <br /> A must for a mental health professional!
