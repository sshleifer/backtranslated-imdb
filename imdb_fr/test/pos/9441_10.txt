Oooooh man, I was happy not to miss that. I wanted to post this review because this particular episode does what some recent movie did not do. It's a real tribute to the DOOM game. His plot is different, yes, and the characters are obviously in a totally different world (obviously the doctor who the universe) but the touch, rhythm, references and location are perfect. And for all the original Doom fans listening to the sound of opening and closing the door, it was the icing on the cake for me. <br /> <br /> Thanks to all the doctors, fans of Doom, to watch this video. it's a little gem!
