It is rare that I have the opportunity to review a film for IMDb that has such a close relationship with my own life. However, as a person with cerebral palsy (although less severe than Michael, one of the main characters in the film), I do not want to give this film a "free pass" just because it addresses a topic that is rarely addressed; and when it does, he is normally treated seriously. I had minor problems with the movie; and I'd like to address these issues first, so that people know that it's not my situation that has obscured my judgment on this great movie! <br /> <br /> * Certain parts of this book have undoubtedly pleased the public, to the detriment of realism. If I had a book for every time a well-meaning member of the public told me about the electric wheelchair race, I would be much richer. but personally, it is more in line with the public's perception of how we treat our disadvantages, rather than the reality of what is really happening. Similarly, spending time watching people with disabilities go to the pub - it's not a big deal for those of us who actually do it, though it may be admirable for the strangers who look in there. I appreciate that this is from Michael's previously protected point of view; but I still think he would focus more on the experience, rather than the fact that he was really there. As such, the time we had to see them having fun was a little too long. <br /> <br /> * I felt that the deadly nature of Rory's disease had come too late to our attention; which meant it was just a cheap, sentimental way of getting in between, rather than something everyone knew for a long time was going to have to be treated. <br /> <br /> To balance these critics, I have on a lot of praise, as well. Although I thought that some scenes showing them adapting to normal life were a little exaggerated; the scenario has also ventured into difficult places that I did not expect, and it has a lot of merit to do it. For example, raising the question of love and relationships; and showing the daily devices often used to help and assist the lives of people who are not valid. Moreover, despite the brutal emotional shock of death on us, the film as a whole is much less dark than anyone has the right to expect this type of film. <br /> <br /> Brenda Fricker can and has played variants of her role in autopilot for years; but Robertson and McAvoy share a particular interaction that needs to be noted. Inside, I say that a group of people somewhere has finally made a film that does justice to the thirst of many people with disabilities.
