I did not expect much when I rented this movie, because a lot of independent films seem to be a bit overestimated in recent days (well, Hollywood movies too), but this movie was fantastic, really great, it's It's a pity he did not reach a huge audience because it's just superb. I really like Alice's determination, it really makes me consider my life as a gift and I see how privileged I am just to have an education. But all that aside, this movie really proves that a good artist can tell a good story, whatever the budget, it's a great movie and everyone should watch it, they'll love it and get it lessons. I do not need to be roger ebert to know that this is one of the best movies I've seen all year, and certainly one of the most truthful.
