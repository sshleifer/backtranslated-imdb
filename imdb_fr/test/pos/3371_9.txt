The Box is one of the strangest movies I have ever seen. To explain my experience, let me use this word-image: imagine that you've been biting on leprechaun sticks and paint fumes during the past month while watching only reruns of Twilight Zone. The resulting coma leads you to the hospital, where the nurse seems to like getting adrenaline in your IV. The dream that you have in coma will look a lot like this movie. <br /> <br /> ABSTRACT: A man comes to the door of a couple. He gives them a box with a button. Press the button, they will receive a million dollars in cash and someone they do not know will die. I will try not to spoil anything, but from there, it will all come down to an intrigue so complex, so complex and so original that it will make you doubt your sanity. But hey, most of us have been sane for a while now, and the change is good. <br /> <br /> PROS: incredible scenario, good acting in general, not a slow moment once it is launched. It raises questions of human morality that are rarely, if ever, asked in popular culture. This film is deep, it makes sense. It's not summer special effects blockbuster fluff (not that there is anything wrong with that); This film had a relatively low budget and it was shown in some places. But I think maybe that's the very thing that loves me so much. <br /> <br /> CONS: The first twenty minutes, before it starts, are really slow. At the end of the film, you will be so confused that you just sit and think for a good half hour. I can assure you that this film will not attract rave reviews from your peers or most critics. it's way too strange and there are no explosions every three seconds. In fact, there is no explosion of this kind in this film (apart from your brain trying to understand exactly what just happened). Personally, I do not think that's a bad thing, but many will. <br /> <br /> RATING: Easily a 9/10. I have never had an experience like watching this movie. The only reason I can not give it a 10/10 is that it is too wrapped up in itself. There are still many important unexplained things in the end that bother me while I'm writing this. But overall, it's the best experience I've had in a movie theater for quite a long time. But be aware that you will not like this film if you can not sit, turn on your suspension of disbelief at about 150% and prepare your brain for impressive acrobatics. <br /> <br /> Visit www. thestuffblag.com for more reviews
