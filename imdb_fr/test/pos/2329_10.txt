I love military comedies (Sergeant Bilko, Stripes, In Army, Major Payne) and Down Periscope, it's hilarious, but it also has a heart. <br /> <br /> The Stingray SS-161 (USS Pampanito)) was beautiful. Absolutely beautiful, a work of art comes alive. So it was a diesel sub-engine, so what? I learned that the aircraft carrier USS Ranger (which was part of the Enterprise in Star Trek IV), a huge ship, was "conventional engine", which could mean that Ranger was also a diesel. <br /> <br /> My favorite scene: Pascal: Damn, Buckman, it can be on shagreen since Korea! This may expire in 1966! Buckman: (picks up his finger and tasted it) What's wrong, sir? He always tastes like corn cream. <br /> <br /> Pascal: (screaming) Except, it's a HAM DEVILLE !! Buckman: That would be a problem. <br /> <br /> It's a story, maybe a little effort, that seems plausible. Winslow respected Dodge and seemed interested in him. He wanted to give Dodge a chance. He gave her a Balao-class submarine in shock but still at sea, and entrusted her with the task of using the diesel submarine to escape the navy and to "attack" Charlston Harbor and Norfolk. . Admiral Graham (2 stars, a grudge against Dodge) assigned him the whimsical crew, hoping it would be a mistake that Dodge would lose. Can Tom Dodge update the crew and work as a team, and can he take an old obsolete submarine and beat the best of the Navy?
