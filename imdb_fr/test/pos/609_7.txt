A look at three geishas who have passed their peak. Now they look at their past with affection and lament their present. Kin (played by Haruko Sugimura of Floating Weeds) swore against men and lived well as a lender; everyone on the block owes him. The other two, Nobu and Tamae, want to be able to disembark the husbands, but are not fool enough to believe they'll ever do it. Meanwhile, their children - one has a son and the other a daughter - are about to get married (not with each other). Tamae is pissed off at how much prettier her daughter is and bitterly trying to convince her not to marry this man. Nobu's concerns about his son are more legitimate in nature, but they are also (naturally) selfish. After the departure of her son, she will be alone. A little in the movie, two of Kin's old customers come looking for her, a man so obsessed with her that he tried to have her commit suicide twice, the other of her most beautiful clients. Unfortunately, he comes for his money, not his love. The way I described the film gives a depressing sound, but it's really not the case. Sad, but not inevitably. It's more sweet and sour. Unfortunately, I only marginally loved the late chrysanthemums. The story seems better when I think about it, but it's very slow and boring. In fact, I fell asleep twice during the movie and I was not tired at all before I started it. It's the kind of movie that I can enjoy more than loving; it reminds me a lot of my reaction to two or three more famous Ozu films. 7/10.
