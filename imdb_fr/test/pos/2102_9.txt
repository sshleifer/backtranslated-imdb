Samanosuke, the ruthless warlord (who played superbly to Yutaro Gomi's odious guard) cruelly abuses the peaceful inhabitants of a small village. The giant stone statue Majin finally comes to life to destroy Samanosuke and his evil henchmen. Director Kimiyoshi Yasudo and screenwriter Tetsuro Yoshida tell the fascinating story all the power and simplicity of an old legendary tale: there is a very strong sense of an ancient and distant place (it is located specifically in feudal Japan) ), the good guys are noble and attractive, while the bad guys are really mean and hateful, the sometimes moving sword fights happen with considerable skill and enthusiasm, the special effects are fine and impressive, the serious tone and the rhythm supported do not falter for a minute and Majin's last ramp of wild destruction is extremely lively, exciting and more than a little scary. Moreover, the fantastical elements of the narrative enjoy great credibility by being firmly anchored in a dark, hard and cruel world, which is perfectly credible. This film earns bonus points by describing Majin as a furious and frightening force of revenge instead of a pure spirit of absolute good. Akira Ifukube, veteran composer, produces a rich, robust and catchy score. The sharp and moody cinematography of Fujio Morita is also a hit. The talented actors all offer admirably sound and sincere performances, including the particularly commendable work of Jun Fujimaki in the valiant and protective role of Kogenta and Tatsuo Endo as the nasty gunman Gunjuro. Highly recommended.
