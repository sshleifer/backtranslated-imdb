Me too, I found "Oppenheimer" as a brilliant series and one of the best deals ever presented on American PBS. David Suchet was particularly effective as Edward Teller, if I remember correctly, and the overall design was spectacularly good. The only reason the series does not give a full 10/10 rating is related to low-budget production values ​​in some regions. The current content is my best memory. <br /> <br /> The Oppenheimer mini-series will be released in the UK on July 31st! It will be a Region 2 / PAL set, but it looks like a Region 1 / NTSC set is coming soon. <br /> <br /> If you have a universal drive in the United States, you can order the series right now at Amazon UK. <br /> <br /> http://tinyurl.com/znyyq <br /> <br /> Huzzah !!
