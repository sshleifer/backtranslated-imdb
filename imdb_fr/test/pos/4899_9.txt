The film was apparently born from an idea of ​​one of the writers when he "saw" one of his creations in a supermarket. The people of Royston Vasey are moving towards "our" world to persuade writers not to stop writing about them and thus destroy their world. <br /> <br /> If this sounds too serious, do not be discouraged. In the very first minutes, we have: Bernice (the vile vicar) letting an unfortunate penitent be torn during the confession; Chinnery (the vet who inadvertently kills every animal he touches) tries to collect the sperm from a giraffe; Mickey (thick beyond belief) being, ah, thick; and Tubbs (sister wife and local shopkeeper) still being kind - but still disgusting. <br /> <br /> Some of the ordinary characters are missing, but a new idea of ​​the Gents introduces characters from the sixteenth century - and we have the men themselves in action too. If you're new to the League of Gentlemen, here's an easy and fun introduction. If you are a long time fan, you will find everything you expect, including the joys of Jeremy Dyson. <br /> <br /> All in all, he has the same slightly surreal humor that is the hallmark of the series, plus a few moments of introspection. Mr. Lipp, for example, retains a soft dignity by learning that he is considered by his creators to be a "joke character". While most characters remain as they are, some develop unexpectedly, which is perfectly natural when they occur. <br /> <br /> This film is a "swan song" for Royston Vasey, but it's also a showcase for men who prove that (panting!) can write other things - and this can be very funny. (But you knew it anyway.)
