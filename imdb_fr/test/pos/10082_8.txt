I have seen this film twice, both times on Cinemax. The first time in its unrated version which is the best of soft-core porn and the second time in a reduced version (cut all sex and most of the nudity) which was entertaining in a kind of beach movie typical of way. The unrated version has an incredible sex scene with Nikki Fritz, a guy and a bottle of oil out of the ordinary (no pun intended). Unfortunately, in the cropped version, this scene is almost completely cut out, as are all other sex scenes. Classified or unclassified, it is always fun to watch all the brothers and sisters of big stars (Stallone, Sheen, Travolta, etc.) who try to act. We also have appearances of Queen B Linnea Quigley and Burt Ward (Robin of the old Batman series).
