I am always surprised, since the title song of 2001 is called "Also sprach Zarathustra", which nobody (nobody that I read, anyway) did not note the parallels between the film and the famous work of Nietzsche, "Also sprach Zarathustra". The idea of ​​the rebirth of man in a child star; an infantile form of an unspeakably more advanced being, is explicitly part of N's "Zarathustra"; there is a well-known passage entitled "How a Camel Becomes a Lion, and a Lion Becomes a Child", in which N. describes the first incarnation of the overman as a child, transcending both the ascetic and the altruistic of the man (the camel). (always asking for more weight) and the rapacious, brutal and willful side of power (the lion). The fact that the song is played during the star-child sequence can not be a coincidence. And also, Zarathustra said that "man is a rope tied between beasts and superman". The structure of the film corresponds to this description: a brief history of man as a beast, until we really become a man by mastering the weapons and acquiring the reason, then a long sequence on the man ( the rope, so to speak), then a brief glimpse of the superman. The inscrutability of the manner in which these transformations have occurred, and the suggestion that an external force has provoked them, are also Nietzschean; in "Zarathustra", he explains very clearly that he has no idea how people will be able to implement these changes themselves and suggests that we will have to rely on a stranger (Zarathustra) to show us how " go below. " Bowman's psychedelic sequence at the near end might be considered Kubrick's best attempt in the 1960s to describe the mystical "submarine". <br /> <br /> I know these parallels are quite broad and have almost certainly been noticed elsewhere despite the fact that I did not see him personally. But I just wanted to mention them, if only to try to dispel the myth that Nietzsche was ultimately a dark philosopher. Few people find the end of 2001 dark, and that, in my opinion, is explicitly and undeniably Nietzschean. One could certainly argue that 2001 is primarily a dramatization of "Zarathustra" updated for the modern era. Feel free to ignore the pure snobbery of my all attaching to Nietzsche.
