I just watched this movie again and I can only wonder if we will see more movies like this one? The timeless music, the tender voices of William Holden and Jennifer Jones let this grown-up man cry in happy and romantic scenes and I am not someone who cries very often in life. Where are our William Holden and will they make these moving and wonderful films? It's sad to realize that they probably will not, but do not think about it, just try to get rid of it. Even so, they will not have Holden and he will not appear again on this hill. You can only enjoy this movie and watch it again.
