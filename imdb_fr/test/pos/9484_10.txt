After seeing this DVD, I was floored. It's so wonderful. This does not only capture Led Zeppelin in conventional representations, they cover a few years. This only shows the growth of the band and their music. This DVD is a MUST HAVE! The DVD lasts more than 5 hours, with extras. The extras are also very good pieces, some of the band performing in Denmark and other promotional spots. This film contains images that we thought were lost, happily found and carefully restored in 5.1 Dolby Digital format, under the direct supervision of Jimmy Page himself! Includes many timeless classics, such as, Stairway To Heaven, Go California, What is and should never be, Moby Dick, and many more. Great acoustic songs are also included. This will correct any idea that Jimmy Page is not a legend of the supreme guitar!
