I remember seeing it in the theaters when it was released, having no idea what it was going to be about and so pleasantly surprised that I swore to buy the video when it was released. <br /> <br /> Even if I will not go too far in the dissection of this film, I will say that I gave him an 8/10, for all the reasons that you can read in the comments of other users . <br /> <br /> Here's what I'm going to say: <br /> <br /> The first 10 minutes of this movie are incredible. It's as close to one of the reading books I've ever seen. Once, I filmed this movie at a party where everyone was relaxing and was about to leave. I just wanted to see what would happen if I showed them the first ten minutes. <br /> <br /> Everyone who watched the opening held to the end.
