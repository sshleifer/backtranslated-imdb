"Thriller" remains the biggest pop music promo with intrigue, great graphics and a complete song to wrap the movie. Michael Jackson was at the top of the tree at the time (and his plastic surgery diet was not much changed for it to matter). Here he is in shape - the song is fantastic, he directs the zombies danced like no other. <br /> <br /> Ola Ray plays the girl who looks incredulously at the transformation of her adorable boyfriend (Jackson, natch) a werewolf! Then, to the vibrating rhythms of the opening line "It's almost midnight", he walks in the cemetery with the other zombies and creatures of the night. <br /> <br /> The culmination of all this is the fruity voice of the great horror star Vincent Price speaking in the middle of the record. Creepy.
