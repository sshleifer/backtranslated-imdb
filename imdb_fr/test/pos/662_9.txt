OK, so the next review is more synonymous with synopsis than real spoilers, but prevention is better than cure to avoid being blacklisted, right? Right! Consider yourself officially savvy and keep reading ... <br /> <br /> In this parody / tribute to the greatest moment in the history of horror film - the 1980s - a group of silly teenagers get gather to organize a notorious murder house sitting McGee, who massacred all his family a few years back and buried them in the backyard. As I'm sure you can guess, things go from bad to worse faster than you can say "Where is the ox?" and in the typical horror movies of the 80s, the dead are bloody, the dialogue is corny and beautiful women undress at every opportunity. Good times ... <br /> <br /> No clicks or descriptions of 1980s horror movies are left here unrepresented. In fact, no stone has been left out? we have the cool hero, his innocent girlfriend, the Goth chick, the tough thug (think John Bender), the hot blonde who loses his shirt, the shy dork in love with the hot blonde who loses his shirt, a couple of beautiful half-naked lesbians and two big geeks. <br /> <br /> As you can see, the casting is rather big. Usually, the biggest casts are those where things can collapse quickly, with one or two bitter apples bulging the whole barrel. Not in this case though. Not a single cast member left me disappointed. The acting game was very well done. Everyone, from the hero dressed in his Thriller jacket played by Jovan Meredith, to the gothic nana played by Renee Dorian and the Geeks One & Two, played by Cory Assink and Jonathan Brett ?? they all played straight, brought their first game and took it out of the park. If you're a fan of Gary & Wyatt in Weird Science, you'll immediately fall in love with geeks. <br /> <br /> The director / co-writer Jeff C. Smith is a guy to watch future, believe me on this point. If that's what he can do on a small budget, he will have only good things when he has more money for his future projects. The characters were dead. the atmosphere was perfect; the laughter was enormous; the blood was flowing and squirting and spraying nicely ?? it was like watching a horror movie of the 1980s. Call it "BREAKFAST AT NIGHT OF THE DEMONS" !!! The slogan says it all and says it honestly - "EXCESSIVE VIOLENCE, FREE NUDITY, BUDGET ZERO" - no misleading advertising here, guys! As fans of this genre, we have to look to the indies and support those hard-working people who break their moguls to tell us original stories, lest we be in a world filled with big, diluted studios. -13. 'horror' or unnecessary remakes like The Hitcher. No thanks - no more than that for me. <br /> <br /> In closing, I must honestly say that STUPID TEENAGERS MUST DIE! is by far one of the best independent movies I've had the pleasure of watching this year. This is a good time, which delays repeated viewing. From dialogues to characters to the wardrobe ... even the latest theme of love in the final credits (which, if it does not cause loud bursts of laughter, recalls the ballads of the mid-1980s REO Speedwagon - Surprised R's on every word starting with the letter "R" - so I'm going to eat my DVD right away) ... if you're a fan of the horror of the 80s or the horror in general, n do not hesitate anymore, this film deserves to be in your collection !!
