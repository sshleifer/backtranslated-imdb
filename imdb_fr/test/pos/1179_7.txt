I had a few laughs on this one, more than many other so-called comedies. The big ship was a knockout and it was fun to see many of her landscapes: as well as seeing some of Dyan Cannon's curves. It was not the peak of Lemmon and Mattheau's career, but it was not a total dog, as some people suggest.
