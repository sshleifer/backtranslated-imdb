If you like puzzles and suspense, you will enjoy this movie. In fact, it was mostly the part of Adrian Paul that inspired me to resume, I knew almost nothing of the film in advance. Sarah (Carly Pope), a student in philosophy and metaphysics, begins to play a mysterious guessing game to try to understand "the reason" and get involved in "the game" by solving riddles. Vern (Adrian Paul) is a shop owner, also a fanatic of puzzles, and is also involved in the game. According to the myth, if you solve the game, the meaning of existence (called "the design") is revealed . The character of Brendan Fehr is a type of "village idiot" who hangs around the store and turns out to be more than he seems. Overall, I thought the movie was pretty good. And it's definitely an original concept, a rare find nowadays! Personally, I like puzzles and word games, so even though most of them were not very difficult, it was still a fun movie. Well worth the rental. <br /> <br /> So, if you have not seen it, take it! :-D <br /> <br />
