Dan Burgess is a nice guy. He happens to be a Christian. Dan can not have a date with a girl and thinks all her friends are having fun. He is constantly disturbed by unbelievers and makes fun of him. <br /> <br /> Dan prays one night, and wishes never to have been a believer in Jesus. <br /> <br /> We answer his prayer for a day. Things get hairy from there. An angel appears to Dan and explains that his prayer is accepted. <br /> <br /> So, all the impact that Dan had on the creation of a Christian club. <br /> <br /> He became a friend of Scot Parks and makes a difference, is cleared for a day. <br /> <br /> Dan's eyes are open. His life really made a difference.
