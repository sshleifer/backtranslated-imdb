Those who do not like this film seem to think that a loved one "belongs to them" and must be thrown to the ground if they leave with someone else. Fortunately, human nature is much deeper than that; deeply loving someone inevitably causes suffering, even if we are lucky only when he dies. <br /> <br /> This film is faithful to the setting, atmosphere and dialogue of Nigel Balchin's original novel "A Way Through The Wood", and by identifying a seemingly irreconcilable dilemma, he captures the silent despair behind many seemingly idyllic lives (and the description of English country life in the upper classes is very precise). <br /> <br /> I loved the movie and hope it will appear as soon as a DVD compatible with the UK
