No doubt a big show that, if it were broadcast today, would attract a huge audience. Bodyguards, consisting of 6 episodes and a trailer, deserved some other series to put it in top gear. With exceptional performances by Sean Pertwee and dynamic Louise Lombard have well described the scenario with professional groups, The Sweeney and Thief Takers.The scenario is based on the diplomatic protection services and on great filming, scenarios and locations of I do not think it was broadcast on terrestrial TV channels, such as Sky or Freeview, which is a shame as if it were to be broadcast nowadays, so I'm hoping that one day the Carlton TV guys will decide to release it on DVD, well done, Nick.
