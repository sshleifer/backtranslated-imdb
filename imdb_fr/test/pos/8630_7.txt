I wanted to see this movie because I'm a big fan of Abbott and Costello and I saw it, I liked it. <br /> <br /> This movie is funny, not hysterical, but fun. I mean I laughed at a lot of fun parties and just enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> Although it's not the best of Perfect Straight Man and Perfect Buffoon, you should see it if you love Abbott and Costello. <br /> <br /> Of all the Abbott and Costello films I've seen, I can not say I've seen one that I hated. It's decent, fun and entertaining. Abbott and Costello have at least made some rather decent films in their last years. <br /> <br /> All in all, I liked this movie, it's not one of their best movies, but I liked it. <br /> <br /> 7/10
