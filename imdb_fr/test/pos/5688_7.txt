I had never heard of this Australian horror before Michael Elliott's enthusiastic review; In fact, after reading it, I decided to check if the DVD was available in my local store (although it is a German edition, ie without the supplements R1). So I decided to watch the movie immediately. <br /> <br /> While I would not go as far as giving the maximum points ?? only a few selected titles have entrusted me, let alone an obscure modern film ?? I must say that I was very impressed with BLACK WATER. Rather than revisiting previous crocodile films, such as ALLIGATOR (1980) and LAKE PLACID (1999), it evokes the memory of two people who saw a small group of people go on a trip, get lost and end up thank you for the elements and creatures inhabiting the place ?? namely LONG WEEKEND (1978), himself a little visible but impressive Australian production, and OPEN WATER (2005). <br /> <br /> This compact and simplified film features a couple and the younger sister of the woman who decide to go fishing in a remote and forbidden part of the Australian wilderness, known as crocodile territory; very soon (in fact, even before 15 minutes have elapsed!), their boat is capsized and the guide killed by an alligator ?? then our adventurers without luck take refuge in a tree. The critic DVD Talk believes that the film suffers from spending too much time at this place ?? with the three arguing over what they should do, try to get the boat back, looking for a way out of the jungle through the trees (to meet only water) and the occasional attacks of the monster. However, I think that the decision makers go as far as possible in the situation: this is due to the palpable suspense and, as Michael said, to the credibility of the characters (especially the two women) ?? but also the fact that the crocodile here is one of the scariest and most memorable of recent years (I wonder how they managed to do it "perform")! <br /> <br /> I also agree with Mike that the film contains really effective moments of shock ?? the alligator jumping out of the water to bite the petrified heroes; his head appears in front of the women heading for the boat; although one of them reaches the vehicle, the monster manages to lift its huge weight and get on the boat with it! towards the end, while the same girl manages to find a rifle (on the mutilated body of their guide), loads it and waits for the alligator to appear, it sneaks behind it (incidentally, the creature is endowed with the trick shark in JAWS (1975)). Keeping this in mind, the finale is just as pleasant (albeit on a much smaller scale) than the classic Spielberg blockbuster ?? even if the tracking is bad. Another definite asset is the scattered score of the movie ?? which is generally rather charming, but which annoys at the right moment. <br /> <br /> At the end of the day, BLACK WATER emerges as a breath of fresh air against the demoralizing doldrums in which the horror cinema has recently fallen; for this reason alone, it deserves greater exposure to remind us that there is still hope for our beloved genre (without the real need to use the gadget of a CLOVERFIELD [2008] to attract the attention) ??
