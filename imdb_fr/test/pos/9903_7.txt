I had the chance to see this movie at the Phoenix Film Festival and I must say that I enjoyed it very much. When I asked the director if he had attended film school, I was very impressed. Films like these do not come from people without talent. To debut in commercials and then produce a family family comedy in the heart of reality, it shows a range. I will definitely keep an eye on what he will do next. As a good independent film, the film is very character-oriented. In comparison with your average Hollywood movie, which is mostly based on plot. The film is centered on a New York Jewish family, the Applebaum, who were all invited back for their father's "suicide" party. The film is full of dialogue, witty, fast. The fact that the Jewish family is obsessed with being Jewish and whoever is Jewish justifies the unrealistic situation of a "suicidal" holiday in reality. Director Jeff Hare does a remarkable job of extracting characters from actors and bringing them to life on the screen. The design of the production gives life to the sets by paying great attention to the small details, which gives the impression that the decor looks like a house inhabited for 40 years. The editing follows the dialogue so that you sit in your seat wondering who will stab who with the next spiritual phrase or the next line of typing. And if so, the movie slows down to allow the audience to delve a little deeper into the meanings and motives hidden inside these adorable characters. If you're a fan of Woody Allen or movies like "As Good as it Gets", check out this movie.
