This film may be a little too long, but it still has charm 45 years later. The main roles seem more appropriate for Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh. I do not care about Gary Cooper, but Ingrid Bergman is fine, especially with dark hair. The film is worth the detour for secondary distribution: Flora Robson is great as a mulatto maid. She is a white woman in blackface, and may have an expression of evil or a voodoo mistress. Jerry Austin as a servant dwarf has a delicious role to play, which allows you to laugh despite long scenes. Speaking of scenes, Florence Bates steals most of those in which she finds herself as a social dowager woman. I did not understand the result of the railroad battle at the end of the film and the last scene was a pure Hollywood dreck. It's a strange feeling when you realize that the film's title refers to a railway rather than a piece of luggage!
