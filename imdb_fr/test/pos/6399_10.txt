The biggest problem faced by the Key West TV program was that it was poorly advertised. If you saw the commercials, you would think it was a fuss and you would be very disappointed. It was a lot more complex than that. <br /> <br /> I was in Key West just before Hurricane Andrew, and I think I ended up having a drink or two with some members of the Rum Runners cast. Of course, it was before the hit of the series. I saw the sailboat that was in the opening scroll a few times and I discussed with the guy that you see hacking coconuts in the opening too. He was a real local. Yes, I would like to see this on DVD.
