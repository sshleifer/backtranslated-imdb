True Love, I really liked and loved this movie. It was fun, fun and inspiring. I just saw it on DVD. How did I miss this one? It's a winner! I mean Flex was "This guy". I wanted to marry him. It was the first time I saw him as a right leader and he was stopping him. I thought that Tangi Miller was the best of all time and that I was also a Felicity head. A woman without fear who fears only her Nana. Thank you for giving women the color range in your work and it looks great! Tasha Smith was a blast! Aloma Wright was priceless as a Nana. This cute romantic comedy is "A must". Oh, and the newcomer, Marcus Patrick, deserves the surprise ladies ... True Love. karen
