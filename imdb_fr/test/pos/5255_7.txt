My sisters and my cousin (wife) made me see this girl movie. This is not the kind of movie I would rather watch, but it was not so bad. I would not want to see this movie, but after watching it, I could not say it was bad, but it was not my kind of movie. It was very accurate to say what women really talk and do in certain situations. As a guy, I was not too amused by the jokes, but the women really were. They told the film and yes, it was funny to see you on the big screen. "OH EM GEE I DO THIS FOR HAHA" I have never seen the original and I would not care. If you're a girl, it's a must, but maybe the girls would say that this movie is nil, probably. I do not see a 13-year-old leaving: "Wow, I remember being thrown that way when I was 30 years old." so
