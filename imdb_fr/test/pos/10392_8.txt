I was stunned by this movie. I rented / rediscovered Antonioni's films, and this film showed me the culmination and the fruits of his 50 years of achievement. What an eye for the setting, the color and the details! I had never seen such visual beauty and poetry filmed before. I had to stop after the first story and hold back my tears. Yes, beauty moves me, as if she had pushed Keats to write Ode on a Greek urn. This film is made for the mature audience, emotionally and intellectually. Those who hope to see a physical action and a soap opera will be disappointed. I will have to watch this movie several times before I can truly appreciate and judge it. This film should be viewed by all directors of photography and directors. <br /> <br /> Maybe a very good film, on the agenda of Kurosawa's Dreams.
