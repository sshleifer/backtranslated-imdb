This film moved me so much in 1981 that I went back to the theater four times to see it again! Something I have never done for another movie. No movie evokes the feeling of growing up in the 60s as Four Friends. The fact that many people share this experience is probably as close to what I lived in the 60s. Jodi Thelen is radiant, beautiful and unforgettable! Why she did not become a star after that, I'll never know. The acting is irreproachable, as is the scenario of Steve Tisch. I always wanted to know how much the story was autobiographical. Alas, Steve is no longer here to answer this question. I almost exhausted my VHS copy of this great movie! Highly recommended!
