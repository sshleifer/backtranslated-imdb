City Streets is incredibly modern technically for a film shot in 1931. Also, who could not be hypnotized, fascinated by Gary Cooper's powerful magnetism, galvanizing public attention. The plot is quite elaborate and clear. The scenarios, the decoration, are exceptional in every detail. All actors are above average. I can not stop to guess how the director and his staff, including editing, sound, lighting and photography, could have been so brilliant. I had no problem, knowing that the scenes on the road (bumpy ride) with the big screen of animated films in the background were the best possible in 1931. Overall, I found this film beautiful and alive, thanks to Gary Cooper's charisma.
