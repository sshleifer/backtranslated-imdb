This is my favorite Hal Hartley movie. All his films are small jewels. I love independent films and I hope that Hal Hartley will never turn into a mainstream audience. What if the Lord Jesus came back and loved his people so much that he could not open the last book and destroy unbelievers? It was nice to see P. J. Harvey in a movie because I'm a fan of his music. Do not look at this if you're a fan of Hollywood cookie cutter movies, you'll be disappointed.
