Have you ever wondered what it feels like to feel FREE? I am sure that all of us know the meaning of freedom and never seriously think of using it to our advantage. HARI OM shows the public what freedom really means. In this film, freedom is described as a style represented by Isa's discovery of India. Isa discovers her true love when she embarks on a rickshaw trip with Mr. HARI OM. She looks at life differently and depicts the freedom that every woman restricts herself when she is in a relationship. <br /> <br /> This film is definitely worth seeing, and I first saw it at the Dubai International Film Festival (DIFF), and I left the cinema room with total satisfaction . <br /> <br /> "Look at it"!
