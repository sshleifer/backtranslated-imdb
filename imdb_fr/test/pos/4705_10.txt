I had the opportunity to speak with co-creator Rebecca Cammisa at the 2002 High Falls Film Festival in Rochester, NY. She said that her style was to be completely open and uninhibited in making movies but was very happy to be so severely coerced into the tight quarters of the group home. The narrow corridors and small rooms were skilfully filmed with realism that would have been lost with more controlled and deliberate camera work. <br /> <br /> Sister Helen herself is a remarkable character, emerging from a tragedy of her own life an unusual combination of compassion, tenacity and rigor in the streets. The way the film presents its past is excellent, spending only a few carefully chosen minutes. <br /> <br /> In all, I can not begin to praise this film. It's really a movie treasure and the subject a treasure of humanity.
