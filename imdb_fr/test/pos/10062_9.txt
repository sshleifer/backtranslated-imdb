For cheese from the late 80's, it's not that bad. There are a lot of very funny disposable dudes ("It was a great flight!" - "Thank you!") And Madonna gives a great performance. Here, nothing is worthy of being rewarded, but it is as good for the Razzies as for the Oscars. I am curious to know if the film would have been better received if it had used its usual voice (of pre-British influence) rather than the hyper-bronxy accent used instead. Never mind. By the way, I met one of the actors who played one of the motorcycle cops in my work; he said it was a fun movie to work on but gave me the sad news that the actor who played the Buck the UPS delivery guy died about a year after Who's That Girl
