Critters 4: This movie was continued after the 3rd Critters films. This one was released in the same years as Critters 3, in 1991. Critters 4 takes you into space while they are looking for humans in a spaceship. I doubt that there was a Critters 5 because the end for the 4th was a good end, which brought the end to the creatures, because there was nothing left. I give this film 10 out of 10.
