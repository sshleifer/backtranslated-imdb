I had never seen such a powerful story film. I discovered a city, a country, a lost revolution and even a Nobel Prize thanks to this masterpiece of cinema. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen this movie, you can not say that you saw anything. <br /> <br /> A great lesson in courage, humility and life. <br /> <br /> I have not seen anything so good since. <br /> <br /> TE Saturday 9 January 1999
