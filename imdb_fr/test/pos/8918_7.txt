I'll admit that this movie was awful, old-fashioned, sexist, badly dubbed and badly edited, but I loved it anyway. I saw this film for the first time at the age of 14 and I still have it. For your information, it's very close to hard-core porn, if I remember correctly. He certainly had my juice running. This film gives a whole new meaning to Swedish eroticism. It is a humorous vision of human sexuality, as observed by excited extraterrestrial women who seek only sperm for their dying race.
