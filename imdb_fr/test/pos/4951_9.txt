I really like the opening of the film, when Colonel Ted Masters realizes on his hunting radar that four enemy planes approached at about 10 o'clock. The good news is that the film does not mention at the very beginning that the colonel, accompanied by a wing fighter, who was a lieutenant, was trying to do an exercise of "freedom of navigation" along the eastern part of the Mediterranean Sea but had gone a little too far. past the restricted airspace area reserved for a rogue country in the Middle East as it accidentally flies over it. <br /> <br /> I also like all the intersections on the radar displays and computer screens of the colonel's fighters while the enemy aircraft aggressively chooses the two American fighter pilots to commit for violating their airspace. This first aerial fight reminds me immediately of the famous movie of fighter pilot, "Top Gun". From the depilation of enemy bandits to the 30-millimeter cartridges of the enemy plane that hit the colonel's reactors, forcing the plane to fall, forcing him to eject it, all this reminds us of one thing ... the techniques Fighter Hunter can keep you alive ... but a single wrong move can cause your fall. <br /> <br /> The only problem with the movie was the "Snake Sequence" scene. It was a bit too long. Yes, the opening of the movie was great when you see the conflict ... which was the dogfight commitment. Only when a boy tells Doug Masters that his father was shot down after the Cessna planes landed in the "Snake" race, forces us to return to when the conflict has already begun. I suppose the snake sequence in the center should be interrupted a bit by Colonel Masters handcuffed in the middle of the Bilyad Desert as he made his way to the detention center ... while the snake's musical sequence " continues. The film does not ... if it were, the details of the conflict would have been clearer at this point. Still good otherwise. <br /> <br /> When we learn that the trial of Colonel Ted Masters for high treason (infringement of territorial air sovereignty) is over and that he is sentenced to be suspended from the gallows in three days, Doug Masters decides go into action. While the Air Force tries in vain to save the man, Doug decides to convince his friends and Colonel Sinclair (played by Louis Gossett Jr.) to have a plan to save Masters. At the risk of facing a court martial and spending more than a year in a military palisade, he runs afoul of Air Force policy and develops a plan to save Masters without the consent of the US government. <br /> <br /> Doug and his friends sneak into several classified areas of the base to get a lot of information about the area where Masters is held for the upcoming hanging and the area around Bilyad (which turns out to be a fake Middle East country for the film). One of the plans was to shoot firecrackers outside the Air Force darkroom for classified photos and maintenance items on the fighter, combat base, intelligence and all other equipment. military around Bilyad. <br /> <br /> When everything was said and done, and Sinclair studied all the intelligence, he almost rejected the plan because Doug was far too arrogant. It was only when they recovered the two F-16s and tried a dry run on a shooting range that I understood what they were going to do abroad. I realized that Doug's shooting and dropping his bombs are not good until he hears rock music. I remember when he dropped a Mach 82 bomb on a horizontal target and the bomb was 20 feet short ... I realized that Doug was unusual. He likes music when he shoots with hunting ammo. <br /> <br /> The last part of the conflict, the last action of air combat in "Iron Eagle" was better than the climax of the hostile sequence of Top Gun. I liked how the final conflict unfolded, especially when Doug Masters faced a stealthy star pilot from the Middle East who actually ran the lawsuit against Ted Masters. Short but sweet when Doug released the enemy fighter after a second test with a side-winding missile. Looks like this Colonel Bilyad was akin to "Darth Vader" in Star Wars ... in the air, he can be very evil, because if you saw Star Wars, Darth Vader was actually Anakin Skywalker, who was a pilot as space. Unusual connotation for this, but still works!
