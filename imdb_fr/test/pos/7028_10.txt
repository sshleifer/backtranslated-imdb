I saw this film for the first time with my fianc√©e many years after its release. I thought I'd hate it, but to my surprise, it's so cheesy it's great. We spent many hours re-enacting parts of the film ("Sylvia ?! Yes Mickey?" Or "I'm sorry you had to see this baby." Sometimes in this world we see things we do not want. "My finances slap every time I imitate Neil, and the music is classic and fun, especially when traveling by car.Of course, I do not confess anything to my male friends. As a guilty pleasure, I look seriously Dirty Dancing once a month or more and it's always good every time Jennifer Gray is also so cute in this movie It's a shame that her career has never really taken his flight.
