It may be my favorite so bad that it's a great movie of all time. Like many pre-teen children of the 80s, a new vision of the revenge of a ninja spawned a ninja phase of my childhood. Man I thought Sho k. was badass at the time. Jet Li could watch him with both legs in a casting! This film has crazy crossings that include flashdance, the exorcist and the television show Lee Van Cleef Ninja. Ugh. But as one of my friends says, everyone can have a good movie, it takes real genius to make a film that starts with a surviving ninja at 17 shots long enough to take back the body of an instructor in arobic for revenge. sensational. While previous commentators have spoken of the sword flying out of the rope closet, no one has yet described the powerful love scene. Where the sexy policeman removes his shirt to reveal a mane of hair. The pleasure never ends. Rent this !!!!!!
