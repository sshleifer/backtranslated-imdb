Mom must be one of the most uncomfortable movies of all time to watch. It features an elderly lady whom you would like to have as a nanny who becomes the meanest mother with the monster you would ever meet on a dark night! <br /> <br /> This supper nanny eats the occupants of a young woman at the opening of the film and it falls more and more sick as and when. When we describe mom, we think of a cross between howling and brain death! <br /> <br /> A must for horror fans who have the courage to stand it (if you've been watching re-animator or dead brain, you're floating your boat) and ready to extinguish your brain about an hour ... Let the blood flow! ... 8/10
