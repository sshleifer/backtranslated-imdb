I like the way he experiments. Ab Tak Chappan was delighted to watch so much Satya and his company. Jatin, the newcomer, also lived up to her role and Nana Patekar was at her best. Suchak was really annoying but I think he fits the character he played - he had really ugly teeth. The story has come a long way and no song in the movie makes it better. I only wish that he signs Urmila for his other upcoming films. I think they are the best director / actress combination I've seen. I have not seen Naach yet, but I look forward to it. For some reason, I do not find Antra Maali as exciting to watch on the screen - unlike Urmila.
