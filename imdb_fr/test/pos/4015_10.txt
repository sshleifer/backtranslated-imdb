*** Spoilers ahead *** My late childhood had two movie icons: Star Wars and this film by Czech genius Karel Zeman. An encyclopedia of Jules Verne where nineteenth-century illustrations come to life in exquisite black-and-white photographs, combined with stop motion and conventional animation. The spirit of adventure of Verne is fully present throughout the film, as well as a very modern questioning on the moral limits of power and advanced technologies. In fact, he introduces atomic energy into the Verne universe in a very elliptical and elegant way. The disappearance of the villain is also elliptical and elegant, with an explosion (probably nuclear) that makes flying his hat over the sea. The resolution of the film is symbolic and very satisfactory, which is very rare today, while many movies do not seem to know how to end. <br /> <br /> I had the chance to discover this little gem during reruns. Local television in the late 70s allowed me to better appreciate the fiction and cinema of Verne. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10 for Karel Zeman, master of the underrated imagination.
