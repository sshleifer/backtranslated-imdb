An excellent story well told by the filmmaker. The interactions between man and leopard brought many questions to the viewer's mind about who was human. Humans have killed animals for no reason just to survive. At the end of the movie, you were wondering who was the real "hero" of the movie. A story well told. The human actor did a great job but the leopard stole all the scenes he was in.
