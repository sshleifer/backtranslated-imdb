A Gatto nel Cervello, or Nightmarish Concert, as we know more often with the English-speaking public, begins when the director of horror films Lucio Fulci (played by the man himself, Lucio Fulci) goes to lunch after filming a scene very bloody and violent, but he commands & has a horrible view of cannibalism. The grotesque visions, hallucinations and dreams continue and begin to affect his mental state, Fulci decides to ask for help and contacts Professor Egon Schwarz (Dvid L. Thompson) for psychiatric help. Schwarz claims that Fulci can not separate fantasy from reality and agrees to help him. However, Schwarz has a more sinister back ground when a serial killer starts brutally killing prostitutes. Fulci thinks he could be responsible for it .... <br /> <br /> This Italian production was co-written and directed by Lucio Fulci, who also plays in the film as a horror film director Lucio Fulci, who does not really feel that he is making a lot of effort. Anyway, A Gatto nel Cervello is gore if nothing else and nothing for that, I rather liked. The screenplay by Fulci, John Fitzsimmons, Giovanni Simonelli, and Antonio Tentori is nothing more than a baseless excuse for mounting together many bloody images of other Italian films. I guess it serves his purpose well to see Fulci on the screen fascinates a lot if you're a fan of him or know his movies, the end is very rushed, almost like they were running out of money because they just had a policeman tell Fulci that they killed the killer and that's all. Another thing about this ending when the two cops placed the white sheet on the dead killer on the ground and they leave leaving the place without any other police presence. I mean, would the police in Italy leave a corpse in the middle of a field alone? It's moving at a good pace and if you like your cool, you have to see it. However, if you do not like composure, you will hate it with passion, everything depends on your disposition, so the choice is yours. <br /> <br /> The director Fulci has never been the most artistically adept filmmaker and is shown here because his images are bland, flat and they look like they were shot for television, the images of other films (7 in total) are not. Does not fit what Fulci shot and it's obvious that it has been pieced together from different movies. If you are looking for composure, you hit the jackpot, people are dismembered with chainsaws, meat grinders, faces are melted, there are some beheadings, there are slaughterings, a body is crushed under a car, a tongue is torn off, someone has his throat crushed when a wheelchair passes over, there are tons of stab wounds, someone has guts removed with a hook, there is a corpse rotten with worms, a hand is cut off, someone has a broken head they fall into the eye, a bloody death by piano wire cutting into someone's throat, there are tons of sliced ​​limbs , gallons of blood splattered and a scene of cats devouring the head and others. That said, some special effects are a bit falsified and look corny. <br /> <br /> With a supposed budget of about $ 100,000, it shows, it's pretty cheap, it does not have visual style or artistic merit, but again, why would you you know when you can see a sequence of Nazi orgies and a gore wall to wall? The game in this scene is terrible, including Fulci. <br /> <br /> A Gatto nel Cervello is a top quality movie if you're a gore hound like me, but if you're looking for something with a little more stuff, or more. so these are not for you. It's the kind of film that divides people in the middle, you'll love what you do or hate it.
