I saw this on DVD with subtitles, which made the crossing a little frustrating because of the length of the film. But I was riveted through all that. The fact that I am fascinated by the characters and that I am always absorbed by the story, despite the subtitles, testifies to the power of the film. It is an extraordinary job. I have it on my list of ten favorite movies of all time. It's easily the best foreign film I've seen in the last twenty years. I would like to know the whole story of the shooting of this film. It must have taken a long time and required the use of hundreds of sites. Its use of some hardcore scenes (on TV in the motel room) may unfortunately lead some people to not see it, but if you do not mind, you will be deeply moved by all the stories that are told!
