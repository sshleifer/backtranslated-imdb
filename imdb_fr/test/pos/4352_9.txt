Warning: Herzog is a filmmaker and therefore tends to be a little too dramatic. So obsessions about closing the doors may or may not be part of the character's life, but a dramatic embellishment of the filmer - or both agreed at the premiere in San Francisco. But Herzog's usual fascination with character, dreams and perseverance is well adapted to this story, first published in Soldier of Fortune, and now a complete autobiographical book. (The commentary by Soldier of Fortune provoked strong reactions from SF's politically correct public, and the filmmaker and the protagonist had to assure the public who had just seen the film that SOF's interests were misplaced.)
