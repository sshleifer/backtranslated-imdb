I was 9 years old when I saw this for the first time on television. a Friday night. I remember the full advertising page in the TV guide with the image of the Rex. It's amazing how some things stay in your mind after 30 years. Anyway, if your kid loves monster movies, this one is pretty fun, especially with Boone and Keats raging against each other. The special effects are not harryhausen, but it's worth spending an hour and a half on TV late at night. I have not seen it for a few years for some reason, these classics disappear from cable TV. If you catch it late at night, do not be too critical, grab some snacks and enjoy. it may be corny, but I thought it was a lot better than the kong remake that was released on theaters a year ago.
