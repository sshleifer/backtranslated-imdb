As a film buff, I had obviously read all the dreadful reviews and the funny and sarcastic comments about this movie (my favorite being Woody Allen's phrase) "If I had life to live, I would not change anything. .. except to see the musical remake of Lost Horizon "). As a result, I have never been able to look at him without smiling at the choreography / ensemble / songs, etc. Recently, I came across a widescreen DVD and watched it for the first time in years, with a friend who had never heard of the film. reputation. He really enjoyed it and after trying to calm down all the negative prejudices I had about the movie, just like me. Lost Horizon is not particularly bad, and it's much nicer and more visible than many other movies of the early 1970s. It's not even especially camp. The lyrics of some songs are rather repetitive and simplistic, but that does not really appear when you hear them for the first time or the flaws are reported in advance, so you're ready to make fun of them. Like all the critics who said that the cast could not sing right, this criticism falls on the water as Liv Ullmann, Olivia Hussey and Peter Finch have been dubbed (brilliantly too, because the voice fits their voices perfectly), and Sally Kellerman has a very beautiful and totally unique singing style. Vocally, Kellerman's duet with Olivia Hussey on "Things I Will not Miss" is excellent. A special mention must be made of the brilliant performance of legendary Hollywood star Charles Boyer in the role of High Lama - and his comments on the destruction of humanity are particularly apt for today's broken world. I do not pretend for a moment that Lost Horizon is a masterpiece (things not to be missed are uninspired choreography, and Bobby Van's 'Question Me An An Answer' issue, which could have been easily cut ), but if you have not even seen Lost Horizon, or have not seen it for some time, try to look without this attitude "Oh my boy, laugh at this pile of junk", and you will be surprised how nice it is.
