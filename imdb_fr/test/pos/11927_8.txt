It was a huge surprise for me. I had never heard of this film when I saw it for the first time, and the title of the movie was really more than a terrorist / hostage situation in a high school. Toy Soldiers has the best of its early 90s period, where action movies were light and very enjoyable. The action is good, the plot is interesting and overflowing, the villain is a one-dimensional hate showerbag (which is great), Louis Gossett Jr. is in, it's simply a film of well-being that I really appreciated . <br /> <br /> You can not go wrong with this one if you like action. I give it a solid score of 8/10.
