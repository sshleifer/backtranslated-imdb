When a bomber, a patricide, a pornographer and a crazy biker, as well as various other forms of social scum, get tired of their sh ** infested cell, they spot a rat and search for the hole. To escape the sewage of the group of nine souls, enjoy their newfound freedom and head for civilization. What follows is not surprising. Chaos and terror ensue. It seems that everyone has an unfinished task to settle. <br /> <br /> Freely inspired by The Great Escape, 9 SOULS is by far in the top 5 of the best movies I've seen this year. If you run about 2 hours, 9 SOULS will tell you a story so powerful that it will literally leave you breathless. The beautiful, but subtle, use of hilly landscapes adds to the expected realism of this story. Director Toshiaki Toyoda's (Blue Spring, Porn Star) vision is completely mind-boggling as he implements a sense of pity for the characters. As fast as each character captures his dream, he is as fast as he is ripped off. From now on, all the responsibility for the success of this film should not rest solely on the shoulders of the director, but the accessories must also go to the actors. This movie was full of great actors from the top down. Ryuhei Matsuda (Miyuki Matsuda's son of Audition) delivers a stellar performance and seems to bring some of her weird mothers to the screen. <br /> <br /> I must also give accessories to the DVD Artsmagic. This is the sixth movie I have seen now, and they seem to get better and better at each DVD. The sound quality is perfect and the picture; clean and crisp. It is very annoying to try to watch a film too dark in transfer, so the discs of these cats are nice. <br /> <br /> In summary, this film will soon receive the status of masterpiece from around the world. Keep an eye on 2005 for 9 SOULS; it's really an amazing movie to watch.
