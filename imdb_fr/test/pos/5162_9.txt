"With all the misery of the world, how not to get drunk?" ?? Mia <br /> <br /> A beautiful aerial view of a big city becomes worrying as a fleet of aircraft bombers approach; an irritated hairdresser reacting to a perceived racial insult cuts a road through the bushy hair of a businessman; a man dreams of being dragged on an electric chair after a failed magic trick and a teacher breaks down in front of her class because her husband calls her a witch. These and about fifty other vignettes cover the whole range, from the depressing to the playful humoristic through the joyously edifying people, You, the Living, by Roy Andersson, his first feature since his success, Songs From the Second Floor . <br /> <br /> You, the living, are filled with the same kind of imaginary plays as Songs, filled with dark humor, surreal situations and strange characters. Although a little too long and less focused than his previous work, what remains constant is the undeniable style of Andersson with its fixed camera, sterile-looking backgrounds and attention to detail. If there is a theme that links the sketches, it is that our time on Earth is limited and that "tomorrow is another day", so let us act with kindness. Along the way we are entertained by Louisiana's tuba and drum music. Brass orchestra, dinners in a banquet hall standing on their chairs, singing a catchy song, and house turning into a moving train. <br /> <br /> The emotions range from the sadness of a girl trying to communicate with an Alzheimer's patient to the ecstatic dream of a young woman to marry a beautiful guitarist, Micke, to the applause of A crowd of spectators. There is no continuous narrative thread, the theme of greed and despair appears in several sketches. presents two fat individuals and their little dog sitting on a park bench, the woman lamenting that no one understands her or loves her, but she blithely ignores the comforting and reassuring words of the man. <br /> <br /> heavy mixture of irony. During what appears to be an executive luncheon, a man says on the phone that workers do not appreciate quality and that it is nice to appreciate the money and the things he can buy, like the good wine. However, when he does not look, a man sitting at an adjacent table calmly raises his wallet from his jacket to the back of his chair. Although Andersson's cynicism is sometimes not very well hidden, You the Living has an underlying humanism that shows compassion for the human condition. It is a cautionary tale that examines the disorder in which we set ourselves, but suggests that there is still time to correct it, if we take into account the warning of the poet Goethe who opens the film, "Be happy then, you're living them in your deliciously warmed bed before Lethe's icy wave licks your fleeing foot.
