I note this an 8 because of the premise of the film. The acting was good, there was no one who stood out as incredible or dreadful. It is disturbing that smart people have fewer and fewer children, or choose not to have any at all ... while idiotic "W in '04" advocates procreate like rabbits. And, although I do not believe that the earth will really exist in 500 years, I can see Mike Judge's parodied prophet becoming like a life imitating art. The world is driven by idiots, and the situation will worsen as intelligent, thought-free people become a minority and fans of "awesome" become more numerous. The proof is our election farce. <br /> <br /> But I'm moving away from the subject. If you have the chance to play it in your city, go see it. I paid my popcorn over $ 7.50 to see FAR WORSE garbage than this one (Date Movie or Napoleon Dynamite?). There are laughs, there are nooks, but all in all, it's fun. If you have a half-brain, you'll have an idea how much this movie, although funny, is precise and very * tiny *. I'm not at all surprised that this movie is almost completely unknown, because Fox is distributing it, and they would not want their sheep to see this and think "maybe I'll read a book and not look "Next" or "Cheats" or "To my balls" "If our society does not stop everything, and the bastardization of the English language (ahem, Mr. Bush), then that's really what we are going to do.
