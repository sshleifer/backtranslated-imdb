An excellent performance of Clint Eastwood and especially John Malkovich, in my opinion, its most beautiful to date. Malkovich had this one nailed to the ground, it's amazing. Eastwood is the agent Mike Horrigan, an elderly and cynical secret service agent, who ends his career by eliminating counterfeiters and carrying out routine tasks. But a mission that seems trivial at first becomes complicated and extremely deadly. Horrigan and his new partner Al are sent to investigate a threat against the president by a "wacko". As fate would have it, Horrigan did not come across a crazy nut, but a professional solitary wolf who has a big bone to choose from with the White House. As Horrigan delves deeper into the world of "Booth", he draws unwanted attention from the villain and gives him unfailing admiration. Horrigan was JFK's chief agent and was present in Dallas, Texas, during his assassination. He blames himself for what happened. He now feels that it is up to him to prevent the current head of state from joining the list of dead presidents. But this killer has reversed the situation on Horrigan and he is now hunted in a game of cat and mouse for life or death. Who will win? Who Will Die It's a race against time to save the president from an enemy who looks like a chameleon and can touch anyone. My favorite Secret Service movie and as good as a biting nail.
