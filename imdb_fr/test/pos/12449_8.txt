This is one of the most enjoyable teen movies I've ever seen (and that I wanted to see on video). He was released the same year as another great comedy in which Tim Matheson played the role "Animal House" (which probably explains why he was neglected). <br /> <br /> One of the most memorable parts of this film would undoubtedly be the soundtrack, which could and should have been an official release of the label. High Inergy, whose song "We are the future", played a leading role in the scene of the movie "Prom". I remember buying the group's "Steppin 'Out" album when I was little, mostly because of the girls' look and not necessarily for their musical talents. <br /> <br /> The closing song is one of the best ballads I have ever heard, and I always hear it in my head. I would like to know the name of the group to be able to look for it somewhere in cyberspace. <br /> <br /> If you like movies like "Over the edge" and "Rich Kids", I think that will benefit you as well.
