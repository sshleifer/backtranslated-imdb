After working on 7 films with director Mickael Curtiz (The adventures of Robin Hood are their best achievement), Errol Flynn got tired of his dictatorial direction and decided to work with the great Raoul Walsh. This meeting is a good thing for cinematography. THE MORED WITH THEIR BOOTS ON is their first and best film together. Raoul Walsh represents General George Armstrong Custer (Errol Flynn) since his debut at West Point until the American Civil War and finally at the Battle of Little Big Horn. It is true that the film shows a too heroic portrait of Custer, but it is not important. What is important is the fact that we are transported with the passion and glory worn by the characters. Who can forget California Joe, the great "Queen's Own Buttler" with his song "Garryowen", the touching Mrs Custer (Olivia de Havilland), the evil diabolical well performed by Arthur Kennedy? <br /> <br /> An eternal blow remains on this epic and tragic fresco.
