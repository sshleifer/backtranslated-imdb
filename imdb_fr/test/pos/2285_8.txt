Not too many people seem to know about this movie. Which is a shame because I think it's pretty good. Of course, it is sometimes a bit corny and can have a predictable scenario. But the presentation of the film is rather well done. I think the cast is good with actors / characters friendly. Tom Selleck does a good job playing with a baseball player (understand ... not too much, I guess) and Ken Takakura (of Black Rain) plays the role of the leader (the coach of the Japanese baseball team) . There is not much to complain about. It's just a light comedy, easygoing, happy and I recommend it.
