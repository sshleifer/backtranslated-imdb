Normally, I try to avoid Barbie's movies, but this one was definitely great. Congratulations to the graphics and voice-over characters. Everything went well. This enchanting story is a great result, but worth buying! I do not have children, but the children I care about, including the boys, find this intriguing and love the extra features of the DVD. Honestly, I do not know why this is judged so low, but for kids, especially your 8-year-old lover Barbie will love that. It's not simple and predictive like most movies. This film "for children" has an excellent morality and shows teamwork. He has no swear words, strands of love (if you are old enough to understand it) and a beautifully written script. That's why I give him ten out of ten!
