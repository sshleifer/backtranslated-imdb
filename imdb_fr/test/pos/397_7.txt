One of the darkest of Anthony Mann's Westerns, The Last Frontier was also his only Western rider (with the exception of a brief episode of Winchester '73). Although it naturally focuses on strangers and internal conflicts rather than offering a Fordian celebration of fellowship and shared ideals. Installed not in his favorite country, but in the foothills and forests, it is a much more cynical view of the life of the border, in many ways his Fort Apache without the need to preserve the legend: this Outpost is made up of unsuited, failing, cowardly and knowledgeable officers ignored by his superiors, mishandled while the American Civil War has priority and the army has the best of what it has to offer . <br /> <br /> Victor Mature and James Whitmore are the free trappers who find the civilization crawling on them when they are relieved of their skins and packhorses by a local tribe injured by cavalry incursion into their territory . Rather than blaming the Indians for their losses, they decide that it is the army's fault for building the fort and decide to seek compensation from them, eventually joining their ranks as scouts. Despite the efforts of Guy Madison's kind and competent commander-in-chief to bring Mature into the nineteenth century and make him fit to wear the uniform, the arrival of the humiliated Colonel Robert Preston, eager to avenge the tribe who chased him out of his own outpost ?? and the awkward craze of Mature for the colonel's wife (Anne Bancroft, a blank slate to do a lot with the role of a woman who is tired of being saved by men who think they know what is best for her ) ?? soon drive things into a much darker territory. It does not take long for some soldiers to consider killing each other, as both sides try to incite their subordinates to commit the act for them: no wonder Mature at one point throws the blue coat that he long coveted with disgust, shouting "I would be dead for that, but it's just a dirty dirty blue rag!" The Stallone of his day, Mature was one of those actors who might surprise you with an excellent performance here or there when they are paired with the good part and the good director. This is not one of his best days despite his most complex, perverse part as a simple man ?? Well-intentioned but drunk, violent, uneducated and with a carefree, almost childish lust for life, the game seems designed for Burt Lancaster, with striking similarities to his character in The Kentuckian. But Robert Preston's colonel, similar to Ahab, is clearly the best role. He is determined to revive the career he has destroyed in a single commitment to the disastrously suicidal civil war by launching a new, unnecessary, suicidal campaign against the tribe, adding a new humiliation to the list that he holds dear. away and out of the mind of the promotion board. In his obsession to redeem his career, he moves away from all hope of moral redemption, as much by his feeling of shame at the sympathy of his wife as by the promotion of former comrades he considers his inferiors. He is beyond salvation, but there is always a recognizable human being and a not without integrity? he sincerely admires Madison's courage to make a futile attempt to get Preston's orders contradicted by their superiors? fatally biased, even if he is. <br /> <br /> Like its hero, the film is a little rough (and boasts one of the most surrealist and jaunty songs of all westerns), but that only gives the impression It's more interesting, and there's a lot of Mann's typically elegant camera movements and his perspective, while the setting of the border is decidedly rough and primitive. Unfortunately, the flaws of the first CinemaScope lenses are very obvious in the Columbia DVD, with often dark pictures (CinemaScope 2.55: 1 needed extra extra lighting and the first Scope movies showed a lot of trial and error) and granular.
