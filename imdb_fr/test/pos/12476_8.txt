Very good movie about a man and his wife involved in a murder and the police officer investigating the case. Everything starts beautifully, but hits the wall a little at a time. We are sure to know what happened, then a small thread of the plot that initially looks like a red herring appears and disappoints. However, the direction of Clouzot is excellent and the acting is pretty good. Louis Jouvet, who also starred in Marcel Carné's Drôle de Drame, gives the best performance as a smart detective. I wonder if the Coen brothers were influenced by this film when they wrote Fargo. A bit like in this film, the policeman appears only halfway through, then he becomes almost the center of the film. There are also a lot of funny comedy around him (although sometimes his methods seem somehow fascistic).
