Gilmore Girls is a hilarious show with sarcasm, wit and endless charm. At the age of 16, Lorelai Gilmore gave birth to Rory Gilmore. She left her parents' house and found a job. Now, Lorelai and Rory have a relationship that many mothers and daughters envy. They are best friends. Girls have an in-depth knowledge of movies and TV shows and constantly quote them. During the first season, Lorelai needs money to send Rory to Chilton (a very famous high school). She must reluctantly turn to her parents. They are happy to give them the money, but in exchange, Rory has to come and dine with them every Friday night. I highly recommend this show. I like that!
