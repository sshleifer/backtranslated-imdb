In fact, I had considered investing in this film when Gorman was looking for funds. I liked most of the script but did not like the end. Gorman insisted that the end was the next. <br /> <br /> Seeing the film finished, I must say that I am amazed. While reading the script, I had not imagined that the acting game (and the direction of Gorman) would be as powerful and moving as this one. Both leaders did an amazing job. They were very believable and this movie is worth watching just for the performances of these two amazing stars. Now, for the spoiler and if you have not seen the movie, please do not continue reading anymore need to see the movie first. (I really wish I had never read the script so I could experience the ending movie first-hand.) <br /> <br /> -------------- ----- ---------- SPOILER <br /> <br /> I have two main problems with the film. First of all, and I'm sure I talked about it when I read the script, the woman should have died. If she were dead, the end would be much more believable. As things stand now, we have this guy who was suffering a woman who left him "years ago". If she left him and he was still in love after so long, he should be seriously delusional. But he does not meet that way in the script. (There is also the problem of why he did not spend all this energy to marry the woman he still loves.) Fulfilling, reciprocal love, and therefore believe that the guy is devastated enough so that the end is reasonable . <br /> <br /> However, I do not buy that Daphne does what she does at the end. I need a lot of conviction to believe that this naive girl (very naive for a whore but credible thanks to the performance of Bohl) did what she did. The character is just not cold enough. And if she did that for love, or something else, she misses a piece of the film / story. <br /> <br /> Much of this film recalls "Sex, Lies, and Video Cassette." I think it could have been so popular if Gorman had chosen to give the film a more credible ending. <br /> <br /> So watch the movie, enjoy the performance. And decide for yourself.
