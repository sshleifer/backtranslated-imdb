I do not understand why this movie has such a low note. It deserves totally more! Of course, it's completely ridiculous, but that's what it was supposed to be. Do not expect a cinematic transcendence of a movie about candidates for the failed beauty contest on a Caribbean island! What you should expect is a huge parody of almost all science fiction, fantasy and blockhouse movies relevant to film history, and even references to other spoofers. All completely exaggerated and sometimes totally useless, but that's exactly what distinguishes this film. If you like parodies and like to play, Leslie Nielsen or Mike Myers, you'll love it. Of course I did it!
