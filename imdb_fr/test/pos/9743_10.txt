As mentioned earlier in one of my best reviews, the Universal Pictures FLASH GORDON trilogy should not be ranked with other serials. Indeed, these three people created a kind of celluloid electronic mythology for a hard-hitting and phobic world of war in the mid-twentieth century. They are the only ones in the minds of many people and show the example of what is a cliff shed. <br /> <br /> We can remember seeing Buster Crabbhe as a guest on NBC's TOMORROW, hosted by Tom Snyder. It was around 1979-1980. During the interview, Mr. Crabbe was asked about his personal fitness habits. He mentioned bodybuilding and swimming, as well as healthy eating habits, including vitamin and protein supplementation. (And, you know, he smoked a lot of cigarettes!) <br /> <br /> Asked about his career, Mr. Snyder did of course discuss the subject of his representation (and his strong identification) with the character of Flash . Buster stated that he had read and appreciated the functionality in his original medium, namely a cartoon that belongs to the King Hearns Syndicate. He said he thought it would not work once transferred to the screen! Fortunately, he was wrong. <br /> <br /> As for the first series, it was a very good adaptation of the original continuity of Sunday Color Comics. The world is about to end because of an imminent collision with the Mongo planet. It is up to Dr. Zarkov, who works independently, to propel himself on the wild planet to change course. He is asking the help of Flash and Miss Dale Arden, newly arrived paratroopers from an airliner, who land on the Zarkov property. <br /> <br /> The series is exciting and manages to give the impression that there is always another danger hidden just outside the film frame. The costumes and decoration are varied, from the novel to the oriental through Art Decco. It would be easy to assume that this was due to Universal's frugality, but once again, it was true to the visual concepts of the creator, the cartoonist Alex Raymond. (Just look at the old tapes reproduced in many collections). previously used in JUST IMAGINE! (Fox 1930), a sci-fi musical comedy. The other scientific laboratory equipment was provided by Universal's technical department, the largest Hollywood company performing Horror and SciFi. <br /> <br /> The casting includes Jean Rogers (Dale Arden) and Priscilla Lawson (Princess Aura) who embark on a battle between girls against girls against Flash. Charles Middleton describes the Ming emperor in a sort of excessively melodramatic villain, but makes it work. Zarkov (Frank Shannon) is appeased by the madness he suffered when he appeared in newsprint. (By the way, have you ever wondered how Zar-Kov had a roe?) Richard Alexander makes a refined and powerful Prince Barin, always so helpful and so noble. <br /> <br /> The actor Jack "tiny" Lipson is the surprise of the cast, flying scene after scene like a lecherous, Henry VIII like a scoundrel become ally, King Vultan, ruler of the Hawkmens. Among the others, the most notable is Jim Pierce as Prince Thun of the Lion Men. Pierce, like Crabbe, had also described Tarzan in a movie, but later married Joan, the daughter of Edgar Rice Bourroughs, creator of Tarzan Creator. ) and FLASH GORDON AT THE CONQUEST OF THE UNIVERSE (1940), have been a juvenile staple for generations, first in the movie theaters, then in the televised output. Like a good wine, they have seen improvement with age. <br /> <br /> We are all very happy that Mr. Crabbe was wrong.
