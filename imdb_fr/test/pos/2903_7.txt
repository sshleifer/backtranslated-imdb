I would like to give this film a high score for photography and cinema performances. I just read a user comment about the performance of the actress who plays the role of an accomplice courtesan who fleece the main character of Sinuoeh. I remember a mini biography of this actress after the film the last time I saw it. Apparently, she was a Holocaust refugee, discovered by a French husband and a French woman in the film industry who were taken away with her extraordinary beauty. She died very young and in tragic circumstances. Gene Tierney is also remarkable in this movie. Like the other neo-biblical films of the 1940s and 50s, "The Egyptian" reflects the morals and values ​​of that era, but remains an excellent entertainment because the performances are fantastic and the story well told.
