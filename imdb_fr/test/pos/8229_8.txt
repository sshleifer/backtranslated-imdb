I read Ashew's comment and thought they had to look at a totally different picture! <br /> <br /> I just watched the movie this morning and was quite surprised. <br /> <br /> To answer Ashew's comments: <br /> <br /> Trail Street is a very well done western. <br /> <br /> And Randolph Scott was in on it! <br /> <br /> Gabby Hayes was funnier than I've ever seen! <br /> <br /> The bad guys had very good relationships with me. <br /> <br /> More: <br /> <br /> It was interesting to see Robert Ryan in straight - good guy - he's usually so gooey. <br /> <br /> In all, it's a good western, very well played and written. <br /> <br /> I liked Kansas's background story and "winter wheat" which allegedly helped the country to become a state too. <br /> <br /> I thought the girl who played Susan was adorable - I do not see why she did not become a big star!
