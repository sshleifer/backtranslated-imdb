Disney's Buena Vista Pictures presents a sports drama based on wonderfully told facts by actor Bill Paxton. The photography is superb, but the story is sometimes heavy. This film is dedicated to 20-year-old amateur golfer Francis Ouimet (Shia LaBeouf) and his competitors at the 1913 US Open. What a story; a unique chance in the life of a young man supposedly unable to play alongside the best golfers of the moment, including British champions Harry Vardon (Stephen Dillane) and Ted Ray (Stephen Marcus). A storybook ending ends with a knot in the throat. The cast also includes: Peter Firth, Elias Koteas, Marnie McPhail, Robin Wilcox and probably steal the show's star is Josh Flitter, who plays Eddie Lowery, Caddy and Ouimet's best friend.
