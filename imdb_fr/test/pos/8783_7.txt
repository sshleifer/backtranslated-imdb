Writers Peter Viertel, Joan Harrison and Dorothy Parker allow director Alfred Hitchcock to explain his favorite movie theme: an innocent man, wrongly accused of a crime, attacks him. Hitchcock, which some attribute to the origin of the story, puts a lot of suspense into the plot about a warehouse employee accused of the blast that killed his best friend; he sets out to find the real culprit. Much excitement on a large scale, with actors generally colorless (Priscilla Lane, Norman Lloyd, Alan Baxter) doing a surprisingly refined job. Even eternally unsatisfactory, Robert Cummings gets in the right mind! *** of ****
