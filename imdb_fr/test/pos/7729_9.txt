Excellent film in many ways. Vicente Aranda managed to portray the era (1830) with meticulous care. The light, the places, the feelings are perfectly perceived from the beginning of the film. And at the same time - contrary to what happened to "Mad Love" (Juana la Loca), a rather episodic historical film - all this beautiful photography / music / clothing envelops a very fluid scenario that reaches its peak in the only possible < <br /> <br /> Regarding the actors, Paz Vega as Carmen is remarkable: lying, seductive, aggressive, totally sexual, so beautiful Carmen. Sbaraglia convinces a little less the audience of his instant love for Carmen, but he manages to give the whole movie a good tragic mood. I recommend it to everyone: the best Spanish film of the year.
