One of the best movies I've ever seen - a classic movie "Matrix". For many years, I have been trying to get it on VHS or DVD - without success. The German film and television industry always prefers to leave valuable cultural contributions (and this is Fassbinder, after all!) To rot and accumulate dust in some archives rather than distribute them commercially (and make a lot of money if it stimulates instead of promoting creative thinking). However, the WDR told me once that if I had paid DM 200.00 to check the copyright (non-refundable), then 8 DM per minute of copy, plus the cost of the material, they would consider preparing a copy (unique!) for me. A way to sell something! The same problem we have with many other TV movies or series like "So we are going to die", "Sonntagseltern", "Kellerkinder", and others. Excellent TV series - we never hear about it again. Germany, wake up! <br /> <br /> UPDATE MARCH 2007: Last year, I could finally get a DVD copy of the "Mittschnittservice" WDR for about 50 euros or more. Awesome!
