This film predates the Australian films Road Warrior and Priscilla of the Desert, and its influence on them is obvious: in dialogue, places, photography, direction and political philosophy. Photography is particularly confident. The management is elegant and for the most part well done. If you liked the first Australian films of Bruce Beresford, Peter Weir and George Miller, then you'll love "Oz". The management also reminds this criticism of Edgar Wright's contemporary work. This similarity suggests that "Oz" was way ahead of his time. The critics of 1967 hated it and the public was left out - 1960s Australia, like the 1940s United States, was somehow the place where compliance was important, while this film is very different from what advertisers expected promotional posters. This film will probably be more appealing to the contemporary audience: it's still weird, clumsy and self-conscious, but in a contemporary European way rather than an Australian 1960s way. Joy Dunstan (who appeared later in the Australian television series 'Prisoner') plays his role with a less raw passion than Jacki Weaver, but the character of Dunstan in this film reflects the rather fantastic force of the most famous Australian women by Kylie Minogue performing Charlene Mitchell in the Australian TV series Neighbors and developing his later roles in his career. Men will also enjoy this film, which presents different male issues in a different way from most other American or even Australian films dating back to the mid-sixties. Bruce Spence (who later performed Tion Medon in "Star Wars III", Trainman in the "Matrix" movies and the chopper pilot in "Road Warrior" and "Thunderdome") plays a pivotal and sustained role that solidly supports the rest of distribution. This film is worth seeing for Bruce Spence's only performance. 7/10 for some minor continuity issues.
