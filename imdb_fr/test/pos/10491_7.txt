After the Civil War in America, the President (Van Johnson) goes to Dallas and is murdered by corrupt officials and businessmen interested in installing the Vice President whom they can blackmail because of incriminating documents . An armed man (Guiliano Gemma) convinced that his black friend is wrongly accused of the murder aims to reveal the truth. Tonino Valeri made this fascinating, though flawed film, which is obviously an allegory of Kennedy's assassination. The film may wrongly portray blacks as slaves working in plantations in Texas, but the film is nonetheless enjoyable and offers an interesting interpretation: Kennedy's death is the result of a coup d'Ã©tat many of which Americans could not accept at the time. The murder of Oswald is repeated here since the black accused of the assassination is assassinated by the officials, en route for the prison of Fort Worth. This moment in the film is more melodramatic than the death of Oswald with his various escorts shot in front of him. Nevertheless, it is one of the most interesting and interesting spaghetti westerns. It's worth checking out!
