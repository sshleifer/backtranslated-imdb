"The Cell" is a pretty difficult film to classify. If you read the plot of the plot, "a psychotherapist travels into a comatose serial killer in hopes of saving his latest victim", you might think it's a thriller with a sci-fi twist. But that does not really do justice to this movie. Subconscious minds have fantastic fantasy, lavish visuals, and incredible storylines that stumble the mind. There is a drama when the aforementioned psychotherapist (played by Lopez before she becomes part of the only romantic comedy) gets in touch with the child inside and bears witness to her terrifying upbringing. And there is certainly a facet of horror due to the disgusting actions of the serial killer's evil character. The film tries to work at different levels and crosses the limits of the genre at will. Even though I feel that it ends up being a weird experience, I find it completely fascinating. <br /> <br /> From the opening credits, with Lopez riding on horseback in the desert, dressed to perfection in a white dress, you'll know you're on a visual feast. Whenever the public leaves the reality and follows it into the subconscious depths of its "patients", it is guaranteed a feast of visual and auditory delights. The costumes are wonderful creations of angles and colors. The camera leaves regularities at the door and crosses a world where high and low are the same. The characters become the leaders of their own domains and become creatures worthy of such stature. If you do not like anything more than "The Cell", you will surely be impressed by the work staged in these scenes. <br /> <br /> The cast is of high quality too. Jennifer Lopez is in her element here, using her natural, benevolent and almost maternal sensitivity, while combining her own striking looks with the lush environment, makeup and costumes. She is incredibly sexy and I personally wish someone to find her another role outside the rom-com world in which she was cataloged, which would allow her to experiment more. Vince Vaughn is quite convincing as an FBI agent who will do everything to save a young woman's life. But it is without a doubt Vincent D'Onofrio who has the greatest impression here. This is an extremely difficult role because it has to give rise to multiple emotions in the viewer. We are disgusted by his actions, but sympathetic to him because of the traumas he has experienced during his life. He looks magnificently powerful in his realm, but insecure and vulnerable in the real world. It's a superb performance of an underrated actor. <br /> <br /> While "The cell" does not work as well at all levels, it tries ambitiously all based on a rather fragile scientific logic, it is a trip to the head sometimes shocking and visually stunning which rewards multiple viewings.
