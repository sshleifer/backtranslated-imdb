There is not much intrigue in this movie. There is a wealthy owner of the baseball team who dies and whose wife will sue the hospital for negligence. Not much more than that, but .... THAT DOES NOT! <br /> <br /> It does not matter, because you have real actors who give life to their dialogue, and because of the distribution, you have a funny drama yourself. scenes and even if you do not laugh, you have a smile on your face. <br /> <br /> Matthau plays Charley, whose wife has recently passed away and is the subject of many women's desires at the hospital. He is delighted to taste all the available menu. He then meets Anne Atkinson (Glenda Jackson) who, first, is a patient at the hospital (their first scene together is very funny), then ends up on a talk show on television, where they disagree on almost all topics are discussed. <br /> <br /> Charley begins to love Anne and vice versa, except that she is very keen on monogamy among the men of her life (her husband was a cheater) and they decide to give it a try - two weeks of loyalty. <br /> <br /> I will not give anything else, but I want to mention the chemistry that Matthau and Jackson have on the screen. She is not usually the first person to think about for a romantic middle-aged comedy, but her contact with comedy is very light and enjoyable. Matthau, who is more charming than ever, matches her every step. He does not have to play Mr. Sensitive or Mr. Macho to get the girl, he just has to be himself. <br /> <br /> Art Carney is a riot all by himself as a practically senile doctor. The scene where the ashes of the owner of the baseball team are buried at the marble is invaluable. He also has a very entertaining scene on a parking lot with Richard Benjamin. Richard does not have much to do in this film and, most often, he's just the man of nothing in front of Carney and Matthau; the role does not impose his considerable talents, but he must have had a good time doing this comedy. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended ... 8/10 <br /> <br /> PS. FYI - Matthau presented to Jackson his first Academy Award for best actress, and this one to the best actor for Art Carney for his role in "Harry & Tonto".
