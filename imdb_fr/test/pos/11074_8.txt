It's a very realistic film. This is the most realistic I've seen in urban youth. The actors were great. I'm going to look for other Gomez movies. I had never heard of the movie until someone mentioned it recently. I bought it on DVD. I was impressed. I did not see anything approaching life as I do in Philadelphia. It really comes very close - in fact, a scene where there is an accident (I will not spoil or give details), reminded me of a situation almost identical to Philadelphia. At first, I thought that Gomez had shot the scene of this real event, then I realized that he had directed the film a few years ago. I also agree that this movie did not try to broaden its appeal by putting shit in Hollywood. Gomez also directed "Laws of Gravity" - I can not wait to see him.
