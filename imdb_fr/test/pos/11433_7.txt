"The Missing Star", which competed for the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival 2006, is a film that, when you think about it, arises as the first adjective: intense. Intense looks, intense sequences, the intensity of this film captures the viewer from the first scenes of steelmaking in Italy (I could not recognize the city, perhaps Genoa or even Naples), although the pace is rather slow. <br /> <br /> Vincenzo Buonavolont√†, the main male role, and with him, all the public, sees a China completely different from that imagined by the Westerners: horrible skyscraper with about 8 hundred apartment owners at the Inside, skyscrapers, desolation, fog, scrapers and cranes everywhere, but also the beauty of the Yangtze River Kiang, which will soon become a big lake because of the dike controversy that will wipe out many cities. China is a country under construction, but under all these colossal public works, there is still poverty, delay and unjust laws. <br /> <br /> We can relate more easily to this story because Gianni Amelio, expert director, Two extraordinary actors were chosen: Sergio Castellitto, well known actor in Italy, and the Chinese surprise Tai Ling, a girl totally unknown which gives an interpretation as intense as that of Castellitto. <br /> <br /> The film is not perfect, there are flaws here and there, but that does not mean it's a mediocre film. Try to see him.
