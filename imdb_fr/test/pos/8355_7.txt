Well, first of all, it's not a bad movie. That's good and I like the characters introduced. I also like the voice of Lady and Tramp. <br /> <br /> However, I would like to see Lady And Tramp more often. I know it says "Scamp's Adventure", and I love Scamp And Angel in small pieces, but it's a continuation of the original, where, in my opinion, they should release it under the title "Scamp's Adventure", not "Lady And The Tramp II: Scamp's Adventure". <br /> <br /> Tramp played an important role, but he did not spend much time with Lady. <br /> <br /> But of Anyway, the songs are pretty good, and Scamp and Angel are sweet, I've seen better sequels, but hey, it's not a failure. <br /> <br /> I give him 7/10. Very good, but still had flaws.
