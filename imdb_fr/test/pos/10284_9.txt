An obsessive love story, where the characters were extremely convincing. I think this film highlights the talent of professional actors. Especially for Vincent Cassel who (at the time, he was not filmed) would not be the first character you would think of for such a role. And yes, he managed to seduce the beautiful Monica Belluci, beyond the film, during this creation. I can only say that this film should have been released in the United States, instead of thinking about doing a remake. It's just so French, almost perverse ... and yet so true ... this film should remain intact ... <br /> <br /> A director who should definitely have more projects, because this kind of subject requires the right amount of ingredients to not make a flop ..
