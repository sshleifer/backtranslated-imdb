This film is based on a play and is the second adaptation of this work. Paul Sorvino plays the role of basketball coach of a team of players who won the championship 20 years ago, against all odds. They all gathered for a meeting. Terry Kinney plays the role of James, a high school principal, and will quickly put you on the nerves of all his moans and will be sorry for my role. Vincent D'Onofrio, as Phil, plays the role of a hateful businessman with just the right amount of "money". Tony Shalhoub is George, the current mayor of the city and seems to be on the verge of breaking down. Gary Sinise plays Tom, a writer turned alcoholic and, in my opinion, is excellent in this role. While they are all supposed to celebrate their championship, conflicts, jealousy and fighting abound. While men understand what was and what they are now, they are forced to look at their lives in an unpleasant way. It is unusual for a group of men to talk and cry about what could have been, and I found it interesting to see them tell each other. It's not the best movie I've seen, but it's certainly enough for a viewing.
