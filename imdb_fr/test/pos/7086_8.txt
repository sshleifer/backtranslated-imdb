I do not cry easily on movies, but I have to admit that this one made me cry. Although I'm not a fan of Mrs. Streep, her performance has been excellent. The title defines in a sentence what is the love of a mother. During the first hour, none of the characters I liked, but it changed over the course of the film. The film also explains why some marriages last although there are obstacles. A must-see movie.
