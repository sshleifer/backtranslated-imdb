It takes a rare film to improve every time you see it. O Brother does this and then some. The first time I saw it, I must admit that I had never seen anything like it. Then I wanted to see him again, and I'm now about to double my numbers with this great movie, the best Coen film, with Fargo and Hudsucker Proxy coming out for me. George Clooney sums up his career playing with Ulysses Everett McGee, an escaped man who knows how to make himself understood and speaks fast, who really does not know much at all. Tim Blake Nelson and John Turturro are the perfect companions of Clooney, especially Nelson and his interpretation of Delmar, a faithful escapee without education. John Goodman is my favorite character, Big Dan, perfect. It reminds me of his role in Arizona Raising, he is just a perfect actor for this role. Holly Hunter and Charles Durning, favorites of the Coen brothers, also offer memorable performances. <br /> <br /> JoÃ«l and Ethan Coen are masters of their profession. It's not like they're trying to win Oscars every time they shoot a movie, they're just trying to tell a story they wanted to tell, and it was entertaining. It's a loose adaptation of the Odyssey, and I mean cowardly for all Homer's fanatics. It's just great. <br /> <br /> The most amazing part of this movie is the coloring. I saw how dusty the film was and I'm always amazed to think about it. Coloring becomes an important part of the film. Super big movie.
