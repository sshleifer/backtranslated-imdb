Do not ask me why I love this movie so much ... It may have happened at a time in my life that I desperately wanted to integrate. It's probably because I LOVE Clive Barker. I think it's fair to warn you that the movie and the novel have no real resolution and that, like me, you will probably have a WTF moment at the end. At least two suites were planned but never saw the light of day because the film failed for several reasons. The studio made drastic cuts in the film and took about 30 minutes and did a HORRIBLE job to promote it. The ads gave the impression that it was just another cheap slasher showing mainly the Decker character "Button Face / Mask". It's a movie about monsters! Fantasy! About a place called Midian! It's a story where monsters are good guys. There is really nothing else like this! I guess it's not a movie for everyone, but it's one of Clive's many great works. Sit down and be ready to be taken to Midian - where the monsters are.
