I really enjoyed this film during its first release and, every time, I've seen it since. Political drama is effective, if not especially new or inspired. The decades that have elapsed since the film's release have shown that the desire to reduce costs to the detriment of public safety was certainly not an idea imagined by a screenwriter. <br /> <br /> However, I think the most impressive element of this film is Jack Lemmon's performance. It's absolutely amazing to watch him at work. He has the gift of being able to communicate so much, sometimes without saying a word. The next time you watch this movie, look at Jack's face at times when he says nothing. He does not need to talk (or worse yet, catch) to tell you what's going on in his mind. <br /> <br /> I call this a spoiler, because of the impression it made me when I started seeing the film: in the last scene of Lemmon, while he is lying on the floor, he feels a slight vibration. The terror in his eyes is one of the scariest images I have ever seen in a movie. It's a perfect acting game because it instantly transmits the imminent threat - if Jack's character is so terrified, there will definitely be something terrible. And it does it.
