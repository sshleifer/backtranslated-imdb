The fires in the plain led by Kon Ichikawa and written by Shohei Ooka and Natto Wada is a WWII film that does not show the allies fighting the Axis powers, but the Japanese fighting and fighting for their lives Philippines. The main character is Tamura, played by Eiji Funakoshi, and he is a soldier who leaves his regiment because of his illness. All he has on him is a grenade, his gun and potatoes. Like that, he tries to get to the hospital to get a doctor and treatment for his illness. But since the hospital sent him back and is destroyed, he begins a long walk. Throughout the film, Tamura remains a bit cowardly, but very civil, when other soldiers become more animals using their basic instinct to survive. Tamura remains human and will not be degraded. One scene that influenced me a lot to think positively and differently about this film about the war is when Tamura arrived in a completely deserted Filipino village. There, he fights a dog and finds a large number of corpses of Japanese soldiers stacked in front of a church. This makes Tamura think and he is even more frightened than he already is. This shows that the soldier is not a brave killing machine, but the servant of superior beings and human beings above all else. After he turns away from corpses, two Phillipinos (a couple or a brother and a sister: very close relatives) return to the village to recover their salt reserves. The main character of the film wants to be friendly at first, although he approached with his weapon, but shot at the woman once she began to scream. Her brother / boyfriend / husband then runs away in fear and after a while Tamura follows him and savagely fires at the fleeing Filipino. He does not hit him. After picking up the bag of salt, something very precious, Tamura drops her weapon into a river. This gesture is very important to understand the profile of Tamura and the war by Kon Ichikawa / Shohei Ooka. Comparing this film to other World War II films, it is not typical at all. Of course, all movies have heroes that suffer, but their heroes are more heroic than Tamura. He expresses everything that is human: he is manipulated, he is weak, he is afraid, he has hope. This is typical of the two films of the Second World War and Japanese society. Since the Second World War is not a topic discussed in Japanese society, the Japanese are likely to place the Japanese in the second world war in the role of victim. This victimization is also very visual in this film. One example is Tamura, another of the piled-up bodies of Japanese soldiers in front of the church and another important one, when Japanese soldiers try to cross a street and the Americans are already waiting for them and are shooting them all. Japanese soldiers who have worse equipment, who are fed and who have no medical equipment or whatever. In my personal conclusion, I must say that it is worthwhile to see this film to finally see a film on the other side than usual. Nor does it have any nationalist propaganda that could easily have been integrated. Once you have fully watched the film, you will see the horrors of the Second World War in all its extent.
