I watched this movie at least ten times. I do not agree with previous comments. This is a language in the cheek movie and some of the actor is supposed to be scalded. Men like Paul Cowley are few and women like Linda, unfortunately, are shoveled. The sad thing here is that although similar relationships like this rarely lead to murder and stratagems, this is a totally familiar scenario. A boy worships a girl, a girl does not know that he exists, they grow up, a man sees a woman in whom he fantasizes and saves her. In the end, she never liked him, he came at the right time and she used it. Thomas is excellent as the nerdy but adequate Paul. His representation is sensitive and touching. Madsen is perfect as a femme fatale. What really touched me was the final scene. Paul says that he ended up crying, but not for Linda, his wife, but for the unknown girl whom he had seen from afar for so long ... and whom he desired ... and whom he loved. And I loved Thomas's close-up at the end.
