It's one of the best TV movies I've ever seen! The title makes it so obvious and predictable, but hey, all TV movies are like that! <br /> <br /> The story is fantastic. It may sound ridiculous but it is based on an incredibly true story. Gary Cole plays a soldier named Dave who feels trapped in his marriage. He abandons his wife and children and then simulates his death! All this so that he can be with Alyson (Karen Sillas). How far will Dave go to keep his secret? <br /> <br /> The acting game is first rate for TV movies. Gary Cole, especially, keeps the film in his eyes as a charming sociopath who speaks well and has an answer to everything when his wife becomes suspicious. Karen Sillas does her best as a wife who discovers that her husband is a liar and does not know what to do about it. Teddi Siddall, who I believe is Gary Cole's wife in real life, plays her role well, especially when she cries about her husband's "death". Wendy Makkena adds a nice touch as Alyson's sister. Linda Goranson is excellent in her small role as Dave's mother. <br /> <br /> Predictable, but the acting and the story bring this film to win several notches.
