One of the great tragedies of life is that Disney is doing so well at everything they do. If they were not, we might have more unique little animated gems, such as "The Curious Adventures of Mr. Wonderbird". The story is that an evil king has usurped the throne of a place called Up-And-Down-Land (I could be mistaken in name). He is hated by everyone. His favorite hobby is shooting birds, and at one point he probably killed Mr. Wonderbird's wife (a bird, played with a typical flair by Peter Ustinov), leaving him with four young chicks to raise. Meanwhile, we see another hobby of the evil king is painting. He has made three paintings: a self-portrait, a picture of a shepherdess (which he fell in love with) and a sweetheart (which he is jealous). One night, the shepherdess and the chimney sweep descend from their paintings and flee together. The self-portrait of the king also descends from its frame and eliminates the real king (you think I invent it? It's the real plot) and sends the royal police in pursuit of young lovers. Mr. Wonderbird then helps the lovers to try to escape the king's forces. <br /> <br /> The plot is wonderfully surreal, and the Up-and-Down-Land set-up is an incredibly imaginative place, filled with towering buildings accessible only by elevators. It's an equal mix of "Metropolis" and "1984" worlds and Dr. Seuss' drawings. <br /> <br /> Look at it for a unique viewing experience that does not fit the standard formula for the most animated features.
