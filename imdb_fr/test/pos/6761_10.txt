This movie is the funniest Danish movie I have ever seen! <br /> <br /> The plot is funny, surprising and exceptional. Danish humor is unlike any other and seduces you every time. The whole audience laughed 90% of the time ... it was amazing. The characters are so well played, and the two actors, Mads Mikkelsen and Nikolaj Lie Kaas play the best of their story! <br /> <br /> I would highly recommend to see this movie, you will not regret it, -)
