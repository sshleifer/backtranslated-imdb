For a long time, it was my favorite Batman movie. He had the best cinematic quality and a sense of nervousness with two crazy characters - Catwomen and The Penguin - as well as the very interesting Christopher Walken. However, after the last viewing, he finally slipped into my notes and, frankly, I now prefer the last Batman: Batman Begins, with Christian Bale. <br /> <br /> THE GOOD - Nevertheless, it's the most intriguing of all. the last five Batman movies. Elegant cinematography here is the best of all Batman movies. Director Tim Burton is known for his films with breathtaking images, which is a great example. The three characters listed above are all very different and very interesting, almost fascinating. Among the villains, I preferred Catwomen, finding it the most fun to watch before and after its change. The violence is not exaggerated here, as was the case in many of the other Batman stories, but you never get bored of looking at it. As in the first film, Michael Keaton does a great job playing Batman / Bruce Wayne. <br /> <br /> THE BAD - For a comic-based movie that mostly kids read, I still think these first two Batman movies, both made by Burton, were too dark and the profanation was definitely not appropriate. Although, contrary to the first movie, the name of the Lord was not used in vain here, there were always blasphemies and the two bad guys made too much sexual remarks. It would have been nice if they had not commercialized this film for children as for adults. Danny DeVito's "Penguin" is downright disgusting. "Grotesque" I can handle, but who wants "raw". Meanwhile, few guys complained about the beautiful Michelle Pfeiffer playing Catwoman. Generally too much darkness and some low bashing on Christian-bashing also made me reconsider my previously high score of this movie. <br /> <br /> GLOBAL - Fabulous visuals and memorable characters make it the most interesting of Batman Series, but too dark, too coarse and too anti-religious prejudices, everything finally turned me off after a half dozens of looks on this movie. Sorry, but I prefer a nicer-nice Batman movie. After all, it's just a cartoon. Most will not agree, but I was happy to see the series lighten up after this one.
