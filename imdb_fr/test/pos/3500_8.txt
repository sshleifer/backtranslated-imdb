In an attempt to convince the Prime Minister to support Ali G as a candidate for Staines in local elections, the candidate quite inappropriate, the vile Chancellor David Carlton (Charles Dance) hopes to discredit the current leader of his party, allowing him to seize power. To his surprise, however, the project turns against Ali, who joins the nation and Carlton is forced to find other ways to try to secure his political future. <br /> <br /> Puerile, brutal, misogynistic and always scandalous: Ali G Indahouse, the big screen outing of the Berkshire gangsta of the middle class of Sascha Baron Cohen, is this all and much more ?? which means it's my kind of movie !! <br /> <br /> Obviously, there are those who are just not going to be joking, and there will certainly be people who will find jokes about oral sex, homosexuality, drug use recreational purposes, hardcore pornography and the extreme offensive of the Queen's regions (needless to say) should stay away!), but if you find juvenile humor hilarious, if you are a fan of the Baron Cohen in general or if you just want to see Rhona Mitra hottie in her underwear (and you're proud of him, because she's in good shape!), Then I recommend spending an hour and a half with Ali G and West S taines Massive. <br /> <br /> They are mean!
