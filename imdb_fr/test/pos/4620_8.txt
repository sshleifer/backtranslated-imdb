Anyone who identifies this as a simple 'Elephant' scam - are there any other comments you can make about the film itself as an individual film (regardless of its similarities? apparent with other films). <Br /> <br /> Anyone who doubts the validity of the film - regarding his stereotypical characters (the obligatory gay, the jock, the disabled kid, etc.) - I do not know how long it takes since you've been to school - but no matter how amateurish the role is - the events happening are surprisingly close to what can actually happen. <br /> <br /> And all those who ignore the movie as being so simple: only six teenagers with the usual teenage anguish that pushes a person above the limit ... does anyone stopped thinking and noticed that the girl who committed suicide was not really one of those six !! As one comment noted, she had a maximum screen time of 2 minutes (excluding final scenes). I think the purpose of the film is not just to make teenage anxiety a problem, but how far it can go to someone - but also that it does not seem obvious who always risk to commit such an act (suicide) ...
