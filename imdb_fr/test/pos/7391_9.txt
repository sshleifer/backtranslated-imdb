The first time I saw this movie, I wanted to like it for so many reasons, but I just did not do it. It just seemed a little dull. But there was a small question I had about something I saw at the beginning of the movie, so I watched it again ?? and then finally he clicked for me. I first looked at the movie knowing that the end was surprised, and although I do not recommend spoiling the end, I still enjoyed the main part of the film and the discovery of the many seemingly insignificant events to which all can not return. a very sinister scheme. <br /> <br /> I do not think everyone will like this movie, or even love it. If you like one of the actors, you'll like this movie because the acting is pretty loud and they all have a lot of time on the screen. If you like mysteries (especially Hitchcock), you'll love this movie. If you like independent or psychological movies, you'll love this movie. It really worked for me on all these levels. If you do not like actors, mysterious intrigues or psychological elements, you might not like this movie. But it's your loss. Personally, the only thing that a little upset me was the accents. Good test, Alan Rickman, on the American dialect, but the scene has not improved much compared to Die Hard. (The wonderful voice, however, compensates for this strange accent.) The mixture of accents in the film was a bit strange, but it was not so distracting that it became difficult or particularly irritating. Also, changing the camera from one scene to another was obvious and could bother some people, but I think it actually adds scenes (or a scene - I can only really remember a scene where the change was very different, but it worked). <br /> <br /> When you see this movie, watch it at least twice. The second time you see it, I hope you realize how complex the plot is. Whenever I watch this movie (less than an hour and a half, so many views are not difficult), I seem to notice something else about it and ask myself, "Why is this this happened? " or "Was it intentional?" I like movies that make me think. This one does. So just see him. Two times.
