A moving documentary that gives a human face to the September 11 tragedy by showing how a small community united to honor two high school friends lost that day. The film intertwines Chris and Tom's life through interviews with family and friends and excerpts from old photos. Through their memories, we see two tragically shortened lives. The film also shows how, through a series of coincidences, an inspiring memorial garden was created thanks to the efforts of many people, known and unknown to both victims. Through laughter and tears (and sweat), we see the power of hope, honor and love. This film evokes a lot of different emotions, but the final feeling is that of the admiration of the human spirit that does not fear tragedy.
