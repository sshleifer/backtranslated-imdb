I saw it for the first time at 5 am on January 1, 2009, and after a day, I looked at it again and want to watch it again. I love everything (almost, so 9 stars). No color, beautiful naive stories, funny gangsters, Anna, camera work, music. Sometimes you just want to listen a little longer and the music stops. But it's not a musical after all. I love Anna's play, this naive gangster girl, how she talks, holds the gun, everything makes me smile. No, it's not so funny, even if I laughed a few moments, it's so subtle. Excellent work of Samuel Benchetrit. Although the new 3d seems weaker, they are also gangsters, maybe even worse, as they steal ideas. And the last scene is my favorite. It makes me feel so warm and .. romantic. Yes, I would recommend this film to romantic souls with a taste for such artistic films. And I do not agree with those who compare it to Pulp Fiction. It is not about action and twisted history, although all the vignettes intertwine. It's a calm film and maybe too slow for most people. It's about the characters, their feelings, very subtle. Anyway, this review will probably not help anyone (my first), I just wanted to express my gratitude. <br /> <br /> SPOILER: This movie does not have a Goofs section. Wonderful, did not anyone notice that hand in Part 2 when the kidnappers decided to go home? Looks like part of the crew, hehe. I know I should post this better in the forums, but I do not agree with some policies here.
