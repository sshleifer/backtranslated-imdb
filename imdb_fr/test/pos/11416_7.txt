I am a big fan of horror and I really enjoyed this remake. With all these horror remedies floating around, I think this is one of the best attempts. <br /> <br /> I watched it with my two little sisters and I think it made it even better, because they were very scared. Also with the cries on the screen "Do not do that!", "Not like that!", Etc. I thought there were good little nervous moments and it was good tension. <br /> <br /> Camilla Belle is absolutely gorgeous in the main role and a very good actress - so she holds your attention. <br /> <br /> Overall, a decent movie.
