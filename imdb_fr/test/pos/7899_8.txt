Let's face it, you know what to expect when you tune in to a post-1990 Corey Feldman movie, there are probably breasts, guns and cars. In saying this, this film is not limited to naked ladies (I'm sorry to say), because they are mainly people who are killed in various unusual ways and, as the name suggests, often "mystical" . I love the horror of shit, and I love this movie. If you do not, you probably will not do it. but I think it's worth it for most people to try, it's not so bad that it spoils your weekend or anything. All in all, if you're having a good time, a little love of corpses and a childhood 80's superstar, you're in the right place. it's a biscuit !!!!
