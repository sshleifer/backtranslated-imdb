I am extremely sad for some readers of this movie. It is obvious that their standards are so high that they will never be able to enjoy a movie just for fun. Or maybe their pleasure comes from the act of choosing movies; Looking for some reason not to like them? <br /> <br /> The Long Kiss Goodnight is an action movie, in every sense of the word. Of course, there are holes in the plot big enough to pass a movie, but none of them is enough to stop the flow of the movie itself. I have never been a big fan of Geena Davis, but I was impressed by the way she was able to create two very different characters, Samantha Cain and Charlie Baltimore. In my opinion, it was not even necessary to have changed his physical appearance to make the difference between the two ... his game was more than enough to do the trick. <br /> <br /> More than anything else, though, This movie was Craig Bierko's. In the hands of another, Timothy's character could have been another interchangeable villain. His decision to play him with a more casual approach was just the right counterpoint to all the action scenes. It is not common for you to find an actor who can express himself as well with his facial expressions as ... if any: the scene in the freezer with Charlie and his daughter. Where most of the films would have cluttered the moment of "revelation" with useless dialogue, Bierko's eyes told the whole story. <br /> <br /> The basic plot? Thin, to be honest. An apparently average housewife who suffers from amnesia slowly discovers that she was a murderer. As his memory returns, so are those who want the death of the murderer. Is it really Samantha, the housewife who prepares the cookies, or Charlie, the cold-blooded murderer? Or maybe a bit of both? For me, The Long Kiss Goodnight was a nice trip to discover.
