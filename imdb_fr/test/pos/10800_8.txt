It was not a bad movie, but it could have been done without the frontal nudity of a 10-year-old boy in one of the opening scenes. This film has an excellent dialogue. which is certainly common among foreign films. Foreign actors always know how to act against American actors who leave the CGI, waterfalls and special effects all the work in their place. This movie is just a good old fashionable game. Gerarde DePardieux did a great job, as always. The costumes and sets are accurate over time. My only complaint is that they should have doubled the English words on the French instead of using subtitles; it could just be because I hate reading subtitles.
