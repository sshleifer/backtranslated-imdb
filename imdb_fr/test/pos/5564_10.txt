Other commentators tell WAAAAY why the Farscape show was (temporarily) put to rest. This has nothing to do with the quality of the "released" programs. In fact, the opposite is true. They continued to get better and better! :) I've seen all the episodes and when you just watch them, you realize how cooler it is, and the subplots of Wormhole & Aeryn are really interesting and give it MORE ambiance, not less . Before, it was a little chaotic, slow and rather aimless. They passed like the first two seasons of this type of enemy, but in the other two years they were actually trying to do something :) Also, I've never seen such a fun mix of girls and girls sexy attitudes in Sci-Fi. The blue girl - Zahn - was cool, but not "sexy". They literally got to the point where the girls were running in leather corsets and high heels that exploded extraterrestrials - now, tell me, what could be cooler than that ??? :)) <br /> <br /> The real reason Farscape went a bit was because it was too expensive - and it's a good thing for the fans, because the show, watched from start to finish last, is really an epic 60-hour movie, with all the cinematics of the blockbuster (ok, ok, they use a lot of similar sets, but the CG is excellent and the girls are sexxxy). <br /> <br /> Blah blah - The real reason is because TV shows are about profit. This is a company, and the Sci Fi channel or anyone who does not get as much feedback on this expensive Farscape show as they could with shows like Junk Show as "Stargate". Lexx was really cool until they got rid of the hot German and replaced it with that weird oddity. <br /> <br /> Anyway, remember this: Farscape kept getting better, until it was like before. a little movie every week. Then the networks decided, "hey, people are going to look at any old drek song we're throwing in the air as long as it's the only science fiction thing at this hour, so why are we spending all this stuff money in Farscape? budget 'Stargate' in the throat of people and call it a 'hit series' because it's like we're playing every night damn LOL :)) <br /> <br /> It's like I also have to tell you that Claudia Black is a really cool actress. "After getting a new look (she has puffy eyes), she looked really cool - one of those dynamic guys like Judy Davis, and sometimes very sexy, sometimes ugly - like a roller coaster I would like by Claudia Black with Lucy Lawless in style and substance - both VERY fun to watch - not just Chrichton :) And yes, you can to say that the pregnancy was a little old-fashioned, but how many sci-fi shows have does romantic, credible and deep, romantic plot that actually goes somewhere and progresses ?? It was legitimately cool as a love story - the actors in the show are awesome. It's a shame that the series is in limbo for the moment, but I hope it will return soon in other episodes and in movies, because I will buy them really! :-RE
