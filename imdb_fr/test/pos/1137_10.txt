I saw this movie a long time ago, just once, and I did not know where it came from, and I searched for about six years to find it, and I finally found it here on IMDb. com! The whole concept of the movie is great, I think it has something to do with a race of biological beings, keeping an eye on us and our planet, but there is a person who avoids being equated with compliance . And the way it does it, not to be tracked and located, is what makes the movie entertaining. I do not remember exactly how it ended, but I remember, it ended with an excellent climax and a good turn.
