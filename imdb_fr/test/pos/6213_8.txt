Let's listen to this so that those who consult this page look for information on anything related to the word "Breasts" (and you know who you are, googlers) can continue: this is by no means pornographic. On the contrary, if it has value as a masturbation material, then, frankly, the filmmaker did not do a good job since the goal is to keep it on the subject and on the experiences of women and their bodies and images of themselves and society and health and so on. Indeed, I would be a little wary of the one who came across this video on DVD or, if necessary, late night on HBO or Cinemax and used it as a means of pleasure. You might as well go to the supermarket and take a pair of ripe melons and bring them home and hug them and, well, you got the idea. <br /> <br /> No, it's a semi-serious movie - which is meant for premium late-night screenings, but it should not be reserved for night-time types. It is intimate in the establishment but not in the tone. All women, in all their forms, sizes, and races, and even with one man thrown with false breasts, have something precious to say, drawn from the experience of life in the most direct manner. If I say semi-serious, it's due to the many small segments that the director feels she has to add, with archive images of old videos "How to" on puberty and sex and breasts, as well as cartoons super rare with flying hitters on. This is not a problem, but an asset: we need some small visual differences between these interviews. <br /> <br /> Nothing is retained, and we see it as a feminism in a liberating form: they do not need to cover themselves, and even if they choose not to remove their top, their shirt and bra, they are always open, which can be a natural part of their body that is an object of sex, surprise, comfort, discomfort, curiosity, motherhood and, unfortunately, cancer . In this last part, another courageous step was taken when we see a woman who survived her cancer with only one breast. You know that you have become an adult and an adult when you can see this woman who has continued to lead a semi-normal life with only one breast (the most bitter-sweet moment is the one where she says if a fairy godmother says she could have only one wish to have two full breasts, it would have to think about it), and you do not sneer or go "eww, gross." This is the test we must do. <br /> <br /> The recording was not filmed in the best circumstances, but it is still a question of television. It's never boring for a moment, and we never think that anyone will hold back, especially when a man hears the truth as if the breasts were not really erogenous, or that a flat chest attracted many men. Breasts: A documentary consists of deconstructing myths with real faces, breasts, minds and hearts laid bare. If it deserves a "I was alone" session, well, more power for you, I suppose, although that's not the intention.
