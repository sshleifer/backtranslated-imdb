I rented this movie because it was a very popular documentary. It's more of a study of a bastard son trying to find out who his biological father is than anything about architecture. <br /> <br /> More than anything else, the underlying theme of the film is that we have a praised, perhaps an architect of genius who has little importance for everything that is in outside of his profession. <br /> <br /> The tragedy of the film lies in the broken families he left behind. Her baby mothers were more despised fans than irresponsible women, which can only give negative results for children. <br /> <br /> That said, Nathaniel, the film's producer and son of Louis Khan, has come across quite stable and curious, if not bitter. The people he interviewed were of course more interested in Louis Khan's buildings than in his personal problems, but I find that the mix of themes made the film interesting. <br /> <br /> As for his buildings, I found them abstract. art - strange, impractical, and generally only appreciated by so-called critics.
