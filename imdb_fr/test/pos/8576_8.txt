I have already seen this film twice and I am very impressed. <br /> <br /> The conversations between Nimi and her mother, as well as Nimi and Matthew are very touching. The Nigerian community is shown in a very sincere and as colorful as it usually is. <br /> <br /> Although some things could have been done with a little more explanation; if we knew first why Matthew was in the south of France, the scenes that would follow his discovery in his car would be more understandable. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, Optimum Releasing has a website with detailed production notes. it would help make such scenes easier to understand. <br /> <br /> I would like to go see him again, but unfortunately, he had only a limited output in London and is no longer available. I hope that the release of the video will reach a wider audience, because the film deserves it.
