Two people living in the same apartment complex find that their partners have an affair with each other. As they try to understand how this happened, they also embark on an emotional journey difficult to solve ?? <br /> <br /> With his previous success with Happy Together and Chungking Express, Wong Kar Wai tells us about it. rather old-fashioned and wonderful story of awakened passions, aspiration and unrequited love. <br /> <br /> Maybe in the mood of love does not suit all tastes. He walks rather lazily 98 minutes: not really long for a film, but it seems longer because it does not happen much. But this feeling of laziness hides a rather tight film. Most of the story is skilfully articulated around a series of well-defined role-plays, in which characters play presumed scenarios between their respective wives, trying to understand the beginning of the affair. I say cunning because, of course, it prevents the audience (and the characters) from saying what is "in the role" and what is authentic. <br /> <br /> If all this tells you something arty and self-aware, it's because it is. Without shame. And it's played to perfection by two of Hong Kong's top players, Maggie Cheung and Leung Chui Wai, with excellent support from Ping Lam Siu and Rebecca Pan. <br /> <br /> It is also a virtuoso performance by Wong Kar Wai that treats the audience with sensory and sensual overload. Bringing together Christopher Doyle (who later deployed his lush and overripe style on Hero) and Pin Bing Lee (whose admirably understated style can be seen in a small town in the spring) was a cinematic genius. He has all the bold beauty of Doyle, without, to say the least, the Athena-poster clash of his work on Hero. Music, as always with Wong, is important. From Nat King Cole singing in Spanish to the haunted strings of the main theme, this perfectly matches the eclectic beauty of the images. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's a leading film, whether it's judged by intrigue, drama, cinematography or soundtrack. Similar to Wim Wenders' Wings of Desire, but more accessible than this, it is a beautiful old story about lost and found love. <br /> <br /> And watch Tony Leung's Hotel Room 2046, which presaged the recent Wong movie of the same name.
