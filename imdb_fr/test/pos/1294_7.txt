A charming story about two evacuees, has been transformed into a nice little film by the BBC. Most kids who love a good story will appreciate that. The characters are very well played by a very good cast. Not sure our American friends appreciate it, but they get a mention, while Aunt Lou runs away with a magnificent American soldier.
