"Strike Force" or "The Librarians" is a fun action movie that does not take itself too seriously. William Forsythe interprets the role of Simon, who searches for the missing daughter of a rich client. He meets Sandi (Erika Eleniak) who is also looking for someone, her sister. But there are bad guys on foot. The most devilish of all is Marcos Canarious (Andrew Divoff). Marcos likes to kill people. So now, Simon and Sandi have to team up to bring down the bad guys. The whole cast is great, with Divoff flying the movie. There are also cameos from Ed Lauter and Burt Reynolds. If you are looking for a good action movie, watch it and have fun.
