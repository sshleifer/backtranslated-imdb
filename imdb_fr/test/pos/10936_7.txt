There must have been some interesting conversations about the filming of Eagle's Wing, with Martin Sheen just after Apocalypse Now, alongside the actor he replaced in the Coppola film, Harvey Keitel. A true child of a bad movie, dating back to the last big batch of westerns in 1979-1980, he was widely criticized at the time for having been directed by a British studio and director (conveniently ignoring the fact that many classic American westerns led by European emigrants), which seems a bit of an overreaction. <br /> <br /> The plot is a simplicity itself, the inexperienced trapper Martin Sheen finding himself fighting with Sam Waterston's beautiful white horse, the Eagle's Wing, Kiowa warrior through a rough and primitive landscape at a time "before the beginning of legends". In addition to the captive Irish governor Caroline Langrishe, secondary actors have little to do (St√©phane Audran can never even open his mouth) and it's a little slow, but the film Anthony Harvey offers great photographs Scope by Billy Williams and a good score by Marc Wilkinson.
