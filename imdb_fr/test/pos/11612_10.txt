When you wait years before seeing a movie you've heard about the vine, your expectations are obviously high, do not you? f ** k yeah! But when this baby came through my door, I did not know what visuals could have embellished my television and distorted my fragile mind. First of all, Karim Hussein is a movie buff as all of us who grow up to the Argento / Fulci / Lynch regime etc ..... and it shows in this movie, but in the good sense of the word. Even though I did not really know what was happening with my first watch of this jewel, I was amazed by the visuals, the lighting and, of course, the performances of all those involved, Karim really had to believe that he was going to do it. push the boundaries of filmmaking (which I'm sure of) and thought it would be hard to convince the actors to do the same ........ <br /> <br /> I'm talking to you of "subconscious cruelty"? Well without spoiling it ... it's a deep glimpse of the human psyche with images of violent and sexual madness working in madness ..... a truly unforgettable experience ..... .. <br /> > <br /> keep an eye on Karim Hussein, he can only go on better things ..... <br /> <br /> I visualized the entire raw copy of unconscious cruelty on a double disc DVD of Infliction movies that is loaded with extras ..... please note that there is a censored outing of Hong Kong out there avoiding this version.
