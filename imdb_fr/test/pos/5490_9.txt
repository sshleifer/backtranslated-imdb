I watched The Perfect Storm and thought of another Wolfgang Peterson movie that is much better - this one. While this is certainly not based on a true story, In the Line of Fire is the way a movie should be made. He has a great story with a big cast. Malkovich won a well-deserved Oscar for his performance as a scary killer with a grudge against the government that he served too well. Eastwood is good as the tortured secret service and Russo is sweet to the eyes. If you have not seen it, rent it or buy it as I did. Certainly one of the best thrillers of the last decade. 9/10
