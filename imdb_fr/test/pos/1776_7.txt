Directed by Jacques Tourneur (The Cat People, From the Past, Night of the Demon) and written by Phillip Dunne (How Green was in my Valley) Anne of the Indies is a very interesting pirate adventure movie. Her main character, Captain Anne Providence, is based on a real pirate woman, Anne Boney, who lived and crossed the 18th century Atlantic. <br /> <br /> The film begins with the naval battle where Anne's pirate ship (Jean Peters) attacks a merchant ship that was en route to Europe from South America. Thus a handsome French officer, Pierre La Rochelle (Louis Jourdan), captured is captured. Anne eventually falls in love with him and apparently her feelings are reciprocal, but only until she releases him when she discovers he has a beautiful young woman, Molly (Debra Paget), whose he is very much in love. Anne begins to take revenge on both of them but, in an unexpected twist of fate, ends up making a big sacrifice to save them instead. The figure of the "Black Beard" cliche in the pirate film also makes its appearance here, this time interpreted by Thomas Gomez. <br /> <br /> Even if Anne of India seems not to be anything other than a pirates movie revisited clich√©s, it still has its classic moments in beautiful visuals and naval battle sequences filmed in Technicolor as well as in certain aspects of the story and especially in personal touches in the production of Jacques Tourneur. 7/10
