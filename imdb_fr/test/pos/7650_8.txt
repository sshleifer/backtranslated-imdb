It certainly would not have been my kind of movie, but my husband saw it on TV and said it was really good. So, on her recommendation, I bought a copy because I did not know if she would be on TV again. I had never heard of anyone other than Armand Assante. At first, I struggled to get into the story, because the first part of the movie is a jumble of images - and that does not make much sense. It is only later in the film that everything is set up. Cutting scenes - if that's what it's called, is a little shocking - it sometimes seems like a few images have been cut out in each scene, and the scenes are jerky - but I guess that was done to add to the unusual (if it's a word). The story turns here and there, and by the time you have understood everything, everything is turned upside down and you have to readjust your thinking to know who is the bad guy and who is not. Or bad woman. The acting is very good - I kept thinking about how much Norman Reedus looks like Leo Decaprio. The end was a real turn, totally unexpected, which I liked. A good show.
