Terrifying and deeply moving crime thriller starring Andy Lau and Lau Ching Wan. <br /> <br /> From the vertiginous opening sequence to the extremely satisfying conclusion, this cat and this mouse smile perfectly. <br /> <br /> Johnny To, who is once again working with astute composer Arthur Wong, is building another opera actor who is crying in front of his contemporaries. <br /> <br /> The images of To are strong and touching. His cut, combined with extraordinary musical sounds, is exemplary. You are in the hands of a cinematic master. <br /> <br /> The two sequences in which Andy Lau "hides" cops in a bus pretending to accompany a beautiful beauty (Ruby Wong) testify to the singularity of To director skills. <br /> <br /> Lau Ching Wan is strong and powerful as a harassed cop while Andy Lau is dynamic as a dying man avenging the death of his father. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie, only slightly compromised by a bad English dub in a scene with the criminal Waise Lee.
