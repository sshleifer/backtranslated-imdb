We all seem to agree. It was an excellent show and let it drop well before time. I decided that if I really enjoy a show, it's often the kiss of death. I love the offbeat and quirky ensemble distribution shows, and a fantastic setting always helps. I was really expecting to see a lot of these stars in other TV productions, but apart from Mariska Hagartay who played Fisher Stephens' crazy girlfriend, I did not see much except in roles. casual. What a shame. Key West, Northern Exposure, the Gilmore Girls and Veronica Mars ... all excellent shows, all sadly gone before their time. <br /> <br /> Listen loud and clear, we want Key West on DVD ..... please.
