I highly recommend this movie to everyone. My son and I first read the book and then saw the movie. While the book was better (in my opinion), the movie was still good. My son and I agree that even though we like the book version as the best, we liked the end of the movie better than the end of the book. The scenery is fantastic and the soundtrack is a must. The fact that Jimmy Buffett plays a small role and provides music is an added bonus. Luke Wilson does a decent job as a Delinko agent and is about what I had mentally imagined what Delinko would look like reading the book. I'm surprised it did not get better in the theaters and I'll wait for the DVD to come out.
