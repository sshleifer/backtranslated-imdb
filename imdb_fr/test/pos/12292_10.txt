I watched Pola X because Scott Walker composed the score and I admire his music a lot. Frankly, I was expecting a French film a little pretentious and perhaps incoherent. I was wrong. The vision of the film quickly caught my attention to the fullest - starting with the opening sequence, which shows black-and-white images of military planes throwing bombs at graves at the sound of music and the beautiful groaning voice of Scott Walker. The film explores the identity crisis of Pierre (Guillaume Depardieu - a brilliant choice for the role) and its consequent (self) destruction. The story is divided into two parts ?? the first describes the carefree life of Peter in a beautiful French country house and the second follows his personal disintegration after having abandoned everything and settled in Paris to live in misery with his supposed half-sister. Both parts contain surprisingly amazing photographs ?? the first very colorful and luminous, the second quite dark and almost apocalyptic - making it a real aesthetic feast. Pola X is a fascinating and quite unique cinematic experience.
