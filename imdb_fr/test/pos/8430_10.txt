"The China Syndrome" could not have been published at a better time: Twelve days after its publication, the infamous Three-Mile Island attempt has occurred. But even if this (and / or Chernobyl) never took place, this film remains an important look at what could happen with bad management of nuclear facilities. Jack Lemmon plays five stars as a supervisor trying to hide a cover-up in his nuclear power plant, with Jane Fonda playing the reporter trying to investigate, and Michael Douglas playing his cameraman. <br /> <br /> I don You do not know if the threat of current terrorist attack makes "China's Syndrome" more disturbing, but in any case, it is still a film that all the world should see. <br /> <br /> I hope these people who have spent years to put pressure on the nuclear industry have seen this film so that they know that their ideas and ideals are completely over.
