First of all, I almost never watch Swedish movies, and this is the second time in my life that I'm watching a Swedish movie about cinema! That's why I think it's one of the best Swedish movies of all time! The combination of thrills and humor is exceptional, and sometimes you do not even know if you have to be terrified or just laugh! The plot is about this man, a writer who wants to go to Germany after the Second World War and help the Germans to start all over again. On his way to Germany, he tries to help his friends on the train, which is a bad idea. What a clumsy fool! And poor Robert Gustafsson - the wounded soldier - is still an obstacle ... OUCH !!! But he always had his good mood. A positive guy. Robert Gustafsson has made less good films in recent years and it's really a relief. He is awesome in this movie. After all, it's one of the best Swedish movies of all time and Peter Dalle did a great job! Congratulations!
