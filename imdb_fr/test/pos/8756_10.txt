Traffik is a 6 hour soap opera about drugs very well done (circa 1987). He also tells three stories about opium cultivation in northeastern Pakistan, the smuggling of drugs from Pakistan and its entry into Europe, and the fact that drug addicts are out of control. The three stories are told in a realistic and empathic way. You see enough lives of characters to understand how ordinary people can be sucked into a truly immoral life. <br /> <br /> These are not cardboard cuts, the opium grower is trying to feed his family. a dry area filled with firearms and other opium producers. The drug dealer is a wealthy German without a heart, but his wife (one of the three main characters) is just an ordinary woman who has to choose between leading her life "old fashioned" or giving up. Finally the main character, the minister has the most difficult role because he has to deal with the emotional devastation caused by his own daughter. She slips into the world of addiction and begins to steal, suffering from health problems, attacking her parents with emotion, all to be able to continue to satisfy her desire for drugs (the heroine) who destroys her life. <br /> <br /> Traffik is one of the best dramas I have ever seen on television. The scenes of this show will stay with you for a very long time. Highly recommended. - Colin Glassey
