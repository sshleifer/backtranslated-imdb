Last year, I fell in love with Tim Burton's version of Sweeney Todd. I wanted to check the other versions of this musical and it was found in the library. Although I think that Burton is the best solution, probably because I like cinema a lot better than theater, it's still an excellent production of history. I have not seen any of the other versions yet, but I'm trying to get my hands on it. <br /> <br /> After seeing Johnny Depp as Todd, I can not imagine anyone else in the role, but Hearn does a fantastic job. Angela Lansbury is great, as always, and all the songs are fantastic. I found myself singing. It's a play you will not want to miss, but try to see it before you see the movie version so you do not have a partial vision like me.
