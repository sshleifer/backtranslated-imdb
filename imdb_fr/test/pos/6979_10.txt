For science fiction fans, this movie is exactly what you expected. Watching this movie, you get lost in the characters, especially Riddick, the movie villain. This is the case where you are attached to the villain and want to see him live and win. As you watch the survivors struggling to stay alive, you can not wait to see who lives and how they survived these unknown creatures that have invaded the planet. An excellent movie, Vin Diesel did a wonderful job as a convicted Riddick and the acting and suspense were delightful.
