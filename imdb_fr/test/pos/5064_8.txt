Is torture ever right? No The answer is simple and absolute, without qualification possible. The reason this film has shown is the effect of torture on society. The values ​​that have been fiercely defended in Western society during centuries of revolution and struggle are to allow ALL men and women to live in a free and open society. Where individuals are treated equally and respectful of their human rights as human beings. To protect this society, institutions have been created to deal with wrongdoing in an open, fair and honest manner. These institutions have been adapted and perfected over generations of hard work. It could be argued that these are the foundations of democracy, because they all belong to us, allow us all to be heard. If we allow undemocratic and inhumane acts to be committed on our behalf, if we divide our society into two categories: those who have rights and those who do not, we cancel the work of our ancestors. Moreover, we are all accomplices and all guilty and defiled. Whether those whom we accuse are guilty or not is of no importance. We are defined by our attitudes and our responses.
