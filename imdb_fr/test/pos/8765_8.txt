Saboteur is a 1942 film, aimed in part at getting American support for the war against Nazi Germany. Propaganda or not, it's great entertainment. The main actors are Robert Cummings and Priscilla Lane, although director Alfred Hitchcock wanted Gary Cooper and Barbara Stanwyck in the roles, which would have given more weight to the film. It's still a good movie with Robert Cummings and Priscilla Lane bringing their own style to the characters. As in other Hitchcock films, we see the director's disdain for the socially suave and the rich. He has often described foreign spies and agents as nice people of the upper class who at the same time mocked democratic values ​​and concepts such as guilt to the proof of his innocence. These traitors are the last ones the police pursue or even suspect. Hitchcock had his whole life mistrusted by the police. He wanted to bring up the ordinary guy, the bungler and the guy who does not take himself too seriously. We can see him wanting Gary Cooper as an icon of Frank Capra's mold. Nevertheless, Bob Cummings himself marks the boy next door and works well in the role. Priscilla Lane, as a mischievous female leader, presents herself as the American girl who can cope very well when she is put to the test. Robert Cummings, as a worker in the defense factory, Barry Kane, is accused of a bomb attack that kills his best friend. This leads to a hunting scene across the country that recalls the other Hitchcock heroes on the run. Hitchcock repeats some of the well-established formulas of previous films - the reluctant woman who is dragged into action, for example. Madeleine Carroll in the 39 steps, and risk her life to escape the authorities who are on her heels. We see scenes of America while Kane tries to find the real culprit of the bombings of which he is accused. We see rivers, bridges, log cabins, truckers, the Hoover Dam and finally, New York City. New York is an ideal backdrop for the climax as we move from the Rockefeller Center to the ships (with a cup for the Normandy ship) and to the grand finale of the Statue of Liberty. Great movie with uninterrupted action. Do not miss it.
