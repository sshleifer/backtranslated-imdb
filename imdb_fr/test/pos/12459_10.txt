The biggest Tarzan ever! This film is made in a way that no other Tarzan has ever come close to. It contains everything you would like in a Tarzan movie. No other Tarzan film has ever described the character as well. I would say that if you've seen a movie from Tarzan and you liked it, you should see it, you'll like it, and if you've never seen Tarzan, you should see it and forget the rest.
