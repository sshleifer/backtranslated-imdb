The elegant and convincing view of Paul Thomas Anderson's 70s porn industry follows Eddie Adams, aka Dirk Diggler (Mark Wahlberg), after six years of sex, drugs and disco. His chance encounter with porn director Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds) begins his career as one of the biggest adult actors of the moment. Dirk's character is based on porn actor John Holmes, who, like Dirk, was known for being "very well endowed". This is where Dirk finds his first success. <br /> <br /> The main themes of Boogie Nights are the most obvious related to a film of this kind; pornography, drugs, sex, treason, violence and music. Boogie Nights treats the topic of pornography with some control. This is not exaggerated and the sex scenes are surprisingly minimal, but they are mentally explicit as they unfold on the screen. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, cocaine is heavily consumed and the setting of the film, Los Angeles 1977-1983, reflects the popularity of the drug at that time, which the film captures perfectly. However, Boogie Nights does not promote cocaine because some scenes contain addictions and overdoses. For example, at Jack's party, they find a girl who has recently had a graphic overdose. the blood runs from her nose and she begins an unconscious crisis. The film, before this scene, was rather optimistic and comical, but from that moment, it suggests the darkness in which it will occur. <br /> <br /> The musical scenes are performed brilliantly, disco scenes beautifully staged Dirk sings terribly in his new musical career. The soundtrack is also excellent, with songs from The Emotions, ELO, The Beach Boys and the unforgettable sound experience. The standout scene throughout the film boils down to music; Dirk, John Redd Rothchild (John C. Reilly) and Todd Parker (Thomas Jane) go to the drug dealer Rahad Jackson (Alfred Molina) to earn some money through the sale of fictitious drugs, but Sister Christian of Night Ranger, who plays the film in the background, incredibly increases the intensity of the scene, proving that music can bring much more depth to a scene. Boogie Nights is filled with this kind of scenes, which makes the movie even more fantastic. <br /> <br /> The standout performance in Boogie Nights is Burt Reynolds as an enigmatic and yet morose filmmaker. In the scene where he attacks a young man for criticizing his films, it is a complete shock for the public, because previously he was rather calm and happy. Julianne Moore, Heather Graham as Rollergirl, John C. Reilly and Mark Wahlberg perform the show of her career. <br /> <br /> Boogie Nights is also a surprisingly original film, which uses many themes but filmed in its clean and realistic manner. Anderson's approach fully captured these characters at a time when nothing seemed to go wrong, or at least until the arrival of the 80s. From then on, the situation became very dark and all the signs of characters and recognizable situations from the first part of the film are gone. This does not, however, reduce the high level of entertainment this movie offers. <br /> <br /> Boogie Nights was not a box office success, earning only 2 million pounds in British theaters. But this is not the concern of the film or the director. Anderson recognizes quality, not popularity, which is evident in his other three films, Hard Eight, Magnolia and Punch-Drunk Love. I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a simple parable full of excellent and variable situations, because at the end of this film, you will realize that Boogie Nights is a simple tale of morality, but will remain in your mind for several days after your viewing . he. Boogie Nights is shocking, hilarious, devastating, and visually and audibly remarkable.
