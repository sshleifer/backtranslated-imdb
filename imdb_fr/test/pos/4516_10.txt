I know that to include everything in the book, the film should have lasted several hours. So I think they did their best to include crucial and essential elements in the story. I thought the cast was great, the kids who played Amir and Hassan were very good actors. And the guy who played Amir as an adult was great! The scenes between him and Baba were particularly touching. I thought the places they used were interesting ... scenes taking place in Afghanistan were shot in China, and a scene in Fremont, California (the graduation scene) was shot in Treasure. Island in San Francisco. I worked one day as "extra" on "Kite Runner" and it was that day, the day they filmed the graduation scene. We went to Treasure Island in the morning. They checked everyone's wardrobe to make sure it looked like the late '80s, then we took our place in the audience. They toured the scene time and time again until they were satisfied. It was cool to see the actors closely and also to see the author of the book, who was present as a history consultant. I thought this book was excellent and I recommend both the book and the movie. It is a touching story of friendship, love, guilt and eventual redemption. "There is a way to become good again."
