I must admit that I was surprised at the quality of this movie when I first watched it. I had planned to see him in theaters during the summer, but I discovered in an unpleasant way that he had already left. Therefore, I expected it to be removed from theaters because it was bad. Then, today, I rented it, I looked at it and I really enjoyed it. The speed at which events were happening was debatable, it could have been a little longer. I thought it was very true to the book, but it left out some crucial parts: the real name of Mullet Finger, and so on. I felt like I had not read the book, I really did not understand what was going on. The acting was pretty good, other than I expected to be mediocre, but the cop, sorry not to remember the name of the actor, could have done a little better. Overall, I found this movie very entertaining and I would recommend it to anyone!
