This is my favorite game for the Nintendo 64 platform. I have played many first-person shooter games, and I have never really liked any of them, but this game has a little something about which I can not put my finger on, which makes it an incredible pleasure. Maybe it's the extraordinary detail put in the game. Maybe it's the fluid movement of the characters. Maybe it's the gadgets and the weapons. Maybe it's the sweet character of James Bond. Anyway, this game never seems to age, no matter how many times I have played it.
