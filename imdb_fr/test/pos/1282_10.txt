Even with just $ 6,000 and a cast of part-timers, Christopher Nolan was a master. Nolan is, in my opinion, the next great one and our first contact with Nolan does not contradict it. <br /> <br /> None of the problems that constantly plague and discredit the low-budget independent photo haunts Nolan and his team. Our actors are inexperienced and young, but they deliver and engage us in this story. In all honesty, I think Follow is Nolan's best screenplay because it's the one he's in control of most. It's a beautifully imagined film. It takes us into a world where we do not feel limited by budget constraints. Dialogue and atmosphere are bold and intelligent. <br /> <br /> Nolan's characteristic method of telling the story in an uninterrupted way is applied for the first time here and here, it's done in a way that gives you the whole story. . With Memento and The Prestige, you have to think a little to understand the genius, but Nolan does not try to confuse people with his prototype film. We can distinguish time by the appearance of our protagonist. This narrative method is both creative and engaging. I'm glad Nolan was so successful with that because his films become more than they could be with this method. The fallout from the Prestige and Memento would not have been exciting at all if the film had been told in a conventional format. This idea was realized with moderate success before, but Nolan really adopted it. <br /> <br /> The scenario is the best of Nolan. I had doubts about his writing skills, I always imagined that his brother Jonathon was a writing talent, but he proves the opposite with Follow. It's a stimulating story that makes interesting observations about people and how they work. Cobb's evaluations of burglary and how it may lead you to discover what motivates people to speak seem plausible. <br /> <br /> My only complaint is that the work of the camera sometimes becomes fragile, but that does not detract from the story or acting. <br /> <br /> Here is the first film of the man who will personify the best of the cinema of the XXIe century.
