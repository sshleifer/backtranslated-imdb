A wonderful film in the purest Scandinavian tradition, with a very far-sighted analysis of most of the big problems we are just starting to face. <br /> <br /> Should be a mandatory viewing for all politicians. <br /> Choose from privacy, nuclear sustainability, global climate change and quality of life. <br /> <br /> Recalling the Walden of Thoreaus, but with a modern twist and considerable humor. <br /> <br /> I'm not Finnish, although I went there and I have good Finnish friends, but I found it totally accessible and also culturally informative.
