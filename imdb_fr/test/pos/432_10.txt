I'm not a fan of musicals, but I'm a big fan of Jean Renoir and Jean Gabin. I rented this film on a whim and I was pleasantly surprised even to wait for the classic director. This film is beautiful. The clich√©s look like oil paintings with movement, something that many filmmakers are looking for, but Renoir MASTERS. I can not express how much this film transcends ... It's not really a musical, it just has some well-placed music numbers and a great dance finale. But there is something in this particular film that makes you feel an absolute joy when you look at it. <br /> <br /> I am a fan of foreign art films, but I am also a meathead who likes things like Die Hard and Schwarzenegger Films. I am very easily upset by things that are too happy or in "la la land", but this film has an extremely positive energy that is irresistible - not to mention that each image is beautiful and that the plot is good. 10 of 10.
