I loved this film. It's a very simple plot and from what I understand, it's based on a true story. Growing up in the '80s with hard rock / hair metal may have something to do with my love for this movie but even outside of music, it's a really fun movie to watch. Try it, you'll love it unless you're the toughest critic and you only like "Citizen Kane" quality movies.
