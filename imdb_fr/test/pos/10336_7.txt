A touching story told with tenderness: a clumsy Jewish girl from the Second World War befriends an escaped German prisoner of war hiding in his clubhouse. They discuss their lives and their beliefs (he is anti-Hitlerite), she slips him food, he becomes his only friend and ally. All this reminded me of the much better theatrical movie "Whistle Down The Wind," where Hayley Mills befriends Alan Bates, but you certainly can not blame the direction here, which is sweet, or the performances, which are sterling. Kristy McNichol is a mature woman in her teens who wears most of the photo and never strikes a false note. Suddenly, when the prisoner is discovered (and Kristy is also found), the film becomes very difficult. His father, shocked and ashamed that his child associates himself with "this Nazi", throws him a quiet fury that I have never seen before (he tells her "You died for me", which must be devastating for a little girl hear). The final scenes do not pass. there are no big meetings, no climax. The girl has to face the world and, in doing so, learns a bitter lesson about neighbors, friends and family. A surprising film.
