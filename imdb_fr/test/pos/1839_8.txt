This film does not pretend to be a great art, which is good. But it's a well written script with well-developed characters and a solid action game. I think that if I wrote it, I could do without the drama that surrounds the woman, but that was not enough to distract from the main story of the character of Minnie Driver. I think that all too often, Hollywood abandons its real-quality writing attempts to try to introduce more visual drama whereas, in an adult film like this, the type of emotional drama is all that is really needed - and probably more credible too. Overall, it is a very well made offer and worth the trip.
