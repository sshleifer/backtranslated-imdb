It's a very funny movie. There is a very disgusting, iconoclastic tone in the film that is very appealing. The characters are interesting. The film flows very well and holds your interest throughout its duration of 1 hour and 50 minutes. The quality of the film is not of the highest Hollywood standard; However, the original movie was supposed to be punk rock. The documentary about the film attempt and the treason of the filmmakers is very detailed and easy to follow. The original filmmakers themselves become the main characters in the documentary version of the film. The interviews of the filmmakers and actors were put together in a very entertaining story that illustrates the difficulties encountered during the filming of the original film, the possible failure of the original project and the renaissance of the phoenix that gave birth to this documentary film. In my mind, the documentary (A Texas Tale of Treason) is a much more interesting and entertaining film than the original movie (Waldos Hawiian Vacation) would ever have been. Well done for a job well done.
