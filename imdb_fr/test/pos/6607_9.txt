Take a topic that I did not know much and make it exciting, why not you? It turns out that in 1979, director Robert Altman had stated that he did not believe he had ever made a real movie and that he expected one of those kids to ride a skateboard - he does not break his head the first film. Well, I would not put such a wait on Stacy Peralta, but it's a skater who made a good movie. Of course, he was forced by the nature of the film that he realized to use existing images, and it is certainly a good thing that there are so many archive archives. Peralta has corrected the problem at the same time as the unusual and telling head shots of his former colleagues as they are today. The whole effect is postmodern in the best sense of the word, but it has been done. Altman's prediction has not yet been realized. However, what Peralta did is capture enough energy from those exhilarating days so we could appreciate what it must have been when modern skateboarding was invented by the Z-Boys. It's all good. I highly recommend "Dogtown".
