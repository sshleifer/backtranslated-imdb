This is a very good thriller in a nuclear power plant in southern California, directed by James Bridges and performed by Jane Fonda, Jack Lemmon and Michael Douglas. Fonda plays a television reporter who wants to be an investigative journalist, but is only allowed to be a television journalist. Douglas is an independent cameraman and Lemmon is a supervisor at a nuclear power plant. Fonda and Douglas are assigned to a routine mission in a nuclear power plant. An accident happens almost and they film everything. Everyone tries to hide it except for Fonda and Douglas, so Douglas steals the movie. Lemmon begins to investigate and discovers that the company is more concerned about the benefits than the safety of the plant. It's a good movie with a pretty good end.
