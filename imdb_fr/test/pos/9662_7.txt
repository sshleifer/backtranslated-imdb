I must say that I did not expect this film to be so good. Usually, Oriental cinema presents the communist past in 90% of the films. However, this film exceeds the Romanian cinema, being worthy of additional publicity. <br /> <br /> The acting is honest and not exaggerated, the plot is simple but complex because it presents life in the Romanian suburbs, the sound amazed me, the staging was good and that can I say more ... <br /> <br /> This "crash" of Eastern Europe dragged me into the film and lived every moment of it I even felt a desire to go out from me, a desire for adventure after seeing it. <br /> <br /> Look at it! You will certainly enjoy it! <br /> <br /> 7/10
