I do not know what the critics were watching at the time of the release of this film, but that escaped them. It's well written, witty, satirical and quite nice. It's like a video game that comes alive. You never know who is behind the door or what will happen next. Violence is neither gratuitous nor exaggerated because of splashing. <br /> <br /> One last word: for you, Mickey Rourke fans ... the Mickster is back and at his best in the performance of his cameo at the end.
