I was at the premiere of the film last night in Rome. I am not an expert on the book, but there are many changes between the book and the film. The rhythm of this movie is much faster than the Davinci code. Many things have been cut otherwise it would be a 4 hour movie. Many things have also been changed to give the film a fast pace. I think what matters is the atmosphere of the movie and it works well for Hanks, Brown and his company. <br /> <br /> Some elements of the book seem very implausible in the form of a film. I do not give spoilers, except to say that the end of the film is treated in a slightly different way. The way Leonardo Vetra was found is also different. Those who see the film might be interested in reading the book to get all the details of the story. Some minor details are also extracted from the film. <br /> <br /> Although they filmed in Rome, they had to recreate interior shots. Since I walked to Rome the day before the movie, I can say that the interior sites are authentic. Kohler is not in the film and we do not show much of CERN. Hanks does a good job and there are interesting scenes involving the Vatican archives. Of course, they did not have access to this area and I'm not sure anyone really knows what the Vatican Archives looks like. Eyelet Zurer pauses in this film as Victoria Vetra and does a great job for Hanks. <br /> <br /> This film should be better received by critics and the public, but you never know. Ron Howard mentioned several times in interviews and, as we saw with the cast before the movie, it was only a movie.
