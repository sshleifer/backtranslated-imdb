I had the privilege of attending the evening of the British Prime Minister of Inglorious Basterds! After seeing the trailers, I had high hopes, but I had doubts because of a series of complacent films (let's say honestly, the indulgence is his second name Tarantinos) <br /> <br /> I was surprised to find that he had taken the cat out of the bag with this one. The film is rich in interesting dialogues, a perfect comedy timed with a hint of brutal assassination. <br /> <br /> The crowning glory of this film, however, rests on Christoph Waltz, who can not find any fault or error. He manages to create a real tension in the audience while remaining quite "theatrical" (I could not think of a better word). He deserved his prize in Cannes and is probably heading for an Oscar !!!! Hoping to see him again soon!
