"The Next Karate Kid" is an exceptional film full of adventures and new surprises. He has a wonderful and moral plot that tells a wonderful story. Hilary Swank does an amazing job of fulfilling Julie's role. I saw the actor playing Mr. Miagee and this is one of his best performances in my opinion. The film is funny and charming and I can not emphasize enough the interest of the film. I think this film is worth 10 out of 10. I suggest it to anyone who loves a good movie.
