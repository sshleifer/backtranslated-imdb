The homage of Jean Renoir to the Paris of the end of the 19th century is magnificent in many ways. Not only does it seem to have been photographed by Toulouse-Lautrec and Mucha, but it represents geographical Paris; the streets accessible only by stairs, the unpleasant end of the ephemeral popularity and sexual opportunism of men with a product for sale, in an uncompromising image of the entertainment industry that contrasts sharply with the painting painted by Hollywood. There is an obvious comparison to Lloyd Bacon's "42nd Street", made about 20 years ago, featuring Ruby Keeler, a dancer-like, fresh-faced child who had come to New York to start the show business, who saves the show when the star fails - "You get out of the chorus, but you have to come back a STAR !!" "Julian Marsh" by Warner Baxter is a director who suffers for his art and who is unknown. Jean Gabin's "Danglard" still clashes with genital politics, but when he talks about the series, he looks more like Knute Rockne than Julian Marsh. He's all about the game except - for his pointy thing. He has a new profitable business stitched until his mistress becomes jealous of the woman she recognizes as her next mistress. His perspectives come and go on every coital trip he undertakes. <br /> <br /> Danglard takes Mistress 1 (Lola de Castro, played by Maria Felix) on a dive, where he sees "Nini" (Fran√ßoise Arnoul) with her boyfriend and first lover, Paulo the baker, and discovers that she is a lively dancer. He uses his charm and the prospect of money to convince Nini to study dance so that she can go on stage. The prospect of money and fame seduces Nini and she becomes Danglard's next mistress, as well as a good cancan student, whom Danglard has dubbed "French Cancan", to respond to the current anglophile trend of dance. <br /> <br /> "42nd St" and "French Cancan" are tributes to the world of entertainment - to modern entertainment - which has its own iconography and its own concept. "42nd Street" is centered around Julian Marsh, a major Broadway director, whom he organizes with personal energy and questionable sexual involvement. The young man is a middle-aged twit with a lumbago, replaced by Dick Powell, the pretty tenor with a secret wealth to hide. Danglard, on the contrary, passes from woman to woman, seducing them with the promise of glory, hanging them from what must have been a very persuasive endowment. There is no doubt that he is heterosexual and very active. The scenes after the rush abound. <br /> <br /> A few days after taking Nini away from Paulo, he discovered Esther, a type of Piaf, and began to prepare her to sing the theme song of the film on the violin. . This, of course, gives rise to Nini's jealousy, just as it has aroused Lola's jealousy. (And of course, Nini had already given up the privilege of being a tsarina!) All the movie tells that the lust of Danglard cost him money, but that even his exciting confusion is subordinated to his love for the series - how the public demands devotion- and it is this powerful combination of phallic persuasion and tempting fame that makes Danglard the hero, while asserting that a true lover of the show will never benefit as much as the men of the 'money. At the end of the movie, Danglard, after neutralizing the jealous creditors and girls, approaches a new attraction by watching the incredible performance (and believe me, THAT is amazing) of Cankie. "Have you ever thought about being on stage?" he asks, and the curtain goes down. Meanwhile, poor Julian sits in front of the emergency escape from the theater listening to new Peggy Sawyer fans denigrate his contribution to the success of the series. (I will not even get into the central line of "42nd Street", "Oh, man, it was GREAT for you to come!") <br /> <br /> In addition, I will not go into the preview gives us legendary Parisian artists, including a brief vision of Piaf, and the vision of urban and rural Paris. There is certainly a sample of the styles that spawned Trenet and Aznavour. But it is the memory of a positive and welcome masculinity, something invisible in any Hollywood musical comedy with which one could compare it, which is a pleasant relief from the androgynous Hollywood musicals of the 1930s (including my beloved Fred Astaire, not to mention Dick Powell), let alone the barf promulgated by MGM in films like the disgusting "American in Paris". All these fountains! We will save our comparison of this turkey at "Breakfast at Tiffany's" and its deconstruction of the American male for another day. <br /> <br /> Danglard was perhaps a hopeful vision in post-war France, a kind of hyper-masculine guy who may have existed or not, is practically irrelevant. Whether it's a man, John Wayne or Edward Everett Horton may not be up to the job. That he is a man who loves ladies is never involved. For my part, it would not bother me to live life at all. I wonder if Gabin was so lucky. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of this comment, I wanted to talk about Baz Luhrman and what Sinclair Lewis called "boloney". I have never been so far. The Moulin Rouge Baz ... well, Paris does not put that kind of things in the Seine.
