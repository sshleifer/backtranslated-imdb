Anyone who has ever seen Ali G should be well prepared for the full movie entitled "Ali G Indahouse" <br /> <br /> Although I prefer Ali G when he interviews rich and famous people, his brand is completely comedy off the wall definitely entertains from start to finish on the big screen too. <br /> <br /> A ridiculous plot, ridiculous characters and a ridiculous scenario that make this movie a riot for fans of Ali G.> <br /> If you saw it and you do not do not like, avoid this film as a plague, because there is no doubt about the same thing; for everyone - watch it Aiiii! 7/10
