Algernon4's comment that "the ultra-lustful dance of (this film) by Paget is the most erotic in the history of films" is certainly an exaggerated example. It's not even Debra Paget's most erotic dance. His almost naked gyrations in Fritz Lang's "The Indian Tomb" give this issue a decidedly tame air. As for being the most erotic in the history of dance. Well! Where do I start? The performance of Salma Hayek as Santanico Pandemonium in "From Dusk to Dawn" (1996); Jamie Lee Curtis in "True Lies" (1994); Jessica Alba in "Sin City" (2005); Rose McGowan in "Terror Planet" (2007); Sheila Kelley in "Dancing at the Blue Iguana" (2000), blah, blah, blah. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong. I love the sequence and I included it in my "Cheesecake Dance" series on Youtube. I just think that claiming to be "the most erotic in the film's history" is really bad.
