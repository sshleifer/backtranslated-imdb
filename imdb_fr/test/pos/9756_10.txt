"The Gay Desperado" is wonderful. The joke between Leo Carrillo and Harold Huber is as funny as anything you hear in a movie today. Best line? "It would be my third choice!" "Diego" is obviously the archetype of Kevin Smith's "Silent Bob". The black and white cinematography of Lucien N. Andoit (especially with the shadows of the banditos) was striking. All I can say about Ida Lupino is: "Thank God for the DVD!" You can go directly to the scene where she tries sombreros and serapes and watch her stand in front of this mirror again and again. <br /> <br /> Lest I forget that the guy from Nino Martini also sings very pure.
