I think New York Times film critic Elvis Mitchell wrote the best in-line review of In the Mood for Love when he said he was "stunned by a romantic spirit that has always been lacking in the cinema. ". As these words are true! Really romantic films are so rare nowadays, while films that include a lot of sex and nudity (which are often described in a messy and gratuitous way) abound. So, given this cinematic climate, Wong Kar-wai's latest film appears as a breath of fresh air. In the Mood for Love talks about the accursed romance between two neighbors ("Mr. Chow", played by Tony Leung and "Mrs. Chan" by Maggie Cheung), whose spouses have an illegal affair, while they try to be like them. "But having spent time with each other (while their spouses have gone" for business "/" caring for a sick mother "), they fall head over heels in love and have to resist the temptation to go too far. <BR /> <br /> There are several factors behind the creation of In the Mood for Love of a new classic among "romantic melodramas", in the best sense of the word. The film-specific film (1960s Hong Kong) is faithfully recreated with astonishing detail: the clothes (including Maggie Cheung's pretty dresses), the music (for example Nat King Cole) and the general atmosphere of this film evokes a nostalgia for that period Second, Christopher Doyle's superb award-winning cinematography creates an environment that not only envelops his two main characters, but also seems to be bubbling with romantic nostalgia in each its sumptuous and meticulously composed frames. Make no mistake: In the Mood for Love is the most magnificent film of 2001. (It should also be mentioned that the usual hyper-kinetic visual style of Wong Kar-wai is (naturally) attenuated for this film, although his palette is just as colorful.) Thirdly, there's Michael Galasso's haunting score, which is accompanied by slow motion sequences, such as Chan walking in his elegant dresses, Chan and Chow glancing at each other as they cross each other. the stairs and other beautiful scenes that are engraved in the memory. The main score - which makes its instruments sound like they were literally crying - is heard eight times in various parts of the film and serves to underline the sadness and longing felt by the two main characters. Fourth, Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung both perform brilliantly (Leung was awarded the Best Actor Award at Cannes) and manage to generate real chemistry on screen. <br /> <br /> Create a film that feels timeless, "vertiginously romantic" and, in a word, magical. In the Mood for Love, perhaps more than any other film of 2001, reminded me why I like to go to the movies. And I guess that's the biggest compliment I can make to a movie. <br /> <br />
