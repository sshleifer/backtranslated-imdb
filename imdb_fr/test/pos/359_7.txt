The penultimate of Chaplin's Essanay films, CARMEN is a parody of Cecil B. Demille's drama with the same title. It is obvious that Demille's well-known movie did not impress the king of comedy so much, which he later admitted in his autobiography. <br/> <br /> The parodies were not a new experience for Chaplin. He had already done several of them, namely his PREHISTORIC PAST and his NEW JOB, and he would continue to do so until the end of his film career (for example, in A KING IN NEW YORK). <br /> <br /> Chaplin makes a very good portrait of Don Jose and Edna Purviance is as good as Carmen. Do not act as we are used to; Charlie is not the lovable Tramp and Edna is far from being an innocent little woman, but that was not Chaplin's intention either. A BURLESQUE ON CARMEN is a strange film of Chaplin, very different, but nevertheless including a good material. <br /> <br /> The main story is, though very differently structured, as in the original drama. Don Jos√© is very much in love with Carmen, but is not alone in this area. "Carmen, Carmen, the beautiful Carmen, is loved by all men under 96", but it has the great advantage of being an officer and we are there; It is the famous story of rivalry, love, greed and honor, from a humorous angle. Thanks to the performances of Chaplin and Purviance, and the wonderful and wonderful music of George Bizet that I admire a lot, it could have been a masterpiece of comedy, time is taken into account. It could have been. But unfortunately, although this is a very good comedy, I do not think it's fair to blame those who claim that A BURLESQUE OF CARMEN is far from being a masterpiece. But it's important to keep in mind that this has nothing to do with a lack of talent, but rather as a result of business conflicts. When Chaplin refused to re-sign the Essanay contract after finishing his latest film for the company, POLICE, they took revenge by mounting all the scenes that Chaplin had originally mounted in CARMEN. Thanks to this, the film is somewhat confusing and contains several useless scenes that are more annoying than funny, and the film turned out to be rather a feature film by Ben Turpin - Turpin played Remendados - rather than a short film. Naturally, Chaplin was in despair when he discovered what Essanay had done and had to stay in bed for days. <br /> <br /> Despite its obvious flaws, A BURLESQUE OF CARMEN is highly recommended to Chaplin fans and admirers of beautiful music.
