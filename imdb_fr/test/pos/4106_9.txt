I went to the cinema in 1973 when the film came out, I was 11 at the time. I remember how much I loved her and wanted to live in Shangri-la, it was my youth and naivety. I recently came across a video of the film I recorded on TV a few years ago. I watched it again and I'm not ashamed to admit that I still enjoy it as much today as 29 years ago. I also like to listen to the lyrics of the songs, because it makes me think that one day we could live in a place where the sound of firearms does not resonate in our ears and if we look at our reflection - we should be happy what we see This is what I call a movie "feel good" because I feel happy after watching it. I may still be naive, but it makes me happy and I'm sure it will make you happy if you look at it with an open mind and enjoy what it is: a good family film. I have to be one of the few people to have this movie in VHS PAL - and in DVD (self-made). I recorded it on DVD because the video recording of the television started to weaken. I still watch it from time to time.
