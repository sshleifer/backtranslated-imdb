Morris and Reva Applebaum had made the Broadway toast at its peak. At ninety, Morris is a widower. He calls his sons - the psychotherapist and car dealership BMW - and his daughter, the screenwriter / TV producer - at a party in his honor, after which he will be euthanized. Creatures with the literal spirit that they are, they take what it says at first sight. He leads them, along with his grandchildren and others, including an African-American and Jewish psychiatrist reminiscent of Godfrey Cambridge, in a merry pursuit through Manhattan as they try to stop or dissuade him. works. The performances are excellent. Peter Falk is in top form. This film does more than deserve an audience: it deserves popular success.
