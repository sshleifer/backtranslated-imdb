It starts a series (that I hope to follow every weekend) of films released during my childhood ?? in this case, it is a case that I have only managed to understand. It was clearly the last word on the subject, which had been degraded at the hokum level over the years; however, in his uncompromising struggle for a serious approach (which proves for sure that the protagonist is never nicknamed as he has been known for so long all over the world!), the filmmakers have rather lost the trace of the fact that the thing was mainly intended to entertain! As a result, we get a strongly fixed representation of the events ?? with more attention paid to meticulous epochal reconstruction than to creating a functional thematic environment for its mythical hero of the jungle! Still, Christopher Lambert became famous? as did another newbie, Andie McDowell, playing her love interest (named Jane, of course) ?? with the title role, which he manages adequately as appropriate in the circumstances. However, Ralph Richardson (to whom the film is dedicated, his song being a swan) steals all the scenes in which he finds himself as the natural grandfather of Tarzan who, despite an obvious affection for his missing relatives, can not resolve to forget tradition in an effort to understand his situation; the hero, in fact, is much more comfortable interacting with primates (even after returning home to save his adoptive father from captivity). The film is also very good to watch (with the cinematography of John Alcott, a regular Stanley Kubrick), presents a particularly grandiose score and remarkable makeup effects (Rick Baker) ?? and, although essentially disappointing at a Tarzan outing, it nonetheless retains considerable value as a prestige image of his time.
