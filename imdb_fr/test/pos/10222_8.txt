For a film like this, there is always something to follow in the years to come. Clive Barker, the man who brought "Hellraiser", makes a half-Gothic, half-mythological and totally horrible horror film between the two. "Nightbreed" is a group of mutants that only come out at night and roam at a place called Midian. Now, a man named Boone (Craig Sheffer) claims to be suffering from hallucinations. He then addresses this shrill Dr. Decker (David Croneberg) who "helps" Boone to solve his problems. Unconscious of this situation, Decker claims to be a purist of whom he is only a disguised hate factor. However, Boone goes to Midian and claims he is one of the mutants. But a mutant named Peloquin (Oliver Parker) sees Boone as a meat! However, his bite spares Boone, so after being killed by a gun glove, he is one of them now. After being deceived by Decker, Boone does everything in his power to protect Lori (Anne Bobby) from him. Lori saves a mutant from the sun and helps others back. I loved the mutant woman who gives a smoky "kiss of death" and the Porcupine woman who dreamed that Boone shows his power at once so attractive and so deadly. I really liked this horror movie and its rule is to never trust a shrink! 3.5 out of 5 stars!
