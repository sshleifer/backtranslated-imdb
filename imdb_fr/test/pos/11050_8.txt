I had read all the negative reviews for "Anna Christie". You know, the problems related to the static camera, the obsolete acting game and the verbosity of the scenario. But when I watched it yesterday, I found it remarkably affecting and pleasant. Yes, Clarence Brown's camera is largely motionless, and I'm pretty sure one of the microphones was hidden in the light of the ship. Yes, there is a lot of dialogue and no spectacular action sequences. It is a first talkie with primitive technical aspects. But there is also Garbo, Marie Dressler, George F. Marion and Charles Bickford, which proves that this game of quality is timeless. <br /> <br /> I think Anna Christie is still one of Garbo's most iconic representations. And it's a wonderful performance from Divine One, in a role that is really quite atypical. Yes, we saw Garbo tired and almost beaten, but never with bags under the eyes or repelled by shots of whiskey. Garbo has played so many (delicious) roles in costumes that seeing her play a contemporary woman is fascinating. It is not burdened by heavy dresses or makeup. This performance seems pretty raw from Garbo. <br /> <br /> The plot, taken from O'Neill, follows the ex-Swedish whore Anna, exhausted, and her meeting with her seaman. Anna had enough trouble for a twenty-year-old girl, says drunk and neglected Marthy (Dressler) in a bar. She finds solace in a life at sea and a romance with a stubborn but tender-hearted fisherman (Charles Bickford). But his past threatens to ruin everything. <br /> <br /> Charles Bickford is forgotten in the long line of Garbo rulers (far inferior). It's an actor who can really share the screen with her and not be swallowed by her magical presence. Both men have excellent chemistry and seem to enjoy working together. Dressler can never be blamed for minimizing her efforts, and again, the grand dame is up to her old tricks, but she is formidable and convincing in her role, never boring like in the terrible "Dinner At Eight ". I had never really heard of George F. Marion, but he was wonderful as a father of Garbo. <br /> <br /> This is a pre-code, and rather sober and dark by MGM standards. I really enjoyed it and although it can crack in some places, it's still wonderful.
