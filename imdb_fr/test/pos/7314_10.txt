The Three Stooges have always been one of the many actors I have loved. I love just about every shorts they've made. I love all six Stooges (Curly, Shemp, Moe, Larry, Joe and Curly Joe)! All the shorts are hilarious and are also featured by many other actors and actresses, many of whom were in many short films! In my opinion, The Three Stooges is one of the greatest actors of all time and is the funniest comic team of all time! <br /> <br /> One of the hilarious shorts of Three Stooges is Men in Black. In this short film are Bud Jamison, Jeanie Roberts, Phyllis Crane, Dell Henderson, "Little Billy", Rhodes, Billy Gilbert and Ruth Hiatt. The game of these actors is good, especially Jamison and Roberts. There are a lot of funny scenes here that I think most of the fans of Three Stooges will love! In my opinion, one of the most different Three Stooges shorts. I recommend this one to everyone!
