I did not expect to enjoy it. in truth, I watched it because a friend knew that a friend knew a friend who had written the script but had not been credited. Knowing Dylan Thomas and really enjoying his poetry but conscious and rather puzzled by the man, I did not think I needed to see an adaptation of his lame bohemian life laid bare. and it was not that. critical and yet grateful it was. it made me cry. Kiera Knightley was superb, even with that slightly accented Welsh accent, and it's a sad story they tell. Dylan Thomas is not the hero as he has unfortunately been throughout his life, no more than the so-called "frisky woman" of the pr spiel. it's cillian the william of the movie. a man who leaves the woman he loves to wage a war they do not know. His challenge to reconnect with this indifference is what presents a real interest for this film and what a beautiful performance of this actor. I think this film is underestimated because it was very badly sold. Dylan Thomas fans expect something more from their flawed hero and get less, and that's how the movie was marketed. it's not a movie about Dylan Thomas and it's a lot more interesting for that.
