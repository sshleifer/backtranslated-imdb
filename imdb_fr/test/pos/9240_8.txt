I must also apologize for a somewhat biased opinion of this company because I contributed to the soundtrack. Still, I received my copy, sat down and enjoyed the cast of characters who were perhaps more colorful than the characters they created in this story of a movie sequel, Shanghai. For those who believe that George Bush is a "credible Texan", just watch this movie to break the image that Texas is full of truck driving, one-dimensional rednecks. The cast contains some of the smartest, most particular and humorous you will find anywhere where they tell their stories of agony, joy and disappointment by turning to a superb sequel, without a budget, to guerrilla warfare. ("punk rock" style Each person helps to define). <br /> <br /> It's an excellent documentary made with passion, courage and all the venom you'll need to break into the other side of the industry, whatever the b and you speak with a double talk (take note of authors, painters, musicians and filmmakers). This brings us back to the credibility of the first wave of American hardcore music when the term "D.I.Y." was the norm, a time when courage, passion and commitment mattered much more than valuable technique, style or calculations. This does not mean that there is not a lot of technique or style to it ... the tone of the documentary is rather refreshing. The montages bring as much drama as the dialogue that takes place there. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​creating a documentary from the sad disappearance of the original intention of the cast, the team and the director is brilliant, totally Texan and absolutely punk rock. In the true sense of the word.
