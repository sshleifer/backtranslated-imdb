I saw One Life Stand when it was premiered at the Edinburgh International Film Festival in 2000 and I was blown away by the film. Directed on a micro budget, this digital film in black and white is a European film and succeeds brilliantly despite the limitations of the DV format. The film works because it is in the independent tradition - dealing with complex issues, moving and relieved by touches of sober humor. One Life Stand avoids falling into the trap of other British realistic films, with ordinary workers described as hopeless victims or comical stereotypes. The performances are strong, especially Maureen Carr as mother, Trise. I understand that the film was recently released on DVD and I would recommend it without hesitation. The rating on this site is misleading, which is why I gave it a high score, because the filmmaker, May Miles Thomas, has obviously put all her heart and she deserves and deserves better than 2.8 for his incredible feat.
