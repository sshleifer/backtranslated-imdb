I saw it at the 2004 Stony Brook Film Festival in New York and it was very warmly received. In this pre-WWII film, two German rocket scientists are working on the Scottish island of Scarp as the war looms on the horizon. The characters encountered on the island are invaluable in their creation and their portrait. Shauna MacDonald is particularly memorable <br /> <br /> After becoming familiar with the "scootish" accents, the viewer feels at home with these people who watch with amusement the work of the Germans to connect their island to the continent a delivery mail based on a rocket. As implausible as it may sound, this film was based on a real story. <br /> <br /> In the end, a memorable film that will remain a good moment thanks to its casting, its history or its landscape.
