Bobby and Mikey are two little boys who travel across the country with their divorced mother to start a new life. Shortly after the family's installation, their mother marries "The King", a violent father-in-law, especially for Bobby. Bobby decides to "fly away" from the mistreatment in his birthday present. <br /> <br /> This film was hard to watch, especially the scenes of abuse. It was hard to see an innocent and playful little boy being abused and transformed into a sullen and frightened young man. The acting game is excellent. <br /> <br /> I cried throughout the last half of the film. There were also some fun scenes like the Monster Brew and the dog that finds the pop bottles. <br /> <br /> I would not recommend letting young children look at it. It was a difficult film to watch and yet it really flew away.
