I spent many sleepless nights after watching 2001. Not only because of the psychological horror (of which 2001 is a masterpiece), but also because of the way it brought me (a agitated soul) a little clarity in the way I observe the universe. It profoundly changed my thinking. And after reading the novel (Arthur C. Clarke), I found myself once again inspired (by his writer) by the level of imagination. <br /> <br /> The Space Odyssey is not something that one can simply "go and see". You have to be ready for that, otherwise it can not be understood. In fact, I do not think it can be understood at all, at least not all at once. It is a philosophical journey into the infinite and beyond, a masterpiece of this kind and always, 32 years later, technically quite impressive until the powerful soundtrack composed of "Also spracht Zarathustra" Richard Strauss and Johann Strauss's "Blue Danube". <br /> <br /> Take all the time you want, but you may have to watch this movie. If it can bring a little order and understanding to the world of a troubled artist like me, he can certainly do it for you too. <br /> <br /> Or maybe I'm just crazy.
