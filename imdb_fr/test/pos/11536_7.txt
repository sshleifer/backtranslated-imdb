Jennifer Egan's novel has been screened by Canadian director Adam Brooks in a film that, based on some of the comments from contributors to this forum, seems like a bad proposition, but in reality it's much better than it is not believed. <BR /> <br /> It's the story of two sisters who loved each other dearly. Faith, the cheerful and playful hippie girl, takes her younger brother, Phoebe, under her wing. Phoebe clearly loves Faith; When the oldest decides to follow her boyfriend Wolf to Europe during Berkley's summer vacation, she promises that she will send a postcard to Phoebe every day. Faith does this, until the cards stop entering and one night, some time later, the family receives a phone call to inform them that Faith has died in tragic circumstances. <br /> <br /> Phoebe can not forget Faith. That's why, after a few years, she decides to follow the same path taken by her older sister. She takes Faith's cards and visits each place, starting in Amsterdam, then in Paris, and she wants to finish the trip to Portugal, where Faith experienced her untimely death. <br /> <br /> In Paris, Phoebe gets along with Wolf, who is no longer a hippie and lives with his girlfriend. Wolf tries to persuade Phoebe to give up her journey and go home; she suspects that Wolf holds the key to solving the mystery and, while she is leaving for Portugal, she makes a discovery when she finds a picture that clearly contradicts Wolf's version he told Phoebe. He feels guilty and, contrary to the wishes of his girlfriend, decides to accompany Phoebe to the city where Faith died. The story changes at this point and we go back to what Faith lived in Europe and what happened in her last days. <br /> <br /> The best thing to do in "The Invisible Circus" is the performance of the directors, something that Mr. Brooks must take credit for. The big surprise is the series of Cameron Diaz, who, as Faith, seems to choose some light comedy pieces, while she is quite able to do a good dramatic job under the good director. Jordana Brewster is considered the old Phoebe and makes a wonderful contribution to the film. She is a magnificent beauty with what seems to be a natural to play. Christopher Eccleston is Wolf and shows that he is also capable of making more serious dramas. Sweet Camilla Belle convincingly portrays young Phoebe. Blythe Danner appears as the mother of the girls. <br /> <br /> The European places are beautifully photographed by Henry Braham. The film is also reinforced by Nick Laird-Clowes' musical score and Petra Haden's original song. Elizabeth Kling edited with great elegance. In the end, this film shows Adam Brooks in great shape as he sets the tone for the adaptation of the novel and is rewarded by the fact that good distribution does wonders for him.
