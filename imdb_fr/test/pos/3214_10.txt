it's a very good series. I love the show and I'm glad it's not canceled yet. he really has a good mood and shows the realistic connection between a young mother and her daughter. o yes for Gilmore girls! it's really awesome. they are such a sarcastic humorous group. they do everything together like my mother and me. ya for Gilmore girls. uh, I'm running out of lines. but I like the way the relationship between Luke and Lorelei finally emerges. they needed so much to be together. and I love Sookie St. James! she is so great. and the show would be nowhere without Michel. all the show is dry humor, sarcasm and life in a very small town where everyone knows each other ... especially the Gilmore Girls.
