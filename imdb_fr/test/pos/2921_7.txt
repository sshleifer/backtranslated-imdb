It may be just a personal affection for this version of Mika Waltari's novel on screen, or a penchant for the Egyptians (I grew up fond of visiting the mummies at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts) but I think Maltin is a tough-guy movie. Production values ​​are excellent in color and cinematography, and it seems that some efforts have been devoted to historical authenticity (much of which comes from the novel, I'm sure). While Purdom is a bit stiff in the lead role, it can be accepted as part of the character of Sinuhe. Victor Mature, it's Victor Mature. Peter Ustinov is a pleasure to watch in this type of role, which he has always played so well and so spiritually. Bella Darvi's performance as Nefer is a classic camp and I find that even the rather dry portrayal of Akenaten by Michael Wilding has its own appeal. <br /> <br /> The historical quaintness of Akenaten's monotheism, a brief detour into the theological history of ancient Egypt, is interesting, as is Akenaten himself, and deserves to be read; the religious wars described here actually have a basis. <br /> <br /> An interesting note about Darvi, whose birth name was Bayla Wegier: it was a Polish émigré that producer Darryl Zanuck and his wife Violet had under their wing (I think they were may have even adopted). His screen name, Darvi, is made up of the names of Zannuck and his wife. She continues her career as an actress in France but never succeeds and, after a rather unfortunate life, she dies on her own in 1971. It is an interesting film and pleasant to watch for the visual. values ​​only. American Movie Classics sometimes shows it in a mailbox, which is essential to capture the full extent and depth of the story.
