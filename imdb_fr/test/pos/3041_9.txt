John Voight plays the main character of this film based on the autobiography of author Pat Conroy (Prince of Tides). An excellent teacher film, it tells the story of a naive Pat Conroy, a young English teacher whose first job is at a primary school on a rural island. The only white man on the island, he has to struggle against internal and external pressures as he tries to instill in children an education and values ​​that have been systematically deprived of such things for generations. A solid performance that makes you think.
