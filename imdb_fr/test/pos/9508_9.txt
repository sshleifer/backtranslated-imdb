This review contains slight detractors, but not enough to spoil the story ... <br /> <br /> You watched Nihon Chinbotsu (the sinking of Japan or the Japanese sinks, depending on where you live) recently , a remake of the 1970 film the same name, which is itself based on Sakyo Komatsu's hit novel. This film is a jewel of Japanese cinema. It seems that Japan is sinking due to a subduction of a tectonic plate in the west. The Americans predict that this will happen in a 40-year period, but according to Dr. Tadokoro (a seemingly "crazy" scientist), this will happen in less than a year. The Japanese government is not convinced, but is putting in place a disaster evacuation plan and is forming a new D1 team to handle the crisis. While traveling to China to negotiate evacuation plans, the Japanese prime minister was killed and sent the government into a state of panic. The D1 team is left on most files and is led by the newly elected Minister of Crisis Management, Saoro Takamori (Dr. Tadokoro's ex-wife). She is turning to Dr. Tadokoro for advice and plans to blow huge holes under Japan to avoid the sinking process. <br /> <br /> Japan should soon negotiate with various countries and convince them to adopt Japanese refugees. Soon, it seems that many countries are reluctant to accept more because of the sudden influx of Japanese into their country and the chaos that ensues (if it ever happens, touch-wood, I hope It Misaki will be safe ... she can always stay at home ... hee hee). The evacuation scenes are really well done, showing the devastation, suffering and desperation that civilians face in these disastrous times. And the many faces of human beings surface, arrogance, egoism, corruption, courage, cowardice ... <br /> <br /> It's a really good film. the narrative is solid, with an engaging story and a wonderful acting experience. Dr.Tadokoro (played by Toyokawa Etsushi) was very well done, portraying a divorced and often crazy scientist who kicks in the back. His frustration and concerns were very visible and it is a very good thing. Reiko (played by the beautiful Shibasaki Kou) has also been pretty well played and has the most memorable replica of the whole movie (watch it to discover it) and I think she has a beautiful voice. She plays the love interest of Toshio Onodera (played by Tsuyoshi Kusanagi of SMAP). Oh, I almost forgot ... she has really long hair ~ And there is also a subtle but profound love story, which is well written and if there is something that the Japanese really do Well, these are love stories ... <br /> <br /> What makes this movie interesting is the technical explanations of the events that occur, and if you are interested in geography, you Have a great time (I know I ... hehe). I can see that they went to great lengths to make the theory of this film credible, and the first graphic displays and explanations were quite well done (although you had to excuse the famous "Engrish" of the Japanese.) Ok, now for effects (it's all effects-oriented, is not it?) After watching the movie with absolute dread, I have to say that this movie has special effects which are tied (or even better) with some Hollywood, volcanic eruptions ... massive earthquakes ... destructions ... tsunamis ... explosions ... all goes well. opening is so cool, the 1st earthquake surprises you, the mountains fall, the destruction due to volcanic eruptions makes you cringe ... watch Mt Fuji heat is a marvel ... then you see Shibuya fall on the ground ... it's so sad !!! However, what I felt enti was one of the best of the giant tsunami scene, which sees rescue operations fail and people who have nowhere to run and have no hope of holding on. to ... the final scene also deserves a mention ... wonderful stuff. If you like the effects, you'll love this movie. <br /> <br /> Oh, every good movie comes with a beautiful song. The highly addictive "Keep Holding U" sung by the adorable and adorable SunMin is a duet with Kubota, and it's just lovely. I think it fits the film very well and it shows that no matter how much we have been struck by disasters, our love and strength will keep us going. The scenes of disaster are treated with orchestral music and sometimes silence (a Japanese specialty) and really give an impression of chaos to the destruction on the screen. Oh, and did I mention it's a really, really, really big screen? Okla, that's stories about this movie. Yeah, I loved it and I was hoping I could watch again ... There are holes in the plot, but it's excusable because it was just a wonderful popcorn movie. Not perfect, but really well done. I would give it a 9 out of 10. I'm happy to say that the most expensive film in Japanese history is also one of the best. If you have not watched it, you should really do it today ... it's a MUST WATCH!
