Oh yes! Hollywood remembers how to use the good old formula, and when lightning strikes, it's a pretty wonderful feeling. Rarely Hollywood creates a masterpiece because, lately, it seems more worrying to hurry up and get the most rewards quickly, or there are too many cooks in the group. Generally, good scripts are the result of a talented writer who perfectly controls his property, understands his material and is a good writer. Then there is a small important role, often overlooked by the marketing geniuses who often lack creativity and vision: a good actor. <br /> <br /> A good actor can mean the difference between a mediocre and half-cooked test, and a fully realized film that might not be an important and relevant film, but that contributes to its genre and could eventually become a classic of the genre. We receive very few romantic comedies, and we are people who are hungry for them. The romantic and stormy relationship of Big and Carrie is buried in the sexy humor of "Sex in the City", and people gathered for "Mamma Mia" because she had some romance, cleverly interpreted by Streep and Brossnam. It could have a silly musical, but it touched us because it was played with intensity and conviction. "Nights" gives us more, with the incredible talents of a woman doing a wonderful job in romantic movies, Ms. Diane Lane. Since his childhood, we could appreciate how his talent, combined with his grateful soul, allowed us to see in the heart of the protagonists of history. A few years ago, she teamed up with Mr. Gere, giving us a tormented, romantic and sexy performance as a woman who is not too sure of the consequences of her actions in "Infidel", work that should have win at least once. Academy Award. She is back and doing a more wonderful job in this romantic gem as a woman who has abandoned her romantic projects and she suddenly realizes that there might be another chance around the corner. <br /> <br /> Ms. Lane thrills this film with intelligence and passion. His facial expressions communicate volumes about the different emotions that his character undergoes. We can read frustrations, aspirations, despair, anger, hope, loss and a range far beyond the marketable types that Hollywood constantly pushes down our throats. Here is a mature performer who has the gift of projecting real emotions and allows us to connect to the material in a way that moves us as we integrate the experience. <br /> <br /> Mrs. Lane is such a triumphant joy to watch as she goes through transformations from the first scenes of the film to the end. Her discoveries become ours as we celebrate with her the power of hope and love. She is able to bring back the unmatched joy of a loving person, much like a teenager, yet she never lets you see her character as stupid or irresponsible. His eyes are expressive jewels that can move even the cynics of the public. She is one of the stars who can do wonders with one glance. In her, the classic sensation of these great movies of yesterday is back. His work is reminiscent of the passionate and intelligent work of Hepburn, Davis, Garson, women who have interpreted everyday characters and made them memorable, as they created complete characters. <br /> <br /> We admire these superb actresses who reproduce legends of real life rewarded for it. Half of their work is done by the mysticism of the figures they personify; However, as far as anyone can tell you, it's the roles like Lane in this movie that are a bigger achievement, because they are created from scratch, have a personal imprint, and make it possible to reach new heights without any problem. previous theatrical material aid, such as plays and the background of a famous legend whose life is paid homage to the big screen. Lane's character is a woman whose experiences could be any of us. It represents our dreams and emotions with a lot of quality, class and with just the right feeling. This is a remarkable achievement, and we should be grateful to still be able to achieve such outstanding performance today. <br /> <br /> I could use a few adjectives to pay tribute to his work, but I can only say that, in my humble opinion, every part of his work in this film bears witness to one of greatest shows ever made on celluloid by a living artist. Thank you, Ms. Lane.
