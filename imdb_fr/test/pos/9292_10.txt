That's exactly what Australian television and Australian politics need, people with a sense of humor !!! Good on ABC to support these guys. The show is based on a couple of Australian guys who know how to eliminate mickey from politicians or other people in the limelight. The boys use Sydney as the main base to make a splash with the public. Keep an eye on the Crazy Wharehouse type or Mr. Ten Questions. The guys who do these things are the same guys who introduced CNNN. If you liked CNNNN and the Glasshouse, then you will love this show. I am always interested to know which stunts are real and which ones act only because there are questionable actions made by the guys ...
