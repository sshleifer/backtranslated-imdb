Hitchcock has already given an interview in which he said he likes to make scenarios involving an ordinary person, who is accidentally caught in a terrible series of events that they can not do without as long as the vile plot that is at the root of their problems is solved. In this way, the audience can feel more sympathy for the hero. We certainly do in this beautiful movie. Barry Kane tries to help his neighbor only by doing acts of kindness and consideration, such as helping Fry recover the letters he has deposited at the factory. Barry even returns a lost $ 100 bill to Fry later ... it was big money in 1943 !! It is Barry's acts of Christian goodness that cause him trouble, and soon he is falsely accused of sabotage and murder and may hang on if he can not shake off. Similar to The 39 Steps in plot, the hero travels the country and discovers plans of terrorist acts perpetrated by fascist cells, an arch-villain that no one could believe to be a Nazi closet, and a beautiful blonde, Patricia Martin, who suspects and hates first, falls in love with Barry Kane. Hitch's characteristic humor keys are also here. Patricia is an advertising manikin. His various roadside ads help and comfort Barry as he trains with the villains from Las Vegas to New York. We meet a trucker who is a comic actor "Someone convinced my wife that it was elegant to eat three meals a day." The field workers of fascist spies have been forgotten or ignored by "costumes" as if they were working for a legitimate company. During a movie chase scene, members of the public laugh at the action of a humorous / gangster movie while the sabotage cell pulls it for real with the good guys and accidentally kills a bad movie buff. Horrible for the old man dead, but funny! Hitch liked to use famous landmarks in his films and this is the best example, with the Statue of Liberty as a backdrop and ironic icon! It works even better than the Mt Rushmore scene in NBNW.
