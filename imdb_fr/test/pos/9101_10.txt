I loved this film !! Jack Black and Kyle Gass have probably made one of the best comedies since Up in Smoke. This film has something for everyone: rock, drugs and Satan. What could someone want more? I suggest this film to all those who want to sit down and forget all the problems of the world and have a good laugh. Even if the film does not succeed in cinemas, it will certainly become a cult classic. I suggest to all who are going to see the film to get D's first album because a lot of jokes are just more fun if you've heard the songs (like JB's obsession with Sasquatch and the epic battle against heck.) is guaranteed to laugh even if you have not heard their music but the songs are so good that you can not let them pass.
