The last film that provided a keen and disturbing look at what the madness is most likely was In Dreams. In this film, you did not see the madness, you were there. Now, The Cell comes with an updated and much more disturbing description of the inside of a psychotic killer's mind. The opening scene takes you into the seemingly innocent spirit of a comatose little boy, and the things that Catherine Deane (Jennifer Lopez) sees are fascinating and terrifying at first. The things she sees later in the mind of Vincent Stargher (Vincent D'Onofrio) are incredibly imaginative and fascinating, most of these things had never been seen in a movie before. <br /> <br /> The story of The Cell is not really something that is truly revolutionary. In fact, it's basically the same thing as the story in The Silence of the Lambs. You have a murderer in detention and these people have to enter his mind to find a woman victim who is currently at risk of losing her life. The only real difference between the basis of the intrigues is that in The Silence of the Lambs, you have to enter a killer's mind to find another murderer as well as his current victim, while in The Cell, you have to get into the mind of a killer to find his own victim. However, despite the sadly weak story, The Cell completely revolutionizes the genre of the psychological thriller. None of those that have been made come close to them. <br /> <br /> In addition, the film had a good direction and was extremely well played. Vince Vaughn delivers another one of his great performances (he was excellent with Norman Bates in the pathetic reworking of Psycho in 1998), and even Jennifer Lopez presents the second good effort of his career (the other being the great Out of Sight) . You can not say anything about cinematography in The Cell, which has earned enough credit, is imaginative and fascinating, and is unprecedented by anything we've ever seen in film history. The Cell is an incredibly well done movie, and it deserves to be recognized.
