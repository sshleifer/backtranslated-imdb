Sydney Pollack gives us an adult love story about human nature, pain, passion and betrayal. Dutch police sergeant Van Den Broeck (Harrison Ford) is devastated when he learns that his beloved wife was killed in a plane crash. He is even more upset to learn of his affair with the husband of Congresswoman Kay Chandler (Kristen Scott Thomas). He arranged to meet her and see if she knew or did not know he knew it. They begin to befriend and then begin to live an intense affair (which could be perceived as a cure for both of them). the memories of the dead and the pressures exerted by their respective jobs separate them and cause more harm than good or can they escape from the past? Well, you have to watch Random Hearts and find out. A moving film and well played with a superb cast.
