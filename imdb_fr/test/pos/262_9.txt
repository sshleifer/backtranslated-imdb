It's just one of those movies, whether you like it or you hate it, my girlfriend and I loved it, told my brother to praise it and he hated it, said he was too eloquent and too familiar, but still see big action movies, so probably not enough explosions left him disappointed. There were new talents (I had never heard of leads)? Brady (the director's brother?) Was particularly good. Playing a good dick at first, I thought he would never redeem himself, but he managed to get out of the black hole he had created and in the end, I was really in the lead. A very surprising film with a lot of heart, if you can live without physical counting or explosions, this one is very original. Yashimo. Brixton in the United Kingdom.
