Alfred Hitchcock has directed many brilliant thrillers, many of which have been hailed as one of the greatest movies of all time. This film tends to get lost a little under the Vertigo and Psycho. Strangers on a Train, the most compelling film ever made by Hitchcock. The story follows Guy Haines, a tennis player and a man who will soon be married to the senator's daughter, if he can get a divorce from his current wife. One day, on his way to see his wife, he meets Bruno Anthony, a mentally unstable man, aboard a train and finds himself quickly drawn into a plot of murder that he can neither stop nor stop; and a conversation that could cost him his life. <br /> <br /> Bruno and Guy's Train Conversation is one of the most fascinating and inspiring film shows of all time. And if two people "exchanged" murders, thus resolving any suspicion of the crime and making their mobile irrelevant? Is it really the perfect murder? What makes this film all the more frightening is that the events in which Guy is led could happen to anyone, an ordinary citizen. Everyone has someone they would like to get rid of, so what if you meet a crazy man aboard a train that kills for you and then forces you to do it? The chances of this happening are unlikely, but it is the idea that anyone can be a murderer who is at the heart of the message of Strangers in a train. and in this situation, anyone could do it. <br /> <br /> Is there an actor on the planet who could have represented the character of Bruno Anthony better than Robert Walker? The man was just born for the party. He manages to capture the good mood for his character and absolutely commands every scene in which he finds himself. Bruno's character is crazy, but he's not crazy. he is a calculating and accomplice human being, and Robert Walker makes the character credible. His performance is extremely malicious and yet sufficiently discreet to keep the character firmly in the real world. Unfortunately, Robert Walker died just one year after the release of Strangers on a Train, and I think it's a big loss for the cinema. No one in the cast shines as much as Walker, but his co-star Farley Granger deserves mention. Granger never impresses so much, but his performance is sufficient and he defends himself against Walker. His performance is also remarkable, he describes his character as a very normal person; and that's how it should be. Ruth Roman is Guy's future wife. She is not enough in the film to make a lasting impression, but she makes the most of what she has. Alfred Hitchcock's daughter, Patricia, assumes the last role of the four central roles as Barbara, Guy's fianc√©'s sister. She is aptly charming in this role and she tends to steal a lot of scenes in which she is. <br /> <br /> The direction of Alfred Hitchcock is always sublime, just like in this film. There is a particular blow that sees the murder of the film committed in the reflection of a pair of sunglasses. This is an absolutely brilliant photo, which creates a great atmosphere for the stage. The management of Hitchcock is always morose and respects the style of the film noir. The highlight of the film is both spectacular and exciting, and I do not think Hitchcock could have made the most of the movie. It's really exaggerated and out of the movie tour; but it works. There is a reason why Hitchcock is often cited as the greatest director of all time. The reason is that he does not just use the script to tell the story of the movie, but he also uses the camera to do it too. Strangers on a Train is one of the greatest thrillers ever made. Its story is both intriguing and provocative, and will delight all movie lovers. A masterpiece.
