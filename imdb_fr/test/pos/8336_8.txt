SPOILERS AHEAD ?? For the first ten minutes or so of Star Witness, we were introduced to a typical quote from an urban American family in an unnamed city, which is another way of telling Warner Brothers' version of NYC. Except for the young children, including the lovely Dickie Moore and the brilliant Sally Blane, they are rather sad and their conversation at the evening table is tedious and we wish the story to advance and bring in the limelight, Walter Huston. But wait, guys, wait. A serious gangster movie breaks out suddenly, dragging the family against their will, and after that, that baby never lets go of anything. There is suspense, an Oscar nominated screenplay, a good acting game; all you want old movies to be, it's here. I question the performance of Chic sales; it must be an acquired taste, but its presence is crucial for the plot. Warner Bros. must have been a big supporter of Dirty, but the way his nerdy old man's routine fits into the audience is something lost to me. Perhaps it is a waste of time, an unknowable factor that you had to be a spectator of 1931 to understand. In addition, the climax is typically melodramatic. Nevertheless, this is the best release of this year's studio that I have seen so far (however, I've only seen eight, so this may be an inconclusive sight). Do not miss this when TCM shows it. 8 out of 10
