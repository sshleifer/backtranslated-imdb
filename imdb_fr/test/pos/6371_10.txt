I loved Complete Savages! Why did they cancel it anyway? They should have had a second season and so on ... My God! They always cancel good shows ... and leave everything boring. Nothing interesting on TV since Complete Savages is gone. This show was a great idea. A single firefighter father with five crazy sons and a lazy dog ​​... Each of them has his own madness in this house. TJ is still the kid ... always the smallest ... Kyle rips! He breaks everything he touches! He's still in detention, he's always doing the wrong things ... But he's still so funny by everything he does. Sam is the smart guy. He's always shy and stupid when it comes to girls ... Finally, he ends up dating Angela. Chris is the sportsman who does not have much to do with school, studies and things like that. He is always funny. And finally ... Jack! The rock of the show. The oldest of all, the macho, "the rock star" ... But still, as crazy as everyone else. Nick is ... helpless with these guys. Oh! And I almost forgot! Uncle Jimmy ... it's the man! He is like a 30 year old kid. It's like doing the same stupid things that boys do. I always wondered how he ended up becoming a fireman ... And the dog is just like the whole Savage family. The problem is that this show had everything to become really big. He had everything, man! But of course ... they canceled it ...
