It's basically a comedy of goofball, with a somewhat strange rhythm due to dramatic elements. For Michael J. Fox and Paul Reubens, it was their first film (Fox had already participated in a television series and a short-lived TV movie). <br /> <br /> Since it's basically a type of hunting / scavenger hunt movie, like "Cannonball Run", "It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad Mad", or more recently "Rat Race", there are no main characters. Instead, there are groups of characters, dividing screen time and allowing tons of mini-plots. Usually, these types of movies are a way of piling up as many stars (or semi-stars) in a movie. <br /> <br /> This one has teams, one being the main team to which belongs Fox, who are the only characters to develop. Their intrigue is more of a stereotypical Disney affair, about a college student not paying attention to his younger brother, whom he considers to be a lazy punk. As they are forced to form a team together, with the elder brother's girlfriend, they are forced to work together. As this is the main plot, he spends the most time on the screen. <br /> <br /> Some of the other stupid intrigues stand out. The Blue Team tells the story of an overweight child whose father only wants him and his unsuitable friends to leave home. They find themselves with a super cool van equipped with a computer on board (in 1980!) To solve instant puzzles, as well as to play video games with the time gained! One member, Stephen Furst, then played Dr. Axelrod in "St. Elsewhere", and later in "Babylon 5". I'll also admit that I'm still laughing when Barf, trying to decipher a word in Scrabble, comes up with "Fagabefe?" It's a lot funnier than Bart Simpson's "Qwyjibo", in my opinion. <br /> <br /> The other three teams have somewhat tied terrain. The green team is made up of young boys, mostly beer jokes, which eventually collapse when the hunt leads to the Pabst Blue Ribbon brewery. They have the opportunity to harass the red team, with two feminists and two playful twins. The white team of nerds is led by Eddie Deezen, who was previously in "Grease" but then played a critical computer geek role in "Wargames" and, later, Tim Conway's companion in some "Dorf" series. ". <br /> <br /> If you grew up in the 80s, some classic moments of the movie will bring back memories. The first video games, when they were cool, are always an advantage for me. Look for Paul Reubens and his watch canons. There is also a miniature golf course and a disco on wheels. <br /> <br /> The film is actually an acceptable family film, simply because the blasphemy is almost non-existent and the small amount of sexual humor is totally innocent. The dramatic steps of the yellow team will make the parents sleep while their children laugh at Fat Burger's giant melons (oh, they have a special melon tray? That must be it, is not it?)
