Mani sir, as usual, tells another amazing story with Kannathil Muthamittal. Such an amazing relationship between parents and children is beautifully highlighted. Mani Sir, as usual, without a lot of special effects and few outdoor shootings. (In fact, it was the only movie he had ever released from India .. too much for Sri Lanka). to add to that the ARR music ... which is just amazing ... Vellai Pookal is one of my most favored songs of all time ... Maddy, who's who he is in the Film industry also impressed a lot. From alaipayuthey, kannathil through ayutha ezuthu, through the guru, Mani Ratnam showed the world that Maddy is a versatile actor. Simran was really good too. She showed that she could also play in non-glamorous roles and characters. In all an amazing movie. Sad that the Tamil public can not appreciate this movie gr8 and it exploded at the box office ....
