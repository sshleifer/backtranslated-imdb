I saw this film for the first time in 1980 and it was touching a rope that reminded me of a more innocent era. Norman Rockwell's opening narrative, music and paintings set the tone. You like the movie or hate it. Jan Michael Vincent was at his best and portrayed Cpl Marion Hedgepeth in a very innocent and touching way. This film is at the top of my favorites of all time, a pity that it is no longer available on DVD or VHS. The end was so beautiful. John Hancock did a remarkable job capturing the essence of time.
