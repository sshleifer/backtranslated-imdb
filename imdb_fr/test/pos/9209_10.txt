I think Vanessa Marcil is the best player in the cast. She makes Sam one of the best characters in the series. James Cann is also very good. I love when he worried about Delinda. One of my favorite scenes when Ed and Delinda are pummeling a guy. It was fun. Nikki Cox is also good and she has excellent chemistry with Josh Duhamel. Lara Flynn Boyle was great in her role as a guest. I wish they did not kill her. The series has excellent distribution without any bad actors, which is not something you often see on TV. I still think Vanessa Marcil is the best. She should have had an Emmy in my opinion. It's a shame that the show was canceled
