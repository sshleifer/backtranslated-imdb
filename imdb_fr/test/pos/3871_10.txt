Frank Langella steals my heart in everything he's ever done! I love watching it !! I was 10 years old (1979) when I saw him for the first time. I look forward to everyone and everything he does. I hope that one day I will be able to see him in person. he is very hypnotic and mysterious and this voice is powerful and powerful! he is very attractive, even now at 65 he is absolutely beautiful !!!! In my opinion, he is the greatest actor we have ever seen! I loved it in "Dracula" (with many other girls out there) and in "god created woman", "D's house", "Jason and the argonauts" and many others. I thought he was genius !!!!!! can not wait to see him in "good night and good luck"
