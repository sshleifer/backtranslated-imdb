Hollywood is one of the best and most beautiful things in my life. I admire and am very fascinated by the way Hollywood generates and implements ideas. It makes me wonder about the reach of the human brain. I saw Flatliners a long time ago, but the story, the direction, the actors and all the actors are still fresh in my mind. The story begins with our main actor Sutherland who says at sunrise: "What a beautiful day to die. For all of us, it's a story that shows emotions that are sometimes hidden in our minds throughout our lives. Never able to understand a few things in life. This shows us that we need to be motivated and improve our quality of life. Anyway, I suggest it to all who watch it once.
