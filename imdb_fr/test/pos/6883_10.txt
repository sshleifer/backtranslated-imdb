It is very simple to say that those who describe this film as "decent" do not know their cinema. "The master of dolls" creates a sense of apprehension and suspense rarely seen in films outside of Asia. <br /> <br /> Think of a mix of "manga" and "ringu" in one book. . <br /> <br /> Actor of first order, first-rate direction, first-rate sets and effects. <br /> <br /> This is where the best of Asian horror cinema is; Ringu, Dark Water and A tale of two sisters. <br /> <br /> An absolute must. <br /> <br /> Take it from a guy who knows his movies.
