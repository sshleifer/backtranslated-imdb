I watched this movie over and over again - every time it makes me laugh, it makes me think and it makes me cry. Robin Tuney does an amazing job in describing Marcy (and I'm pretty happy that Kate Winslet and this other lady rejected her part), it's just one of those roles you know no one else could have compare. <Br /> <br /> It's a beautiful love story for these two very different people in shitty situations that come together. Anyway, they stand side by side, even if it is a strange situation and insane ways. <br /> <br /> I will tell you that it's not for everyone - on everyone I've shown it to. I would say that the results are 50/50 - but if you like it, you will like it and you will want to share it with others! 10 stars all the way!
