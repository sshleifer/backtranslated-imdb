Mickey Mouse is now 75 years old. It was created by Walt Disney, famous creator, producer, director, etc. I love Disney movies because it's so much fun to watch cartoons. Overall, I think Walt Disney is the king of creations, everyone must love these creations and Walt Disney movies. Thank you Walt for all the classic characters you have created.
