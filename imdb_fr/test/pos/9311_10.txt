It was a very funny and fast film. I have watched it more than once and I keep my rental to show it to others. I would just like to take this opportunity to ask anyone to know how the Hong Kong producers choose their subtitle translators. I am very curious. Please guide me. <br /> <br /> Once again, to come back to the criticism, it is a very scathing film, rich in content, with subtleties reminiscent of the classics, although full of slapstick. This is reminiscent of, for example, the Mexican comedies of Cantinflas. <br /> <br /> The film does not disappoint fans of the director who noticed that he chose themes distinctly Chinese, trying to obtain features rarely explored. The entire director's collection is a way to get a taste of the culture in a disarming way. <br /> <br /> And I do not see how her fun daughter of Chinese Feast could be outdone.
