"Please do not kill me, I'm just an actor!" "Can you play dead?" It is difficult to describe this show. It's like a crime drama. Where the bad cop is a donkey. Literally. What's great about the show is some of Assy's awful monsters. Assy Mcgee produces laughter such as "Adios, Blimp". Unfortunately, at other times, the series seems to be slowly getting longer, which makes it almost hard to watch. This is really the kind of show you will like or hate, there is essentially no intermediary. It's not the best show on {Adult Swim}, but it does have some highlights. It's worth looking at just to see if you like it. I know I did.
