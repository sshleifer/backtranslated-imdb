Looking at this series, you will probably feel like our parents when you watch Star Trek for the first time. <br /> <br /> This series has it all. The kind of stories that make you forget how to blink, the kind of characters that make you want to jump into the TV to join the action, and the kind of atmosphere that thrills your hair and endless admiration . <br /> <br /> In short, we start with John Chrichton, an astronaut, who gets shot in a wormhole and ends up with a gang of prisoners fleeing the black badguys, ironically known as Peacekeepers . <br /> <Other colorful characters consists of D'argo, great guy with a short temperament and a sword / laser rifle. Aerun Sun, former peacekeeper and PhD student in psychology. Zotoh Zhan, which is a plant. Not really, she is. She is also a priest, but with a medium streak. There is also Dominar Rygel XVI, a fat, lazy bastard who fights helium and usually does more harm than good. <br /> <br /> Later in the series, we meet the sexiest extraterrestrial on TV, namely Chiana. Nebari, young and apparently chronically horny. Gigi Edgley plays it, a name you must remember. <br /> <br /> One of the many things I like in this series is that since John Chrichton ended up in this part of the galaxy by mistake, continues to give references to the "real life". Namely, when John has a little trouble accepting the fact that he will be frozen in a statue for 80 years, one of his many criticisms is that, on his return, Buffy the Vampire Slayer will be dead. <br /> <br /> Then, all the other series, collect your Dren and spend an Ahn in one of these episodes. I can assure you that Sci / Fi, as you know, will change forever. <br /> <br /> This series has it all. It's sexy It's actionpacked. It's hillarious. It's Farscape
