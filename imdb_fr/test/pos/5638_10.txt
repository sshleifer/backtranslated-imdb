This documentary is the most hypnotizing film I've seen in a long time. I had to have it for a whole day. The material selected in the piece flows perfectly and develops three characters that can not be forgotten. The different layers of these people come back to make a strangely moving film about perseverance, loyalty and determination. These characters have come to be surprisingly fascinating and the film is unforgettable.
