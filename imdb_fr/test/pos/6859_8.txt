I was going to use 'The German Scream' as a summary but it was already taken lol. This sums up the anatomy well. If you're no stranger to reading subtitles, Anatomy fits perfectly in the Scream / Urban Legend pack. It's a horror movie for teenagers in a medical school where students disappear and then become subjects of experimentation in the dissection laboratory. Cue a brave student who investigates himself and discovers a giant conspiracy. <br /> <br /> Provided that you watch the original film in German language (I can not comment on the dub, not having seen the English edition) written and intelligently traced so that the tension never really lets go . In comparison with his American counterparts, the mystery is revealed much more quickly, which means that instead of being a slasher until the final revelation, Anatomy evolves from a horror movie slasher-body-body to thriller intelligent and exciting. It's an exciting adventure from start to finish. <br /> <br /> Low hat to the actors involved. Franka Potente proves once again that she is an intelligent and intelligent actress, capable of giving life to any role. His central performance as Paula is an excellent base for the film. The spooky speakers and the pets of their teachers are just as good, a truly disturbing presence at all times. <br /> <br /> It's also amazing that the movie does not lag much. The pace is fast and punchy, very similar to the previous Urban Legend, which means that there is always something to do to grab your attention. If there is a disadvantage, some might find Anatomy too horrible for them, but if you persevere throughout the first half of the dissection sequences, this last half with its thrilling thriller ratings will reward you. I recommend Anatomy to all those who love the horror of teenagers but who are a bit jaded from the American point of view.
