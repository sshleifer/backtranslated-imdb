The interaction between Portman and Sarandon was very interesting and my mother-daughter relationship was really close to my heart. It's a family story that does not get dulled by frills and special effects; a story of how it really is. I could not help but breathe a sigh at the end of this film because alas, it's a bittersweet story that says growing up and talking with family and friends. The acting was quite exquisite and I hope we'll see Portman and Sarandon in well-known roles a little later ...
