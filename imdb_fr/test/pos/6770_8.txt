I'm not sure I've seen a Denamark black comedy before, but it's pretty good actually. Humor is appropriately discreet and impassive to accompany some of the macabre activity. Svend and Bjarne are tired of working for their boss, because he constantly denigrates them (in fact, he mentions that they were not smart enough to decompress before peeing at some point). They do what they need to start their own butchery and when a worker is accidentally locked in the cooler during the night while preparing a light, they discover something that makes their butcher much more popular than their former one. boss. In fact, it was to this one that they sold their first "nets", and that's partly his fault, because he served them at a Rotarian dinner at his home and the guests were delighted and introduced themselves to Svend and Bjarnes the next day. Bjarne is somewhat horrified by what Svend did but it does not stop there. Svend has risen above his sad little existence to become someone new to him and he does not want to give up on that. The freezer continues to fill with all kinds of knowledge (and, at some point, "a little Swede from the park"). Suspicions arise, however, because former boss Holger thinks something is wrong. Bjarne is also haunted by her twin brother Eigil, who lived in a sanatorium for years in a coma and for whom Bjarne wanted the outlet plugged in so he could get money from the inheritance to help open the store. . When Eigil was removed from the respiratory system, he was revived, much to Bjarne's horror. And Bjarne also has a love interest for Astrid, who works at the cemetery. Neither Svend nor Bjarne are well-adjusted individuals and the situation begins to get out of control. That's what absolute humor really does, and even if it does not really make you laugh, it's fun. It is a little scary, even if we consider the cuts of meat and body parts that hang out by chance, especially since these two take all this for so simple. If you are a fan of black comedies, it is recommended, it pleased me rather well. 8 out of 10
