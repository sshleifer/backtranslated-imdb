Troama decided that these two films were horrendous movies, so in a desperate move they became that movie. The bitterness on the side of Troama may have helped trigger the comedy, but for some reason it is a very funny movie with an excerpt inspired by "Oliver Stone" commenting during the film. Many cameos, a lot of use of the song Lesbian Cannibal HoeDown add to the fun. Trey Parker, Ted Raimi, Julie Strain, etc., etc. .... <br /> <br /> One of the best recent Troama products. Yes, it's everywhere, know that the quality of production, or lack thereof, becomes one of the many common jokes. Go ahead and you'll have a good time. <br /> <br /> Behind the scenes, the best things about Troama's outings are also above average this time around. I really think that the anger that they felt about these two shabby movies helped to bring them, well not to greatness, but pushed them to "arrange" this film in a way that is better than what one or the other film could have been as originally planned.
