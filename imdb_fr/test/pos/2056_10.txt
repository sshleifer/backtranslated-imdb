I have seen this film probably a dozen times since its release in theaters. Anyone who calls this movie trashy or horrible simply does not understand action movies and does not recognize a good one. Maybe for some, the incidents and the results may seem fanciful, but in my opinion, the screenwriter Shane Black (Lethal Weapon Kiss Kiss Bang Bang) has designed one of the most thoughtful action adventures you'll have never lived. Whether above or not, this film is set like clockwork and the action continues to come. The final action sequence is one of the best I've ever seen in a movie. The cast of this film cracks. Genna Davis gave an incredible performance and it's a real shame that there has never been a follow-up "LKG". Samuel L. Jackson is hilarious while his sidekick, Mitch, tries to help him discover his lost past and earn a few dollars. If it bothers me, how could someone not like this movie? There are so many shivers and it's so funny. The sarcasm of this film still makes me laugh so much 10 years later. In my mind, the first movie Matrix and Long Kiss Goodnight were easily two of the best action movies of the most original 90s. Incidentally, Shane Black made a fortune when he sold this script. At the time, it was the best-selling scenario and worth every penny. It's so sad that the public has never given this film a chance, because it would have seen the best Renny Harlins and Genna Davis movie like you've never seen it before. Long live "The Long Kiss Goodnight" !!
