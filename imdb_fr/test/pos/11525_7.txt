As a father of four in his forties, I thought this movie made the viewing captivating, even the stuff on board. I deserve a note much higher than the grade of 4.3 that I had when I wrote that. (I gave him 7.) <br /> <br /> I agree with some of the comments about the characters, but Cameron Diaz has once again shone in a very different role. The plot was a little silly, but the purpose of the film was for me perfectly summarized in the final sequence, quite surreal. A touching ending for any parent. <br /> <br /> I could imagine that a single young man could find the movie pretty boring, but that other people who do not take high doses of testosterone would find something sweet.
