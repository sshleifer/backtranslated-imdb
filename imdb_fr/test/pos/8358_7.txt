Aslan Adam, or Lionman as his name suggests more generally among English-speaking audiences, begins with an epic battle in which King Solomon and his army defeat a crowd of guys, although I do not know who they were and the movie itself is not very helpful in establishing the fact. Be that as it may, after King Solomon massacred all these types, Princess Maria, Bishop Osorio, and Commander Anthony are forced to sign a treaty that leaves King Solomon to govern just about everything. Shortly after, Princess Maria seduces Solomon and they have sex, while the last wedding ceremony the shortest (only two sentences) Antoine marries Princess Maria and plans to rebel against Solomon and take a sweet revenge in the process. Antoine and his guards attack and kill Solomon while his pregnant wife, Princess Almunia, escapes with her protector Rostin and Antoine's guards in pursuit of the shortest work ever done (less than 5 minutes or the time required to running around a bush) Princess Almunia gives birth to a little boy hidden in bushes far from Antoine's guards. Unfortunately, when Rostin tries to get the boy back, he discovers that the baby has been adopted by a Leo pride as one of theirs! A year later, the evil Antony now reigns over his subjects without mercy. Princess Maria has given birth and has a son, but Rostin is still trying to form a band of rebels to overthrow Antoine. The task seems hopeless if can count on the help of the legendary Lionman, who is dumber than man ... <br /> <br /> This Turkish-Greek coproduction was made by Natuk Baytan in the role of Natuch Baitan and is one of a kind, I found it hilarious, but at the same time extremely entertaining. The screenplay never seems to be taken seriously, sometimes it's a pretty funny movie, it's rocket-like and never boring or boring, and some dubbed dialogue in English is hilarious, given what's happening on the screen. That makes no sense, we get a boy raised by Lion's, an evil king, a betrayal, dark family secrets, birthmarks that form the form of Leo in an element of history that existed before the children are raised by Lion's, crazy fight scenes, scenes of torture where people are supposed to be bound, cow, ancient interiors of castles that contain random ziplines and gymnastic rings, naughty idiots who all seem to have a long facial hair and a central figure who has a jaw line resembling a house brick, can be stabbed twice, have his hands covered with acid (this acid can work its way through steel hatches but is kept in a ceramic jug!) and fall more than 20 feet off a concrete floor without causing serious injury! Aslan Adam is a terribly entertaining film, I do not think I've seen another film as similar as this one. I can also compare it. If you are looking for something serious, forget it, but if you like "Too bad!" And "want to have fun, laugh and be entertained," then Aslan Adam should be at the top of your list. for the bad movie-goers and those who have the taste of the different and the weird On the disappointing side, Lionman has only his claws of steel 10 minutes before the end, which is a pity. <br /> <br /> Director Bayten continues to keep things moving at a steady pace, although he is far from being well done in the first battle - one moment, the guys are fighting on a sand dune, the other on a grassy hill with trees in the background There is a point where Lionman uses a "branch" for the pole vault, but it is obviously only a long tube surrounded by a vine! at the scene where a bloodthirsty pack is supposed to chase Lionman, but the dogs used are obviously of different breeds s, including some of the most harmless dogs out there! There are so many individual scenes in Aslan Adam that are just hilarious, stupid, weird or all three, that I could go on forever. Just check the end when Lionman jumps and flies everywhere as if he could fly. There is a lot of blood in Aslan Adam, but not a lot of graphic violence or violence, a few stab wounds and someone with his hands cut off is as graphic as possible. <br /> <br /> Technically, Aslan Adam is rather trendy, the period the costumes are bright and loud with purple, yellow, red and various other bright colors. Combat scenes are cheap, but at least filmmakers have tried to put as much action as possible. The music seemed more suited to a classical ballet than to an action movie. That's another weird aspect for Aslan Adam. The acting was bad, and even nicknamed, we could say that the acting was bad. <br /> <br /> Aslan Adam is pure gold from start to finish, there is so much to love, laugh and enjoy in this movie that I just ended up really loving. Aslan Adam can not be considered a good movie in every sense of the term, but it's really an entertaining film. I may have to see again soon to prove to myself that I had not dreamed everything! The best Turkish action movie about a man raised by Lion's, you'll never see, point. Quite popular for generating a sequel, Lionman II: The Witchqueen (1979).
