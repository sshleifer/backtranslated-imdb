I loved this movie because Bobbie Phillips can REALLY FIGHT! I always hate when the actors are not credible in the action parts. It was great to see, no offense, but a woman who can skillfully perform martial arts and fights. If you compare this with most action movies with women, you will see what I mean. They do not have to cut the blows with someone who can fight and it flows better. I was very impressed. I hope there is more!
