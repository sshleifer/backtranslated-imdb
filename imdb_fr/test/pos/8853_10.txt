When, in 1982, "The Thing" was released in movie theaters, he was greeted coldly and got very bad box office results, becoming almost a failure in John Carpenter's career as a director of horror. However, time has proven that "The Thing" was certainly not a failed project and disappointing commercial results were not the fault of the film. Nowadays, John Carpenter's "The Thing" has earned the appreciation he rightly deserves and is considered by many horror fans as a horror classic, and not without reason, as this new version John W. Campbell, Jr. "Who's Yours?" (previously adapted as "The Thing From Another World") is closer to the original story and retains a pessimistic sense of dread and high doses of suspense in a masterful study on paranoia. <br /> The plot of "The Thing" begins in the winter of 1982 in an American research station located in the far-off lands of Antarctica, when the crew members notice that a Norwegian helicopter arrives. The two apparently crazy helicopter pilots are trying to kill a Husky dog ​​that is making its way to the US base. After the accidental death of the Norwegians, the Americans try to understand what made them mad. Soon, they will discover that the Husky dog ​​that the Norwegians hunted was not a normal dog, but a creature capable of imitating all living creatures. And not only that, he has a huge hunger. <br /> <br /> Director John Carpenter has gained a special place in history when, in 1978, he directed the seminal slasher "Halloween", where the suspense and atmosphere were above the gore and shock. "The Thing" could be seen as an evolution of this style, because even when Carpenter uses the special effects of Rob Bottin (criticized by "repellents" the same day), the film focuses more on the atmosphere and the suspense rather than the violent (and very well done) displays of gore. The feeling of loneliness, as well as the "bad karma" between the crew members increases the feeling of paranoia, because everyone can be the Thing, even our main character, RJ MacReady (Kurt Russell), ending in a situation where nobody can do it. trust. <br /> <br /> This element of the plot was more faithful to the concept of the source novel and was blatantly ignored by the previous version (not quite a bad thing, just a big difference), giving the print this version less like a remake and more like a new design of the source novel. Bill Lancaster's script treats the characters with a brilliant field, giving us enough to distinguish them, but not too much to trust them completely, which makes them an essential factor in the feeling of terror that haunts the film. The mystery and the suspense are maximum, as one can never say who is the Thing and who is normal, which reinforces the paranoia and unpredictability of the plot with excellent results. <br /> <br /> The cast is very effective, and their overall performance is so effective that one can almost feel as a reality the negative feelings that reign between their characters. Carpenter's regular collaborator, Kurt Russell, plays the film in MacReady. In his eyes, we are witnessing the madness and horror of the research station as the situation worsens. Certainly one of his best performances. Wilford Brimley is also great as Dr. Blair, a scientist who goes crazy after discovering the goals of The Thing. <br /> <br /> "The Thing" is a film so wonderfully designed that its flaws tend to go unnoticed, though they do exist. The most notorious being the very discreet and sometimes inappropriate score of Ennio Morricone. It's not really bad, but some scenes are out of place and it's not one of the best works of the legendary composer. In addition, due to some erroneous forms in the special effects, some scenes were left out, filling a few small holes, but nothing important or boring. <br /> <br /> When talking about John Carpenter's movies, most people will almost instantly name "Halloween" as his favorite movie, but personally I would choose "The Thing", which I consider to be the biggest Carpenter's success so far, and one of the most interesting and scary horror movies ever made. I would go so far as to call it one of the best movies ever made. 10/10
