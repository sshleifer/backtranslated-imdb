It is now clear that the true golden age of the American film ran from the mid-60s until the eve of the release of Star Wars. Before that, there were too many Hays contraction papers. With Star Wars, the green light was on so that most of the movies are aimed at children and morons, a practice that continues today. Actually, THE SEVEN-UPS contains some scalded lines of dialogue - "We can do it in a simple way, or we can do it in a difficult way" is one - but I'm cursed if I can find something else if there is has a problem. (In fact, this line may not have been out of date by the time this film was shot.) THE SEVEN-UPS shows that everything is going well with the best movies of the golden age: sparse dialogues, games Realistic, real New York locations never looked good or bad), propulsive stories, and, yes, the best car chase ever filmed. Bill Hickman is the pilot that Scheider is pursuing (you'll recognize him at Bullitt), and the hunting structure is quite similar to McQueen's, but I prefer Scheider's facial intensity here, the pace, the terrible close-ups of schoolchildren. , and the upsetting conclusion. (This VW bug that's around 2 mph still annoys me in Bullitt's pursuit.) Don Ellis's strident and screechy score sets the perfect tone. THE SEVEN UPS: dark, dark, action-oriented, adult. It's a movie that could not be done today; there is no "gadget" for children or an absurd ending. Thanks Philip D'Antoni, Roy Scheider and Tony Lo Bianco: As long as cop movies are watched, THE SEVEN-UPS and his 1970s brothers (eg THE FRENCH CONNECTION) will set the standard.
