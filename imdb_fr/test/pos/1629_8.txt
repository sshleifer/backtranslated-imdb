The symbologist Robert Langdon (Hanks) is called to Rome to help decipher the mystery of the Illuminati before a new scientific experiment explodes the city. <br /> <br /> The Da Vinci code broke records in 2006, but for the vast majority of Dan Brown's followers did not do justice to his award-winning book and, despite having worked for two good half hours seemed to carry a lot. <br /> <br /> After reading the book, I was perhaps one of the few who I'm glad that Tom Hanks and Audrey Tautou tried to solve the mystery of the murder at the Louvre, but for Angels and Demons, the scale was raised once again as the main star and the director returned. <br /> <br /> After asking the question, most people seem to prefer Angels and Demons to the Da Vinci code for fun reading. This seems to be a criticism and fans, even if they are not yet fully justified, prefer this last adaptation to the 2006 version. <br /> <br /> This image of Howard certainly has a more clinical energy and an exercise like Da Vinci, Robert Langdon h Tom Hanks as a single night to solve the mysterious activities of the forgotten Illuminati in the Vatican and because of the constraints of time, action and despair that drive up the auction and provide a stirring excitement certainly the Da Vinci code but also generates a lot of twists and sequential assassinations. <br /> <br /> The interesting factor of this version of 2009 is the consistency of the justified elements for the murders. Earth, wind, water and fire are all included in drastic and powerful sequences to express a sense of global power in the face of the situation. <br /> <br /> This really justifies the thriller etiquette with constant tension and acute drama with <br /> <br /> Like 3 years ago, many debates and discoveries of symbols were once supposed to be lost forever and Langdon is once again the key character to show everyone. light in and among the controversy other urgent circumstances. <br /> <br /> It's fair to say that Dan Brown is a complex writer; he certainly likes to stuff problems and dramas into his action scenes and thrilling scenes. In addition to trying to discover the Illuminati, there is also the scenario of the election of a new pope, the treatment of a new scientific experiment and the power of religion is again present. All interesting to discover and listen to, if from time to time the debates and dialogue tend to let you drift, but as there are many in the novel, it has always been probable. <br /> <br /> Ron Howard, who has honestly kept some kind of ordinary direction in Da Vinci, may be returning in the worst possible way. His jerky and still moving camera style does nothing to keep up the pressure, and we can never fully accept what's happening on the screen thanks to this frankly terribly portrayed style. He's certainly not Paul Greengrass and it's not Bourne at all. <br /> <br /> Smooth and stylized, it's faster and more interesting than Da Vinci
