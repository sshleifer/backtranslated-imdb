I consider myself an occasional fan of Dario Argento. For each of his very good films (such as "Deep Red" and "Tenebre"), there seems to exist a no less inspired (its production since "Opera" has tended to disappoint). Nevertheless, it is clear that, when it is at its best, there are few horror directors who can surpass it. I consider "Opera" as the most beautiful work of Argento. <br /> <br /> This is definitely the film in which all its brands are present. There are no well-developed characters and the plot has very little meaning once you start scrutinizing it. Nevertheless, think of Argento as a European equivalent of Brian DePalma - style is all that matters here, it becomes its substance. Typical in Argento, there are some sequences of beautifully filmed murders. Those who are not familiar with the work of man can perceive this as a sadistic remark (and this may be the case, given their often chronological misogyny), but it is really true. Argento stages a murder with a complexity linked to striking visual details. It really makes graphic violence an art. In addition, his direction and the look of his films are impeccable. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, "Opera" is one of its scariest products. Argento is the only director that I feel like rock music that works well for horror sequences (when others try to do it, it seems derisory). The acting game varies, Cristina Marsillach playing a young opera performer beautiful and reasonably friendly, but never particularly lively. The rest of the actors are workers and do the work, but again, with Argento, acting is never the goal. Its beautiful colors, the terrifying violence and the dreamy fairy atmosphere / nightmare of fever. (9/10)
