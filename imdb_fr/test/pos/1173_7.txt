with two old friends. <br /> <br /> I've always loved Lemmon's and Mathaeu's movies, and of course, their teamwork is always worth watching and they're often hilarious. <br /> <br /> Do not consider this movie to be hilarious, it's certainly a competent and entertaining vehicle for fans of the two main actors and intriguing romantic comedies in the 60s style. br /> <br /> Brent Spiner could well steal the limelight in terms of laughter as the director of the arrogant and tyrannical cruise. <br /> <br /> Gloria DeHaven proves that older women can stay extremely attractive.
