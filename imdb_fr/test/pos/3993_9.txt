It is not surprising that this film was directed by I am at the time. I examined the ancient beauty and tragedy of the life of the Chosun dynasty in Seopyonje and explored with delight a well-known Korean folk tale in Chunhyang, which included his last two films. What is most surprising is that Chi Hwa Seon, his offer of 2002, is not presented in the pansori style of these two previous films. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, the experienced hand of I am successful. We explore together the life of a real person: a painter of the late nineteenth century Chosun dynasty who straddles modernity but who is not a noble and who, as a result, arouses a stir in contemporary Korean society with his fame and his audience. and artistic expressions of disdain for the old Korean noble class and its disregard for future colonial Japanese rulers. The painter Chang Seung Up, better known by the pseudonym Oh Won (beautifully performed by Choi Min Sik, famous legendary "OldBoy" star of Park Chan Wook) is becoming more and more influential and therefore more dangerous throughout the film. The contemporary Korean audience will support a hero like this despite the fact, or perhaps because of the fact, that he was so ostracized in his day. I am the sense of simultaneous beauty and the tragedy of history remains intact. I perfectly master the idiosyncrasies of the past of his country and, in this film, it almost surpasses itself. As you would expect in a film, cinematography is breathtaking, editing is accurate and history is central. <br /> <br /> The scenarios are staged against Seung Up, the family ties are put to the test and broken, scandalous behavior is presumed (and is sometimes real), all to bring down the man who "paint the fire". But despite all the subtleties of the detailed but sometimes complicated story of Seung Up's life, I manage to survive. It becomes legendary thanks to its ability to perfectly copy famous Chinese paintings after a single look. The art dealers and agents then assaulted him and tried to make money with "Oh won". In other words, groups of people who want to enjoy the real Seung Up, an artistic star, begin to form. But he refuses to be manipulated. His ability to avoid massive hordes and imperial lackeys impresses the public, if not the cast. <br /> <br /> What does Seung Up think? He has powerful emotions and opinions about painting, such as the aesthetic belief that paintings are living things and never really finished. He despises those who want to turn art into profit. And he does not care about politicians who use their strength to bring artistic beauty around them and then reject the artist as a traitor. But he also thinks that painting plays a role in the next upheavals. Horror scenes involving foreign invaders from France and Japan are presented. The historical epic motif of the brand Je suis, and its influence in the field remains visible in this epic multi-million dollar. <br /> <br /> The protagonist is even more distressed, as well as those who love him, when he refuses to paint. It is at this moment that history takes on a whole new meaning, not only political but of a social nature. I take the problems in a realistic, commendable way. <br /> <br /> He, Oh Won, becomes a figure of Jesus. People believe it can do artistic miracles and the government feels it needs its artistic support, but the protagonist remains fiercely independent and contemptuous of what others want him to do or be. In the end, the government and people fall on Seung Up in a way extracted from the Bible. His holiness becomes human; his humanity is not accepted; he dies for (or escapes) the sins of commoners, art critics, politicians, who pursue him. <br /> <br /> But does he die? As in most I'm movies, one question remains. In this case, does Seung Up really become an immortal hermit? The film does not address this issue. this is simply a possible end for Chang Seung Up's real man, or Oh Won. No death is represented because no death is known. <br /> <br /> It's hard to find a flaw in this film, but I've become so good at presenting various historical absurdities of his culture that at that moment, he has no more surprises. As usual for I'm movies, cinematography, editing and writing are all first rate. It's a well-crafted movie, imbued with incredible storytelling. Certainly, he is perhaps more talented to do it through the ancient Korean musical art of pansori. Nevertheless, the film contains excerpts of this admirable art form and, in the end, the audience feels as if they have been aware of a great and unprecedented story. And they did it, because that's precisely what I am.
