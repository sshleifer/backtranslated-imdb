I must say that this movie is absolutely amazing. I do not understand why he got such a low note. There is romance, music, darkness and vampires. Stuart Townsend also did a great job as Lestat, the acting game was great. Also, normally I'm not in this music, sometimes sometimes. But I must say that in this film, the music is perfect. If you like dark movies about vampires, it's definitely for you or even if you do not, there is a love story about it. My rating is provocative: 10 out of 10. Anyway, I seriously suggest you watch it. I remember not having seen this for years, I looked at it again about a year ago and got hooked again. lol. Super movie !!!
