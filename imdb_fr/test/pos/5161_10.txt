There is no conspiracy. There are no central characters. There are no moving cameras or close-ups. In fact, this film does not follow any of the classic storytelling techniques used by mainstream movies. Roy Andersson's Levande is a remarkable piece of cinematographic narration. It is a touching look on the human psyche. <br /> <br /> Constituted of a series of vignettes, Roy Andersson gives us an intimate glimpse of what makes us all human. In static shots perfectly framed, to which is added a music at once perfect, but shifted, Roy presents us a crowd of characters who engage in their daily existence. Some on the verge of tragic, others hilarious, we embarked on a Nordic journey unlike any other. <br /> <br /> It's a journey in the little things that make us human beings. Instead of using narration techniques or exaggerated visual techniques, everything is reduced to the bare minimum, so that we focus only on the characters themselves. It focuses on the insignificant points in our lives that make us who we are. our dreams, our despair. It is through this simple observation of others that we can accept who we are as individuals. <br /> <br /> The faded colors and deadly makeup of the characters seem to just underscore their personal stories and remind us that unlike them, we are all alive. There is no happy ending or light at the end of the tunnel in this film, but you are coming out of the cinema with a sense of life. Much more accessible than his previous movie, Du Levande, on the second floor, is a truly inspiring film.
