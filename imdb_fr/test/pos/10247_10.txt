Some people may call "Cooley High" the same sort of thing as "American Graffiti", but I would not do it. For starters, in "AG" everyone was white, while in "CH" they are all black. Plus, this one has a Motown soundtrack. Specifically, the film focuses on several African-American working-class students from 1964, Chicago and their antics. The film mainly deals with home life and relationships. In their apartments, we see that there is never a father. But these young men always know how to live fully. <br /> <br /> One thing that truly distinguishes this film from most Black performances is that the teenagers in this film are portrayed as very responsible and disturbing. about the missing school. Two really fun scenes are the gorilla scene and the only white in the movie. But overall, the main star is the soundtrack. It's really one of the best soundtracks in the history of the film (we even have it on vinyl at home). A classic in the true sense of the word.
