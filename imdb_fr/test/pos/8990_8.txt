Like most sports films, it is not surprising that people who know the sport can find fault with it. As a football umpire, I have not yet seen a movie or TV show succeed when it comes to representing a game. "Forever" has good actors, but I found that Sean Astin was a little young to be a director in a juvenile prison. I was very grateful that the plot does not imply that the main character turns his detained comrades into rugby players and attacks Flagstaff as well as Highland. Which comes down to credulity: a police car is coming just when Flagstaff's bad guys are pissing off Rick Penning. Even though rugby is not a nationally sanctioned high school sport, the team is a school club sport - much like the rodeo. That said, I find it hard to believe that high school officials allow students to play with open wounds: this is simply not done on this day of AIDS and hepatitis. I do not care about tradition and the macho image. Despite this, it was an awesome movie in which teenagers were supposed to behave like adults (and sometimes even actually). Unfortunately, far too many coaches are like those in Flagstaff - or worse.
