One of the most charming and, at least for me, the most powerful elements of Anthony Minghella's fascinating winner of the Best Film Award, "The English Patient", is that in the mid-90s, when Hollywood was on The point of losing his courage for New grandiose projects, a film was created that brought back traces - very powerful traces - of the radical and wonderful majesty that produced films such as "Lawrence of Arabia" (1962) and "The Ten Commandments" (1956). "The English Patient" contains many things that made these films so powerful. He has that glorious feeling, a stretched running time that seems barely long, and fascinating characters with pasts and stories. <br /> <br /> "The English Patient", based on a novel of the same name by Michael Ondaatje, is like "The Godfather: Part II" (1974) in the sense that it is built. It's a mix of two stories: the past and the present and it's all about the main character: an English patient in the years following the Second World War. Ralph Fiennes plays the English patient, forever marked by a plane crash, and taken care of in an isolated church by a single nurse, interpreted to perfection by Juliette Binoche. In addition to her relationship with her patient with hoarse and troubled voices, Binoche discovers her past when a stranger (Willem Dafoe) arrives and the two men seem to know each other. <br /> <br /> This is one of the two beautifully crafted stories that shape this film. The other, said in flashback, is the patient's past, before he is marked and dies in a bed. The story of the present mingles with the patient's past and his love story that tragically changed his life forever. <br /> <br /> To be honest, "The English Patient" is a love story mingled with a radical epic sensation and blends it beautifully. What I really admired in the love story between Ralph Fiennes and Kristin Scott Thomas is how enthralling, obsessive and enchanting he was. Usually, in love stories, such as "Cold Mountain" (2003), Minghella, the romantic elements seem much more lustful than obsessed. Some love scenes contain elements that tend to be associated more with lust than with love, but nevertheless, because it is so developed and it is not rushed or exploited in a disproportionate way, we can believe that there is true love between these characters. It reminded me a lot of "Vertigo" (1958) in the way filmmakers and performers convinced us that they were two human beings who really fell in love with each other. <br /> <br /> The performances were excellent. . The performance of Juliette Binoche, who won the Oscar for her performance the following year, particularly excited me. I also liked that Willem Dafoe plays the kind of cynical and dubious character he always plays. And of course, I can not leave aside Fiennes and Scott Thomas and their portraits of two very passionate lovers. <br /> <br /> Despite my enormous enthusiasm for this epic, I would be dishonest if I described it as a perfect film. There are two faults I can not take a look at. First, it's a bit too long and the reason is my second complaint. There are some useless side-tricks. I was not thrilled or particularly interested in the second love story between Binoche and a bomb specialist played by Naveen Andrews. My research led me to suppose that this piece of intrigue comes from the original book and I'm sure it worked perfectly well, but in the movie it just seems a little distracting and the relationship between the two characters fascinate me. The character of Fiennes and her relationship with her two main actresses interested me much more. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, these two faults are easily forgivable, even if they slow things down a bit. Those set aside, "The English Patient" is an extraordinary achievement of film making. For me, it looked a bit like a foolish mix between "Casablanca" (1942) and "Lawrence of Arabia" (1962), two remarkable and better films, and this efficient assembly was well worth my time. It's a shame that Anthony Minghella has left us. Because he was a really talented filmmaker. That's all the proof we need.
