Again, I have to play something contrarian. Most of Ab Tak Chappan's critics have been extremely positive. Mine is positive, but only slightly. A 7 out of 10 equals a letter "C" from me. <br /> <br /> It seems that the praise is largely due to two factors: one, the fact that Ab Tak Chappan is more realistic than the typical Bollywood film, and two, that he tries to do things differently. <br /> <br /> The first point that mattered to me the least. I do not look for realism in movies, so I do not score higher for a movie that tells a story and characters that are closer to what I think about the real world - I'm a big fan of surrealism, fantasy, absurdism, etc., even though I do not hate realistic movies for the simple fact that they are realistic. <br /> <br /> On the second point, I agree that it is commendable to try to do things differently. However, I do not think that "originality" in relation to the pretext is a better or worse film in itself. A film can be "original" and mediocre, just as a film can be excellent and excellent. What matters is that the film does everything it wants to do and is enjoyable or aesthetically gratifying for the viewer. <br /> <br /> Ab Tak Chappan is based on the true story of a Mumbai policeman, Daya Naik. . Naik was a "meeting specialist". Dating specialists, who could be considered as early instantiations of the real-world "judge Dredds", are trained to function as criminals and gang members they pursue, and they are basically allowed to kill - they act in as police, judges, jury and executioner in a few moments. Ab Tak Chappan follows the story of Sadhu Agashe (Nana Patekar), a Naik-based dating specialist. We see him at work, interacting with fellow dating specialists and engaging in violence. We see him at home, trying to lead a normal life in his not very luxurious environment. We see him trying to adapt to a new "commissioner" halfway through the film. And we see his strange relationship with a notorious Indian gangster, Don Zameer Zafar (Prasad Purandhare). <br /> <br /> All this has the potential to make a fabulous and hard film. I agree that it is good to give up the typical Bollywood novels and musical melodies - not all films need them; Ab Tak Chappan's producer, Ram Gopal Varma, is famous for leaving music and novels in the background or on the roadside in many of the films he made or produced. In addition, Ab Tak Chappan has good performances - Patekar has almost an atmosphere of Death Wish (1974) - Charles Bronson. Cinematography is excellent, for example, the hand-held film at the beginning of the film was particularly effective. It has an excellent score that mixes a more gloomy action / crime score with Hollywood sounds with traditional Indian instruments and modalities. The violence is well done and serious. <br /> <br /> There is also a decent exploration of sub-texts, including the morality of dating specialists, the idea of ​​following orders, and so on. Meeting specialists must demonstrate that they must largely dissociate themselves from the ideas of good and evil. More poignantly, the film questions the merit of blindly following orders. Parallels are drawn between meeting specialists following orders and, for example, members of a country's military, and we are shown how much corruption can result. <br /> <br /> But you knew there was a "But the director" Shimit Amin "and his writers have created a story with far too many characters, far too much sprawl and that advances a little too slowly All these problems may be due to the fact that Amin and his team are watching the Godfather's films, to which Ab Tak Chappan has some similarities (at least superficial), although from the point of view of a police officer. Most of the dating specialists we do not know very well - they are shallow characters at least, except for Agashe and Jatin Shukla (Nakul Vaid) First of all, Narayan, I did not know who was before half of the film at least, his name is mentioned several times, but I would have seen it only when the scene changed, then everyone would change clothes when they were to appear again and I should start to find who was Narayan. /> <br /> The same thing happened with the first commissioner of Agashe. The movie was already far in the new curator before I could understand the relationships. It seems that there are new characters in each scene. We never learn the stories of most of them. Although this may have some artistic merit in the sense that meeting specialists kill mostly people they do not know anything about (because they do so mainly at the command), since we do not know much about most dating specialists, difficult to find characters to watch, and this is not really a captivating film. <br /> <br /> The main villain is Zameer. But until the half of the film, nothing indicates it. He does not have much more time on the screen than the other villains who parade through the film, and he "literally phone his performance" - he is in another place (Dubai), only communicating by phone for the majority of the film. In reality, we do not see much Zameer. To a certain extent, the film depends on some "twists" that do not need to show Zameer a number of things, but we could see it doing something else, and many other bad guys could have been left out. <br /> <br /> It would have tightened the film a bit, making it more targeted and shortened by about half an hour, which would have been beneficial for its impact. It's not an action packed movie. For at least the first 45 minutes or so, I found myself admiring Ab Tak Chappan's considerable style, but saying, "Okay, keep going with history."
