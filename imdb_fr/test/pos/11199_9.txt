Perhaps many frustrated viewers are living their lives without ever thinking deeply about life itself. What I want to emphasize here is that "far" is not just a home-made art film but one of the best home-made art films. Of all the home-made art films I've seen, "far" is the one that really stands out as a glittering gold coin. It is even fair to say that the cinematography and the representation of the human emotion of this film surpass Tarkovsky's nostalgia. One commentator was right in saying that sex, a jaded trait common to foreign films, is surprisingly lacking in "far-off" and common sense. What is remarkable about "distant" is that it captures the details of life we ​​usually ignore and the richness of our existence that is often buried under the clatter and visual extravagance of our commercialized world. Fortunately, "remote" does not have much to spare the audience and what we see on the screen is a nude portrait of human beings.
