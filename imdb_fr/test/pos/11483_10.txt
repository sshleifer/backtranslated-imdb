I saw Linda, and it's a top quality movie! The life of Paul and his wife, Linda, whom he adored in his youth and finally married. They meet another married couple, Jeff and Stella, and the foursome becomes very good friends. But, their friendship takes a turn after having a vacation together at Varona Beach .... A Twist that never brings married couples back to their former status of friends. <br /> <br /> Linda is a must! ! The Virginia Madsen game is acceptable. However, Richard Thomas steals the film with his incredible acting ... and the emotions he displays. <br /> <br /> A wonderful movie! "Lotta Honey"
