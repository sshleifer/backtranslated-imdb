Do you want to know why the French and Italians love each other / hate each other? Would you like to have a glimpse into the story that guides our life? Check out Virzi's movie (in the original language, of course) and you'll see a wonderful Monica Bellucci who finally speaks her mother tongue, from Citt√† di Castello (Umbria, just on the border with Tuscany). And the rest of the characters speaking livornais (the beautiful Sabrina Impacciatore and all the others). Daniel Auteuil definitely in his place with Napoleon. A lot of fun, a real fresco of the landscape of the island of Elba and a picture of the political reasons to kill or to let live a tyrant (good forever).
