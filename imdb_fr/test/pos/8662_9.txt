The Bothersome Man is one of the best foreign movies I have ever seen. All technical aspects are, in my opinion, perfect (lighting, play, direction, stimulation, etc.). HISTORY is breathtaking. <br /> <br /> Apparently, beyond death, our main character finds himself in a world without beauty, without passion and without anything that could please the senses of man. His work is cold and uninteresting; his relations are numb and uninteresting, and when everything becomes too difficult, he tries to stop it in front of a train. But that does not end - he can not leave this strange world by suicide! Back to a man who seemed to feel the same isolation and solitude, our main character joins him to search a stone wall in hopes of revealing the source of a strange and wonderful smell and music. By the time they cross the cap - and I will not reveal that much - everything will end and the movie will end as oddly as it started. <br /> <br /> Suffice it to say that you will love this movie or hate it. he. I think it's like a magical poem, open to many different interpretations, all equally valid. If you like new experiences in the cinema and want to escape the Hollywood party, try this movie! <br /> <br /> 9/10 (and I hardly evaluate!) Because, despite the darkness, this film left me feeling something bigger ... something mysterious and beyond of ourselves. Good game!
