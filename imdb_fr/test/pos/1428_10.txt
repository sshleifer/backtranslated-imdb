I saw this mini-movie when it aired for the first time and I loved it! It's pretty funny to see how far people will go to get money. It's also fun to see how a boyfriend can be "whipped". "Whipped" enough to kill. I think the casting was great, especially Kristin's character. Without her sweet conversation, and the misleading look, the movie would not have been the same. <br /> <br /> I have never used to look at the United States but now it is one of my stations. <br /> <br />
