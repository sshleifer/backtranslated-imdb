No music. No stupid masala. Really realistic representation of the police system in India and based on a real specialist of the "meeting" in India, Daya Nayak. It's Ab Tak 56 (56 symbolizes the number of criminals that "Sadhu Agashe" killed "- and you already know it a little bit) Brilliance plays Nan Patekar as a casual, calculating Indian cop. The intrigue, although slightly predictable to criticism, is intriguing anyway.Another film of Ram Gopal Vermas The Factory: decent films or really good, Ab Tak CHappan snakes very well, but remains one of the Top 70 best films out of India, commercial and artistic included. <br /> <br /> What is great is that the story is relaxed and finally shows the functioning of the police network (in a Indian film) but seriously, the linings are funny (but I do not know if the subtitled version will look so funny) The producers are trying to release a film in Cannes, which is interesting.Founded by the first director Shamit Aman ( I think that's his name). <br /> <br /> > Again 55 years old Nana Patekar i Far from her ridiculous roles of the past, it shows what a good director can do with a good actor. Really good things. If you're interested in Indian movies and you're disgusted by the nonsense that some of our guys are talking about, then that's really a relief. <br /> <br /> Once again, Patekar is the one who happily wears the film on his shoulders and embodies the film's style - relaxed, funny, intelligent and calculating. Good dialogues, a good acting, a beautiful direction in short. Recommendations: Gangaajal, Company of Ram Gopal Verma (the two Indian films)
