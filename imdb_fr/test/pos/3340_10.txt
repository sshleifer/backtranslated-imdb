I did not know who Bruce Haack was before seeing this movie. I had just seen the MOOG doc, which was ok, the only problem was that Moog was leading a very happy life, and that the doc was well ... content. Haack's story is full of all the marketable tragedies that people have today, but it is full of heart. Although the film does not enter the tragic film, we can feel that Bruce has accepted the price to make music in his own way. There are so many elements that make up his IE legacy. invention of the people, where Bruce could play music by touching people. It had to be difficult to document Haack's "brilliant" production, which fell into almost every conceivable musical category (even rap), but the director cut the song in a very coherent way and managed to capture the mind. And the cast ... what surrounds a group of characters Bruce surrounds himself, but what do you expect a telepathic guru who makes noise with children and fights against the industry of music? I recommend this film to anyone interested in the history of music, that's it, but it's important.
