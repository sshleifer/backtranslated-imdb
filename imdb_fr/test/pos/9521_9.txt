Beginning with "My name is Joe", as in the careers of Alcoholics Anonymous tBM, plunge into a crazy spiral of unfaithfulness, double standards and clandestine business. but what do you expect from a family of lawyers? <br /> <br /> A really fun movie, with some of the most outrageous characters since The Birdcage, the plot and subplot are interwoven with surreal scenes from decadent Parisian life (never been). at a wedding reception in the gentlemen's washroom where the wives' grandmother and her upset girlfriend smoke drugs and make blue jokes? No, me either!) Leading to a last scene of almost arcadian symbolism. <br /> <br /> Excellent.
