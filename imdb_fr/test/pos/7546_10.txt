This comical classic of the English school's antics is and was one of the classics of the art house. Then the art house disappeared with the arrival of videos. And so did the audience for this movie. The loss is not to art houses or to this great movie. The loss is for those who will never have a real opportunity to see this cinematic masterpiece filled with memorable laughter. But I'm telling converts not to be me. Who else would look for this movie?
