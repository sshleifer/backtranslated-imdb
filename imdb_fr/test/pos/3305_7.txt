This is the drama of a captivating woman that men can appreciate. The plot follows a young woman (Hope Lange) who works for a publisher after college. We can forgive her transition from secretary to editor (hey, it's Hollywood) and some other faults. Here is one of the rare films in which the great producer Robert Evans (here, nicely represented by a rat with a woman) appears. It also features a mature Joan Crawford and a fantastic cast. Check it out.
