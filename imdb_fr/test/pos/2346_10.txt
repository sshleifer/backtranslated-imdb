I must say that this is one of the best movies I've seen so far for Naruto. the action was much better than in the first movie because there were a lot more fighting scenes and it was happening at a faster pace. it was amazing, the choreography was excellent as well as most visual effects. <br /> <br /> The script is a novelty for Naruto. but it's basically the same thing as the first movie. in the series, you see them fighting other ninjas, but in the movies (1 + 2), you see them fighting against a machine of mass destruction. It's good to see them fighting against something other than a ninja, and it was great to see another power than the chakra. and how other overseas peoples are fighting. also sakura has finally killed someone who is stronger than her. (she really became strong) it was much better than the fillers of the show I'm watching right now. When you watch this movie, the fast action scene will make your heart beat. With the new jutsus and garra in the movie, you know it's good. and the music was good too, but I think something is missing. But the final theme song was a plus. (dind dong dang) I think it was a very good song. I recommend it totally. <br /> <br /> All in all, I give this movie a 10, because I just love it. if you decide to watch it, enjoy it. lol
