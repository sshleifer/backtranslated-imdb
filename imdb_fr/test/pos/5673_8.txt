The film begins with three characters who play in turn and decide to visit first a crocodile farm, then a lighter activity, a visit "fishing". <br /> <br /> You pick up interesting information about crocodiles when they visit the farm and the information just brings enough to increase the suspense later in the film when you remember what was said previously. <br /> <br /> The action in the film is well programmed and not finished. The suspense is built through the "what ifs", the "unknowns" and the sometimes heartbreaking decisions of the characters in the film. <br /> <br /> I wondered what I would do if I were in the same state. boat, no pun intended. <br /> <br /> The quality of the film was really good and the effects realistic, credible and no frills or caricatures or displaced, as sometimes with CGI. <br /> <br /> As a horror movie buff, I look at just about every horror movie I can get my hands on, in just about every genre, and that's the 'one of the best horror movies' crocodile', otherwise the best I've had. seen. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie and you will not be disappointed.
