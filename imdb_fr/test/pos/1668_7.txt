After seeing NAKED CITY and NIGHT AND THE CITY (who is still my favorite Dassin), I was more than happy to see his "Masterpiece" (O-Word criterion) RIFIFI. <br /> <br /> Now, I'm a little disappointed with the story. <br /> <br /> So I have at least these five questions in mind: <br /> <br /> 1. In the final countdown, Louis Grutter photographed from inside a home the main character, Tony the Stephanois. He could not know if he was still alive or not, but he did not care and ran directly afterwards outside the house (with the money) to reach his car. So of course, Tony was not dead and shot him. GREAT QUESTIONMARK. <br /> <br /> 2. In another important scene, the safecard specialist, Cesar, delivered a diamond ring (part of the flight) just after the flight, a woman who was working for Louis Grutter in a night bar. Stupid, because before that character was not so stupid. And of course, Louis knew directly that Tony had planned the theft of the jewel. SMALL QUESTIONMARK. <br /> <br /> 3.After the murder of the gangsters behind Louis Grutter, Mario Ferrati and his wife Tony and his best friend Joe planned a revenge against Louis' gang. At the same time, they do not care about the safety of Joe's wife and her five-year-old child. Of course, Louis Gang kidnapped the son. CHEAP AND SIMPLE. <br /> <br /> 4. The perfect holdup: of course, it's the best 30min. long scene in all the plot, no word spoken in all the time, but was it a perfect holdup? Comparing with other films dealing with this theme, I could only smile when, for example, Tony took a fire extinguisher to ban the alarm. Also too simple. <br /> <br /> 5. The Grutter gang went to Mario's house because they knew (however ...) that the jewels would be there. Then they murder Mario and his wife. So what? They do not seek it! NO. They went straight out of the apartment. And more. They did not watch the apartment after that so that Tony could enter after a while (which was the same day) inside to pick up the jewels. GREAT QUESTIONMARK. <br /> <br /> In summary: it's a good movie. Due to the brilliant silent turning scene of 30 minutes. Because of the very good cut (the final scene of the car through Paris is magnificent). Because of a very good actor called Jean Servais. Because of this black / white fever, you will have everything while watching. For other reasons, other users have also mentioned the subject, but do not tell me that this story is staggering.
