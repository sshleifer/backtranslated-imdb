Given Mick Molloy's terrible track record since he was alone, I was not expecting much from Crackerjack. Even the promotional posters of the movie made me nervous. In fact, if I had not received free tickets for the preview, I would have resisted the pressure of the miss (who thinks Mick is a piece - there is a worry) to pay money for that. <Br/> <br /> The first few minutes of the movie worried me. It started with one of Micks' routines tired of "getting angry at insignificant things," but it gave him a neat touch, which at least refreshed him a bit. The rest of the story was pretty good and very light - even the typical humor of Mick Molloy (and Judith Lucy) was well delivered and although I never had to get up in the aisles, it generated a lot more laughs that I was waiting (and it was consistent). <br /> <br /> There's nothing new in the plot - it's predictable enough, but it's changing quickly between plain lines and other jokes - I've never felt like absorb into an element that is too long or too long. too short; Mick had to work hard to refine his scenario. There were one or two "Late Show" jokes and one or two jokes that only the Melbournians could receive - but there are certainly plenty of generic things here for a wider audience. <br /> <br /> John Clarke did not seem to be mean, but it did not hurt the movie. <br /> <br /> Overall, I enjoyed this Australian. comedy, and was pleasantly entertained throughout the duration of the film. I left the cinema with a decent-sized smile - a pretty hard thing to do for an Australian comedy in my books. 7.5 / 10 <br /> <br />
