The things I like Steve Zahn in the role of Gus, nails the game, copies the mannerisms of Robert Duvalls, which puts him at ease for fans of Gus. (Some other actors also copy the style of their predecessors in this series). Karl Urban, looks dark and tough, but can also make a joke and smile, which T. L. Jones did in an original series. Gear, guns, clothes, all accurate or very close to the period. I will never forgive Costner and Duvall for having a nylon lariat in their cart in Open Range. The Comanches, in fact, go on a ride, rather than hide a modern saddle under a Navajo cover. And they are not described as politically correct peace-loving pastors, but as a proud warrior people. There are silly scenes, but that totally challenges another variation of doing something stupid not to win a $ 1 million game show.
