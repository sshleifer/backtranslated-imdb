This film is a fairly accurate adaptation of Prosper Merimee's novel. In the novel, Merimee himself is a character, Don Jose is from Navarre (northern Spain and, historically, a region of the Basque Country where Basque is spoken). They are in Seville (Andalusia, southern Spain) and speak only Spanish, with an Andalusian accent, but do not speak Basque, but Carmen explains to Don José that she lived in Navarre. You can believe it or not, anyway this is the version of the book, so you can not be critical with the movie about it, be with the book! It should be noted that Merimee's novel and Bizet's opera are different. This film is an adaptation of the novel. Anyway, in the opera Don Jose is still Spanish from Navarre, never French. Why do so many people still think that Don José is French? I do not know but I guess because the novel and opera are in French but are supposed to be in Spanish. <br /> <br /> The only important difference between the film and the novel is that of the film Don José. also kills the lover "bullfighter" of Carmen and in the novel it does not do it (nor in the opera). I guess they wanted to keep the movie a bit gore! I think the movie is pretty good, anyway.
