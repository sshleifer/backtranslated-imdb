Big Fat Liar is an excellent watch for kids of all ages, even adults. I had a good time watching this movie and recommend it to children 10 and under. The laughs never end and the adventurous plot is very good too! Frankie Muniz is funny and Marty Wolfe is hilarious! All in all, a movie well done so that children can enjoy and have a good time.
