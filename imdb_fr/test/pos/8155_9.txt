Hey man, this movie is all about choices. Every time in your life, you have to choose something or simply disappear ... And this film proves it! Of course, life is actually not like a beautiful image as shown in this film ... it does not show it indeed, but some may think so. I try to say that it's full of pain, love and deep life lessons. Aaron, the Mormon missionary is the real shepherd looking for what is beautiful in the depths of Chisthian, the guy who smells the skin ... <br /> <br /> It's a beautiful ending and you always believe destiny because it will surprise you a turn or in another part of your life like the last days ... <br /> <br /> Look at it well !!!
