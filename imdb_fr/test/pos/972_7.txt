It's not a film that changes your life. it's not an epic or something like that. But it's fun and fun. It's a movie that the whole family can watch together, and for the moment, there are very few movies suitable for kids who DO NOT make a love affair! It tells a good story lightly without trying to dazzle the audience with excessive special effects, like many movies nowadays. There are good actors, and all the music used is quite well adapted to the content of the film. The acting is very good too, the actors look comfortable and credible in their environment and, above all, the jokes are really funny. I recommend it to people of all ages - it certainly made me laugh. :)
