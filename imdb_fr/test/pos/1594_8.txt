WARNING: SPOILERS <br /> <br /> Although this film was a bit slow at times, the brilliant landscapes, the richness of the characters and the powerful themes make "Morte a Venezia" an enriching experience. I have not read Thomas Mann's book, but I am convinced that Visconti's visual splendor, musical score and powerful evocation must do him justice. <br /> <br /> The study by Gustav von Aschenbach alludes to the human tendency to rationalize and quantify our emotions, our behavior and our passion. This tendency is demonstrated in the German scene between Alfred and Gustav when Alfred describes music as being both mathematical - that is to say. quantifiable - and emotional. This conflict occurs again in the scene where the young Tadzio plays alone "Fuer Elise" in the lobby of the hotel and Gustav remembers his visit to a brothel where he is attracted by a prostitute who plays the same song. In her flashback, after paying the prostitute, Gustav is clearly seized physically by the consequences of his actions. This reaction is reminiscent of the moral reaction to Tadzio's temptations. <br /> <br /> Finally, Gustav is forced to make his biggest decision: to stay in Venice and resign himself to his lust and his temptations? Or flee Venice to save his life? His first attempt to escape from Venice to the train station led to futility and foreshadowed the result of the extension of his stay. <br /> <br /> Complimenting the captivating interaction of the characters, the powerful landscape of Visconti (including Venice at Dawn and the final scene). Tadzio walking in the water and pointing towards the horizon) makes this film a true masterpiece.
