When I saw LAUREN BACALL doing CACTUS FLOWER on Broadway, I had never dreamed of one day seeing an actress like INGRID BERGMAN play the role of Bacall on screen. But here, Ingrid let herself be disheveled for good moments of comedy while the dental nurse claimed to be WALTER MATTHAU's wife to be able to continue as she had told GOLDIE HAWN. <br /> It's a story to play for laughter. from beginning to end, gay stuff that never fails to humor or dry spirit throughout its course. There are many one-liners or gags that are way above the usual situation on television - the lines sound just because they get married so well to the characters and their motives. <br /> <br /> daffy girl who plans (at the beginning) to commit suicide for her unfortunate affair with Matthau, GOLDIE HAWN (fresh out of her star role on TV "Laugh In") plays a stupid blonde role Perfectly. It's easy to see why she won this supportive actor. <br /> <br /> Ingrid is surprisingly attractive in a rare comedy role, although she sometimes seems a bit too pretentious for the role. Be that as it may, she is a surprising choice to play the role of the nurse who freezes work at the office, but who is considerably warmer outside working hours. <br /> <br /> As an immediate neighbor of Goldie, Igor, Rick Lenz does it admirably, and fits him perfectly in this last scene. <br /> <br /> Matthau embodies the kind of character that has become his commercial legacy in all his roles as Neil Simon: an adorable cad who gets his own mess when he lies after lying. <br /> <br /> This is the kind of comedy that tickles your ribs and that will make you laugh laughing lines of fun told by Abe Burrows and IAL Diamond has managed to get rid, according to a French joke.
