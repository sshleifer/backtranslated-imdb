Barely three and a half years after a month (October 7-31, 1953) at Broadway's Coronet Theater (west of 49th Street, renamed since O'Neill), MGM built on its previous strong success of the play in London to lavish a magnificent cast and - for the most part - carefully opened the production on a sadly balanced scenario of this subversively subversive comedy of the boulevard and were rewarded with a modest success. <br /> <br /> Ava Gardner is Stewart Granger's increasingly frustrated wife, an internationally successful "workaholic" (before the term was coined) called on David Niven, always frustrated, to try to revive the passion of his wife. When the "second honeymoon" Gardner recruits Granger in the cruise, the trio (and his dog) is stuck on an island in the South Sea (were there any other survivors? later plot developments), Granger continues to manage the world around him - big hut for himself and his wife and a little head for Niven - or the unattached man. <br /> <br /> The heart of the plot of the play takes place in the middle of the film when Niven proposes that Granger and him alternate as tenants of Little Hut - sharing the only woman on the island, Granger having agreed to share the only pair of shoes (sa). <br /> <br /> Reason (which Granger sees as his strong point) reigns and frustration reigns supreme - for a while. <br /> <br /> David Niven and Ava Gardner are superb in their so-called seductive and seductive suave roles, and Stuart Granger - usually known to be handsome and virile in action roles and the odd miscast specty lty (a handsome boy like Apollodorus in Shaw's CAESAR AND CLEOPATRA in 1945) gives one of the best acting performances of his film career as a husband who can be as smart as he thinks. 33 years later, he would once again show off this smooth urbanity alongside Rex Harrison in the first (and last two) Granger engagements in the hit revival of Somerset Maugham's THE CIRCLE, which ended only with Harrison's death. We would be much richer if Granger had used these skills more often. <br /> <br /> As promising as the house is, it is, after all, a very British Boulevard Comedy AND Hollywood in the 1950s, that is to say that (unlike the source room) very little sex is actually happening. To be honest, if you do not indulge in the ideas that drive the devices, it becomes a little ridiculous (the same basic plot is much more satisfying three years later, in Cary Grant / Deborah Kerr / Robert Mitchum / Jean Simmons ( Stewart Granger's current wife) THE GRASS IS GREENER is based on an even less successful game, but for whatever reason, this superior triumph has failed at the box office). <br /> <br /> As abundantly as MGM defined the play, there were unfortunate failures - the foolishness that ends the stay on the island is presaged by a cartoon in what should have been a moment of true excitement - the sinking of the yacht that PLACES them on the island. In the end, we only have about three quarters of an hour from the real little cabin, but a good ninety minutes from David Niven, Ava Gardner and Stewart Granger, who make the film a fun diversion. No high culture, but a guilty pleasure worthy. <br /> <br /> We even get a very nice trim in Walter Chiari (known to be the true lover of Ava at this time). As one of his best speeches says: "Boola, boola!"
