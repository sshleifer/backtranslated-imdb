My husband trained me in this film because I had no interest in seeing cartoons. I was absolutely delighted by the simple story and the amazing animation. In a digital world where effects are computer generated, it was refreshing to see a beautiful and imaginative animation drawn by hand. The world of Sosuke and Ponyo is a living fantasy mixed with a minimal reality. I have not seen animation like this since I was a child and it is wonderful to see it last and succeed. <br /> <br /> The actors providing the voice in the English version were fabulous. The length of the film was PERFECT, especially for children who tend to have squirrelly fits in the movies. Overall, a delightful experience is worth the very high price of the ticket we have today.
