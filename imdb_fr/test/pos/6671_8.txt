* Perhaps spoilers * Without doubt one of the best dramas if not the best of the kind that I have ever seen. Prot is he an alien or just a crazy idiot? This is the question you will ask yourself throughout the film. <br /> <br /> Kevin Spacey is just amazing, as is Jeff Bridges. You can not beat that kind of actor anymore with a little humor sometimes. Some of Kevin Spaceys' actions in this movie are very funny. When he was in the tree, for example, and when he was talking to the mental patient "queen," he hid half of his face against the wall and looked at him. <br /> <br /> To put it simply From the beginning, you will be hooked and if you really like the theater, you will not be disappointed. <br /> <br /> A solid at 85%.
