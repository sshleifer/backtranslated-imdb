All the guys that Liv Tyler meets lose their heads, no, of course, without a little encouragement from Liv. Liv is at its best, with Matt Dillon at the top of the list. Interesting initial premise, telling the story from the point of view of each dupe, degenerates into a sitcom style finale (a bit like Blame It On Rio, with which it has more than a few similarities). It's worth looking at anyway.
