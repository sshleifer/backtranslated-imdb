Breathtaking at its best, intriguing at worst, Francis Ford Coppala's revolutionary epic 'Apocalypse Now' is one of the most iconic and celebrated films of the twentieth century and, in my opinion, the greatest representation cinematographic never devoted to American involvement in Vietnam. <br /> <br /> Apocalypse Now is what sets me apart from other films of the same genre. Growing up as a moviegoer and having a special interest in war films, I have seen many films that have tried to portray Vietnam's "images" and "feelings", but fail to do so. Films such as "Hamburger Hill" and "We Were Soldiers" fall into the category of attempting to capture the atmosphere of Vietnam by describing "heroic battles" that, most often, are tainted by the zeal of Hollywood film production. . <Br/> <br /> In 'Apocalypse now' there are no battles, no heroes or villains, nothing in the film suggests that it is intended to reflect the image of Vietnam through the physical aspects of the war. Rather, it is a film that explores and powerfully explores the human psyche when it is tormented by the absolute "horror" of what was the darkest military conflict of the previous century. <br /> <br /> the cast of actors (in particular Martin Sheen's taciturn Captain Willard interpretation), as well as the spectacular cinematography (filmed in the Philippines), which provides crucial realism in the background of movie, make "Apocalypse Now" an unforgettable epic. <br /> <br /> Evoking a myriad of emotions and leaving us with a whirlwind of mediation, "Apocalypse Now" is not for the cheerful viewer. It is a masterpiece that requires multiple viewing to be fully appreciated.
