George Sanders playing the Saint for the penultimate time did a good job with a good script - with the usual good RKO cast. It's also a non-Charteris story, bristling with murder and good humor. <br /> <br /> Topic 1: In New York, police inspector Fernack, a friend of Templar, is plunged into a corruption scandal and is disgraced - ST comes from London to try to clear things up . So far, it's simple and enjoyable - but is there really more than $ 90,000 in the world? Thread 2: Another story where a woman takes her revenge on the people who murdered her brother, Wendy Barrie manages to get rid of evil men and to make the Saint fall in love with her. Including a villain who was under their direct protection and in Fernack's cellar - there is a frightening shot of him (dead and looking) and watching them in a car when they bring him back to where they had him . Paul Guilfoyle, in the role of Pearly Gates, should have assumed to have been homosexual in this room - as evidenced by the dressing gown at the beginning and the last seductive comment of ST that he thought to keep him as a pet - and the did also for "Palm Springs"! Jonathan Hale played the game as usual at Fernack, but this time with such a defeated attitude that what he really needed was a good slap from Templar to animate him. <br /> <br /> Hays office also made sure you get the right image, all the threads are attached without any straggly pieces. It's worth looking for all of us who love this kind of thing, but if Val Kilmer's version is your criterion, do not worry.
