Recently finally available on DVD (11/11/08), Severo Pérez's film ... and the Earth that did not swallow it (1994) is based on one of the most esteemed and most discussed novels of the Chicano literature. Tomás Rivera ... and that the Earth did not devour him (1972) is still generally recognized by many critics and serious readers as the classic novel Chicano. Originally written in the Spanish feature of South Texas and also translated into English, Rivera's novel continues to be an indispensable presence in the Chicano literary landscape. <br /> <br /> Perez's film, originally produced as a much-loved production of the American Playhouse PBS, took some time to be released on DVD. One can only wonder about this question because its high quality is not a problem. The film, and now the DVD, remains, to my knowledge, the only film adaptation of any novel on Chicano and is clearly a tribute to the incredible power of the Earth. This cinematic version also strikes an exceptionally deep nerve that is, in my opinion, both specifically ethnic, and also generally universal. Doubts about the Earth could perhaps arise because it is too "ethnic", too foreign to a current American base, too much of an independent art "foreign", too limited in economic resources. Yet, in my opinion, in his version of art, Perez connects very effectively, artistically, and creates a highly nuanced portrait of a migrant chicano community that focuses on everyday family life. With respect to a production made with relatively limited economic resources, his fine cinematographic work and his haunting music go far beyond the funds available. The simple viewing of the film highlights the artistic value of this film (or this DVD). <br /> <br /> In short, the Earth did not swallow it, depicting in a neo-naturalistic way the critical situation, the suffering and the desperate migrant workers migrating to Chicano as they follow the cultures of northern Texas in Minnesota in 1952, to the north. Local priests bless the crowded and overloaded vehicles of these Chicano workers who can no longer find work in the area and must follow the agricultural path of the migrant worker to the north. This Chicano community, like the Steinbeck Joads in The Grapes of Wrath from the Depression era, is an epic tide, driven by economic need, survival instinct, anguished despair, and ultimately a shimmering faith. sentence. Tribute to these peoples of the earth, collective hero, the DVD is centered on a focal family. The most emblematic is a young protagonist of the family, a boy of about 12 years old. This work also works as a bildungsroman. In the end, the sense of identification of the viewer is generated by the protagonist's experiences, subjectivity, and struggles. Poverty, alienation, child labor, illness (sunstroke and pregnancy-related death), discrimination, school absenteeism (the boy escapes the bullying of discrimination is lying in a charming and peaceful cemetery) are laid bare as a fact ?? again, also symbolically. Worse still, the problematic conflict between the young and his mother goes beyond socio-economic and political conflicts, into deeper areas of psychology and metaphysics. In a desperate but materially translated struggle, the youth fights against his mother, an archetypal traditionalist American-Mexican representative of the will of God, contented with prayer, resignation, consolation and acceptance. The rebellious youth can not believe in a god who would allow such evil and suffering to be visited. How can God be so cruel, he asks, since his little sister is certainly innocent and likely to cause serious illness in the fields? At this point, the boy has to overcome even more formidable obstacles than poverty and discrimination. The problems now include death, doubt, hopelessness and lack of meaning. And he has few resources at his disposal: strength of character, strength of will, intelligence, and a powerful survival instinct. In this desperate but materially translated struggle, the nameless youth, the central figure, feels the need to persist, to achieve a keen sense of meaning and to hope for a renewed and strengthened life force that can serve as a source of inspiration. inspiration for Chicanos and others. <br /> <br /> This hard battle uses a plot device that has just been evoked by the original work to link the episodic work: missing migrant workers from Mexico who leave no trace of their death, although this DVD does not deal with Mexican but Mexican-American migrant workers. Extremely existential work: anguish and despair; A quest; a focus on a project; and redemption - all under the auspices of free will in spite of deterministic socio-economic and religious circumstances. <br /> <br /> Perez has a long list of credits, mostly as a documentary filmmaker. His many awards are confirmatory. Producer Paul Espinosa is also known and has also been honored for his work. In fact, the 1994 film won and won many awards: first place, public favorite at the Santa Barbara Film Festival in 1995; first place at the Cairo Film Festival; and a number of other deserved awards. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this film and this DVD, Earth, from Perez, is the best film on Chicano made.
