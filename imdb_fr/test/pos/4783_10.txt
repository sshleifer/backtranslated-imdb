It was the first published Mickey Mouse cartoon and the first cartoon with sound. It was based on a silent movie called "Steamboat Bill, Jr." featuring Buster Keaton. At the beginning of Mickey, Mickey did not speak and did not wear gloves. He could just whistle and play music. The song he played was "Turkey in the straw", using several barnyard animals as musical instruments. He plays the teeth of a cow like a xylophone and he plays the teats of a suckling sow like an accordion keyboard. Captain Pete, however, is very angry and forces Mickey to peel potatoes in the kitchen. Pete's parrot flies to the window and orders him to peel the potatoes. Mickey throws a half-peeled potato on the parrot and laughs, closing the drawing. I was able to record this drawing on tape and I really like it. I think Disney shorts are way better than feature films.
