I did not know what to expect. I have always considered Bam Margera and CKY's crew as a team of pawns dedicated to doing stupid things for entertainment. I did not know they could act. But everyone who has played in this movie has performed well. The hilarity of the "aaaaagh!" The scene blends perfectly with the depression of Ryan Dunn and his revenge against his ex-girlfriend. Sometimes, some scenes from the movie seem useless, but at the same time they are fun. I recommend it to anyone who likes to laugh but this movie may not appeal to those who prefer detailed stories and a series of twists.
