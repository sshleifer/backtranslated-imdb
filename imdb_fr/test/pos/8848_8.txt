At a time when almost all the great horror movies of the '60s and' 70s are redone for today's clueless audiences of horror acts, it's instructive to go back to THE THING's opus of John Carpenter, 1982, remake - of one of the director's favorite childhood movies, the 1951 Howard Hawks sci-fi horror classic THE THING FROM EXTER SPACE. Although Carpenter's film was not as important initially as at the box office when it was released in mid-1982, it has since attracted a huge number of fans. <br /> <br /> In fact, Carpenter's film is less a remake of Hawks' film than it is a reshuffle, because it returns to the original idea posed by the source material, namely the story of John W. Campbell "Who Goes There?", In which an American science crew in Antarctica is threatened by an alien who changes its thawed form of ice after 100,000 years. Kurt Russell, who played for Carpenter in the films ELVIS (1979) and ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK (1981), directs a cast of outstanding character actors, including Keith David, Donald Moffat, Richard Dysart and Richard Masur, in This film A complete exploration of paranoia as a "thing" that changes shape and arrives for the first time in their camp in the form of a guide dog that a Norwegian team tries to kill, takes care of each of them. It will not be long before everyone in the camp starts to be suspicious of his neighbor. The end of the film, in which Russell and David are the only ones left, presents a troubling and disturbing ambiguity reminiscent of codas similar to THE BIRDS and STRAW DOGS. <br /> Almost universally, when the subject To buy THE THING, the focus is on the extremely bloody special effects makeup, as well as on exotic patterns created by Rob Bottin, who had worked with Carpenter on the classic of THE FOG horror movie of 1980, and Joe Dante's 1981 werewolf movie, THE HOWLING. These effects are indeed quite spectacular and graphic, and even today, they can also be quite disconcerting. But all this would make the Carpenter film an epic upscale film if direction, history and acting were not up to par. and thankfully, all of them are. When not focusing on the extremely horrific transformation sequences, Carpenter creates suspense in the same Hitchcock-influenced way as the one that inspired his previous films HALLOWEEN and THE FOG, with filmmaker Dean Cundey's shooting, especially in the corridors of the station. Help me. The acting game enhances an already fine script adaptation by Bill Lancaster; Ennio Morricone, whose work on the classic Italian spaghetti westerns of the 60s by director Sergio Leone is well known to everyone, including of course Carpenter himself. THE WHIT also presents other visual effects of Albert Whitlock (who worked on many of Hitchcock's films, including THE BIRDS), and Roy Arbogast, who collaborated with CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THIRD GENRE and JAWS 2. <br> > Carpenter's The film was not what it could have been because Universal decided to release this graphic shock just two weeks after the release of ET: THE EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL (The EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL) Steven Spielberg (so it is not surprising that critics and the public are in favor of Spielberg). excellent film on Carpenter also excellent but extremely different). In addition, the bulk of the horror movie business in 1982 was taken over by another film produced by Spielberg, POLTERGEIST. As a result, at a cost of $ 15 million, THE THING suffered from the lack of attention of his time. <br /> <br /> However, over time, many people came to see Carpenter's film for what it is - a combination of sci-fi and horror, brilliant but extremely intelligent, made with much talent and a true understanding of psychological paranoia at the heart of its history. While still horrible, THE THING should not be forgotten for both the skill with which the story is assembled and for the bloody extraterrestrial creations and makeup effects; because it's the ability to tell stories and the suspense that makes it so memorable in the final analysis.
