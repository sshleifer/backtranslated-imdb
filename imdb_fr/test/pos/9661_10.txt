My teacher made this movie. It's a new start. Look at it and you will not notice it's a Romanian film. The old boring style is gone. Now it's something else. A post-revolutionary film. He uses the latest imaging technology and mostly unknown artists. They are unique. You will not even know you are watching, you will simply be transferred beyond the screen and you will feel each image. Do not miss it, pay attention to the plot but do not ignore the details. They make the difference between this film and other Romanian films. You will hear music at some point. It's representative for some of us, but it does not represent us. Please, just keep your head upright and leave your body free.
