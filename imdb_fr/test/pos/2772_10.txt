I love that movie. is it more broadcast? what can I do to put it back on the air because I miss this film, when will this film be broadcast again? I really like this movie. does anyone know how long it has been on Disney? It's been a very long time and I'm so sick of waiting! I want to see Susie again. I swear that they're pulling out all the good movies and playing new stupid gay movies that are fake and lingering. I miss this film, I want a star, Kazaam with Shaquille O'neil and many others. Where have all the good films gone? I want to recover them. I miss all the good movies and they do not have them anymore. if anyone finds out that Susie Q or a good old Disney movie is coming out, please let me know, my email is girlygirl148@aol.com girlygirl (no space) 148. thanks and i hope you want this movie too. have a nice day
