All the characters in this caricature were hilarious. Norman, the Viking guardian, had some memorable phrases and the master of the skull, the villain, always swore to kill Max with some insane chuckles. The writing is the best. <br /> <br /> I was stuck to the decor when it happened when I was younger. If they came out with a DVD of all the episodes they made, I would have to buy it. This and a cartoon of Conan the Barbarian are the ones I miss most of my childhood. I think these drawings are the most unknown of all the great drawings. I used to watch these drawings on Channel 13 in the Los Angeles area. <br /> <br /> I remember that the owl was always scared, warning Max that he had problems and that he was the chosen one. Max did not believe he was the chosen one and always gave the owl problems. Norman was less talkative but his simplicity was funny. He said things like "I eat monsters at breakfast" when he was fighting them. And then, when he was fighting zombies, he said, "I eat zombies for ... too bad." Comedy and action classic cartoons. <br /> <br /> I vote they re-issue Mighty Max.
