Broadcast on television in 1982 from a Los Angeles production, this is probably the best example of a filmed musical you are likely to encounter. Released on DVD in 2004 in a remastered digital transfer, it is pretty stunning. Hearn and Lansbury give the performances of their lives and the rest of the distribution is obviously caught up in the generated electricity. Of course, it is Sondheim's music and lyrics that make this possible. If anyone doubts that he is one of the "greats" of American musical form, listen to this. The scenery is nil, as it should be, and adept to allow the fast scene changes required and the cameras capture the action without erasing the fact that it is a theatrical production. Mrs. Lovett's cake shop, with the upstairs barber shop, is a central, mobile, and renewable platform. Around it, various porticoes and escalators allow the rest of the action to unfold. The brutal story of injustice leading to vengeance, murder and chaos is generously spiced with dark humor and comical moments. Sondheim does for hairdressers what Hitchcock did for the showers! An important work of the American musical theater is presented here with an electrifying performance.
