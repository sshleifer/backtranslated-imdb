The Battle of Elderbrush Gulch was Griffith's longest and most expensive short film. We see him trying to perfect the large-scale action scene that would be needed in his feature films, bringing together all the elements that made the success of his previous short films. <br /> <br /> Griffith uses the Western format ?? already the ideal backdrop for pure and straightforward action plays? as a setting for his first epic battle. Like many westerns of the 1910s, the starting point is a character from the east heading west ?? a device that may have helped to help the public sink into the wilderness, and here, these people from eastern eastern countries, are a pair of children, which was important for the type of image he develops. For Griffith, we could not act without a feeling of vulnerability and he was hiding it here, with the children of the East, Lillian Gish, mother distraught the "only baby in town" and even some puppies threatened. to be on the menu of the Indians. <br /> <br /> All this paves the way for an extremely complex and superimposed sequence of actions, mixing the heroine-trapped scenario and the journey to the rescue with Griffith's battles He depicts since his first pictures of the Civil War in 1909. It's a phenomenal amount, and Griffith is very good at maintaining the exhilarating pace throughout his work and keeping everything coherent and logical. However, juggling x elements in an action sequence does not necessarily make this much more exciting, however clever, and Griffith has created better finals soaked with tension before and after it. <br /> But even an image of Griffith as strongly focused on action would not be devoid of drama, characterization and atmosphere. In The Battle at Elderbrush Gulch, emotions are treated briefly but economically. First we have the scene in which the waifs leave their house. The cart on which they are moving away from the camera, using depth and distance to express their distance from security and civilization. An equally effective scene is one in which we are introduced to Gish's young family, Bobby Harron and their baby. The townspeople coo on the precious tot, then wander, revealing that two Indians were watching in the background, adding a sinister sign of danger. <br /> <br /> Of course, many viewers today have pointed to the offensive portrait of Native Americans by Elderbrush Gulch (in contrast to the more sympathetic Red Man's View), but perhaps all that is not what it seems. First, take a look at the vest of the Indian Chief's son ?? he is black and covered with brilliant white dots. It looks like a pearly king jacket, perhaps slightly modified for the warmer climate. Now, look at the "war dance" that they later interpret ?? he has a certain air of "brown mother's knees". They are not Indians, they are cockneys! So, it should not be offensive to Native Americans. Just cockneys.
