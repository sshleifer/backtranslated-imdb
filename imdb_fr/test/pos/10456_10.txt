I saw this in a theater in 1982. I was expecting a stupid T & A movie. That's not what I have. <br /> <br /> These are basically three teenagers who are trying to have sex. We have the jokes and sex scenes expected - but, for once, they are rather funny! <br /> <br /> Yeah, they are stupid but I appreciated them all the same. In addition, there was a surprising amount of male nudity. <br /> <br /> Then the film, halfway through, takes a dramatic turn when one of the boys (played brilliantly by Lawrence Monoson) falls in love with a girl. Then the jokes stop and the situation becomes very dark. I will not reveal what is going on, but I was very surprised by the sudden turn of events. The film covers very important topics and deals with them with realism and intelligence. And his end is really heartbreaking. <br /> <br /> I give him a 10 because it's probably one of the best teen sex comedies / dramas ever made. It mixes fantasy and realism and it works! What more can you ask for? In addition, he has an excellent soundtrack.
