The film "Everything is illuminated" comes from the director for the first time, Liev Schreiber, adapting the first novel by Jonathan Safran Foer. The book was ambitious and sprawling, its magico-realistic elements and its living use of a language apparently impossible to represent on screen. The film, wisely, tries less. Although the final result is not as original as the novel, it is still a film completed on a strange road trip in Eastern Europe or, as one of the characters would have said, "a very rigid". <br /> <br /> This character is Alex (Eugene Hutz), a young Ukrainian man who loves American pop culture but does not seem to understand the English language. Nevertheless, his grandfather (the Russian actor Boris Leskin), who runs a travel agency serving American Jews, convinces him to be a translator for Jonathan (Elijah Wood). Jonathan is studying the background of his family and is particularly looking for the woman who saved her grandfather from the Nazis. More than one family secret is revealed during their quest. <br /> <br /> Jonathan of the film (not to be confused with the author of the novel) is a semi-kleptomaniac nut who steals the prostheses of his own grandmother's collection of "family things". The serious, calm and caring manner of Wood is very suitable in this role. Hutz makes an impressive debut as Alex, a casual and laid-back man. His mismanagement is hilarious, but he is also able to draw the growing consciousness of the character. The dog Mikki is very funny as a madman of Sammy Davis Jr. and one of the few movie dogs I have ever seen that is neither too cute nor precocious. <br /> <br /> "Everything is illuminated" The story of the Holocaust eventually becomes a human scale, asking us to remember it not as a general event but as a million small tragedies specific. Recalling a European film, he also wonders about the consequences of past events for young people like Jonathan and Alex. With its original perspective, powerful performance and stunning graphics, "Everything is Illuminated" is great work for a novice, and hopefully Schreiber will continue to direct films.
