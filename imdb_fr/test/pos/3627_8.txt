The sub-genre "old dark house" that dominated the first talkies never fails to disappoint when we see the old ones today. Here is one that contains so many suspicious characters that you have to wonder how they will be able to solve all the problems in the 6 reel time. The Twisted Circle is a gang of counterfeiters and thieves who have decided to take revenge on Colonel Walters (Berton Churchill) who sent one of their ranks to jail. They decide that he must die the same evening. Meanwhile, the colonel's group, the Sphinx Club, is determined to protect him at all costs. That does not please Thelma (Irene Purcell), the fiancee of the club member Brand Osborne (Ben Lyon, deceased from the big budget HELL'S ANGELS (1930)) who wants him to leave the club and stop putting his life in danger . The brand promises to resign after saving the colonel's life. Everyone is heading to the newly purchased Walters Manor on Long Island to wait for the murderer. <br /> <br /> The Colonel may be the new owner of Melody Manor, but it's a dark old house with eccentric neighbors (like local Raymond Hatton hermit) and maybe even a ghost. At the top of the list, Zasu Pitts is Nora, the cleaning lady who expects to see a spirit on every street corner. Add a cop (James Gleason) who is certain that Brand is a criminal and we have a picture full of action and surprises. <br /> <br /> You will immediately notice that the scriptwriter was running out of imagining too many dialogues because many characters are constantly repeating the same lines. Yoganda (C. Henry Gordon), a Hindu mystic (with whom the movies of this era were charged), says "The evil is on the way". many times and I lost track of how often Mrs. Pitts said, "Something always happens to someone!" There are many suspects and two characters (Mr Gleason as stereotype of the idiot cop and Roscoe Karns as a friend of Mr Lyon) who serve as comedy. The house itself has a phantasmagorical aspect (in fact, I think the same set was used in THE PHANTOM (1931)) with many secret passages and violin music coming out of empty rooms, but we do not get never really danger. It may be because no one in the film, and I mean nobody, is exactly what they seem to be. Everything goes well in the end though; but going into details will spoil it for you. <br /> <br /> Watch carefully Robert Frazer (WHITE ZOMBIE) and Frank Reicher (best remembered as KING KONG captain Engelhorn) suspects. <br /> <br /> THE CIROKED CIRCLE is a funny movie. Some aspects of the plot are predictable and many others not. I think you will appreciate it.
