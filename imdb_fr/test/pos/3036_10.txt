I'll do it short and nice. No wonder you have no use for this movie. This is a story about the power, beauty and possibilities inherent in meaningful education. Based on your pathetically composed comments, I can see that your own education has been terribly neglected ... or worse ... completely lost. Your comments are those of a truly ignorant person. I would advise you to do something about this disease ... but in your case, I think it's probably too late. I hope you do not intend to get into the teaching profession (especially in cinematography) because you could only cause damage. Oh ... one last tip. In the future, if you intend to write more opinion pieces, you should really re-read your work. This will make people take you more seriously.
