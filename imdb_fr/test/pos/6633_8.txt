A very credible and disturbing film depicting the effects of war on the general public, Shame gives us a frightening understanding of Ingmar Bergman's beliefs. The absence of color and sound (as in a soundtrack) helps to give the film a more realistic feeling. There is no soft or hard light, or a variety of viewing angles that give the story a charming or dramatic effect. Everything is very simply described as it really would be. The scenario was sometimes confusing, but perhaps to give an idea of ​​the characters' state of mind ?? how do they know now what's happening and why. The simplicity of the film made it somewhat boring, but I could understand how the director was trying not to glorify the story and the points. He described the events and the harsh and disturbing effects of the war. At first, the characters were introduced and displayed as content with clearer settings and very long shots. When suddenly the war hit them, they were much darker and quieter with less intimate blows. Bergman did a good job in allowing us to be consumed by the war ourselves and presenting an image that corresponded so well with the war. Although the scenario is not too impressive, so is the film's content.
