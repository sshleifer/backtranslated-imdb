"Duckman" is an excellent show. I saw it for the first time when I was 10 at the time and after school, I rushed home and turned on Comedy Central. I saw a drawing called "Duckman" and I loved it! It's such a funny and cool show. It was created by Klasky-Csupo, great creators of cartoons. They hosted some of my favorite shows, such as "The Simpsons" and "Rugrats". <br /> <br /> I have seen many episodes of this show and I think they are all very funny and adorable. The dubbing actors have also done a great job in repeating the characters. <br /> <br /> I wish that Comedy Central could bring back this show, with "The Critic" and "Dilbert". <br /> <br /> But it's a great Comedy Central show. Great job, Klasky-Csupo!
