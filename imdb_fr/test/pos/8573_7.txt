If you watched this movie for nudity (as I did), you will not be disappointed. I could have done without the scammer and the bear. A bottomless nudity could have been shown but for what I think, H.O.T.S. must be the best of its kind. <br /> <br /> This is not the kind of film that could have been done today, which is a shame because it's the kind of movie that deserves to be watched at this time. I would take any day a stupid nudity on crucial points of the plot. <br /> <br /> It is unfortunate that the DVD does not include supplements, but as they had not been filmed it is understandable. I would have liked to know more about the shooting of the film, especially the place where they shot the football game at the end.
