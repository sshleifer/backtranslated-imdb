If you liked this movie, be sure to watch the others made by Hrebejk - you'll be thrilled. This is unfortunately not the best, but millions of times better than a mainstream movie. He explores relationships, especially abusive relationships, with strong, gentle moments and excellent interpretation. Conspiracy inconsistencies, clich√©s and hollow moments spoil the overall effect. For the previous comment and his comments on the Czech psyche: an interesting approach, but I do not see this film become a Czech blockbuster. These people are rather spoiled by their filmmakers {see also articles of Sverak, Gedeon} and this one is a little late.
