I really do not see why people do not seem to like this movie. I found it very amusing (of course, being the star of the superb Laura Fraser is a bonus!). When I first heard about it, I thought it would look like a "strange Science" with an inverted role. As far as possible, it's true, but there's a turning point I really have not seen coming. Having seen the trailer on the DVD (which I had not seen before watching the movie), I saw that the "twist" is actually shown in the trailer! Very strange. <br /> <br /> As the film progresses, the comparison between "Weird Science" goes less and less, and I think it's the best of both films. Some scenes do not work very well, but they are compensated by the enthusiasm of the young cast. <br /> <br /> In summary, I would say that this is a good example of Sci. -i chick flick, and I do not think I've seen much!
