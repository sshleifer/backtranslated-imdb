Serendipity. I thought I was leaving badly, bringing home the wrong dvd in the case of "The Intruder". The staff of the rental shops! So I did not want to see this movie but I'm glad I did. Probably, my chosen film would not have been a slice film as superb as this delicious and delicate taste of what independents, be they American or European, can do together. Seven years apart, two heroin sisters embark on fantastic journeys through the post-student demo of the early 1970s / Baader-Meinhof Europe. Sumptuously shot in the Algarve, Portugal; and in Berlin, Paris and Amsterdam (recalling the atmosphere of the exterior shots of Paul Verhoeven's first masterpiece, "The Fourth Man"), Brewster, Diaz and especially Christopher Ecclestone played touchingly. , capturing the ephemeral emotions of these characters as they confront their relationships and see their idealized images of each other and break. A film with a lot of refinement and taste. Not for the fans of Arnie Commando, which probably explains why the critic from above is so far from the target in "his" statement that it is a girly movie. Criteria Daft. Bad too. It's worth experimenting.
