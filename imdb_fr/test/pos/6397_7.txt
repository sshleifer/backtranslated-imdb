This show was bad when it started. The first actress who played the girl did not fit the role, the writing was random and Damon Wayans CLEARLY was not comfortable doing such a family show. The chemistry between him and Tisha Cambell (they are long-time friends, as well as all Wayans clans with Tisha's husband, Will Smith and Jada Pinkett) worked, so they reorganized the series. Once she came back, they remade the girl, made her son a lot silly (at the Eric of "Boy Meets World") and made the youngest girl a genius ... (later, they told him have given a great boyfriend to make comic appearances.). The show, even though it is often composed of roller coasters ranging from the supreme buffoonery to the old-fashioned, holds the line enough to keep it as a show that Damon Wayans is comfortable in his skin on the set (especially since the principal writers, directors and consultants were ALL members of the Wayans family) AND in his character. Once everyone had been in the show for a while, they worked with each cast member and were able to make a funny show on the air. <br /> <br /> However, there are TOO MANY antics, too much on the ups and downs, and often too much chaos in the Kyle family's life. They created Junior TOO STUPID, they also made the eldest daughter an attractive and clumsy idiot from time to time and the youngest girl was not even spared by the writers. I feel they jumped on the shark and signed the death agreement when Junior put his girlfriend pregnant, she moved in and he married her and her parents were introduced (the character of the father of the wife of Junior makes me win by thinking of him). The series was fun ... but it was a UPN show on ABC if it made sense to the reader. <br /> <br /> Reruns are pretty funny, but I'm relieved it's over ... there was nowhere left to go with her. When it's bad, it's REALLY BAD. This tends to be a critical moment, but at least he was a black man who had a sitcom doing syndication on a major network .. who can say that for themselves now? (Given the merger of CW and the "brown-outs" on television networks lately). A.
