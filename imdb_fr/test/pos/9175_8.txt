A chick movie that guys still like - Yes! Wonderful. Now I can have fun, enjoy the company of my daughter and not feel that I can not wait for the movie to end! Light - but fun. Great thing. Whatever you do, do not miss the extras of the DVD. It is also an excellent "blind date" file. Will Smith does well in this - even if it's clear - he's doing very well. The film is a bit slow - do not expect too much action - the laughs are there - and the message too - but the timing is a bit slow. Use the low moments to whisper or kiss - this will accelerate. The end makes the good times feel good. Above all, expect a fun and light cuisine - and expect excellent staging from the side actors - they will make the film. The twists of the plot are predictable - but it's a date change, so get the popcorn refills in the kitchen - and do not make him pause. Count on more dates after this movie - she will want to see what will be the next step. Do not forget Hitch's advice !!! <br /> <br /> Enjoy.
