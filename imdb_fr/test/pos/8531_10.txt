You must love this movie! I mean, what other Swedish movie splatter could be so bad, weird and totally cruel ... The whole movie is stuffed with a kind of strange humor, like this: The old cencoreguy blows his head and the boss wipes the blood off his glasses and says in a wicked voice: - Your fired !!! wouppie !!!
