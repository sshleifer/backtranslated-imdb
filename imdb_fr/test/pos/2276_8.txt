I saw this film at the 2005 Toronto International Film Festival. <br /> <br /> According to Jonathan Safran Foer's novel, Everything Is Illuminated is the first film by actor Liev Schreiber. Schreiber also wrote the script. In the film, Jonathan (Elijah Wood) obsessively collects items from his family, from toothbrushes to fasteners, to pieces of paper, which he then seals into ziploc bags and pins against a wall. from his house to record his family's antecedents. But the space for his grandfather is remarkably bare. All that Jonathan really has about him is a jewel and an old picture of him with a woman who hid him from the Nazis during the Second World War. Jonathan decides to go in search of the woman in Ukraine, thank her and learn more about her grandfather. <br /> <br /> His quest is facilitated by two or three characters who run a tourism business for Jews, including a young man obsessed with Western culture (Eugene Hutz), his grandfather (Boris Leskin) who thinks himself blind and who perhaps has memories and demons of the war, as well as the observer dog of temperament who sees him of his temperament. <br /> <br /> The script effectively combines humor and drama as the three characters travel through the countryside in search of Jonathan's grandfather's city, delving deeper and deeper into memories of the past. The best performance probably comes from Eugene Hutz, played by Alex Jr., who begins the film as a break-dance loafer dressed in a tracksuit, just for fun, but who evolves even more because not only Jonathan, but all characters acquire their own enlightenment. . <br /> <br /> After the film, Liev Schreiber, Elijah Wood and Eugene Hutz attended a very humorous Q & A session: <br /> <br /> - Schreiber was very close to his grandfather , who was a Ukrainian immigrant who died in 1993. He then began to write to write his memories on paper. During this time, he was invited to read Foer's short story, The Very Rigid Search, from the still unpublished novel. Schreiber was blown away by the quality of the writing, claiming that Foer had done in 15 pages what Schreiber had tried to do in 107. Schreiber approached Foer and they talked about their grandfathers, their culture, their movies and the nature of short-term memory. America; in the end, Foer agreed to let Schreiber adapt the book. <br /> <br /> - Schreiber's project was supposed to be a road movie, but the book presents a parallel narrative that is an imagined chronological story of the 500-year-old city of Trochenbrod; Given his budget and his limitations as a filmmaker, he said he would leave that to Milos Forman and take the trip on the road instead. This imaginary chronology pushed him to make the film in the first place, the idea that "a past imagined with love was as precious as a past recalled with precision". <br /> <br /> - Schreiber said the movie was a series of happy accidents. After looking for an unsuccessful actor in Ukraine, he was walking down the Lower East Side in New York when he saw a poster depicting a centaur woman, topless at the waist, with a crazy Cossack riding her. Under the name, the name Gogol Bordello is a group of Ukrainian punk gypsies. <br /> <br /> Eugene Hutz then goes back to history. He had never pursued the profession of musician, it was his first passion. One day, a friend gave him the book, and he thought it was written in a way similar to the way he wrote music. screw sentences / syntax, the language is mine. <br /> <br /> Later, they received a call from a production company looking for Eastern, medieval but modern music. Hutz met Schreiber and he soon discovered that the film was based on the book he had just read. Shortly after, Schreiber asked Hutz what he thought of Alex and if he could do the character by chance. <br /> <br /> - Foer and Schreiber talked about the movie in the fall of 2001, shortly thereafter. the events of 11 September. They were both in Europe at the time and spoke about the derogatory remarks they heard about the Americans, which led Schreiber to try to find an articulate American who could challenge the stereotype that Europeans have. Americans. Someone who was clumsy, vulnerable, flawed, innocent and was looking for a story beyond the borders of his own country. Schreiber started thinking about who it was, and Elijah appeared. <br /> <br /> One of Schreiber's inspirations as a filmmaker is Emir Kusturica (I think it's his person, who also directed a segment of the movie The Invisible Children) who said "you do not do not look for the actors, you are looking for people ". Schreiber said there was something about which Elijah was his generosity of spirit and sincere kindness as a human being, which appeared in the cinema. Schreiber said that eyes are important when trying to articulate a character who is an observer and that, if "eyes are the gates of the soul, those of Elijah are garage doors". <br /> <br /> - Elijah Wood had fun asking a question about the similarities between his character, Kevin in Sin City, and Jonathan in this movie, both of them being somehow a blank slate on which emotions are projected. Wood replied that Jonathan may seem motionless and seemingly emotionless, but that everything is in his observations, his experiences with other characters and the environment in which he was. <br /> <br /> - On the differences between direction and writing: Schreiber said he liked to write a lot more and he jokingly called it "hell". After the death of his grandfather, Schreiber began to think about how to preserve a sense of history and of himself. is it content-based or not, or is it good to interpret the work of others? He said he liked the exercise of determining what is emotional for you and important to you.
