You must be terribly patient to watch a movie with such flat and insane dubbers that you wonder why everyone was talking about it when WHISTLING IN THE DARK opened up to such an enthusiastic audience in the 1940s. In addition to a few simple lines and ordinary visual gags, the plot is as far-fetched as the stories that The Fox (Red Skelton) tells his radio audience. One has to wonder why one might think that he could propose a concrete solution on how to commit the perfect crime and get away with it. But then, how comedy is unrealistic. <br /> <br /> But if you're a real Red Skelton fan and you look back at how the comedies were made in the '40s, you can at least appreciate the kind cast supporting it. Ann Rutherford and Virginia Gray are kind to her love and Conrad Veidt, as always, is an interesting villain. One of his most amusing moments is his reaction when Skelton explains the mysteries of wearing a turban. "I never knew that," he recalls, impressed by a minor point that is smartly presented. <br /> <br /> In summary, a typical nonsense that requires accepting the lack of credibility and accepting the gags as they are. Not always easy for a discerning viewer, many of them simply fall flat, like many comedies of this era because the novelty of gags in sight and one-liners has simply disappeared.
