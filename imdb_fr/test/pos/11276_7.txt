I do not really know what to do with this movie. very weird, very artistic. This is not the kind of movie you watch because it has a plot or compelling characters. it's more like a movie that you can not stop watching because of the awfully fascinating things happening on the screen. even if, the first time my wife looked at it, she could not cross it ... too disturbing for her. short a bit long, but nevertheless interesting to watch for those who are interested in very dark films.
