Kathleen Beller, a schoolgirl with doe eyes, is found beaten and raped in the first scenes of this TV movie. The film <br /> <br /> then recalls the few days before the rape, because Beller is harassed by a stranger. <br /> <br /> Beller, Scott Colomby and herself Robin Mattson, best friend, and Dennis Quaid <br /> <br /> already have two dating dates. Beller's anxious parents, <br /> <br /> laid-back Tony Bill and Blythe Danner, a strident man, are waiting at home wringing their hands <br /> <br /> and so on. Immediately, the 1970s make their entry <br /> <br /> date, as young couples discuss romance and love <br /> <br /> "Three days of the Condor". <br /> <br /> Beller, an amateur photographer, begins to receive threatening notes <br /> <br /> in her locker at school. The filmmakers gave us wisely a whole bunch of suspects: Beller's new boyfriend, Mattson's boyfriend, Beller's father, Beller's ex-boyfriend, and what about that? /> <br /> Professor of photography too friendly who wants Beller <br /> a little sexier in his self-portraits? I knew who the rapist was <br /> <br /> because the video box from Worldvision Video shows a photo of <br /> <br /> the attack on the back of the cover, destroying any suspense <br> /> regard. <br /> <br /> Without revealing the identity of the attacker, Beller begins to receive <br /> <br /> harassing phone calls and ends up being raped. The movie <br /> <br /> then heads south as she does like Nancy Drew and secretly installs an accelerated camera to surprise the guy who tracks another student. <br /> <br /> Finally, filmmakers insist on Beller's <br /> <br /> hokey story about the lack of understanding of rape victims <br /> <br /> at this time. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The suspense is real, without going beyond the scary movies <br /> <br />. Beller is very good and watch it and <br /> <br /> Mattson's scene in an abandoned theater - both do a great job. The movie <br /> <br /> is full of familiar faces, including Ellen Travolta in a small role, <br /> <br /> and everyone is professional. <br /> <br /> This was done in 1978, and it shows. I am sure no one thought <br /> <br /> that this would be examined in 2001 by a supercritical horror movie fan <br /> <br /> who has to go to bed and get up early in the morning < morning, but some of the attitudes here are embarrassing. The teacher <br /> <br /> who tells Beller to be sexy is never forced to explain exactly what <br /> <br /> he had in mind. Today, if a high school teacher had said, <br /> <br /> it would have been a TV movie made for himself. <br /> <br /> After Beller rape, the rapist is still a part of his life, as warrants are issued, blah, blah, blah. There may be no case because <br /> <br /> Beller is not a virgin and can not prove that she was raped by <br /> <br /> she said . Many of these problems have been solved with <br /> <br /> modern technology and law enforcement efforts, but this movie <br /> <br /> obviously knew it would have a chance to contribute to the debate on reform. Rape is an act of violence that has not stopped, but efforts today to catch <br /> <br /> aggressors have a considerable head start on twenty four years ago. The problem <br /> <br /> is that the anti-rape angle is as glued as afterwards. Before that, we have a small, narrow suspense that has a real honest characterization before God. After rape, everything <br /> <br /> changes, whether in movies or for the better. <br /> <br /> I remember Beller in the 70s and 80s (and who could forget <br /> <br /> his revealing role in "The Betsy"), but she has not done anything since <br /> <br /> almost ten years. It's a shame because it was very good <br /> <br /> at that time. <br /> <br /> I will recommend "Are you alone at home ?!" on the basis of <br /> acting alone, with a sign of reluctance at least for the first two thirds of the film <br /> <br />. If you want to relive the 1970s for television, <br /> it's your cup of tablets. <br /> <br /> This has not been evaluated, but it contains physical violence, some <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> violence and some adult situations.
