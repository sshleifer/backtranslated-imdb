"Love is a multi-faceted thing" that takes place in Hong Kong from 1949 to 1950 and tells the story of the relationship between Mark Elliott, American white journalist, and Han Suyin, semi-European semi-European doctor. This story of a Métis love story was a pretty daring theme for the fifties and, as so often, Hollywood tried to soften the shock by pointing to a white actress as a woman supposed not to be Caucasian who falls in love with White. man, something that would be considered politically incorrect today, but that was quite acceptable at the time. (Think, for example, of Ava Gardner's casting in "Show Boat" or Natalie Wood's "West Side Story"). The setting of the story in a British colony was perhaps also a way to explore the issues in a way that would cause less controversy in America. Suyin loses her job in a Hong Kong hospital because her British superiors do not agree that she is going out with a white man, that she can not marry because her ex-wife will not grant her the divorce. As was sometimes the case, European colonialism has been condemned to some of America's failures. Imagine the fury that would have arisen if a similar film had been made about a black or Métis woman doctor in an Alabama hospital. <br /> <br /> In addition to racial issues, the film also raises questions of international politics, referring both to the Communist takeover in China and the outbreak of the Korean War. Han Suyin was a real person and a well-known author of the time. In reality, she tended to support Mao's communist regime, but here she is firmly anti-communist. However, it is not primarily a "themed" film about racism or politics, but rather a romance, a good example of what would have been called a "woman's portrait". These films, although mainly directed by male directors, were mainly intended for the female audience. From the woman's point of view, they dealt with love and romance - often unhappy - and had a strong feminine character in the lead role. The genre often provided roles for older actresses than the heroines of classic novels. The previous examples were normally in monochrome, but in the fifties, they generally used, as here, a lush and sumptuous color. <br /> <br /> Even if a Chinese or Eurasian actress would have been more convincing in her role, Jennifer Jones a very good job as Suyin. I found William Holden, as Mark, not very charismatic, but it does not matter, because Suyin is the dominant character. She is much more projected than Mark, and the film examines her family and professional life much more than her own. Even though Jennifer was still strikingly beautiful, she was in her thirties, a little older than most romantic heroines from movies of that period. Holden was about the same age, unusually in the fifties, when "boy-meets-girl" often meant "older man meets girl". <br /> <br /> The film is not particularly deep, but is well done with some attractive photography, especially that of Hong Kong itself, reflecting the growing trend in the fifties to take pictures outdoors rather than in the studio. It is rare that Hong Kong has been so beautiful. the view of a hill overlooking the city takes on a special meaning because it is there that Suyin and Mark go for their romantic assignments. The overall atmosphere is one of poignant and doomed romance, underscored by atmospheric photography and musical score, including one of the most memorable film themes ever written. 7/10
