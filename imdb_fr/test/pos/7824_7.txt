Sometimes you wake up late at night flipping through the stations, bored, and you want a light and fluffy romantic comedy that does not make you feel bipolar. And this film corresponds to this exact bill. Of course, the plot was torn off as early as the 1930s ... a writing as schmaltzy as Hallmark Greeting Card's legendary poetry, and the one-dimensional characters were played by a cast straight from Central Casting - and exactly what which I needed last night. <br /> <br /> Lauren Holly and Costas Mandylor have great chemistry together - I liked it in "Picket Fences" and I'm happy to say they still have it over 10 years later. Costas Mandylor, at 41, may still be one of the most beautiful men to have decorated the screens since Rudy Valentino kicked 80 years ago. RRROWRR! Bonus points for throwing this fun man who used to be on roller skates during this show on the lady of the comic strip. I always thought he was coming straight from a Hepburn-Grant comedy. BRAVO! <br /> <br /> Some people will probably say it's the most secretive movie piece of all time and I should probably agree - but come on! It's on the Hallmark Channel. What did you expect? Sit back, relax, eat sesame sticks and watch a cute little movie with two cute people with a bottle of Zinfandel. Believe me, you'll love and accept schmaltz a lot more, and then you'll fall asleep dreaming of Costas Mandylor swimming in a sea of ​​soaking chocolate while feeding you little feet with mint chocolate icing. Yummo! (PS Now, I'm craving little fours, THANK YOU MUCH, HALLMARK!) <br /> <br /> I really wish that the naughty girl was chosen with Rachel Ray, and maybe that overflowing food, Alton Brown announcer instead of scary guy with beard Van Dyk. Shudder! <br /> <br /> That would have made my night. But hey, take a look at "Just Desserts".
