Frank Horrigan (Clint Eastwood) is harassed by Mitch Leary (John Malkovich), an attentive terrorist who literally believes he will not be arrested. "John Kramer" (Tobin Bell), from the Saw series, is the modern favorite serial killer of all. Thanks to intelligent planning and influence, Frank is able to stop Mendoza (Bell). <br /> <br /> From this day forward, it's a series of lawsuits against the cat and the mouse. Malkovich is a great actor and incredibly versatile. Again, showing a different role in this film, it surprises me by its ability to exchange characters with the next movie. <br /> <br /> I've seen Malkovich play in Con Air as Cyrus, in mice and men like Lenny, the tragically challenged rabbit lover, to name a few. He plays the role of a very intelligent terrorist terrorist, very sane but convinced that he can escape his capture. <br /> <br /> Clint Eastwood does not like me at all. He is too old to really do much acting in movies, so the only thing he can really amaze you with is his ability to create dramatic scenes. The characters he embodies are simplistic and one-dimensional. <br /> <br /> Rene Russo interprets Eastwood's love interest for the film and seduces me with his support, which is actually more important than Eastwood's. <br /> <br /> Even though it may seem like an action blockbuster, it is relatively slow and plays in anticipation. You have to wait for the construction and the end and it will be profitable in the end. Along the way, you will be fascinated by the chemistry of Malkovich and Eastwood and their cat and mouse scenes.
