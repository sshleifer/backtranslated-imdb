This film was shot in the area where I grew up and live now. I personally know most of the owners of the different places used in the film. As a teenager, I worked in the fields surrounding the isolated road shown late in the movie with Ron Perlman, Jonathon Furr and the car. I am told that Jonathon Furr and Ben Allison are from North Carolina. I had the chance to see him at a local exhibition. During this screening, one of the people who helped select locations and secure accessories, such as the bus (1938 Greyhound) used in the film. The bus had no reverse and during the shooting, the driver had missed his stop several times and had to travel several kilometers to get back to the right point. These details of the technical problems added to my pleasure. The film accurately portrays life in this region during the Second World War. A film well done and I look forward to the availability of the DVD.
