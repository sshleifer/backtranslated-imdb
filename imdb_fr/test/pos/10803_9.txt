This film is more than the story of Danton. It was a Polish-French joint production filmed at the time of the beginning of the end of the Soviet system. This has probably helped to stimulate the trade union activity of the Solidarity movement. It is more about Poland in the 20th century than the French Revolution. Solidarity began the end of the system. This film itself is historical by its very existence .... the rest belongs to History. <br /> <br /> Robspiere, aka. totalitarian leaders. Danton, aka. Walensa. When you watch this film, you have to remember the snowball that started in Poland. <br /> <br /> In fact, it might be useful to see the superpower struggle within the only remaining superpower.
