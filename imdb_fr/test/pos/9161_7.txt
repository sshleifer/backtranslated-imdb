Well, the film focuses on the last days of a Russian regiment stationed in Afghanistan, before the withdrawal of troops in 1985. The film accurately describes the harsh reality of the Russian army that made it infamous: " dedovshina "(officers and NCOs physical harassment, beatings and humiliation of young recruits), mixed character of the war (you can trade with your enemy one day and kill him the next day), life of women at the front, documentations of scenes of Helicopter assaults and coffins welded and sent home in the C-130 Hercules class cargo lift Hercules with tracker to block Stinger missiles, fatigue, boredom, anti-war sentiment, emotion simply. There are some action scenes, but they are poorly done and often illogical, such as Major Bandura's suicidal march and turning his back on a 10-year-old boy armed with AK-47, his father. just killed. In addition, the heavy grenade launcher emerges from nowhere in the middle of a shootout in the mountains (and any half-lighted person knows that it is almost impossible to bump anyone with a launcher of 40 to 50 bombs ). At the same time, the movies show that the war is a dirty affair, where murder is sometimes tolerated, the wanton destruction of entire villages for little or no reason is normal, the indiscriminate killing of civilians is neglected, the collateral damage inevitable during the war ... A little food for thinking about why the war in Afghanistan was lost. It's not the best war movie ever, but it's deep enough and smart enough to be watched.
