As a Czech, I am very happy to read these comments here. I am absolutely sure that this movie is great. And what you may not know is that this story was written specifically for Mr. Brodsk√Ω. The man you see is him and his typical attitude: live and resist death. He was one of the great actors and we are very lucky to have made so many beautiful films in his lifetime. You are lucky to be able to see at least one. Enjoy.
