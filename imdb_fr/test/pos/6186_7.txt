Years before prenuptial agreements became a normal thing, Ernest Lubitsch produced a comedy on the screen on which they rest. The eighth wife of Bluebeard involves Gary Cooper as a multimillionaire living on the CÃ´te d'Azur who has married seven times and now marries Claudette Colbert for number eight. But Cooper is a good sport on this, he still agrees with his ex-women for $ 50,000 a year under a signed agreement before marrying her. It looks like what we now call a prenuptial agreement. <br /> <br /> Of course, Claudette wants a lot more than that and she feels that Cooper is taking a totally too commercial approach to marriage. She would like to have the real deal and is willing to go to great lengths to get it. <br /> <br /> The eighth wife of Bluebeard has a lot of fun, the original meeting of Cooper and Colbert in a men's shop where Cooper is insisting that he only wants pajama tops and Colbert is only looking for stockings. And of course, my favorite is Colbert, stalking and singing the detective Cooper sent to spy on him. Herman Bing has the best supporting role in the film as a similar and troubled detective. <br /> <br /> I often wondered how, at the time, Hollywood could escape so many non-French people a movie like this. Of course, Cooper is an American and Colbert, of distribution, is the only one to be of French origin. Although David Niven is charming as always, the fact that he is French is ridiculous, he is so British. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, Bluebeard's eighth wife is a nice movie and an excellent example of what was called the "Lubitsch touch" at the time.
