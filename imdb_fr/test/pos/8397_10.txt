Gone with the wind is one of the most popular books ever printed. This is by far the film of all movies. The romance between Scarlett and Rhett made people around the world dream and turned the main actors into cinematographic icons. One may wonder if it is really necessary to do a sequel. And ... there are big shoes to fill. <br /> <br /> Well, there was the book first. Alexandra Ripley's "Scarlett" is, it must be admitted, well written and respectful of the world created by Margaret Mitchell. She picks up exactly where we left our heroine previously and gently takes us from Mitchell's legacy into her own fantasy. In the book, Scarlett, vanquished after Melanie's death and Rhett's departure, travels to Charleston to live with her mother-in-law in hopes of regaining Rhett's love. Her typical manipulative behavior once again provokes a lot of criticism from Rhett and spreads them further ... until a certain boat trip that will change everything. Scarlett is now a secret. The series follows the book quite well until the arrival of Scarlett in Ireland. From there, book and series are slowly separating. The actual end differs, but of course, Scarlett and Rhett are reunited. <br /> <br /> The production of the series was announced with a worldwide search for the next Scarlett O'Hara. Many countries have created their own television shows featuring young actresses auditioning for the role. Finally, about twelve girls were selected to participate in the latest screen tests and interviews in Atlanta, Georgia. Unfortunately, the producer did not find any Scarlett among these actresses. Sad for girls, major advertisement for the show (it had already been sold to many TV channels around the world even before the start of filming). Robert Halmi, the producer who bought the rights to "Scarlett", said he had discovered the good actress while watching television, called her and two days later signed the agreement. Joanne Whalley-Kilmer (who starred in 'Willow' and 'Scandal', the latest being the film that Robert Halmi was watching tonight faithful) is not Vivien Leigh, but she's definitely Scarlett! Her performance is not a copy of Leigh's, she appropriates the character. The main difference between GWTW and 'Scarlett' is that the main character evolves and develops as a person. This is the prerogative of the series, why copy something that has already been done? Given that there is a gap of almost seventy years between the first and the second scenario, it is natural that both authors focus on different aspects of the characters. While Mitchell works around Scarlett to deal with the aftermath of the Civil War and fight for Tara, Ripley lets Scarlett cope with his demons. For me, this is the most interesting aspect of the series. We get to know Scarlett in a different way, as she discovers that everything can not always go the way she wants. I totally agree with Timothy Dalton's choice as Rhett Butler. He describes it with charm and irony and is less of a cardboard figure than Clark Gable's performance. The rest of the cast was well chosen. Julie Harris is endearing as Rhett's mother, John Gielgud gives a very entertaining performance as Grandpa Robillard and Sean Bean is always at his best playing a dirty character, his Lord Fenton is no exception. Bad choices however, Stephen Collins embodying Belle Watling's adaptation by Ashley and Ann-Margret, was a waste of money. The costumes, the sets and the places are elaborate and convincing. The newly-built Tara set looked exactly the same and it's a moving sequence of the show when the house first appears. <br /> <br /> Is there any reason to follow up ... Well, six hours of romance are mine. One to watch!
