I can not believe that this film counts only 7.4! This certainly corresponds to the best of Hitchcock movies such as VERTIGO or MARNIE. The only reason I can say why the score is so low is that, overall, THE MAN ... renounces violence and will certainly not get a degree in "sex and crime". <br /> <br /> What pulls her tension is not the violence, but the carefree energy of those criminals who take a child from her parents and are willing to kill him if the operation fails. Today, having seen a lot of difficult kidnapping films like Mel Gibson's RANSOM, this sounds normal, but in the 1950s, when the family was a reality in contemporary America, the thought of such a crime has certainly aroused a lot of emotion. <br /> <br /> And this tension still works for me today. Yeah, these guys are selfish and ignorant bastards, disrupt their behavior: it's a bargain for them, and they want to be "good businessmen", ignoring the fact that business here kidnaps children and murder politicians at the Opera !! <br /> <br /> But the quality of the film is the creative aspects, the perverse ideas of Hitchcock, the scandalously disturbing scene of the church (which draws the viewer's attention to loneliness, l abandoning the protagonists, no one cares about anything, no help, church people who just go home ...), the meeting with the owner of this shop stuffing and preparing dead animals (which underlines the somewhat "oriental" style that the film has first scenes abroad), the last and least important point of the role of music in this film. <br /> <br /> Music is the key principle here, as *** SPOILER ***, the assassination of the targeted politician must be done exactly in the moment of a strong tutti / gong orchastra; Hitchcock lets the camera follow the score of the orchestra and that will happen in a second *** BANG *** And then, of course, DORIS DAY will sing Que que, which has become more famous than the movie itself; she sings it to inform the kid that her parents are at the embassy ... <br /> <br /> In short, a classic !!
