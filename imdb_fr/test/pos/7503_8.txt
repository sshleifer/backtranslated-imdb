George C. Scott gives his best and the funniest with a wonderful drama in this scenario of Paddy Chayefsky. Diana Rigg is attractive and is a complicated young woman. This film oscillates between tragedy and chaos in a hospital in New York in the late 60s, with staggering consequences. Barnard Hughes is still charming (excellent theater actor). <br /> <br /> One out of 10. Best performance = George C. Scott. Chayesfsky was a hard blow when he crushed Vanessa Redgrave at the Oscars in 1978, but he's a good writer. A true ensemble formation that works wonders, down to the slightest role. This won the best screenplay at the Oscars and Scott was nominated. He should have won for that instead of PATTON the previous year (for which he was also brilliant). Look for this!
