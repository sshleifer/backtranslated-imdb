Family Guy has been hilarious for so long, but I have the feeling that he lost his quick, random humor at the beginning of season 6. Although I liked Blue Harvest, I felt that last episodes were a "synthetic film" - a small attempt to fill Family Guy's American social satire reputation. <br /> <br /> I saw all the episodes of the season 7 and I was totally surprised and happy that Family Guy found his true colors. Season 7 presents many fantastic episodes and many jokes about the current situation in America. That's exactly what we need at the moment - more fun. <br /> <br /> I have the feeling that the Simpsons have lost their spark together, this show however made a tremendous recovery: he proved how perfectly satirical he was. Good work!
