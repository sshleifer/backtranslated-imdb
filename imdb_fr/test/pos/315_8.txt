'Apocalypse Now Redux', Francis Ford Coppola's war movie is probably the most beautiful war movie I have ever seen. Captain Benjamin Willard (Martin Sheen) is a Vietnamese soldier destined to lead a highly dangerous and highly classified mission in Cambodia to "end the tenure" of Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando), a highly classified military man who has apparently become completely insane and has left the army, creating his own small company and helped by a suite of soldiers. A handful of navy members escort her to Cambodia and meet several interesting people along the way (including Robert Duvall's Kilgore, a tireless lieutenant-colonel with a few screws in the air) and horrible situations. <br /> <br /> 'Apocalypse' is less a historical war film than a philosophical and psychological study. It is more "Full Metal Jacket" than "Platoon". "Apocalypse" lasts more than three hours, but the film is so marvelously rhythmic and captivating that when the movie was over, I was really surprised at the time. The beautiful cinematography is certainly what struck me the most. After seeing this film, I am convinced that Coppola is one of the masters of light and photography in the film's history. The godfather's films were all tinged with an almost sepia-toned tone and the shadows gave the impression of a baroque composition. With 'Apocalypse', the natural light is incredibly used and the shadows, especially in the scenes involving Brando and Sheen, become almost a living figure, so they are ubiquitous and effective. Another beautiful scene was when Cpt. Willard and Jay Hicks (Frederic Forrest) were in the jungle in search of mangos and met a tiger. The enormity of the surrounding foliage (leaves as large as a house) made the characters almost lilliputian, but the colorization of the scene was incredible. While everything else was almost gray, the leaves were incredibly vibrant green, a particularly striking effect. Another very minor positive moment in the film was the big scene when the helicopters carrying Duvall and his company attacked the little village while playing Wagner. It could have been an ultra-dramatic soundtrack behind the scene, but Coppola turns the song into a real part of the scene, with Duvall mentioning that he likes to play that song as they approach to scare them. . <br /> <br /> The performances in 'Apocalypse' are first class. We talked a lot about the amount of money Brando earned for the film and the trouble it caused. Regardless of this, it has proven to be a powerful performance for a relatively short screen quantity. Sheen is quite remarkable - this is the first time I see him really unleash in a film ?? and Duvall is very much fun to watch like crazy Kilgore. 'Apocalypse Now' is a film that has become so ubiquitous in pop culture (most know several lines of choice of the film, 'I like the smell of napalm in the morning' and others), but I knew very little about it that there were many surprises to live. I have not seen the original version of 'Apocalypse Now', so I can not compare it to this newer version, but it's a film that should definitely be experimented. 8/10 <br /> <br /> --Shelly
