While Salinger's film "A Perfect Day for Bananafish" ends with the suicide of a prodigy, this film begins with the death of Matt, the high school swimmer's star legend, who shoots himself in the head after opening scene. But Matt Travis' death serves as the key to opening the door to another prodigy, his brother Tim, who in his life has never seriously bothered the question "What am I going to do?" <br /> <br /> When he finds his brother dead, his head broken like a watermelon, the Travis family starts throwing up his secrets one by one. The film focuses on Tim. He is the victim of bullying, domestic violence, family alienation, grief, sexuality and friendship. <br /> <br /> Tim reveals his injuries through physical bruising, but these are not the only injuries to him, as we slowly realize, because the scenario painfully reveals the origins and result of Tim's scars. Everyone who loves him hurts him. Hirsch interprets the character quite well, revealing image after image in the visual expression of his body, a host of conflicting emotions in the soul of a child that no one seems to listen to or know very well, without knowing it and without consciousness of its depth. soul and prodigious talent. <br /> <br /> Two brothers and sisters sharing a doobie, huddled in a red saucer and spinnable, Tim asks Penny, "What am I going to do with the rest of my life?" The scene is framed by a familiar and recurrent image of the film: the comfortable playground where Tim obviously feels at home, filmed as the crow flies, because with each character, Tim feels comfortable sharing a part of himself, and we see them He shares a few moments in the red saucer of the playground, with childish graffiti engraved in pencil, from above. After advising him to pass the seal, Penny said, "Tim, well, the secret of life's success is finding something you love, and you have to do it for the rest of your life? better hope the hell you're good at because if you're not, then you'll probably fail. "Penny's simple line of advice serves as the central theme of the film, the responsibility of talent and the possibility of failure. Why does a person have a talent she does not support, like Matt, who hated the attention of his swimming fame, but no one notices Tim's talent? nobody ?? because nobody cares to ask him? Not even us. The film makes us realize that we do not know Tim ourselves as well as we thought when we met this sad sad guy; in our intimate understanding of Tim, as he progresses, we are reminded that not everyone is what they seem to be. This is the other side of the film, the failure of those who should ?? parents, friends, teachers ?? anyone ?? notice and see the gifts of the people they claim to love. Even his mother Sandy, played by Sigourney Weaver, does not see Tim's gift despite his love for his son. Weaver does a skilful job of a middle-aged woman struggling with her own inner demons, while she randomly tries to play the role of domesticity and support. When Tim is found bullied at school, she storms the boy's caravan, threatening her with death. "You can tease, torture, hit, drive drunk with me, I can forgive you, I can understand it, I'm good Christian, you know, I can forgive and forget, but you screw up with my child and God Himself comes down from heaven to protect you because as long as I live, I will survive you all, I will wake up and go to sleep at night dreaming of ways to turn your insignificant little lives into hell on earth. "After waving a paper cup in the mother's face, she looks around the trailer and looks at them both, the kid and his mother stunned, comments, "beautiful trailer" and leaves as quickly as she came. Weaver managed to match his enthusiasm with a visceral, acidic and witty spirit. And Tim's father, played by Jeff Daniels, does not see who his son is, treats him like a stranger, does not tell his family that he has been away from the office, spends his days in the city park , apathetic, a soul carved and sleeping in Matt's bed, nestled with his jacket in high school letter. Jeff Daniels does a remarkable job in making us believe that he can be both a bastard and lovable, because we realize that even an incompetent father can show his love for his son. In an emotional scene, Tim confronts his father. Just when you think his father is going to hit him, he catches her so he kisses her. Do not let him go, he says to Tim, "I'm your father and you're my son and I'm here, but you have to talk to me, I do not know how to do this alone". It's at this point in the film that a father tells his son that you have to tell me what's going on inside you, you have to tell me who you are. I want to know who you are. It is in this scene that the film reaches a cathartic moment, the visual movement of Tim, angry and alone, that his father embraces as he collapses and cries, revealing the emotions hidden under his shell. Tim experiences this moment of purification with his father as a catharsis, especially when you consider the abuse, manipulation, contempt, violence and betrayal of which he was a victim during the long year covered by the film. I recommend this movie.
