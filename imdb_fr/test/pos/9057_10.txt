It's really a good movie. Filled with love and humor, it forces the public to take an interest in the characters and participate in their journey. Michael Parness has managed to bring together a large number of top players, a minor miracle for a first film. No doubt, they were touched to help him tell this beautiful story. David Krumoltz brings the film with his discreet intensity and honesty. Natasha Lyonne is unpredictable, exasperating and yet totally adorable as Grace. Also a great tour of Karen Black (great to see her on screen) as a crazy but nice mother of Grace. There is a quick wit everywhere, which allows us to reduce laughter when we are confronted with the pain of life. The acting is impeccable, the editing tight, the direction inspired, and the music creates a decor of atmosphere. Given the current craze of Blockbuster Hollywood, bursting with big budgets, big names, car accidents and special effects, Max & Grace is a refreshing departure. Indulge yourself and watch this movie.
