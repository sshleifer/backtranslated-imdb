The title suggests that this film is a sequel to "An American Werewolf in London". None of the characters from the previous movie comes back and is not even mentioned in this movie by name. So, as a result, AAwiP fails, it looks like. <br /> <br /> I dare say the opposite. <br /> <br /> An American werewolf in Paris is a charming and effective horror film. It's one of the best werewolf movies I've seen in a long time too. And I saw all of my own, like in An Trilogy, an American werewolf in London, The Howling, Wolfen, The Wolfman and The Underworld. <br /> <br /> The story goes that three Americans visited Paris on vacation. At the top of the Eiffel Tower, one of them saves a woman who tries to commit suicide. What began as a romantic relationship slowly turns into a nightmare when the dark secrets that hide in the city are revealed ... <br /> <br /> I really liked playing in this movie. Especially the two stars of the film: the woman who tried to commit suicide and the guy who saves her. They have good chemistry together. But the other two Americans play their role as well. I did not find anything annoying in the acting game, so congratulations for that! <br /> <br /> The effects on the werewolves are nice. It does not look too cheap or fake. Of course, opinions are divided on this subject. But let's just say that I was not disappointed. <br /> <br /> There is also a lot of humor in this film. There are really fun scenes that you will probably remember for a long time. <br /> <br /> So, to summarize, an American werewolf in Paris might not be a direct result of his predecessor, but it's still nice. movie. Perfect for fans of werewolves! 7 out of 10 stars!
