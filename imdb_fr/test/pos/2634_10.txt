Chris Penn is hilarious as Jeff Spicoli's stoner brother. This movie is great because it was much more real and funnier than fast times at ridgemont high. The casting was perfect and one of my favorite soundtracks by almost all Eddie van Halen, who later became songs on ou812 and an illegal carnal knowledge. This film is one of the great stoner heroes with cheech and chong. Fast Times was more depressing than funny. Abortions, friends who cheat on friends, jerk off in bathrooms, have a bad job or fail at school. Someone must hate the eighties to love the ridgemont more than the wild life. The film even had beautiful cameos as the manufacturer of the city's boundaries, Michelle, shocked in the liquor store or Ben Stein in his first role in Sunny's surplus store.
