If you like subtle psychological dramas / thrillers, this is a movie for you. Those who want to see an erotic thriller of ordinary sex crime will surely not understand this film, as Colin Firth understood when he described it as "hogwash". But Jennifer Rubin is still the real star of the film. She is such an actress so bright and beautiful! With the scenario that turns and turns, it becomes more and more psychological and makes you think of yourself, the beautiful realization, photography and especially music make this film a masterpiece. Also, the small parts are very good, especially Belinda Waymouth is great in her small stage. I hope it will be released soon on DVD and that a soundtrack album would be a dream come true !!
