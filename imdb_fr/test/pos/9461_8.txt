I think someone would be wise to read or see (I prefer to read) "The Night of Kings" before seeing or seeing "She is the man". The film is good in itself, but comparing the two and looking for jokes makes the game even more fun. Shakespeare was inspired by others. I think he would nod. <br /> <br /> Harld Bloom said in "Shakespeare, the invention of man", that most people of "Twelfth Night" were to be locked up. Malvolio, the person Malcolm is based on, is not without reason. The people in "She is the man" are healthy in contrast. For example, the Duke of Orsino is much more influential than the Duke of Orsino. It also shows that a man can have feelings without being gay. He shows a lot of self-control. <br /> <br /> It's a teen comedy (a clean comedy), so it does not have the dark edges of the play. For example, Olivia in the room mourns the death of her brother. In the movie, she was dropped. <br /> <br /> If you like Sir Andrew and Sir Toby in the room, they do not have the same attention in the movie. <br /> <br /> The jokes are often fast. The name of the hairdresser Pauls is given once. It's Antonio. Many people who have read the play say that Antonio has more love for a man than just friendship. A deep love between men was noted at this time. Some see it as a sexual side: homosexuality was illegal. <br /> <br /> The only line of the game I caught is the one where Duke Orsino quotes the coach on greatness during the soccar match. In the room, it is said by Malvolio, quoting Maria).
