I watched it on television in 1989 and I regretted not having recorded it. I was very intriguing and suspenseful. It is amazing to see that events unfold and that man's past catches up with him. <br /> <br /> The acting is top notch and the story is exactly what the title claims ... no one could escape a life this man had at the beginning of the movie.
