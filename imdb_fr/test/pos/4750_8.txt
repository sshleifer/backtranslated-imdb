This film is a classic crime movie of the seventies which, for some reason, has unfortunately been neglected. It's essentially French Connection and Bullit. <br /> <br /> Roy Scheider embodies the head of a group of elite detectives, the "Seven Ups" <br /> <br /> One of their men is discovered during an infiltration operation and is killed. <br /> <br /> Scheider and his team must find his killers. They engage in a battle against the crowd. <br /> <br /> The highlight of the film should be the car chase, obviously included to take advantage of the success of Bullit. However, this car pursuit surpasses Bullitt by its length, speed and enthusiasm. It's a breathtaking roller coaster ride that ends unexpectedly and spectacularly. Do not miss this little gem !!
