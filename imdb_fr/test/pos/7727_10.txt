I loved Carmen, better than Original Sin (Angelina Jolie & Antonio Bandaras), who share some thematic similarities and whom I also enjoyed. I felt that the acting was stronger here (Paz Vega showed a wider range, more fire, and Sbaraglia was also great). Overall, their game was harder, more believable (less dreamy than Original Sin, and the two actors here had less "celebrity status" and "pretty face" to rely on to make the movie work. it was to be expected. <br /> <br /> The director Vincente Aranda has also built a detailed world (even better than the original sin) that allows you to feel the filth and daily life of archaic Spain - by for example, people unloading goods from a trolley on the street, workers changing candles from the street lights, all in the background of the action. <br /> While I sympathize very much with the recent idea of ​​buying back our femme fatales (as Femme Fatale by Brian de Palma) Carmen embodies with modernity the tradition of the classic Black Double Indemnity, a pleasant pleasure to watch: it is another fine example of the triumph of the audacious European cinema on a holistic tariff lofty and sure lywoodian.
