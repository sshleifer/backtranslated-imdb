I do not need to repeat Glenn's synopsis. The representation in black and white is even more powerful in the description of the sadness of life in the country villages at that time. Babette's deep friendship with the two older sisters touches the heart. The cast is excellent and their performances superb, it would not be fair to choose a single character, because the entire story depends on the cast as a whole. I can not understand exactly why I value this film so much because I am not a professional critic; individual viewers may or may not agree with my rating since the satisfaction of this type of film is always in the viewer's eye.
