Take a young liberal idealist, Christopher Boyce (Timothy Hutton) ranked in a top secret ranking in a government screen society, because of his father's position, teaming up with a drug dealer without a leader Daulton Lee needs to a new source of income and you have the recipe for spying. Sean Penn played the role of the punk drug dealer with a certain composure, probably by likelihood with such hot types. The bile that Penn carries with him in every situation is unique; he even suggests to the Soviets to administer him drugs. <br /> <br /> I saw the film again and again and every time I see something new. It seems to me that one of the major problems of American espionage organizations is consanguinity, which leads to the hiring of a candidate who is manifestly inappropriate because of his temperament and his inclination for a government shell society. <br /> <br /> Falconeer escaped from prison and led the authorities in pursuit of the wild goose. I see that despite the escape, he is now released. Too bad that the Soviets are no longer there to accept the unfortunate! A Happy Cherio!
