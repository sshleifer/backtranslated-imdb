Before forgetting, let me say that the works here are exceptional. From trash cans to the big cruise ship, the designs are beautifully made. If it was not animated, critics would praise the "direction" here, because it's really good. <br /> <br /> Learn more about the story: Sylvester searches shipyard garbage cans but conservatives are thin. As he ruminates on the dock beside a large ship, in a porthole, he sees Tweety in his cage. Tweety spots him too, and you know his first comment - the same as he always does when he spots the cat. Anyway, Sylvester overflows, opens the porthole and says, "Hello, breakfast!" Tweety slams the window of the porthole on his face and says, "You're an old, good old cat!" The cat falls into the water. <br /> <br /> Sylvester, intrepid, slips quickly aboard the ship, settles into Tweety's cabin, catches it and is ready to leave when - wham! - There's "Granny" at the door with her umbrella. Sylvestre hurts because the old lady protects her pet bird again. But, "Frivolous gibbet," said Granny, "I dropped my glasses, I can not see anything without them." Heaven to Betsey, where are these cheats. " <br /> <br /> Now, Sylvester has the upper hand ... and the usual cat cravings trying to catch a bird are lit again, like grandmother's glasses. Sylvester's smartest gesture was to take his glasses and paint an image of Tweety on them. So when she woke up and put them on, she would see the bird and think everything was fine. <br /> <br /> All in all, An animated short film that is very entertaining and very fun to watch. As you can see from the quotes, I love the dialogue in some of these old caricatures.
