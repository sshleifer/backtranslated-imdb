This series where the dinosaur lived 65 million years ago. Dinosaurs look very real and are very realistic when they move. It is also very interesting to see how the climate changes. <br /> <br /> I'm very interested to see how the dinosaurs lived and died. I am also interested in the behavior of dinosaurs. <br /> <br /> The color of the dinosaurs is also interesting to see and to discover. They think what color they had. <br /> <br /> The most interesting is why the dinosaurs are dead and what happened afterwards. <br /> <br /> The BBC has made a brilliant series about the life and death of dinosaurs!
