Chi-hwa-seong (Painted Fire) tells the story of Korean painter Jang Seong-ub in the midst of the changing political landscape of 19th-century Korea. <br /> <br /> However, the themes of this film are centered on the process of artistic creation through the fire of the desire of the artist and the expectations and demands of his audience and society. <br /> <br /> Jang Seong-ub is played brilliantly as a complex character that goes from the innocent excitement of tortured alcoholic hardened youth. This characterization reflects the young, avid artist who finds it increasingly difficult to invoke the spirit of artistic creation in itself without allowing the creative fire to fade through drink, erections and desire. <br /> Although the development of this character continues Overall, gradually through the film, the emotional complexity of Jang is always interpreted oscillating and permanent until the end of the film. It is interesting to note that the editing of the film is parallel to this seemingly changing and seemingly wild emotion or the artist's fire as the scenes pass uninterrupted from one place to another without any conventional "signal" to the audience. audience that such a change of scene will occur. For example, many scenes would change apparently in the middle of a conversation that would take place elsewhere and somewhere else. <br /> <br /> The visual d√©cor of the film is beautifully presented and also oscillates from a dark and even dark (and perhaps dark) black and white decor. to more colorful and vibrant environments that once again match Jang's paintings, either plain black ink on white paper or added color. Arcs of color enter the film at times, as the artist observes nature and especially women, who are then reflected in his paintings. <br /> <br /> the film through various points, including the class distinction, the government's dominance over the artist, the standards accepted by the artistic elite and the basic desires of the common masses. Instead of creating his own completely original works, Jang is mainly dedicated to recreating the masterpieces of other artists from East Asia. The question therefore arises of whether leisure itself deserves artistic merit. <br /> <br /> I would like to know more about the political events of this period and understand how they relate to history - but beyond any comparison with the current role of the Korean government in artistic expression and / or censorship, I can not comment. <br /> <br /> Overall, the film is extremely well done and the cinematography is often breathtaking. A great movie to see and then meditate.
