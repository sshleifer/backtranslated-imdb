Considered by many to be a strangely neglected Chabrol, it seems to me that the reason he was cold in the shoulders is his lousy factor. Not as openly sexy, violent or bloody as many films from this period, it nevertheless begins in a rather surprising way and although more and more measured continues to emit a rather unpleasant odor. Mrs. Audran, not here the ice girl but a drunk mother, Donald Pleasence makes a cameo as a pedophile, David Hemmings has eyes on the sex of minors and the central theme is the relationship between a brother, a sister and a niece. No, not very nice at all and Chabrol treats all of this as if it were very normal (like in a small French village!) Instead of Ed McBain in New York. If it had been treated in a more sensational way, it would have been a more acceptable but less important film. Here, we really have to choose between the probability of various unpleasant options before the final outcome. Very watchable
