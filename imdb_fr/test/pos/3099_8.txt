This is the first of Ma and Pa Kettle's films. Marjorie Main (Ma) steals the show in everything she does. It's funny to see Ida Moore in the role of Emily, the old daffy on the train ... god she was ALWAYS old; she was in "Desk Set" and "Alfred Hitchcock Presents". Their new home is also a co-star here - it's the house of the future with really cool inventions that Pa does not care about. LOVE the paint gag. Keep an eye on TOM ... he played in "Nanny & the Professor". Unfortunately, he died very young ... oddly, his last role was in the series "Death Cruise". weird. Directed by Charles Lamont, who not only made several Kettle films, he also shot a series of Abbott and Costello films. So he had to know one or two secrets of comedy. Fun story, simple and simple humor. Even the release date was April Fool's Day 1949. The story begins by showing us what they are like a backward peasant and peasant (the neighbors are even Native Americans), but as the story goes, we have sympathy and respect for them.
