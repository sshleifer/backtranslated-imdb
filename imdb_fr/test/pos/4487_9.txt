During the Sci-Fi TZ marathon on January 31, 1999, this episode was the last broadcast in the 20th century in my time zone (East). It was New Year's Eve, and when the clown started singing, "We're here because we're here, because we're here, because we're here ..." New Year's Eve because this piece is also that of old Lang Syne. Coincidence? We'll never know. <br /> <br /> I like this story for the little touches: the tear of the ballerina, the antics of the clown and the end of the match. This and the Carney Santa TZ Art are the only ones that talk about Christmas. <br /> <br /> My five best personal episodes, after five characters ...: 1. The hunt 2. The afternoon 3. The hitchhiker 4. The loner 5. The lost girl
