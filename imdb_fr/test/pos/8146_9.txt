When I was told about this movie, I was not too happy to see it, even though, in the end credits, it turned out to be one of the best movies I've ever watched. <br /> <br /> the film itself is quite graphic (scenes from man to man, we do not see everything) would not be a film on the theme of gays if there were none. .. <br /> <br /> the film has a very light heart with humor and contains very funny parts. I highly recommend this movie, about three quarters later, you really like the main characters and I think it brings the film together. <br /> <br /> once again, very nicely set up .. more cute Mormon.
