"You were going up and you stumbled on a skirt!" Gilligan tells Jim Leonard. This sums up the plot of this story of Leonard and his future (a YOUNG Humphrey Bogart) when his dream is diverted by the bomb of heiress Carol, played by Dorothy Mackaill. Leonard is working on a new and improved engine, but now his love life and his car business are in highs and lows in this 68-minute shorty. Bogart had not yet developed the silent and dark style. Good performances of most of the secondary characters - his butler, his colleagues, a sister, intruders all along the way. Some adult themes, since this was done just before the movie's code was actually applied, but it's still not serious compared to what's on TV today. Directed by Thornton Freeland, a year before Freeland, he realized the incredible "Flying Down to Rio".
