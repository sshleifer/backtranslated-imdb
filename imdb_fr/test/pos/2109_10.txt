Without a doubt, GRAND CHAMPION has the most impressive cast of "AAA" stars and musicians ever together for a fun family adventure, rated "G". This is an essential purchase for every video collection! Director BARRY TUBB skillfully combines the drama of the rodeo / 4H competition for the "GRAND CHAMPION" cow with a touching and fun story of perseverance in the face of tough challenges. Joey Lauren Adams delivers her typically strong performance as a well meaning mother, but the star of the show is 12-year-old EMMA ROBERTS, whose camera presence is as vivid as that of her famous aunt, JULIA. You can expect a lot from this young protégé Roberts, as already proves his new series of success Nickelodeon, "UNFABULOUS".
