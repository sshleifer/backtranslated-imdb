You can not watch a film like Peter Watkins' "Privilege", a story of a pop artist's exploitation by big corporations, the state and even organized religion, without thinking of such creative products as Michael. Jackson or Britney Spears. who peddle giants like Pepsi or another poison for money. Or any number of artists, in music or movies, who become tools of political parties or commercial religious interests like Scientology and Kabbalah. A film like Privilege must have looked almost like science fiction when it was released in 1967, so fantastic was its principle. Today, we tend to view celebrity endorsement as self-evident, without worrying too much about its most alarming implications. Watkins' vision has not only become reality, we tacitly accept this reality as "normal". <br /> <br /> Now, consider Punishment Park. While Privilege challenges the viewer to consider what is being sold to us and why, Punishment Park demands that we count on what has been taken and why. <br /> <br /> Heaven helps the United States and the world, if contemporary politicians get their hands on this film. It is already so close to reality that by looking at it recently, I felt a real sense of nauseating anxiety. <br /> <br /> Watkins dresses again with talent for a documentary-style narrative. While in Privilege, this technique presented rough roughness, in Punishment Park, it was refined to perfection. Realism is reinforced by unpretentious disarming representations, economic and credible throughout the cast. This is the kind of actor that Hollywood has completely turned its back on, to the detriment of, in favor of aesthetically perfect image projections. The cast has first rate material to use in the Watkins screenplay. <br /> <br /> Many film visionaries have tried to shake the viewer to rid them of their complacent and false sense of security. Nobody has ever gotten this result with such severe and frightening precision that Peter Watkins is doing it here. <br /> <br /> "What seems quite clear now is that instead of trying to get excluded and excluded Americans into the national community, the Administration has chosen to accepting and exploiting the current division within the country and rallying to what it considers to be the majority Instead of the policy of reconciliation, it has chosen the politics of polarization. "<br /> <br /> To paraphrase one of the characters, we do not have to call them pigs because they know what they are. Better than us.
