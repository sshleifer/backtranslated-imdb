The rise of punk music was barely documented in the movies and most people tend to focus on events taking place in other cities, such as London or New York. Penelope Spheeris managed to keep a snapshot of Los Angeles around 1979-1981, proving that a vibrant and diverse artistic and musical community had been created that rivaled any other. For some, the bands read like a who's who of the now legendary American punk; Black flag, x, circle, jerks, germs, fear. Purists claim that vital groups have been missed (Weirdos, Zeros, Flesheaters) and that the film has been the cause of a suburban setter attack and macho violence. However, the issues addressed in the film remain relevant, the intensity of the music remains unmatched and the influence continues to be seen and heard in cliques / modes today.
