If you like the excitement of a good underwater drama and the pleasure of a good comedy, this film is highly recommended. Kelsey Grammer gives an excellent performance here. <br /> <br /> The film also gives you something to think about the next time a serious sub-film requires "quiet operation" .... <br /> <br />
