The warmest and most engaging film of its kind, Those Lips, Those Eyes, made me smile and cry, reminding me of the work needed to pursue a dream and the pain of disappointment. Hulce and Langella are superb and the story seems to write itself. A brilliant scenario of David Shaber (one of my favorites! - see The Warriors and Nighthawks to know more ...) and beautiful scenery shot on site (I think) in the summer theater where takes place history. You can not see this movie and do not want to drop everything and go to the theater! Please check this video if you can find it.
