I really enjoyed this movie. I have probably watched him twice or more and I still enjoy him. Being an old Navy man, I am always moved by the catchy rendition of Anchors Away! I also like the pirate atmosphere "McHales Navy". I could have done without the diving officer, but I guess I'm old-fashioned. She was always good to watch, lol, especially after the team finished washing. The cook, sonarman and electrician made the film. I loved the old salty engineer and his first class commander too. And Grammer did a very commendable job of being an unsuitable officer. I loved the "driving scene" when they passed the golf course on the way to the harbor, lol. Pure Navy! And I swear I had an XO that looked like this little weasel ... I'm so glad it's on DVD, about Bloody Time. : 0)
