Watching this movie, I was amazed at how media perceptions can influence a person's opinion of a celebrity. Karen Carpenter was a carefree young woman, but not very confident, whose wonderful voice helped her and her brother Richard climb the charts with beautiful songs. Like all celebrities today, they have often been criticized for their music, appearance, style, and so on. This had a huge impact on Karen, who fought a battle against her diet and lost a lot of weight, which eventually caused her death. This movie was not what I would have thought to watch. But when I started to see him, I became addicted. As in the story of Tina Turner, this film enlightens you and allows you to see the lives of young performers. The acting was superb and even after almost 20 years of filming, the staging and dialogues are always fun. <br /> <br /> I would recommend it to anyone who has not watched it yet. It's incredibly accurate and emotionally charged.
