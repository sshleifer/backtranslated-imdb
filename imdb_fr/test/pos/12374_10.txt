This film is a masterpiece to put it simply. Especially the double exposure of cameraman Julius Jaenzon. It is cleverly manufactured even with the standards we are used to seventy-eight years later. Viktor Sjöström, the director, also plays the main character, David Holm. On New Year's Eve, he is killed in a fight and legend has it that the first who dies the new year will have to work as a soul collector in the form of a transparent ghost. A new soul collector must be named each year. <br /> <br /> The scene in which the alcoholic, David Holm, rises from his dead body (as the soul leaves his earthly body) in the cemetery. (where the fight took place) is a real reward for a loving eye. Similarly, when the current soul collector arrives with his horse and carriage, the scene is beautiful but also frightening. David Holm recognizes that this collector of souls is a friend friend of past life. It is now his turn to take over. Just like Scrooge in Dickens' story "A Christmas Tale", David is shown what his life and actions have been for the people around him. <br /> <br /> The film talks about the danger of drug abuse, in this case alcohol. It is based on a book by Nobel laureate Selma Lagerlöf. Viktor Sjöström has filmed a few more of his books, but it is the one that gives the best result, perhaps because this book is the most filmic of them. <br /> <br />
