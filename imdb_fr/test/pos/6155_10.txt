I saw this movie in Wales in July. This is the courage of the Czech pilots who carried out many missions for the RAF after the occupation of their country by the Nazis. In this film, the action takes place in the early 50s, when these pilots are beaten in political prisons in Czechoslovakia, and during the Second World War in Britain. They were imprisoned after returning to their homeland because the communist regime regarded these warriors as a threat to their occupation of Czechoslovakia. The pilots maintain their dignity in prison and during numerous aerial battles against Nazi pilots. This film contains a sub-plot of love that makes sense because it helps us understand that civilians and soldiers have made great sacrifices to preserve democracy. The end of this film indicates that the heroism of these Czech pilots was finally recognized in the early 1990s after the restoration of democracy in the country then called Czeckoslavakia. This powerful and moving film was made with the financial support of the Czech government. I highly recommend this movie.
