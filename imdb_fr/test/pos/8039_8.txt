Christian Duguay made this tidy spy thriller early in his career. It is regularly broadcast on television, even if some terrible scenes of violence and sex are unfortunately cut off. I finally had time to see the theatrical version on a $ 3 tape from the local video store. Navy officer Aidan Quinn is recruited to pose as the infamous Carlos the Jackal and is a little too involved in the role. Donald Sutherland Ben Kingsley plays Quinn's superiors, with Sutherland a real fanatic and Kingsley calmer. The first half of this funny movie shows that Quinn is trained and indoctrinated. The second half sees him on the ground, making love to Jackal's wife and attacking various enemies. The idea is to make the jackal look like a revolver for the Russians and take care of the most notorious murderer in the world. Things are not going exactly as planned. Sometimes I almost expected the actors to laugh while talking to some nerdy dialogues, but they all play it very directly. In the end, it's a great little thriller that deserves your attention. The former mistress of the Jackal taught Quinn, a very decent and very married woman, to torture her, to lick her blood, and then to take her down, alone, worth the price of entry.
