It was a fantastic film about two people, a young teenager and the other, a middle-aged man who is each looking for someone to help fill a certain void left by old loved ones. <br /> <br /> Both actors play brilliant performances that different audiences can relate to. The script, though written by Gorman Bechard, seems to have been written from a woman's point of view. And at the same time, men can understand male characters because of the way they were developed and described in the film. <br /> <br /> The end of the film has an unusual but powerful and unexpected twist that leaves you speechless. I would recommend this movie to anyone who has ever felt alone or abandoned by a loved one. It is clear in this film that you are not alone.
