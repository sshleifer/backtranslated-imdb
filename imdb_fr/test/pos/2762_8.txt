I have seen so many bad reviews on Supervivientes de los Andes that I felt compelled to defend it (or at least I will try). First of all, of course, it seems dated, it was manufactured in the 70s with a very small budget, but that's part of its charm. I like contemporary movies, but I also like old movies for what they are worth. I am not alone in feeling the need to see or love only movies with modern treatments and effects; moreover, almost all film buffs like old movies (who does not like El Santo or Plan 9 movies from space, no matter how good?). As far as rhythm is concerned, it is simply a tool to cover (again) its low cost, and I believe that constant dialogues are intended to improve the character and development of situations. Of course, Alive has better FX effects, but I will not despise the old one because of that, and I do not feel very attracted to the anglophones at an event gathering Uruguayans and for me, which gives a advantage to Supervivientes. Los Andes. It's as if, even though Canoa, from the seventies and based on a real event, would have a better remake now because of the advancements in technology, I think I'll stick to this one according to the emotions offered regardless of the date of production. . <br /> <br /> All this is based on the impact I had on myself, because I saw this for the first time on television, and I do not think today that it has lost part of its primal strength. Of course, it's been a long time and I've seen tons of better movies in every aspect of cinema, but that does not diminish its real value. This is not a bad movie and I place it above Alive without hesitation. Just give a break.
