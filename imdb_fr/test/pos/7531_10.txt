Looking at this film, I can not help but compare it to Wild Reeds, another well-thought-out film about teens who reach adulthood. <br /> <br /> Like Wild Reeds, this film is slow and the director would not be in a hurry. So, if you want a quick problem resolution, do not look at it. This film is like a slice of life, starting imperfectly and ending imperfectly. There is no solution to anything, no happiness for anyone, like in real life. <br /> <br /> This film is as real as it can be. The acting game is surprisingly good. The director likes long, very long shots, and actors and actresses excel at subtlety and inner reflection. <br /> <br /> I like this movie. I almost did not look but now I am very happy to have done it. This is not a movie for everyone but if you are ready to let it grow on you, you will be rewarded. <br /> <br /> 10/10
