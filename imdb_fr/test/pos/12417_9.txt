Five minutes later, I began to feel how much it looked like that, you have a completely non-heroic hero and his overweight friend idiot. See all this before, yeah yes. I was getting ready to be bored for a few hours. It's something I'm used to a lot ... do not we all. Then, after a few minutes of testosterone, the truck appeared. Okay, the filming techniques used to make the movie fast were awkward, but we do not care! This truck is amazing! Soon however, this is removed again and we return to the overweight geek and his friend. But now, I'm convinced that at least it will not be terrible. I am then amazed by the ingenuity of the film. There are so many jokes at their expense that it's as if everyone knew about it, except the two of them. The spirit behind makeup and effects was a genius, I swear. Believe me, if you are a man, you miss so many jokes in this movie, there are so many that only a girl can understand. <br /> <br /> Brother Bob is by far the best hillbilly killer that can be found anywhere, the fact that it is sewn only adds to the effect. There are, of course, really absurd scientific facts, but is not that always the case? When our "hero" bleeds from the nose and uses the blood to drive his brother Bob to death, it's now bullshit. Nosebleeds can not be so severe and do not mean a sectioned artery or something like that. I use too much blood, but it goes a little too far. The jokes about incest are a bit predictable but nevertheless fun. And the way Brother Bob meets his end is more than classic. Overall, this film is right, it really comes out of the exaggerated melodramatic horror tension we had in 2003-2005. The end of this movement just could not have been better. <br /> <br /> It is an event to be watched absolutely for all those who love their horror with several orders of gore and attitude.
