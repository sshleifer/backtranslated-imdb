I have heard some comments, particularly from prisoners of war, that CHANGI is not historically accurate and is disappointing. It may be for those who have really experienced this kind of thing, and much worse. But for the rest of us, who have no idea how the Japanese treated prisoners during the Second World War, CHANGI is a remarkable introduction. But CHANGI is not a war documentary - if it had been, the historical aspect of precision would have been paramount. This is a miniseries drama, with fictional characters and fictional situations (though based on real events that I've heard and read), and at the center of the story lies the ideal friendship. This group of young Australian soldiers, taken prisoner by the Japanese and held in appalling conditions for years, became a war companion through adversity and the strength of their friendships lasted all their lives after the war. It is also a cultural study of the differences between the Japanese of the time and the Western world, with its music, games and entertainment: in the fifth part, it becomes clear that Japan will lose the war after the capitulation of the world. Germany in Europe, the Japanese colonel of the prison camp insists that his country must study the culture of its prisoners - to defeat a people, it must overcome its culture - and to do this, it must be understood. In total, Australia continues its rich tradition of producing outstanding TV mini-series and is unrivaled as a world leader in this regard: the AFI Award with CHANGI is MY BROTHER JACK, the adaptation of George Johnston's novel, and a worthy winner. In recent years, the miniseries includes DAY OF THE ROSES, KINGS IN GRASS CASTLES (adaptation of Mary Durack's historical account of her pioneer ancestors), KANGAROO PALACE (about from a group of friends, a country town in Australia to London and transforming and growing separately), and the (somewhat disappointing) adaptation of Bryce Courtenay's powerful novel THE POTATO FACTORY. Less recently: the great Nancy Cato saga about life on the Murray - ALL THE RIVERS RUN; Cusack & James' brilliant novel about Sydney's post-war life - COME IN SPINNER; Colleen McCullough's pioneering saga - THE THORN BIRDS; Kings of the river; Ruth Park's novel, THE HARP IN THE SOUTH; BODY LINE; EUREKA STOCKADE; ANZACS; etc ..., etc ... (Of course, there were some less good productions - for example, MOBY DICK, DO OR MOUR, on the beach, THORN BIRDS: MISSING YEARS, etc ...) As a rule Overall, however, if an Australian miniseries comes your way, be sure to see it - and that doubles for CHANGI, a superbly crafted masterpiece. Rating: 9/10.
