This is the kind of unknown and forgotten film that we dream to discover by viewing old videos. It's a gorgeous comic book jewel with a brilliantly funny writing, embedded in the marvelous array of characters, a wonderfully inventive and fun musical score and a witty and light direction from Montgomery himself. This is to watch again and again. Montgomery is a small actor who is entrusted by his military reserve division to infiltrate the home of a young debutante to discover the identity of his former handsome, an alleged jeweler. Although the premise is rather absurd, the results are hilarious. Montgomery is the confused plant, Ann Blyth is a marvel as a haunting and terribly fierce debutante and the parade of comic characters from the famed theater actress, Jane Cowl's mother, lawyer, to the maid in charge of Lillian Randolph is fabulous. <br /> <br /> Curiously, it earned only an Oscar for Sound, while he deserved the honors of the head for the realization, the scenario and the musical score. <br /> <br /> DO NOT MISS, this is one of the best in Hollywood.
