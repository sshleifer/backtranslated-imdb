This movie was one of the funny movies I have ever seen. Danny De Vito plays Owen perfectly. Mom is very well portrayed and was one of the highlights of the film. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the film, the beginning of the film is different from what you expect. Larry tries to write a book and has problems. Larry teaches a writing class and Owen gets tagged after Larry tries to get him to read his story. Owen eventually asks Larry to kill his mother and, in return, he kills Larry's ex-wife. The whole movie was really hilarious. <br /> <br /> One of my favorite parts of the movie is in the end when Owen writes "Throw momma from the train". Larry gets furious because he just wrote a book about a similar plot. It turns out Owen wrote a children's pop-up book. <br /> <br /> I would really recommend this movie. I gave him a 10.
