This movie blew me away - I only saw two episodes of the series, I never saw the first film, but I went to a pre-screening during which Johnny Knoxville himself presented the film telling us to "turn off our sense of moral judgment an hour and a half." He was right, as a film it would probably be a 2 because it has no plot, no structure besides randomness and very little production value. Everybody in our theater laughed and panted from the beginning - not only were some of the stunts creative (see the trailer if you need to know, but they hid some of the best (or worst) depending on the the way you want to watch them), but some of the things they've done have taken us completely by surprise - these guys are doing things that will not appear in your newspaper reviews (and probably will not even be published here), involving a lot of things below the belt.However, about 3/4 of the cascades are fantastically hysterical (even if morally reprehensible, but remember the Knoxville statement), and if you're in the b we state of mind, this film is hysterical to watch. Only about 20 minutes of this film could have been shown on TV, so be aware of what you are getting into - some things are disgusting, but instead of being repulsed by it, you end up laughing at the stupidity of all that. . As a person who thought that Jackass's TV show was a whimsy fantasy with only a few fun sketches and a lot of unnecessary suffering, the amount of fun I had in this movie made me realize that to have no boundaries is the best environment for these films. to work. It's very funny and it should be a good comic solution until the release of the movie Borat. With this movie, you may think you know what you're getting, but these guys have a few steps ahead of you. I guarantee you will be surprised by the 3rd skit. So, have fun and do not worry: you will not want to play at home at home.
