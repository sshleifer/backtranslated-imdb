Trey Parker and Matt Stone, creators of South Park, come out of their grueling schedule to talk to the cameras while sipping champagne in their hot tub. At first, when I looked at it, I did not feel as much sarcasm as there was. I knew they were joking when they complained about different actors in the series and that Trey said he was not going to give money to his mother, but there is so much sarcasm everywhere that this documentary is more of a fake documentary. full of jokes. <br /> <br /> This "documentary" shows everything about South Park (anyway until the second season). It shows what is happening behind the scenes of animation and recording. He has interviews, many of which are fake interviews, but some, among all the fabrications, give an overview of the series. Excerpts from Trey Parker's two short films Spirit of Christmas are presented, as well as many good excerpts from the show. If you were a fan of South Park, then that should have quenched your thirst for showmanship at the end of 1998 when it was done. Now, of course, the show has changed, but it's still interesting. <br /> <br /> What we have here is a fun documentary in which Trey Parker (in particular) and Matt Stone pose as arrogant fools, and it's like going out like. They may be like that in real life, but here it was a joke, an insightful 51-minute joke. <br /> <br /> My note: *** on ****. 51 minutes Unrated, contains language and sexual content.
