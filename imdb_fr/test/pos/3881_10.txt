For those who like to think of themselves as reasonably intelligent human beings, who love movies, pay close attention to details and enjoy independent films with a fun and intelligently written dialogue, this film is for you. <br /> <br /> For those who have a poor attention span, high expectations and no brain .. good .. uh .. you can get bored and find things hanging out sometimes. <br /> <br /> It's a charming, modest and well-paced movie with actors conferring a real sense of depth and warmth to their roles. I almost laughed all along the way. <br /> <br /> This film is a little gem.
