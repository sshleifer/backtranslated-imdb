I think the filmographic lineage can work like this. Be careful, please, because I had to watch this. In 1967, Peter Yates, a former car driver, directs the English burglar film "Robbery", the most exciting of which is a car chase in the streets of London, in alleys where crowds of children play, etc. . It is a success. <br /> <br /> A year later, Yates directs "Bullet", starring Steve McCool. I mean McQueen, featuring another even more spectacular pursuit by car in the San Francisco hills, with surprisingly authentic engine sounds. this seems to include double-clutch cams, full-length racing, no mufflers, 40-meter, 40-meter, turbo-charged, turbocharged engines, and all five thousand horsepower running at full speed. Many shots of McQueen's chewing-gorged face, sullen with concentration, trying to knock another car off the road, while one passenger in the other vehicle carries a shotgun. The lawsuit is staged by Philip D'Antoni. Bill Hopkins drives the criminal vehicle. <br /> <br /> A year or two later, feeling a good thing, Bill Friedkin directs "The French Connection", staging a chase between a requisitioned police car (Gene Hackman) and a high man. train to New York. Many shots of Hackman's cursed face as he struggles in the streets through the car. The lawsuit is staged by Philip D'Antoni. The Oscars follow. <br /> <br /> The detection of a good thing, a year or two more brings us "The Seven Ups", with a chase between a car driven by Roy Scheider, with many shots of the cursed face of Scheider he tries to hit the other car, driven by Bill Hopkins, off the road, although the criminal car carries a shotgun-carrying passenger. No hills in New York, just bumps, but they are still sharp enough to raise cars a few feet. The pursued car screams around the corner and heads for a street in which a dozen children play. Shots of children screaming as they scatter on sidewalk and allow car to zoom in. But once is not enough. The children immediately return to the street and have to retreat for the chasing police car carrying Scheider. <br /> <br /> One day, I attended a high-speed chase in the streets of Philadelphia. The criminal and the cops walked the streets at an approximate speed of 25 km / h, arriving at stops at each stop sign and red light, which is very boring compared to this movie. <br /> <br /> About this movie, it's pretty good. "Flight" and "Bullet" were cool. Everyone dresses neatly. But New York movies are dirty. There is garbage everywhere and subway cars are covered with graffiti. Shootings and beatings occur in vacant lots surrounded by dilapidated brick buildings or landfills for industrial sized freezers. <br /> <br /> The acting game is very good too. Roy Scheider looks elegant. The other actors have faces made for the camera, especially Richard Welsh. And the story is engaging, not to say totally unknown. The best of this film is the way it captures New York in its almost total indifference to human depravity and nobility. At a funeral, the limousine drivers stand up, the collars raised, the buttocks coming out of the mouth, hitting their cold feet together, completely bored by the ritual. The film wants us to believe that The Seven Ups is an elite group of untouchable cops who will stop at nothing to get the job done, and it's a bit like a sold-out. They always seem to threaten to act in an unethical and unlawful way - beating a suspect's hell or physically damaging a hospitalized and defenseless hood - but they still manage to avoid doing so. (If they really did, their characters would become more real-life and ambiguous and we'd prefer our heroes and villains to be more biblical in nature.) Very nice, even if you've seen it before, and you're might have in one or the other of his previous incarnations.
