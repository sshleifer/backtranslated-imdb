This is a 100% improvement over the slag of a third movie and it's a hell of a lot of fun. It's a film by John Hughes to meet The Devil's Rejects. I really enjoyed this movie and it really stands out as the savior of the series. I thought that Jennifer Tilly was playing very well with Tiffany and that Brad Dourif instead of Chucky was really shining this movie again. In fact, these are the only good parts of the film. I was rather bored with the scenes of Katherine Heigl and Nick Stable. It's as if they were thrown there as a bypass and someone to save the situation. But Chucky and Tiffany were great to watch and I really liked black humor. I thought the film stood out more. If you want to have a good time, be sure to watch this. <br /> <br /> 7/10.
