It looks like something I have NEVER seen before. It made me crack all the time, I do not think there was a scene I did not laugh at. This is a girl from the south of the country who goes to a big city. At school, she befriends RA on the other side of the hall. When she realizes he has no family to go to for Thanksgiving, she invites him to come home with her. Rabecca and her family and her serious boyfriend all go to dinner one night and Becca realizes what her boyfriend is about to do ... Propose. She's urging Cral to do something to get up and scream something like ... Sorry buddy but you're too late, I've already asked Becca to marry me a few weeks ago at school and she said yes. All of this is turning into chaos. Please watch this classic, it is worth it ... I swear.
