It was a really interesting Halloween movie. I was not enthusiastic about Thorn's theory, but it's still a good movie. I liked to see Tommy Doyle come back but unfortunately, Donald Pleasance died just after the shooting. The film had a really REALLY bad director who did not give in to the series, from what I heard dealing with evil with Donald, and did not let Danielle Harris come back as Jamie. It's as if he was just trying to make the film fall, but I still liked it. There have been a lot of cuts and musical changes and if you are lucky, you can pick up the Producers Cut, which lasts more than 40 minutes. scenes never before. With these scenes, it becomes a brand new movie. Check if you are lucky.
