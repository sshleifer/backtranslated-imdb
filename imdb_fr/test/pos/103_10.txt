... means "take and read", and that's exactly what I wanted to do after seeing this wonderful movie. <br /> <br /> Von Ancken stimulates and inspires with this breathtaking and beautifully executed adaptation of Tobias Wolff's 1995 New York-based article of the same name. Tom Noonan's incredible performance is brilliant and provocative and editing, sound design, cinematography and directing are truly inspired. The nuanced changes and embellishments of the original story are subtle, clever and make the film more dynamic. His lyrical rhythm hypnotizes and begs you to see him again. <br /> <br /> Pay attention to this young director ... he moves.
