When I heard about this film for the first time, I was slightly interested. The plot seemed like an opportunity for hilarity and Bam Margera as an actor and director seemed to be something that could be good. When I discovered that the film starred Ryan Dunn, I was even more interested (I was a fan of Homewrecker when he was ... Yeah, I'm as bad as that). However, I did not believe in success. When I sat down to watch it, I was afraid of wasting my time. <br /> <br /> But even five minutes later, it became obvious that I was wrong. <br /> <br /> I thought the comedy of this movie was deliciously silly and certainly not suitable for everyone. The acting was pretty good, way better than my expectations. I thought it was pretty easy to understand Ryan's character, which gave the film a credible focus. This is essential in such an outrageous film (and that's probably why I was not a fan of Borat). <br /> <br /> The film is not suitable at all for young people, DUH, and will certainly create more than it's just part of the clumsy turtles if looked with parents. But it's a good thing for you and your friends at a movie night.
