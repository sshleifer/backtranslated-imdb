It's really not a film that revolutionizes the industry or introduces new filming techniques, it's a very beautiful and solid production. It is miraculous that today we can admire a superb quality on DVD - most viewers have probably seen a copy in black and white because the stained luxury edition was only available in the best theaters . Even if you are not fascinated by this film or its subject, you will be able to marvel at the copy published by Image Entertainment (with another gem, From the Manger To the Cross, 1912). It is almost impossible to see a movie that's more than a century old but shows so little damage. The stencilling process was very effective and, compared to the sometimes hazy and stained images of a hand-colored film, the colors are sharp and well defined. Filmed within the limits of the film as it was known in 1902 at the beginning of the shooting, the static character of the scenes can today be considered almost intentional, meditative and solemn. The paintings keep moving, so the film never becomes tedious. You may not be fascinated by this film as a cinematographic work, but it is beautiful as a work of academic art. If you are a religious person, watching anonymous, long-lost people playing missing characters, adds significantly to the mystery. A good visit for Christmas or Lent. <br /> <br /> P.S: I just ticked the box "contains spoilers" for fun. As you can see, I did not reveal the end.
