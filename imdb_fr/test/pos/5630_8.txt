I'm proud to say that I'm a student at UW-Milwaukee, where parts of the film were shot. Yes, I recognize Mitchell Hall, where I took a film class, maybe the same class as fellow student Smith. <br /> <br /> This is where I discovered the "American film". Our teacher spoke to us shortly before its release. Certainly, I was intrigued, but for some reason, I differed from seeing it for several months (it should have been quite successful if it was still played, at least in Milwaukee). <br /> <br /> When I finally had time to see it, I thought it was an entertaining documentary. It's not a masterpiece, it's a bit too long, but I find Mark's passion and commitment inspiring. I hope this film marks the beginning of bigger and better things for him. Maybe his next "Northwestern" will propel him into fortune. Who knows? <br /> <br /> Rating: *** (out of ****) <br /> <br /> 108 min / Posted by Sony Pictures Classics
