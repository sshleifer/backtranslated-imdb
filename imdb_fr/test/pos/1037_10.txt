I saw this series on PBS in 1980 at university and I still can not get it out of my head, although I've never seen it since. I remember every member of the cast (the cast was perfect, as mentioned in other reviews), the design, the lighting and, of course, the story, which alone is enough to keep you glued to the decor . Probably the best TV series I've ever seen next to the original "Roots".
