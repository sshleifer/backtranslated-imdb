The plot is predictable. This has been done many times in other movies. You have summer camps competing in this one: rich children against underachieving students fighting for the right to "boast" in typical camp competitions, while children and comforters are looking for pranks, sex and "good time!" "Are you ready for the summer?" Meatballs is the first (and best) summer camp movie for a comedy of well-being. As others have pointed out, this is not Citizen Kane, but this type of movie is not supposed to be. The film works thanks to the fantastic timing of the cartoon and the classic line of Bill Murray. His scenes with a camper where he tries to elevate the child's self-esteem are very good. Bill's linings throughout the movie are very entertaining. <br /> <br /> I also like the fact that this movie is not dirty or explicit, unlike so many other movies about "teenagers at camp" today. There are some slight sexual insinuations and maybe a word or two of laughter throughout the movie. But Meatballs is the kind of teen movie that really suits young people. It's PG rated. <br /> <br /> This is a film that must be seen several times to have all the jokes! When Bill Murray is on screen or doing one of his classic "PA Announcements", you are drawn to the movie. Bill seems to be carrying the film alone. But he does it so well that when you see Meatballs, you'll realize it's the movie that made him a star! A note next to this review is to avoid ALL the aftermath of the Meatball movie. They are horribly bad.
