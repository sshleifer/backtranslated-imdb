John Landis really outdid himself when he directed the short film THRILLER by Michael Jackson. Of course, it's corny, the dialogue is horrible and everything seems too old, but it's still perfect. <br /> <br /> Michael and his date are at the movies to see the latest horror movie. When all this becomes a bit too graphic for the date, she goes away. Michael follows. On the way back, they decide to take a shortcut in the local cemetery. It starts there. <br /> <br /> The thriller dance is amazing. It is full of Jackson's trademarks, as well as some memorable zombies. He does not seem to be in a hurry at all, or too long. It all looks like a movie and it's actually pretty scary. Of course, this is one of the most famous clips of all time and is probably the biggest clip ever made. <br /> <br /> Overall, look at him, seriously. These 13 minutes will be among the best ever spent watching a screen. (5/5)
