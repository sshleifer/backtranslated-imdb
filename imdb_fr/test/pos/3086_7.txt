It's a funny movie and I like it a lot. Cary Elwes plays Robin Hood on a t-shirt. This is, of course, the usual good vs bad with Robin against the evil Sheriff of Nottingham. Humor is usually present in your face, but still works well. A comedy for an evening where you do not want to think too much, it's worth a rent!
