I'm not the type of person watching TV shows because the acting is usually nil, even unrealistic or TOO dramatic! But this show is perfect. Everyone can act and you can relate to the characters and their situations. Everyone has their own personality and Lorelai Gilmore is the best for his sarcastic comments that can make a bad situation look bad. Rory Gilmore is a good role model for all girls. She is proud to want to attend Harvard and boys / boyfriends always come in second place in her book. She is a faithful friend and always the peacemaker. There is a subtle romance that is what I personally love. This is not the delusional romance that few people have in their lives, but a realistic romance. All characters eventually understand, and they do not find their Prince Charming at first sight and do not "fall in love" with all the guys who come to them. It's a realistic show, but when you watch this movie, you'll do well to revise your movies, pop culture, and random facts, because Lorelai Gilmore always makes reference. I fell in love with this show and if you give it the chance, you too.
