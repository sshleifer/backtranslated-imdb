"Goodbye, Mr. Chips" is a superbly written and photographed musical version of the classic 1939 film. In addition to Peter O'Toole's admirably mastered and controlled performance as a pedagogue who finds love and is changed, film contains hundreds of breathtaking visuals, from Greek ruins to London's side streets, to an extensive montage in the countryside. The music and lyrics of Leslie Bricusse have been criticized as boring or unparalleled for movie musicals, but they are used to improve the story rather than tell it. Many songs are used to highlight montages or scenes; the few who are not relegated to "show numbers". In this way, the songs do not encroach on this delicate story but enhance what the characters think or feel. "Where did my childhood go?", "Cross the world with me" and "You and me" are particularly effective. A captivating film, brilliantly played, directed and written.
