"I know that I'm human, and if you were all of those things, you would attack me now, so some of you are still human, this thing does not want to show itself, it wants to hide inside. to fight if necessary, but he is vulnerable to the big day, if it takes us, he will have no more enemies, there will be no one left to kill him, and then he will be won. " > <br /> "The Thing" by John Carpenter is one of the most entertaining horror films ever made ?? fast, intelligent and purely exciting from start to finish. This is how all films of the genre should be made. <br /> <br /> The film, which takes place in Antarctica in 1982, is specifically dedicated to a group of American scientists. We do not receive any introduction to their mission, but we are immersed in their existence when a pair of apparently crazy Norwegians appear at their base camp, chasing a fleeing dog. The Norwegians are killed and the dog makes its way into the colony. That's when things start to go crazy. <br /> <br /> It is soon obvious that the "dog" changes shape. foreign organization, which manifests itself on the physical form of its victims ?? in other words, he begins to eat the Americans and imitate them so that the remaining humans can not discern the difference between their friends and their enemies <br /> <br /> The group of scientists led by MacReady (Kurt Russell) , start fighting for their own survival, using spirits instead of strength. If the Thing is indeed among them, then how will they reveal it? How many things are there? How can one kill the thing? (Or can it be destroyed at all?) <br /> <br /> The origins of the creature in the film are easily explained: 30,000 years ago, a spaceship plunged on Earth and was frozen in the Antarctic ice. The Thing tried to escape and was discovered on the ice by the Norwegians, who unconsciously released him from his natural prison. <br /> <br /> "The Thing", the film itself, is similar to Ridley Scott's iconic "Alien" (1979) .Many comparisons have been made ?? the protagonists are stuck in a sorry area, tracked by a rarely seen enemy who manages to kill them one by one.However, "the thing" ?? for all intents and purposes ?? came first. <br /> <br /> According to the famous John W. Campbell, Jr.'s new "Who Goes There?" (written under the pseudonym Don A. Stuart), the film was originally adapted as a feature film production in 1951 by Howard Hawks and Christian Nyby The result was "The thing from another world", an indisputable classic, but to be fair, it did not look like the new one, and the Carpenter remake makes it more accurate. <br /> <br /> The idea that Thing can adapt the physical character of anyone is what makes this film so great, and is the most vital link in the news.In 1951, the special effects The numbers were just too mediocre to reasonably represent the changing organism, but thirty-one years were the source of many advances in SFX. <br /> <br /> The creature effects artist, Rob Bottin, does a great job easily became a cheese party in a frighteningly scary (and realistic) mess of blood and fear. The thing, although never taking a specific form, is constantly seen in a phase of morphing, and the effects are simply superb. They still have punch twenty-two years later. <br /> <br /> Ennio Morricone's score (nominated for a Razzie Award at the time) is a bit too electronic and metallic, but remains obsolete if used correctly. <BR/> <br /> Because his cast is entirely composed of men, the fact that his end is one of the most stimulating and unusual conclusions of all time, "The Thing" ?? by all standards? Hollywood is unconventional at its best. It is not surprising that at the time of its release, "The Thing" had poor results in theaters and "E.T." ?? published the same year and featuring a much nicer stranger ?? has become the most profitable image of both (by far). <br /> <br /> In the long run, however, "The Thing" is superior in almost every conceivable way. The story of Spielberg is outdated and failed during the 20th anniversary reissue. "The Thing", by contrast, has gradually climbed the ladder of cult classics ?? This is one of the most famous non-famous films ever made. <br /> <br /> Carpenter is known for his very unequal career ?? From his incredible "Assault on Precinct 13" (1976) to the magnificent "Halloween" (1978) to the disappointing and stupid "Escape from L.A." (1996), "The Thing" remains his best film. Although his reputation over the years has never been honorable enough to be on the charts for most of the "big movies," "The Thing" is still one of my favorite horror movies, and ?? after a careful inspection ?? masterfully designed. It's a thrill ride, daring and ingenious, both unique and scary. a real relief for moviegoers who are tired of the same old horror simulacra. This one, at the very least, is truly unpredictable.
