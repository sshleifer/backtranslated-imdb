This is a fascinating documentary about a 15-year-old black boy accused of murdering a tourist in Florida and the ensuing legal case. This film shows how corrupt the American police system is and how easy it can be to convict an innocent man and how an old senile idiot who thinks a black man looks a lot like another man said he was the man who murdered my wife. The defense lawyer is brilliant. He is brilliant not only for his work in court, but also for what the police should have done from the beginning. Fascinating things. 7 out of 10
