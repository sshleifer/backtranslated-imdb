This is the film that started the cinematic love affair <br /> <br /> between the team of Jaundiced Eye and Matthew Ferguson. Her ability to describe RELATIVELY normal characters such as Birkoff in <br /> <br /> "The Nikita Woman" is counterbalanced by her as clever <br /> <br /> as "Kane" handling. We would like to be given only more roles, more important roles and others, even more complex to analyze to push the limits of its capacities. <br /> <br /> There have been four or five memorable scenes in this film, and Matthew Ferguson has stolen two of them from much more experienced actors. This movie itself is good, and deserves to be watched alone, but <br /> <br /> Ferguson makes it a little more special. His * work * could <br /> <br /> show what Anthony Perkins' career would look like <br /> <br /> if he had not been cataloged as long as "Norman Bates" </ br> > there is <br /> "Kane" is not as slumped as Norman, and far fewer people have seen "love and human remains" to the "psychopath" to be able to hope <br /> <br Ferguson will show us a glimpse of what Perkins could have accomplished if he had been allowed to do so.
