It was a very energetic and well played show. I saw it in '98 and my friends and I are still joking about it. Every time I look, it's always as funny as the first one. I also like the way everyone can be interested in a particular way. I can not wait to see more of John's texts and productions. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I can not find it anywhere for sale and I have searched a lot. If anyone knows of a website or store to refer to, I would appreciate it a lot because I am also looking for his other performances live. Please send me a message if any of you have any information on the subject. Thank you.
