Where do I start? I saw this film for the first time in 1995 and I did not know what to expect. At the time, I was looking for movies in which Elijah Wood had played and this one was highly recommended. I sat down and watched the movie once and did not know what to think. I watched it a second time a few days later and the floodgates opened. Never before in my life had I really cried while watching a movie, and I bluffed, every time I edited the film I was shooting, on an emotional roller coaster. <br /> <br /> It hit such a The emotional tension that reigns in me on many levels, the sadness and the intense exaltation we see in the film, the wonder and innocence of childhood, the ardent desire of a time formerly is no more. More than anything, this film reminded me of my childhood (with the exception of abuse) at a time in my life when I had ignored my childhood a few years ago and that I had not even really noticed, I I had abandoned her and gone to a life completely devoid of her. The radio flyer made me wake up and suddenly realized what I had left without really realizing it. From that day, I immediately started to change my life and myself. <br /> <br /> It's going to be corny, but deep down, I've rediscovered my inner child, I've embarked on a path that's still going on. over the last 6 years and has changed me so much, for the better, embracing and living this part of myself. I discovered who I really am. I do not think that was just the case for the good movie at a crucial time in my life, The Radio Flyer really did something very special, and I still consider it an incredible job in every respect, an incredible movie . <br /> <br /> In closing, I can not fail to mention the music. I'm a big fan of Hans Zimmer and it's one of his finest works. The breadth and depth of the emotional expression he put into the score of this film is an important part of what makes the film what it is for me. As subtitles to a film in a foreign language, its rising music is a cradle for the intense emotions that this film will make you live. Find the soundtrack at any cost, it was unfortunately deleted a long time ago. I did not expect to find it, but it's amazing, having chatted with someone I met on a Hans Zimmer fansite guestbook. <br /> <br /> Watch this film, let yourself live the emotions, do not get bogged down in the trivial frenzy of the end, be this child again
