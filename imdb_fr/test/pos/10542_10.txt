This movie is the best horror movie I have ever seen. the acting is terrible and the plot is poor but the puppet made me nightmares for weeks. seriously, if you have young children, do not let them see that. Of course, I am a bit biased because of an irrational fear of puppets and dwarves. also a double cameo body by the guy who makes me mini saw troyer. and free nudity, essential in any low budget horror movie. all the other horror movies will always be judged against that in my book.
