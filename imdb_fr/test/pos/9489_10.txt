Zeppelin is my favorite band, so when I heard that this double came out, I was naturally excited. I'm just going to go, and say that if you're a Zeppelin fan, you have to buy right now! It's absolutely spectacular! He blows "The song stays the same" completely out of the water. Why this material has never been published before is beyond me. The images presented here really show Zep at the top of his game, which I never really felt like "Song". Jimmy Page is without a doubt the best of all time, and these performances give Jimi Hendrix a strange look! Be on the lookout for 'White Summer' live concerts ... phew! <br /> <br /> Viva Jimmy Page! <br /> <br /> Viva Led Zeppelin! <br /> <br /> 11 out of 10
