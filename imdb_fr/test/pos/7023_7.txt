Jennifer Gray seems to be one of the strangest romantic threads and that's probably why this beloved film is so successful. It's fine to make a version of Montagus and Capulets with sweeteners like the dance and family tropes of the Jewish society stinging flesh, but it usually takes a X factor. <br /> <br /> Swayze probably makes this movie safe with its robust post-Travolta movements and temperament have been conquered by this curly-haired teenager Penelope Pitstop who puts the dream at the fingertips of the impressionable market. The superb soundtrack (dated - perhaps 'immortalized') is useful and of course, the cunning pretension of placing the film in a resort away from everyday life completely refines the fantasy. 7/10
