It's not really the best Canadian film of all time, IMO. I will not go astray and name 3 or 4 best. A few nights before, I had already seen "The Bicycle Thief", the great Italian classic, with some parallels. Both filmmakers shot their films at a specific time and place, with minimal resources in terms of scenery and distribution. And the result in both cases is fascinating and a joy to watch for the realistic setting and the characters alone. The persistent shots on faces and landscapes almost make it look on their own. That being said, this one is not quite in the same category as the Italian classic. The film was shot in an asbestos mining town in Quebec. This frigidity contrasts with the human warmth and the look of filmmaker Claude Jutra. Basically, you get a series of vignettes that are probably nostalgic memories of Jutra - not ah, funny ah - but poignant and probably sometimes difficult at the time, but now warmed by the patina of nostalgia. The film winds; there is little tension. Somewhere between half and two-thirds of the story begins. All the people you met at this stage are involved and you have come to know these characters well. so have a little patience at first. The story is good. that will leave you thinking, and that implies sex, love and death, all the basic elements. If you like Bergman, Godard, Truffaut, etc., you will not be disappointed.
