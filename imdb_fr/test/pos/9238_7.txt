watch this movie. it's really a good trick through the difficulties of making an independent film, and what happens when it explodes in the face of the filmmaker. There are a lot of things about punk rock, and the philosophy behind this movement and its relationship to this project. So, if you like old punk, American punk, you're going to dig it ... but beware, there are a ton of bad actors in the failed project that are incorporated ... but sometimes they come out in a fun way. and, in fact, some of the best actors are listening to people who have never participated in the pontificate of filmmaking and what they have experienced in the three years it took to bring all that. So, if you're about to make a movie, especially if you have not attended a film school or worked in the field, you should watch this and learn from the filmmaker's mistakes.
