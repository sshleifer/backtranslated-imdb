One of the many backwoods horrors that came out in the early '80s and, fortunately, it's one of the best. Yes, it's a cheesy plot, but I was pleasantly surprised by this movie because I thought it was really good and very fun, even though the killer could have been made a little more scary than he looked like a big slob. First of all, we have the local sheriff, whoever he is, who warns him not to go to these mountains, because they are very dangerous. But when the teenagers arrive, it does not seem very dangerous at all, finally in my opinion anyway. It's too bad we do not have movies like this anymore, and if we do, it's usually a terrifying and boring movie. <br /> <br /> This film is more about tension and scary than gore, because gore The postman is very low in this movie that I did not like, but other than that, it's still a good movie. <br /> <br /> In the end, you will have to look a long time and with difficulty to find this film and if you find it, you will like it and you will also be careful not to finish with the last girl and the killer, this is not what you expected.
