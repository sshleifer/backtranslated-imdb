It was a fascinating film, a film that really attracted me. I am a big fan of William H. Macy and he has achieved a wonderful performance. His great sympathy, coupled with the way his character broke the fourth wall, really gave me a sense of complicity in his actions. I found myself waiting impatiently for the whole house of cards to collapse around him (and by extension, as a confidante and silent witness). It took me several minutes for me to relax once the movie was finished, so I was excited. <br /> <br /> Good performances all around too, not just with Macy. Arkin was good enough, as was Cromwell (he was surprisingly fierce). In short, I highly recommend this film to all fans of Macy and / or the mystery of murder. But you may want to prepare yourself to feel a bit guilty.
