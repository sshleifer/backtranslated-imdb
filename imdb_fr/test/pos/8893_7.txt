Billy Crystal is Larry, a writer who has not written and who is suspected of murder in "Throw Momma from the Train", alongside Danny Devito and Anne Ramsey. The phrase "black comedy" was invented for this madness, which is a takeoff of Hitchcock's "Strangers on a Train". In fact, Owen (Devito) has the idea of ​​having his mother killed by Larry in exchange for the death of his former friend by the latter. "I saw the movie, intertwined," Owen told Larry. Not that Larry knows what he's talking about until it looks like it's too late, like "Strangers". Larry, a writing teacher, says his ex-wife, played by Kate Mulgrew, stole his book and put his name on it. She became a big celebrity, appearing on "Oprah", where she refers to Larry as "a beast". Owen is in Larry's class. He lives with an abusive Neanderthal mother (Ramsey) and has the impression of poisoning him by sticking scissors in his head. Shortly after seeing "Strangers on Train" travel to Honolulu to hunt down Larry's wife. As she leans over a boat ramp to look for an earring, Owen stands behind her and gets up ... Soon, the police are looking for Larry to question him, but he's at Owen's where he is invited to live until the end of the market, he had no idea what he did. You know, "crisscrossed". There are several scenes copied from "Strangers", which are hilarious. I especially liked Larry's confession about the sleeping woman, Mrs. Lift, Owen's mother, as when Guy thinks he's talking to Bruno's father-in-law. <br /> <br /> Crystal and DeVito perfectly master the dialogue and timing of comics and make you laugh. often out loud. Ramsey is repulsive and funny - a performance totally "out of the ordinary". Kim Griest and Rob Reiner also have roles - Griest is Crystal's girlfriend and Reiner has what it's like to make a cameo. <br /> <br /> The end is very clever and all the film will let you laugh.
