It's a spectacular production! I saw the show live twice in Chicago and my only problem with the production was the fact that I could only see fragments of what was going on. The scene consisted of three gigantic footbridges and the platform. When the action moves from one part of the scene to the next, you lose track of what is happening, wherever you are. As always, it is a sensorial overload provoking reflection, cleverly captured in high definition with 15 cameras! The images were brilliantly edited, one of the best concert DVDs of all time in my opinion! I only hope and I hope that they publish this disc on Blu-Ray of HD-DVD so that we can relive this extravagance again and again.
