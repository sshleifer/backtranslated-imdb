Probably because it's Columbia's first color film, colors look different, especially in indoor scenes. They seem to be stronger, sharper and the result is a little unrealistic, but very enjoyable. Randolph Scott is the sheriff, a good guy, but the real star of the movie is a very young Glenn Ford, an outlaw who wants to change. Evelyn Keyes is the woman who starts to fall for Ford and Claire Trevor is the countess who runs the show. There is a funny character called Nitro who does not think before blowing him. I particularly enjoyed two moments of the film, one at the moment when there is a tremendous debauch of horses and thousands of horses; there was no computer to help at that time, so I guess they had to collect all those horses, not an easy task. Another moment is the final shooting, technically very good. There is also a whole fight of fists. Seeing this Western created in 1943 with such beautiful scenes of action brings you to a sad conclusion: they do not manufacture them anymore. Would they be able to do it if they wanted to? I have my doubts.
