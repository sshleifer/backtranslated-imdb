Lotsa action, cheese love story, unexpected actors and a lot of fun. The special effects are acceptable / decent, some fights are pretty neat with interesting acrobatic movements. The whole story is evolving and is pretty old-fashioned to make you think of the inevitable, although there is a little resonance (just a little). The film's general naivety sometimes makes it quite fanciful. Pretty cute chicks too that ask for more. PS. If you want to see a movie like this again, try to describe it according to the category in which the movie would fall (not necessarily where it was supposed to fall). that is, do not bombard good cheese films!
