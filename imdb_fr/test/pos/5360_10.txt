Being a "fan of Wallace and Gromit", I was eager to see this feature film. Surprisingly, I saw it at the world premiere in Vlissingen (NL), at the Film by the Sea festival. It's a wonderful feeling to be one of the first to see this very funny and happy movie. This is Wallace and Gromit (who, in my opinion, do not need introduction) have their own pest control company in the city, which is organizing a giant vegetable contest in a few days. Everyone, including an eccentric baroness, hopes her carrot or giant melon will win the golden carrot. Unfortunately, the city is plagued by many hungry rabbits. This is where W & G come on the scene. They have their own tools to control these cute creatures in a humane way. <br /> <br /> It's a very funny and colorful story. Anyone who liked W & G's three previous shorts (which are more than awesome!), Will love this feature. Nick Park really delivered a wonderful and original result with a keen sense of humor. As in Chicken Run, I'm really amazed at how he can capture so many stories and emotions in just a few images. "Work well done, my boy" ;-) Oh yeah: The music was fantastic! This really completes the journey. Enjoy!
