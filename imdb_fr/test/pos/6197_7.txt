If you watch this series, you will get 10 interesting chapters on the story of a dormant cell and each character. And more intense with the infiltrate of the FBI. <br /> <br /> Nice story, nice characters and performances, but something is wrong (for me, of course). The final is wrong. You wait ten chapters hoping for a grand finale (regardless of whether or not they reach their goals) but ... well ... I think that's not enough. It's a small final for a big series. I was also hoping for more definitions on the character stories. <br /> <br /> But, I repeat, it's an interesting mini-series. If you do not want to wait with big series (22-24 chapters), look at it. I give 7 out of 10.
