The favorite trio of all fool imbeciles is racing in a hospital in this incredibly noisy and often hysterical whirlpool. These guys are undoubtedly the most incompetent group of doctors to have escaped forever on screen. The highlights of the comics include the Stooges constantly breaking a door glass, their meeting with a deranged patient who claims that the rats were coming out of the buttonhole of his shirt, the Stooges riding in the corridors by giant bicycle, a huge horse , and miniature race cars, and our extremely stupid trio accidentally leaving instruments in the abdomen of an unfortunate patient after having finished operating on the poor boy. The director, Ray McCarey, describes the frantic comical shenanigans at a frantic, uninterrupted pace, and enthusiastically stages a wide gag. Moe Howard, Larry Fine and Curly Howard are all in great shape, with the support of Dell Henderson as the hospital's longtime supervisor, Dr. Graves, and Jeanie Roberts as a hiccuping nurse (the scene where the Stooges are doing an absurd improvised band, one with this girl is absolutely awesome!), Ruth Hiatt as a whispering nurse, Billy Gilbert as a crazy mad patient and "Little Billy" Rhodes as a tiny patient. Crazy madness never misses a minute, making this beautiful baby berserk one of the best outings of all Stooges.
