[WARNING: CONTAINS SPOILERS] <br /> <br /> Written by spouses Wally Wolodarsky (who also directed) and Maya Forbes, this independent film is one of the best romantic comedies in recent history. <br /> <br /> Jay Mohr takes a break after playing the caring weasel to become the kindly boy in the face of the fact that his fiancée wants to sleep with other people and that he is allowed to do it too. Julianne Nicholson, who was so good in "Tully", plays bravely and is vulnerable with great enthusiasm. Too bad she does not get the recognition she deserves. <br /> <br /> Good support performance helps a lot too. Lauren Graham, who made last year's "Bad Santa" memorable, plays the blasé and cynical sister to perfection, Bryan Cranston (the father of television "Malcolm in the Middle") enjoys some fun and exciting moments , and Andy Richter plays a genius guy who falls in love with a single mother - Helen Slater in a credible, though familiar, role as a smiling woman. <br /> <br /> What surprised me most about "seeing others" is how fun it is. There are real laughs here. Ed's first attempt at meaningless sex gets a few broad lines, and there's a three-man house that elicits one of man's most truthful reactions as male fantasy changes. <br /> <br /> The film is not unusual. , but I liked the fact that it was Alice (Nicholson) who thought about it, much to Ed's (Mohr) chagrin. Given the genre, you know that, whatever his intentions, Alice's plan is doomed. We see how the couple works in this strange situation. Originally, Alice and Ed are motivated by the idea, but then the human element defines it. <br /> <br /> I appreciated that Forbes and Wolodarsky do not make a cheap sex blowjob. Yes, there is sex and nudity, but real emotions are at work here. The "other people" Alice and Ed are not part of the occasional sex. they also have feelings. In one case, too many feelings. <br /> <br /> Certain scenes have a joke too much, the subplot of Richter-Slater is not necessary and Alice is doing something really unusual. But this is forgivable because Mohr and Nicholson generate such intimacy and honesty - discover the scenes in which Ed searches Alice's lingerie drawer or her reaction to the announcement of the end of the experiment - that little it does not matter how much we could appreciate their little game, we for this couple to succeed. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this film has little or no advertising and limited release. Hollywood studios, whose romantic comedies often revolve around the disturbing, unfathomable and unsurprising, would do well to learn from this intelligent and entertaining film.
