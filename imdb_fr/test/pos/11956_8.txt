If I ever write or make films, I'd like one of them to look like this one. I appreciate the sense of humor and the jokes contained inside. This movie does nonsense without seeming. The names of places and characters are priceless: New York's generic high school, Calimari's squid (George's sister), etc ... genius. I saw this film so many times because it was a staple of cable TV when I was growing up, of course I did not have all the jokes but it was still funny. This film is an unprecedented classic.
