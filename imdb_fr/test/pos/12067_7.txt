Like many situation comedies, "The War at Home" improves with each episode. The characters start to become real and I believe them as family. I agree with a lot that the first episodes were not so funny; I thought the show would be canceled for sure. But with the absences of "Malcolm in the Middle" and "Arrested Development", "War" provides a well-deserved action comedy live for FOX on Sunday night. And compared to the rest of the sitcoms right now, "The War" is an even better choice. <br /> <br /> Its attraction, at least for me, lies in its real situations. Teenagers have sex. Not all parents like the results of their children. Parents fight and call each other. But instead of relying on the "bad guy" as in many shows, everything is good in the end, which is the number one rule of a good sitcom. <br /> <br /> One of the drawbacks of the show is the narration during / between the two. scenes. The style of the flashbacks "Arrested Development / Family Guy" works pretty well but the narration can be too long. <br /> <br /> Anyone who needs to watch Sunday evenings should consult "The War at Home". especially considering what is on the other major networks at this time.
