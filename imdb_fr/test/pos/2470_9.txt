I caught this movie on TV yesterday. I had some curiosity about it because it had been directed by Emilio Estevez and featured him and his real father, Martin Sheen. I like to see a movie about a father-son relationship that involves a father and a son from real life. Of course, there is instant chemistry between Sheen and Estevez, and their conflict scenes are even more intense, knowing that they are actually related. Of course, it is good that these two people are remarkable actors. I've already seen Martin Sheen in intense roles, but I think it's Emilio's most intense role - since I mostly remember him from the "Mighty Ducks" series - and I was very impressed . Talent really works in this family. And Kathy Bates steals the film in a performance worthy of the Oscars. She touched my heart with every word of dialogue. Kimberly Williams - the beautiful actress of the films "Father of the Bride" - is also very good, doing well among a group of talented veteran actors. <br /> <br /> The film is a little theatrical, with dialogue clearly designed for the stage, but it did not bother me. It's not supposed to be an action movie; it is a study of character. And for a movie based on a play, it is never too claustrophobic. When Emilio's character, Jeremy, remembers his days in Vietnam, his heart-rending memories come to life. <br /> <br /> The film is extremely powerful and realistic, without being sentimental. In the end, I expected all the conflicts to be resolved and the family to become radiant, but that's not how things went. The end made me cry, without resorting to classic Hollywood melodrama. It proves that reality is more exciting than anything Hollywood can imagine. <br /> <br /> If you want a magnificent and powerful drama with extraordinary performances, which will surprise you ... take a look at this underrated jewel. Hopefully one day, Martin and Emilio will join Charlie and they will all make an excellent film together. <br /> <br /> My score: 9 (out of 10)
