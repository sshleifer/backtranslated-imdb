A work of love. Every image is perfect and catches you. Then pure emotion and story take you into a dream that will remain long after the film. The director understands your heart and guides you through 100 minutes of visual poetry. You are part of the emotional journey of the characters. I saw this film in 2 festivals and it had ovations at each screening. The remarkable narrative transcends nationality and language and I felt like I was part of the drama unfolding before me. The casting is as perfect as possible. Vijay Raaz, Camille and Benoit each hold their own. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this film to anyone who appreciates good cinema. I am looking forward to the commercial release of this movie.
