Sui generis. People, I will not lie to you; Merhige is a marvel to one or two successes, but what a movie (he almost excuses SUSPECT ZERO). Nor will I pretend to understand it completely; Half of what makes them guess what they are doing on screen because of chiaroscuro. <br /> <br /> Richard Corliss said: "It is as if a Druidic cult had promulgated, for real, three biblical stories: the creation, the torture of the Nativity and Jesus and the death of Golgotha This is not a bad description, but there seems to be more than seemingly individual religious correspondences. <br /> <br /> There is an environmental theme close to the surface - note it towards the end (after the sterility of the landscape), there are large pipes similar to those of a construction site. Oh no, he'll say how people rape mother nature. We rarely see a dead metaphor in action, and with so much hyperbole, but seeing it play is much more painful than language suggests. <br /> <br /> And yes, if you just want something that synchronizes with a death metal soundtrack, it has the atrocities required. But for myself and for others like me, it's an important art film that deserves an exit from the Criterion collection. At the top of the ranking, FAUST of Murnau. <br /> <br /> ~ Ray
