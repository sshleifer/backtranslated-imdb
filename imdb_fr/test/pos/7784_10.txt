It's the best comedy movie I've ever seen ... My two favorite actors did a good job. Salman Khan and Aamir Khan cradled themselves. I hope to see the Andaz Apna Apna part 2 soon, because I heard that they would come back with Part 2 as well. I have a request to those who have not looked at it yet. please buy a DVD and watch it you will not feel bored. I watch this movie once a week. All the others were as good in this movie. Paresh Rawal, Shakti and others The music is also good, she also has beautiful songs. Salman Khan played a very good role, but also Aamir. <br /> <br /> You have to watch an excellent film of the actors and the director.
