A year after the release of the average "Frankenstein House", Universal released another Monster Mash where all their famous characters would collide. "House of Dracula" would bring Dracula, Frankenstein's creature and Werewolf together for what would be their final battle and finally close an era for the studio. Directed again by Erle C. Kenton, "House of Dracula" presents a slight but noticeable improvement over the previous film and delivers a better-constructed story (although still imperfect) that, far from being perfect, constitutes a more appropriate as the previous film. . <br /> <br /> The story ignores most of the events from the previous entry, "House of Frankenstein", and introduces a new angle to the story. Count Dracula (John Carradine), tired of having to hide in the sun, asks the help of the brilliant scientist, Dr. Edelman (Onslow Stevens), a physician renowned for his research in biology. Edelman becomes fascinated by Dracula and soon begins an experimental treatment. Larry Talbot (Lon Chaney Jr.), the wolf man, goes to Edelman to get rid of his fate. Soon Edelman realizes that Dracula is a monster that needs to be destroyed, but his own exposure to Dracula's blood is also developing an illness in him. The discovery of Frankenstein's monster (Glenn Strange) in nearby catacombs will bring more excitement to the mind of the brilliant scientist. <br /> <br /> After the previous monster clash, it's good to see the series go back to the origins and deliver an almost simple gothic horror returning to the dark pessimistic nature of this kind of movies and its away from comic relief from previous entries. The story (by Edward T. Lowe Jr.) has many interesting themes, such as the contrast between Dracula and Talbot (both seeking healing) and Edelman's increasing madness. The inclusion of Nina's character, a beautiful but distorted woman, who helps Dr. Edelman in the hope of being cured of his condition is probably among the most interesting topics. <br /> <br /> Director Erle C. Kenton is back this time, finally capturing the dark nature of these three characters, a seemingly lost nature in the previous movie. Despite the small budget, Kenton makes a gothic horror that, although simple, is quite effective and even manages to present old partners such as these characters. "House of Dracula" regains the charm of Universal Studios horror films and Kenton ensures that monsters have a chance to shine at least one last time. <br /> <br /> The cast is very good this time, Carradine, Chaney and Strange taking up their roles (although Strange's role is considerably reduced) with more enthusiasm than in the previous film. The addition of Onslow Stevens, Jane Adams and Martha O'Driscoll to the cast brings tragedy and drama back to the series, with Stevens giving an extraordinary performance as Dr. Edelman. A little cameo from Lionel Atwill and the presence of Skelton Knaggs as a terrifying Steinmuhl complete one of the best Universal horror movies in years. <br /> <br /> "House of Dracula" is a nice addition to the series, especially after the mediocre "Frankenstein House". It's nice to see Kenton get back into shape in a pretty serious horror movie, and although the plot is quite original, it's not only suffering from the budget, but the movie trying to do a lot in a very short time results. It is true that the characters all have very inventive scenarios, but the film devotes very little time to each of them to develop, and the film seems very rushed and disjointed. <br /> <br /> Although far from perfect, it is also far from the worst of the series. "House of Dracula" is a beautiful closing of one of the best moments for the kind of horror, a time when ghosts and ghouls roamed the misty nights and where mad scientists gave life to frightful monsters. Later, the monsters would be back in "Bud Abbott and Lou Costello Meet Frankenstein" (1948), but it would be a totally different context. after the previous disappointing entries, it's easy to dismiss "House of Dracula", but give it a chance and let the monster wander for the last time. 7/10
