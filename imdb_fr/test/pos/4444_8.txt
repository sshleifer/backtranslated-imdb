I am not a big fan of Lucio Fulci's films. Most of his 80s films have had their heyday, but have often appeared as poor imitations of Dario Argento. With the exception of the entertaining "Zombi" (which was an imitation of George Romero), I did not really appreciate them. I know that Italian horror often overlooks the plot, but the screenplay and characters in his films were far too meaningless, even by standards. That's why "Do not torture a little duck" surprised me. It's actually a very well done movie with a captivating murder mystery. This is perhaps the best giallo ever created, only seriously rivaled by the entries of Dario Argento in the genre. And unlike the previous giallo of Fulci "A lizard in the skin of a woman", it never lags. <br /> <br /> The direction of Fulci here is pretty good. It moves the story forward at a good pace and keeps the viewer interested all the way through. In addition, the conclusion of the mystery is a total surprise to the public. In addition, he adds some smart touches, such as optimistic soul music during a particularly disturbing sequence of cemetery beats. Overall, violence is under control and is used only when necessary for storytelling. The acting is good for most, too, full of familiar faces of the Italian cinema of the 70s. Thomas Milian and Barbara Bouchet are both super cool. The only weak link is Florinda Bolkan, whose performances are too excessive. This is the only laughable aspect of the film. "Do not Torture a Duckling" certainly comes with my recommendation and can be a good introduction to the giallo subgenre as a whole. (8/10)
