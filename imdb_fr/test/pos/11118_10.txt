This film tells the story of nine ambitious teenagers who are trying to follow their dream at the famous New York Performing Arts High School: Coco, the singer, Bruno, the modern Mozart, Lisa, Leroy and Hilary, dancers in trouble, Ralph, comedian, and Doris and Montgomery, the actors. If they think they have all the assets to achieve their goals, they will need much more than their talents. They will face rejection, sorrow, education, pain and love to become famous. <br /> <br /> "Fame" is one of the most entertaining, classic and inspiring films of all time. It contains everything a teen drama or musical comedy should have: extremely entertaining and entertaining songs, performed by the astonishing Irene Cara, Academy Award-winning, breathtaking dance numbers, a very appealing cast that makes you believe to the raging scene characters when Coco meets the video camera. <br /> <br /> As I said, the casting is great. Irene Cara can really play, and it's not just her singing that makes her shine here as Coco. Lee Curreri is very good like Bruno. Barry Miller brings a lot of humor to Ralph. Maureen Teefy is great as a rejected Doris, and look good, you'll see Paul McCrane's "ER" in the role of Montgomery. <br /> <br /> It's really an amazing movie. "Fame" really touched me and inspired me to continue to realize my dreams of actor and singer. Any movie that touches me so much is a winner in my book. A must see! The film really touched me and inspired me to follow my dreams of actor and singer.
