When Precious Bane aired in the United States, this beautiful story stunned me. All the actors were brilliant. Clive Owen really understood the character he played. I immediately went to a bookstore and ordered the original novel, which is even more beautiful and is out of print just after buying the book - even though I've seen it online a few times now. I had also hoped that with Janet McTeer's Oscar win and Clive Owen's huge popularity, the BBC would naturally get that great DVD production ... I can not believe that all these years later we were still have no DVD. This must be the only production ever created by the BBC that is NOT for sale. Come on BBC - you have money to make us fans here. Get this on DVD please!
