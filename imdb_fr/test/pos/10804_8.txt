Unlike http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098238/, this movie does not provide any basic information. We are shown a snapshot of Danton's fall, its artificial process and its execution, but, unless we study the revolution in some detail, it is difficult to understand where the characters come from (Fouquier-Tinville, Philippeau, Desmoulins, Robespierre ...) and so to appreciate them for what they are: Danton and Joe Blobb could be the same person for the viewer. For example, Robespierre and Desmoulins were close friends since their youth, which explains the behavior of Robespierre. Those who know the facts, however, will easily move and enjoy this good movie with actors offering a solid acting, no useless plot and a good reconstruction of the time. Desmoulins and Danton are the best characters, but they all do a good job, even the "crazy" Saint-Just depicted as a kind of psychopath. Terror was a period of massacres whose importance was not fully documented and which, for the most part, were motivated by ambition, greed and the resolution of personal conflicts, fueled by ignorant sans-culottes at the time. the eve of the next decisive step against tyranny. .
