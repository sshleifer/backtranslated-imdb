I avoided this movie as a boy because I thought it would be boring - no fights or shots, cops, thieves, cowboys or Indians. It really was not a cool movie to love. So, I did not see TRC until I was twenty and I found it one of the most beautiful and captivating films I've ever seen. All the actors deliver the characterizations to perfection and each emotion is drawn from the spectator scene by scene. The filming and filming are deceptively simple, but they seem so natural and have completely plunged me into the story. My two favorite scenes are Bobbie's birthday party and the one on the station platform, towards the end, directed and edited to perfection. The quality and phrasing of Jenny Agutter's voice when she calls, "Dad! My dad!' key emotion of the viewer. Tears gush into my eyes and I think about it. <br /> <br /> This adaptation is not just a film, it is a precious art, it is also a perfect example of what all filmmakers should be. strive to achieve ?? creating an emotional experience.
