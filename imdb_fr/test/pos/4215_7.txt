I will be honest, I rented this movie only because it was part of the series "Child's Play". I was expecting a boring and boring fourth part of the series, but I was surprised. This movie was surprisingly good and I found it quite funny. There was a lot of black humor and the idea of ​​having two dolls was a good way to spice things up. The two dolls worked well together and added a guy Bonnie and Clyde to the movie. Overall, it was great for a 4th movie in the series, with some horrific death scenes (just watch the guy marilyn manson get killed early, not to mention john ritter getting a face full of nails). Applauds the writers for spicing things up, and the end even if I found it a little strange still leaves room for ANOTHER continuation ... maybe "son of chucky" !!!
