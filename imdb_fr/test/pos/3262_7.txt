This Australian film shot in 1999 does a good job in describing a gang of crooks at Kings Cross in Sydney. The plot focuses on the fate of a young unfortunate whose life is in danger after sabotaging a job for his future boss. Very well played by Heath Ledger and Bryan Brown. The plot is quite credible with some very humorous moments in a scene that revolves around a bank robbery. The setting up of various central themes of history is rather well done. For example. When a crim searches for bullets for his firearm. Personally, I do not like gratuitous violence in movies and, in this respect, the film did not offend. He tried and managed to show us the human side of bad guys like Bryan Brown. The rest of the cast did a decent job, with no noticeable difference that I can remember. The management has been very successful in making a credible film offering good entertainment. The main feature that makes this movie a good movie is Heath Ledger's acting and directoring and his successful portrayal of a naive young man who makes stupid mistakes for short-term satisfaction, thinking that he is indestructible and not realizing that there are sinister people waiting to jump on any mistake. The director, Gregor Jordan, deserves special mention. Note in my book - 7 (out of 10).
