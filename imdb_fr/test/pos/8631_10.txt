Although copies of this film are difficult to find, if you can find it, get it! !!! I believe it was, apart from In In Navy, the only musical comedy of Abbott and Costello. Although they have twisted the plot a bit, (I've never heard a version where the butcher rides with him), you still enjoy Jack's antics, a bit silly but adorable, and the greedy butcher, Mr. Dinklepuss . This is a bit like DuBarry Was a Lady, this tumultuous movie will make you roll on the floor - only to get up and dance as Lou Costello sings. (I do not know why they did not do it in other movies.)
