I have to rate this film at a 10. I'm sorry but I think it's a classic comedy. so, if you give this rating to other Madonna movies ... well, what? you want to tell me it was not his best movie? Mira Sorvino did not win an Oscar for almost the same performance, not ten years later? Please, this movie deserves a lot more credit than it has. In addition, I like to see a sociological study A + on the lifestyles of the 80s. Do you remember when you could have shoplifted Sam Goody and Cartier the same day? Do you remember when women proudly wore bushy eyebrows? so it was not "the last emperor", it was always good. there are some movies that I would be ready to watch every day. three, in fact, it meshed my day and makes me smile. if you like "Who's That Girl?" so I would also recommend "Party Girl" and "Romy and Michelle's High School Reunion".
