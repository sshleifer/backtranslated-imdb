Anderson's animation easily rivals Pixar's and goes far beyond anything I've ever seen at Disney. Although some say the story is a little too abstract, I find it a refreshing and refreshing change from the exaggerated characters and clumsy animals commonly found in animated shorts. It's an interplanetary version of CASTAWAY! Anyone who has left the security zone of their home and left alone in a scary and scary place will easily identify with this abandoned microbe. Great job, Mr. Anderson! <br /> <br />
