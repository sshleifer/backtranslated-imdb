No matter what country you are in, you have to buy this show, Sure It is Australian and if you've ever seen an attempt at our comedy, they are really nil, but with the hunter, they are not boring. They are forty years old. A team of people talking about the news (pretty much in Australia) do not care about our shit ads, mock our politicians, and so on. <br /> <br /> The guys also had a show in 2002 called Cnnnn that was not as successful as the war that started only this year, so all they talk about is a news that is really good, considering that they are boring or tragic, they try to highlight things with humor.
