It's really an excellent show. I do not have a cable, so I started renting them because my friend recommended it. I thought it would be a teen soap, you know, who goes out with who, that kind of thing. But it was not. It's surprisingly deep. It's also very spiritual. It is moving at a very fast pace, and there are more and more jokes that you catch every time you look at it. It's a dramatic comedy, which is rare when done well. This is the relationship between Rory and Lorelai. Instead of the classic mother-daughter relationship, it's a story of the best friendship - of a mother and her daughter. The characters are perfectly molded and all do a superb job. It's definitely the best TV show I've ever seen.
