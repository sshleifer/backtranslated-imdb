Here's a much less well-known 50s science fiction with a slightly different twist. A son of atomic researchers is kidnapped and held for a ransom of the Father's atomic secrets. <br /> <br /> This is a tightly knit science fiction thriller with high production values ​​and above-average behavior, even from childhood. The Atomic City actually has a movie sensation unlike many of the science fiction of the 50s of that time that looked more like an episode of a television show. <br /> <br /> The Atomic City has also been nominated for Oscars for best screenplay - How many sci-fi films of the '50s can they claim for an Oscar nomination? <br /> <br /> Great pace, tight direction and some great filming locations in the "real" atomic city of Los Alamos, New Mexico make it worth stalking. The outstanding impression of collectors is a transfer above the average and is an excellent double feature with Atomic Man !! <br /> <br /> Recommended.
