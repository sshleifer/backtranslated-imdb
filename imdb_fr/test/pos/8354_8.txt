Another good animation of Disney. The suites are not always so good and tend to follow the same scenario as the original. However, Tramp's son tries to savor the world outside the home and family he knows and learns who he really belongs to. Being a dog of the case is not for everyone, uh dog, but Scamp overcomes adversity. The voices of the various characters were superb and provided by several well-known actors such as Scott Wolf, Alyssa Milano and Mickey Rooney. An entertaining and well done family movie.
