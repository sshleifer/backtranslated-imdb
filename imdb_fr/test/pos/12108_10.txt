Crossing the bridge: The sound of Istanbul was one of the most enthusiastic applause of the public when it ended and quite meritoriously. I was not expecting too much of a music documentary, but the film turned out to be much more than that. It was also a visual documentary of Istanbul with strong contrasts of old and new, Western and Eastern, poor and rich, modern and traditional. The black and white photographs of old Istanbul by renowned Armenian photographer Ara Guler were exceptional. But of course, the main theme was music, and by God, what variety! It was similar to the Bueno Vistas Social Club; the love and respect of the interviewer -Alexander Hacke replacing Ray Cooder- for the musicians sank off the screen and overwhelmed us all. The music was especially interesting. The jazz session by a group of Roma gypsies in a small western Turkish town was hallucinating. I would not be surprised if travel agents start receiving group booking requests for Kesan after the film's release. But I liked Muzeyyen Senar the most, who looked surprisingly smart to be burlesque and gave him a tip "Raki" bravely said, "My voice and I are 86 years old!" Bravo Faith Akin. I bet there are many more Turkish musicians who feel excluded: go for volume II please.
