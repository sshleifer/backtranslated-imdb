When the Romulans come, they will not carry gifts; no, they bring with them war - war and conquest. As all the regulars of this episode know, this is a reworking of the war movie "The Enemy Below" of the fifties. The obvious difference is that instead of a battleship and a submarine (or an American destroyer and a German submarine) engaged in deadly war games, these are two ships space in outer space. In this episode, in the history of Trek, about 100 years before the events, Earth fought against the Romulan Wars. After about five years of conflict, an impasse resulted in a treaty and the establishment of the neutral zone, a border between us and the Romulan empire. Now, on this plateau, the treaty seems to be broken, our outposts being attacked and destroyed by a weapon of immense power. Yes, the Romulans are back and testing their new war toy. Kirk must now earn his salary: he must make decisions that will affect this area of ​​the galaxy, for example, find a way to avoid ... Oh, I do not know - an interstellar war, maybe? <br /> <br /> I think what makes the episode so effective is that it does not fear the darker aspects of the war, as one would expect from a simple TV episode of the sixties - in particular an episode of a science fiction show. Everything is very tense and captivating, as in the best war movies, as when Kirk sits down with his main officers for a council of war. The writers and actors are not laughing here: all this prepares for a horrible conflict, potentially the beginning of another battlefield of several years. In the final analysis, Kirk's goal is to limit this battlefield to both ships - but even in this case, it is an effort fraught with pitfalls and probable losses. In fact, I believe this episode holds the record for the number of ship casualties at the end. From the beginning of the episode, we see the devastation that this battle can generate, in this outpost supposedly well protected. Then start the cat and mouse war games between the Enterprise and the Romulan ship - it's as exciting as any conflict we've seen on the big screen. Of course, if you do not like war movies, you will have to look for other things to admire in this episode. <br /> <br /> What elevates this episode even more is the revelation of what and who the Romulans are - it's a kind of electric shock. At present, the conflict between the teams continues on the bridge of the Enterprise - the war tends to bring out the worst in some people. Due to still nasty attitudes about race in this future, the tension goes up even further - Kirk has his hands full in this one. I suppose that one of the weaknesses of history is that the conclusion of the problem of bigotry is convenient. On the Romulan side, actor Lenard made his first appearance in the Trek universe as a Romulan commander. he's great in the role, the backhand of Captain Kirk or Captain Pike, make your choice, prepared to look like Spock more than a little bit. Surprisingly, his character is not hungry for war as one might expect, another revelation of this episode. The actor would then return to this universe as Sarek, Spock's father, so he is nothing if not versatile. It also shows how the first appearance of characters such as Romulans is usually their best plan, as is the case here. They appeared in "The Enterprise Incident" next.
