Okay, so I read most of the reviews on this movie, as well as the comments left by visitors to this site, and I get the impression that most people who have written reviews do not really like this movie. That's why I'm writing now - I represent the minority because I did it. I admit that I went to see the film because I am very impressed by the fascinating abilities of Ryan Gosling and the projects he has been involved in lately have been simply incredible. He is an incredible actor. That said, I wanted to see this movie because it seemed intriguing to me ... why? Because it's a thriller where you know "polar" from the start, which is rather unusual. <br /> <br /> As the plot progresses, two teenagers attempt to commit the "perfect crime" because they believe in a crooked. the philosophy that human beings are truly free only by the perpetration of criminal acts - and, let us remember, innocent, act according to their will. The relationship between Richard and Justin was complex, evoked homosexuality and was brilliantly interpreted by Ryan Gosling and Michael Pitt. Gosling was the talker who manipulated and controlled, and Pitt was the extremely clever and socially clumsy pariah. Enter the character of Sandra Bullock, whom most people have not particularly appreciated. I think when people see that she was the executive producer, they automatically assume the role that the actor has in the thing. I did not see that as the case here. Without Cassie's personal story about the ex-husband who almost killed her, who, unsurprisingly, shared the same traits with Richard Hayward, she would never have pursued her instincts about Justin and from Richard. The case was apparently airtight against Ray, the unsuspecting school janitor and friend of the boys. Even when the boys are interviewed near the end of the film, neither Bullock nor his partner have any solid evidence about them, other than the fact that they lied about getting to know each other and the vomit Justin left behind. view. This is where the genius of the film lies because the philosophy that boys tried to prove by killing, the irreproachable behavior of the will as "true freedom" ended up working against Justin, who ended up having a conscience ( and ends up leaving some of his consciousness at the garbage dump). Without this crucial piece of evidence, they almost suffered a "murder by number". And for the readers who were perplexed about the title as much as me, I glanced at it and found that something "done with numbers" (like a painting) suggests careful and careful planning. There's also a Sting song called "Murder By Numbers", but that's beside the question. :) <br /> <br /> Many readers have questioned the need for Cassie's relationship with her partner, but I think it really meant how cynical and manipulative she was because of her story . Like it or not, her story plays an important role in this film, because without it, she would probably never have followed her instincts about Justin and Richard. Yes, it was a bit of cliche `women scorned, the woman playing the vendetta in every facet of her life ', but I think that without the depth of Cassie's character, you just have another movie about teen killers and they may have gotten away with it. There is no movie there. <br /> <br /> And to the reader who commented that the teenagers obviously did not commit the perfect crime because the police had been watching them from the beginning, can I remind you that the reason was footprints placed on purpose and fully traceable. The boys wanted to be involved - it was a game. They were so convinced that they committed the perfect crime that they wanted to see for themselves the difficulty that the investigators would have to discover what they think is the truth. What they did not expect was that Cassie Mayweather had a case of too active instinct that settled on her side. A bit incredible? May be. But many crimes were solved by police officers who followed their instincts. However, it's a FILM! <br /> <br /> I saw this movie three times in movie theaters, and each time he revealed to me a little more, and I liked a little more. The more I watched him, the more I was captivated and frightened by Richard Hayward's psychological depth - there are people who really like it. My main complaint about the film would be that they should have placed the interactions between Justin and Richard a little more in the center (because, let's face it, the plot is in the whole movie) and that my main props are going to characterization - each character was very distinct. and interesting in its own way. It was very well played, although I would have given a little more depth to the character of Ben Chaplin (he is a good actor) and perhaps even reduced to the minimum the character of Bullock. <br /> <br /> I think everyone should stay tuned. Remember that for a Hitchcock-type thriller like this that basically tells you about "whodunit" at the beginning, it's very difficult for writers to keep the audience's attention until the end. I think they did very well by using a few small intrigues, slowly revealing the different character dynamics and illuminating the screen with emotionally charged performances by young actors Ryan Gosling and Michael Pitt. I think that if we remove our innate cynicism and try to see how complex the characters and their interactions are psychologically, we may be able to look beyond the apparent conspiracy holes and see the actual texture and quality of this film, if only by the characters who: have been brilliantly portrayed. Especially Richard Hayward. Not that I am biased. :)
