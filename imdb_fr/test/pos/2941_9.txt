Yes, I am ashamed to admit it, but this show is positively DEVINE !!! It's so much fun, and I have the greatest time to watch it. Everything since cycle 1, it's been great, and I did not notice a fall from his Tyra Banks, as you know, is l 'host. And as fabulous as it is, there are also the other judges and co-hosts such as J. Alexander, Jay Manuel, Nigel Barker and Twiggy. The essential of the show is for all the girls invited to become the next Top Model of the America, must rise to the top by completing and winning photo shoot competitions. It sounds good already, and let me tell you that IT'S GREAT !!!! It's great to watch the different types of photo shoots taken by girls, and each is different, cool and daring. Anyone who hates this show has no idea and I will tell you that this show will be broadcast for a long time, so deal with it!
