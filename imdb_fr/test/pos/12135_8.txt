So you think you've seen all the mafia movies ever made! Here is one of which no one has heard. It's a low budget B-movie, quickie - shot in the Jersey Marshes. For us mob-movie fans, there was a bit of everything - sex, violence, curse and wise guys acting like "gafones". While violence dominated the film, I laughed at some of the familiar scenes I've seen since in The Sopranos and Goodfellas. Look for a 1977 version of "Badabing Girls" at the beginning of the film. <br /> <br /> All our favorite gangster stereotypes have been presented here. And, as for realism, "fugettaboutit"! Joe Pesci was superb, describing the classic character of the sage as we have seen him do so many times over the years. It was probably his first shot, and it was a jewel. Pesci fans should visit the video store to watch this film. You must examine it carefully because it bears different names. My copy called it "The Family Enforcer". Here he is called "the collector of death". But whatever his name is, he should be called - A winner.
