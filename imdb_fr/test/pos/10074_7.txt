I saw this film the day it opened in New York, at Ziegfield. At the time, Madonna was not quite the cultural icon she is now. She had some hits, was very good in "Desparately Seeking Susan" and I had tickets to see her in concert at Giants Stadium. <br /> <br /> "Who is this girl?" gives Madonna a real role to play, which is not just a variation of her own personality. She does the crazy routine / heroine better than you think. Griffin Dunne is very well chosen to embody the man who will attend all the shenanigans. <br /> <br /> The story features a huge cat named Murray, a future bride who slept with every New York father-in-law taxi driver, and a key. There are a lot of car chases and cops going their way. All elements of a comedy screw are intact. <br /> <br /> Sir John Mills is briefly seen. He shares a glass of champagne with the main guests and owns the largest apartment on the Upper West Side, with a rainforest and everything in between. <br /> <br /> Compared to most of Madonna's movies (the ones I've been able to tolerate anyway), it's fantastic. In itself, it is not so bad. 6/10. <br /> <br /> PS The concert was bad.
