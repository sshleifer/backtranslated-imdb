Contrary to what many might think, this film is a type of film and an attitude "against the system". This is an excellent representation of the "system" in question and its ridicule. The fun parts of the movie are actually fun because they tell the truth about the world around us. Anyone who finds this film unrealistic simply denies the obvious truths about life. And it's to learn what you like. That's what college should be. <br /> <br /> I just noticed that a comment must have at least 10 lines. I think I gave my opinion about it. So, now, I'm writing a few more lines to fill. I hope you have been entertained during this time. I encourage you to go see the movie. It's worth it as long as you follow and immerse yourself in the film.
