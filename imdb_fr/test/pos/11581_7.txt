I guess it's quite a feat to be able to present to an audience a real tail about a fragile man; a tail in which the protagonist will spend most of the film on his back, in a bed and totally unable to move. And yet, the realization lies in the effectiveness of the film as a dramatic piece; as a memory of a true story and as an argument for why people should have the right to die if they wish. But the film is not a political statement and perhaps, fortunately, it avoids too many scenes of debate, although it includes one for the purposes of the discussion anyway. In addition, it is one of those films in a foreign language that presents its main character as a cripple who can not do anything, but who speaks to the people around him, and who can nevertheless seem engaging and convincing anyway. <br /> <br /> Thus, rather than being an incessant argument, the film is more of a drama that is both sweet and timely when another person wants something or is looking for something; The only difference is that by reaching this "goal" it would mean the end of someone's life and it would be possible to physically go there. Javier Bardem is an interpreter of Galician Ramón Sampedro, an individual who, much earlier, plunged into a shallow clearing for such activity. This made him bedridden for the rest of his life and his desire to die is central to the film by Chilean director Alejandro Amenábar. We have seen so many films in our lives in which the characters have certain goals or objectives to reach before the end of the film to provide a satisfying experience to the audience, but the change of pace in The Sea Inside is sweet; it does not involve young, energetic and attractive heroes who go to fight in distant places, but a real person after something that matters so much to them. <br /> <br /> Even if you have a firm policy, either pro or anti-euthanasia, you can hope that Ramón will get what he wants in the end. The film sets the tone very early with Ramón who explains why he wants to die by watching his family members, immediately presenting the situation and submitting it to an audience that may not know what the film is about. It is interesting to note that some family members are "opposed" to what he wants, which could put any member of the public sensitive to the subject in his respective shoes. But the purpose of this installation is to tell the public: "No, it is not one man after another who has also the whole family who supports him to the end". Quite easily, the film could have taken a path in which the Sampedro family is opposed to everyone, but some are an anti-Ramón idea; some are too young to admit what is really happening and others are apparently too upset to have a different opinion than they want to stay longer in Ramón, they love it after all. <br /> <br /> The sea Inside, we find the story of a story that revolves around a kind of victim. Ramón is quadriplegic and we see things from his point of view. It's something that can discomfort the viewers or make the film rather strange, as we are presented with a film from the point of view of the victim rather than an instigator or a main character in a film that is always inducing the cause the cause and effect reader. But this is not a criticism and it is a credit to the director for having applied such an approach in the most efficient way possible. The film asks questions. he offers a scenario to his audience. If you were in Ramón's place: what would you do, would you think, would you dream or speak? Therefore, Juila's (Rueda) lawyer's dreams are not so much for the public's enjoyment, but rather as a little window to a man's escape fantasies stemming from his plight. <br /> <br /> Julia's study intensifies a little later, when she begins to share some similarities with Ramón, she begins to have cerebrovascular accidents due to a disease. This trait seems timely in the progression of their relationship and adds an additional ingredient of connection in addition to an already engaging friendship. It's because Julia feels physical pain and restraint, not in the sense that she is unable to get up and walk, but I think she realizes the value of life given the pain she felt before. Although the film is based on a true story and covers the subject of euthanasia, it resembles a more realistic drama depicting a man in a situation in which he is ready to fight for what he wants but must do it verbally. It's refreshing to see films like The Sea Inside, which not only refer to the story and give us a glimpse of it, but which, as an independent film, offers a level of emotion and commitment.
