All Risto Jarva's films are worth seeing. Some, like "Jäniksen vuosi" and "Loma", are the best films of their kind and have achieved the status of Finnish cinema-history classics. <br /> <br /> Most people have left an impression of the actor Antti Litja thanks to the film Jarva films. Litja played a leading role in three of Jarva's films, all of which have been successful at box office and in film critics. <br /> <br /> It is nice to see that the idea of ​​"Jäniksen Vuosi" still lives in commercials (I believe The TV show of the operator Sonera where Litja walked in the mountains fell in Lapland with the Hare in the arms Everibody who saw the film knows what I am talking about ..) "Jäniksen Vuosi" is a beautiful film with great actors and good shooting locations like the famous little town of Lapland, Sodankylä, where stands the best film festival in the world - the Midnight Sun Film Festival. I recommend everyone to go in June - but remember warm clothes and a raincoat :)
