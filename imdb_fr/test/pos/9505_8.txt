This video was my first introduction to residents, and I could not stop reading it for the past three days. The visuals are more dynamic and more inventive and technically complex than the ones I've ever seen on big or small screens. <br /> <br /> The DVD however loses points for the unnecessary addition of new music. Residents' original music is like nothing you've ever heard and it's really going to refine your brain in the best way possible. However, the new music is consistently uninteresting and, in most cases, rather bad compared to some classic pieces. In addition, the incomplete video of Vileness Fats seems VERY incomplete and I could only understand the plot of the story after a long reading of the notes on the disc. <br /> <br /> This DVD contains a lot of notes. Fresh Easter eggs that will probably appeal to long-time resident fans. Tip: Look on the note pages for icons that should not be there. <br /> <br /> From a technical point of view, the disc is one of the best DVD transfers available. There is practically no observable pixelation and only a little ardor in the strong contrast points. <br /> <br /> Congratulations on a first class presentation. This record really deserves your attention.
