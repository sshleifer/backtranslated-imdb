People are stupid. You should not applaud when Paris gets killed in the head with a pipe! It's just rude! What did Paris do to you? And if it was you? Anyway, it was really gore, which I liked and it was cool when Elisha's finger cut off. It was weird to see that these sons did not have 2 sons, they had the tree and all This makes way for a movie House of Wax 2: Ressurction or something like that. Paris was great in the pursuit scene. The chemistry of Elisha and Chad is great, they deserve an Oscar. Paris and the type of Cousin Skeeter being fucked.Lol.K bye.
