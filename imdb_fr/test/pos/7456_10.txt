Perhaps the deepest drawing made in the United States, "Duckman" is limited to 70 episodes in four seasons. <br /> <br /> Contrary to the often innocuous criticisms of "The Simpsons" (a very good show in its own right). and the rude humor of "South Park", every part of this series follows a plan. The critics of American society, from its mercantilism to its egoism, have more teeth than any other animated series. <br /> <br /> The cultural references in "Duckman" also tend to be sometimes obscure (whoever the fan sites will realize that most have not even been caught). In this he is different from "The Simpsons", who usually uses pop culture instead of the sophisticated stuff often hidden in "Duckman". As other people who write about it, the characters (Bernice, Duckman and Cornfed) develop. In addition, by making the main character not only an offensive neurotic, but also a person who lives a personal tragedy (as shown by episodes such as "The Once and Future Duck" ("You'll love it until the end of your days) "... ') and in" Bev takes a vacation "(when he grabs Beverly to tell everything he could not tell Beatrice), the series is steeped in a deep sense of reality. <br /> <br /> One can not help but be sorry for him and his lucid madness. <br /> <br /> In total, in my opinion, the best cartoon ever made in the United States and one of the best series of all time. I doubt However, far too many things that the Duck has said make more sense today.
