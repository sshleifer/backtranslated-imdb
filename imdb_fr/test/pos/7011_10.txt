It's funny how time has passed and I've never seen this movie ... 'until last week when I was in love. I saw it twice a week and that still was not enough. It's a good movie and I'd love to see it again. The story is great and it really touched me. I would like to live such a story. The actors are great, the music too and you can dream of your own love story. I just hope that one day I will find the opportunity to learn to dance like Johnny and Baby. I have the impression that dance connects people and brings them together. I think people should learn to dance ... it helps a lot, especially in a relationship. It's great to feel the dance in your blood and in your body.
