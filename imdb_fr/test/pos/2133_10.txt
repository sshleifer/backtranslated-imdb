If this film was directed by DW Griffith or Stanley Kubrick, it would be recognized for what it is: a cinematic masterpiece narrated with depth, subtlety and passion, a movie unmatched in visual terms. He is constantly astonishing and also very brutal in his description of our great legacy of greed and annihilation. And of course, what the critics could not accept is that it does not tell a simple narrative narrative, like 99% of Hollywood production. His characters are complex and confused by their passions and thoughts, their fears and their emotions. They even seem to think, something that your average movie critic does not understand and can not stand, so they destroyed it. See the original widescreen version uncut. That's wonderful.
