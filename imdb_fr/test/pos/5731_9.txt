This program was very interesting. The presentation of the program made it all the more interesting. String theory is also very interesting to listen to. The whole three hours in my opinion were worth it. I liked listening to the ideas given by physicists. The extra dimensions really amaze the mind. If you have the chance, watch this incredible documentary.
