The entire film, an artistic adaptation of one of Joyce's "Dubliners", takes place on the night of January 6 (Epiphany), 1906. The bulk of the film takes place at an annual party organized by three singles ( two sisters and their niece). ), where a group of upper class Dubliners gather for a night of music, recitations and dinners. Although there is very little plot in itself, the interactions and discussions among the group members reveal a lot about Dublin in the early 20th century, when the beginnings of independence were just beginning. The actors, all the talented Irish actors, except Anjelica Huston, are universally wonderful, and you really feel invited to the rally. The poignant final scene, between Mrs. Huston and the astonishing Donal McCann, says a lot about the marriage of the characters. There's poignantness mixed with humor and insight, and for those who like quiet, well-thought movies, "The Dead" is highly recommended. My wife is from Dublin, we do a ritual watching this beautiful movie every January 6th. After several views, he never fails to touch me and every time I glean something that I missed before.
