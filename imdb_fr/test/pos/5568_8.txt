When I saw the first episode of Farscape for the first time, I did not know what to expect. I was immensely impressed and satisfied with "Premiere". Subsequent readings, however, made me aware of many imperfections I had missed in the beginning. "Premiere" is not a fantastic episode of Farscape, but it deserves to be credited with having prepared it successfully and effectively and giving the basic story to many normal characters. <br /> <br /> The episode begins with John Crichton (Ben Browder), astronaut and scientist, getting ready to take off in Farscape Module, a small spacecraft perfected by Crichton and his friend DK. Crichton has a revealing conversation with his father, Jack Crichton, and then begins his test flight into space. Of course, everything goes wrong and Crichton is "shot down in a wormhole" and wraps up in "a distant part of the galaxy". <br /> <br /> After leaving the wormhole, the Crichton module is fired aboard a ship's vital space. From there, the characters and the story of the Farscape series are presented in a fun but hasty way. <br /> <br /> The usual characters are correctly presented during the first half of the episode. Of course, there is Crichton, well played by Ben Browder. It offers the audience a sympathetic character with whom to identify. He is lost and has no idea how to do anything. In "Premiere", Crichton must choose between joining the prisoners or the blue helmets. He knows nothing at all on both sides, but by helping Aeryn (a captured Peacekeeper pilot), it becomes clear that he intends to help the Blue Helmets. He probably would not have ended up on the side of the prisoners if there had not been Crais, a Peacekeeper captain, declaring that Crichton was the murderer of his brother. This puts Crichton in an interesting situation: he is stuck with strange and violent prisoners having fled in front of a distant galaxy of which he knows nothing at all. Crichton's lack of knowledge of the world of Farsape makes him a particularly interesting protagonist in the first season of Farscape. <br /> <br /> The support cast is just as convincing. There is Zhaan, a blue Delvian and former prisoner. She is peaceful and reasonable, unlike her fellow prisoner Ka D'Argo, a powerful and hard-headed warrior. Virginia Hey is totally covered with blue makeup, which allows her character Zhaan to look cool and convincing. D'Argo's mega makeup, on the other hand, is below average. He looks pretty stupid with his giant tentacles and his strange nose, and there is something special in his eyes. They seem to have had some sort of allergic reaction to her makeup. Farscape would bring some improvements to her makeup in season 1, but the overall costume would remain, for me at least, as a problem until season 2. <br /> <br /> Rygel's puppet / digital characters Pilot are, to put it simply, excellent. Rygel is a small hynerian dominator floating in a kind of hovercraft. In "Premiere" he had a good dialogue but not much else. The pilot almost steals the show as a liaison between the living ship, Moya, and Moya's passengers. Even in the first episode, Pilot gives the appearance of a true living alien; never in the show seems to be a giant and expensive machine. <br /> <br /> The Peacekeeper characters presented are also very interesting. The Peacekeepers are made up of a race called Sebaceans, which looks like humans. The chief antagonist is featured in "Premiere" as Captian Crais, who believes that Crichton killed his brother. In reality, the death of Crais' brother was only an accident resulting from an accidental collision with Crichton's ship. Aeryn Sun, a pilot Crichton helps to escape, tries to explain that death is an accident, but Crais simply claims that she is "irreversibly contaminated" and refused to change her mind. Crais vengeance obsession, justified or not (it should be clear to Crais that Crichton is not responsible), is mysterious in "Premiere", but would be explained later in the season. Aeryn herself provides an extremely interesting character. By forcing her to leave the peacekeepers, she changes her way of life and finds herself in a similar (though less serious) situation to that of Crichton. <br /> <br /> a little hasty and clumsy. There is so much going on that not enough time is spent on anything. Moreover, D'Argo (for the moment) seems rather silly to run in his mediocre costume trying to look threatening. Still, "Premiere" is a solid entertainment. The special effects (as in the star sequences) are impressive. Most costumes and scenery on board Moya are original. Despite its flaws, "Premiere" is a must for fans of Farscape. 3/4
