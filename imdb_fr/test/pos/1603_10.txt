Personally, I can only agree with Stephen-12: indulge. There is no point trying to "capture" this movie. I like movies where nothing happens (explicitly). Herzog's "Aguirre, der Zorn Gottes" has the same background, although this film is less convincing, as the highlights are rather early in the story, so Herzog had to focus on nature rather than Kinski. Dead in Venezia is quite different because it has several climaxes, towers, etc. In fact, from the moment that Aschenbach's baggage is lost, the film "rushes" towards its grand finale (its last grains of sand begin to run through the hourglass after the moment of happiness where he dreams of putting keep the Polish family and caress Tadzio's hair). <br /> <br /> You can, if you wish, search for real clues / symbols in this one (his attempt to leave behind his luggage from the moment he arrives, Tadzio pointing towards the end, the fact that the content and form of the entire film are completely sincere, but there is no point in doing that: it will not make the film better or worse, since its strength lies in the flow of history, which is never Tons of history, a decaying Europe, the end of the "romantic era" as we know it, which was only the beginning of it (the individual emotions and expression are more important than today) But wait, now I start myself developing the only small (small) defect of the film: the parts "talk about art." Now, there is one thing to never do I myself believe that it could have been expressed in other ways. becomes already very clear in the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> I do not like explicit movies. I can read books, so I do not want a script that just puts forward my reason for being. I prefer movies that you can not explain with words, but only with these (Lynch's Lost Highway, Weir's Picknick at Hanging Rock and The Man Who Falled on Earth also belong to this category), because then, and only exists as a film and not just as a book. So what about Thomas Mann's short story? I have never read it, but forget about it! The film gives a different point of view: it says things you can never say in a book. He uses the art of cinema to make you feel, through images and music, the same thing Mann made you feel, using text. Worlds also brilliant, but different.
