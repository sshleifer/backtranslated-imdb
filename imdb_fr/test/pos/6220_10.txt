Jäniksen vuosi is one of Jarva's most political films. It strongly opposes the status of authority of modern society in the life of the common man and the way in which it has completely separated men from nature. It defies the whole concept of freedom and wealth in our welfare society. <br /> <br /> Vatanen (Antti Litja) - smothered buy the concrete jungle with all its rules and regulations - tries to shake the chains of society by escaping Everything is in the wilds of northern Finland - only to realize that the concept of "free country" is not so obvious, that is to say that society has the common man by the balls. <br /> <br /> What makes Jäniksen vuosi so exceptional - apart from its visual brilliance and sense of humor - is how it seems to illustrate the entire political atmosphere in Finland in the 1970s, as well as than the whole identity of Finland as a nation. Vatanen is like an archetype of a classical Finn in his loneliness and social distance. Since nature has always played such an important role in the national identity of us, Finns, the very idea that this society is gradually being suppressed by modern society makes Jäniksen vuosi exceptionally moving.
