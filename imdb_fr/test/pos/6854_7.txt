I really enjoyed this film. The actors were great, especially Potente, who is different in each role; FÃ¼rmann, who is also able to play anyone; and Loos, who spices things up (she's also a talented singer - she sings the song "My Truth", heard when a character raises the stereo in the lab). <br /> <br /> Anatomy is a good horror flick, who pays attention to his characters. It is also very gore at times, and the scenography is innovative. It is unfortunate that they had to do a sequel, which is far from the original. <br /> <br /> By the way, two other things are worth mentioning. The DVD is not dubbed, which allows for a better movie experience. Also be sure to keep watching after the start of the final credits.
