Gerald McRaney, (Dave Morgan), "War Crimes", TV Series 01, was like a father of Tiffani Thiessen, (Jennifer Gallagher), "A kiss before lying", '03, who lives a very bad situation in his life . and that brought Jennifer to retire with people and young men. Dave Morgan tries desperately to get her out of the house and manages to introduce Jennifer to Chris (Gallagher), who falls head over heels in love with her from their first meeting. In almost a couple of dates later, Chris asks Jennifer if she is going to marry him and she agrees. Shortly after the wedding, things start to happen, Chris is in the navy and does not like working in submarines and things are starting to happen to the girls in the neighborhood. It's a very good TV movie and you sometimes wonder if the guy or girl I want as a soulmate is the perfect PERSON!
