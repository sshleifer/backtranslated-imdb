This film is the best kung fu movie of all time. Although there is no wire and special effects like those used in Crouching Tiger, this film uses the ingenuity and creative work of the camera to create memorable moments of combat. The fight scenes are well choreographed and tight. There is a ton of activity in this movie with a lot of fighting scenes, but the story is very good too, with a lot of twists. The characters are well rounded and have a real depth, because the motivations of their actions and their personality are revealed in a much more detailed way than most kung-fu movies. There is a very beautiful shot in the film. My favorite picture begins as a close-up on the face of our hero showing his reaction, then quickly withdraws to reveal the scene in front of him that is the cause of his look. Originally, I bought the film in the hope of seeing some great fighting scenes, but after several screenings, I learned how great the acting and the story were. Overall, a good movie.
