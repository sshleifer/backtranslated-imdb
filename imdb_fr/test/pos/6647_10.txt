I do not remember a film that so cleverly depicts the emotional destruction of war, as reflected in a single conjugal relationship. The union between Ullman and Von Sydow is at the center of the film - both are in each scene. During the film, they undergo a role reversal: one has the strength of survival and the other is reduced to emotional escape through dreams. Both will lose one measure of humanity, but one to a greater degree than the other. The characters and the spectator go through periods of fluctuation with regard to proximity - the camera retreats, the sound disappears, the words are lost, only for the camera to return to close-ups of its expressive stars. The confusion and the fluctuations can make this film difficult for some viewers, but all this is deliberate under the hand of Bergman master. I think that the use of a "fake" war makes the film timeless, as relevant today as ever, and with a focus on human relations through the war, makes the film relevant for all. The pair could be anyone. The film is not anchored in place or time, but rather in emotion. A unique and effective war film, one of a kind. Bergman's films are virtuosic in the presentation of human relations - the fact that he would bring this to a war movie is masterful.
