AAA is my favorite movie ... I've seen it many times (I do not remember the account now) and every time I like it ... it's Raj Kumar Santoshi's best movie..The comedy , dialogue and performances are incredible ... All the actors and actresses did a superb job ... You can not stop laughing while watching this movie ... it's just hilarious ... Amir Khan and Salman Khan have did a great job .. and playing Paresh Rawal was excellent as always ..... the music is inspired by old hindi movies (60's music) and it's good ... the whole cast of the movie did an excellent work ... <br /> <br /> All in all, it's an excellent Indian comedy to watch ...
