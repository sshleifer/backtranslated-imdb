Having seen the film a few years ago and disappointed by its wasted potential, when I heard it was becoming a television series, I categorically refused to watch it. My best friend immediately became a rabid fan, and knowing my love for horror movies, I could not believe I would not watch a single episode. I told him that the film had marked me for life for everything that concerned BUFFY, and he told me to forget that the film even existed. He insisted that I give a shot to two episodes: "Once More With Feeling" and this one. <br /> <br /> Both are the reason I'm a BUFFY fan today. He was right - I became hooked immediately. I've never seen a show so audacious to dare to try an episode that has almost no dialogue, and nothing else could have succeeded with BUFFY's panache and pure creativity. I think X FILES could have gotten through if they had thought about it first, but I'm glad BUFFY did it instead. <br /> <br /> It's a credit to everyone involved that you're riveted for an hour in total, sometimes hanging on the edge of your seat. And when it was all over, I wanted to know more about each character. So I went out and bought the Season One box. And the rest is history ... <br /> <br /> I guarantee you that if you have never seen it, you will want to see more if you make this episode your first. <br /> <br /> The only reason I do not give him 10 out of 10 is because I reserve this score for "Once More ..."
