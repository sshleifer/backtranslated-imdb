I saw this wonderful documentary at the Santa Barbara International Film Festival. Extremely absorbent and very well designed, it immerses you in the life and career of Harry Nilsson, one of the most neglected musical talents of the 60s and 70s. While I knew his best-known compositions ("One is the Loneliest Number "," Without you "), I heard about this man's brilliant writing and magnificent song. If you like music, you will find something to plunge into his world, which has unfortunately degenerated into a loss of control as his success grew and his past haunted him. Sad as he is, he was nevertheless completely devoted to his family and you will find yourself so happy to have met this man. The profile is actually explained by Nilsson's own words and those of his friends and colleagues (a virtual Who's Who of Rock) who loved and respected him. Do not miss this!
