I saw this during a screening test in Chatsworth about a week ago and I left with a group of my friends. we all really liked it. James Franco is amazing and so hot, I would see him just for him !!!!!!! but Sienna Miller is also very good and plays a southern girl who loves her so much that she can not let her go. David Caradine who was in Kill Bill plays a cowboy and he is perfect for that. The story is a bit strange, but if you believe in the power of love and magic things, you will love it !!! It's really original, it's also very funny and everyone laughed a lot, but in the end, it gets more serious and we all ended up crying. I will see him again with my friends as soon as he comes out, it's really good !!!!!!!
