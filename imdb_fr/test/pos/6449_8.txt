When I saw the ad for the first time, I thought, "Let's go. He has already played at High School Musical, but he can not do without it, so he participates in other Disney series. Personally, I love The Suite Life and I am a big fan of Ashely Tisdale. But for some reason, I do not really like Zac Efron, even though all my friends think it's the best thing since Jesse McCartney. But he really annoys me. Anyway, I watched the show (taking a break from English classes) and was pleasantly surprised. The performances were good at all levels, especially those of the usual characters from The Suite Life, and Zac Efron was not as bad as I expected. Overall, it's a very good show.
