I finally got Lifeforce on DVD with the widescreen format intact and resulting in the maximum score of Henry Mancini. After watching Lifeforce for fifteen years on a tape, I must say that the "uncut" DVD version was both excellent and disappointing. The American version is * well * much better than the DVD version (European?). The American version of lifeforce moves much faster (the editing on the DVD version is terrible, it feels like an unfinished version). And the many scenes that we have not seen in the American version add little or nothing to the final problem. In fact, a "new" moment destroys almost the entire film, when Caine (Peter Firth) meets the stranger at the cathedral. I like this scene, in the American version though. On the DVD, the foreign male talks to Caine and what he says is so hilarious. It's the ultimate hilarity: <br /> <br /> "It'll be a lot less terrifying if you come to me!" said the foreign male, with a serious voice of the fifties. I was upset when I saw that. It's just not part of the movie. This scene is a pure camp in an otherwise serious film. I'm glad Hooper (or whoever) cut this scene when the film was released in North America. Several changes have been made to the US version to improve the performance of Lifeforce and I would have liked the DVD to contain the US version. The editing is neat and frantic without being boring and some passages already boring in the American version are even more on the DVD version because of the added scenes. And the opening credits on the DVD is terrible. Much better in the American version. More subtle. <br /> <br /> I like this movie. They are essentially strangers who stop on the ground and aspire as much as possible Lifeforce. The film has too many flat and uninteresting sequences (talk, talk, talk), but when the action happens in London, it's fun. The film really shines in these scenes. We can see Hooper finally do what he does well: chaos, savagery, horror! Lifeforce should have had more scenes of chaos. These are the best apocalyptic scenes ever put on film. It's also the best zombie movie of all time. Zombies are hungry (for the life force, not the flesh) and they are crazy and agile and terrifying. Not the slow bores of other zombie movies. In addition, many people have criticized the end, but I love it. It leaves you high and dry, like one of the exhausted victims. <br /> <br /> And I think this movie was released during the '80s cute and cuddly, when people gathered at E.T. or Cocoon or other sweet and boring, feel good sci-fi movies. No wonder he bombed because he was way ahead of his time with his super nihilistic point of view! <br /> <br /> Regarding the DVD, well, it's not great. The image is muddy and grainy and there are no extras whatsoever. But it's good to see the movie in its widescreen format. I only hope that they will publish a neat and clean American version on a DVD and commented by Hooper and Dykstra.
