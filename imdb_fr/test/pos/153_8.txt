Now that I saw it, it was NOT what I expected, at least not before the END. I read some of the other reviews before taking a used copy of this product on Amazon and was happy that I did it. Having first discovered Park's work via Oldboy, I was curious to see how he treated the genre and I was rather pleased with the intelligent way he performed it. I think Park has matured in terms of presentation because, while Oldboy and some of his other works have a very nice and deliberate camera work, he has some interesting innovations in Bakjwi that I've never seen in other movies of vamp. For example, the scene where Father Hyeon realizes that the "beast" is growing in him as he gives his still barefoot Tae-ju shoes and is able to see the blood flowing through the skin of Tae-ju. and that his eye widens in a desire for blood. for that. It was a nice effect. I was also happy that Park did not care about the movie and that it's actually very little CG. I came back from Bakjwi fully prepared to think that something was going to happen and that I was mistaken for a ride like Park. In addition, I liked that Park plays with a bit of symbolism and turnaround while we generally do not get that, it's Asian cinema. At the beginning of the film, we see the plot slowly develop and get to know the characters and you feel like an invisible observer of what is happening. Park treats you a bit like the ghost of the future of Christmas coming to show you, even if it's a bit boring, what life is like outside your world. Ah, but then we begin to feel some kinship with the fallen father and his growing desire for Tae-ju and the conflict with the priest's duty. We are almost starting to root for them, even though Park did not bring us back to reality and we really see that, finally, Bakjwi is a film about the moral dilemma, right and wrong. It will not spoil you if I tell you to look at Bakjwi in the mind of a priest and I think you will come out with what Park wants you to come back. Do not expect Oldboy and stylization as this is not what you will get here. A very interesting interpretation of the genre. Those who missed many literary elements and religious allusions watched another film, not Bakjwi. After Bakjwi, look at Let The Right One IN, it's not what you expect.
