One Night at McCool's is one of those movies that starts with a lot of dreadful promises, but as the movie progresses, it becomes ridiculous and loses its power. Liv Tyler plays a manipulative woman who tries to make herself beautiful by displaying her body in front of all the men she meets, all falling under her spell. a comedy farce. Michael Douglas, who plays the killer, is good like Liv Tyler, even though she seems to have gained some weight since armaggedon. It's okay, but it's only for the scene where Liv Tyler is washing his car, you'll know what I mean when you see it, man! Shwing !!!!! 7 out of 10 (just).
