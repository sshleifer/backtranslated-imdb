While I hold his predecessor, "Fast Times At Ridgemont High" as the benchmark against which other teen comedies should be compared, "The Wild Life" is one of the lesser-known films of the day - and a sequel worthy, if you can call it that. I believe his slogan is: "FTARH manufacturers, something even faster." This is certainly true. While it may be lacking in the depth of the former who addresses issues such as first appointments, teen sex and abortions, "The Wild Life" is nonetheless a great movie. It's pure chaos, especially thanks to Chris Penn's outstanding character, Thomas Drake. If Spicolli was rich in coca rather than grass, he would be Drake. Eric Stoltz, in his first lead role, is excellent as Bill Conrad. The two characters are getting married. Think of a weird young couple, with the luster of the 80s. Apart from them, there are so many other great things to mention in this movie. Lea Thompsom has never been so cute, especially in the scenes where she worked at the donut shop. Jenny Wright is just delicious and fun to watch. Rick Moranis plays a big nerd / perv who is dying to put himself in his pants. Thomas Drake's fight companions are hysterical, especially Benny, the little guy from Puerto Rico, who tells some pretty memorable stories. One of them in particular, when he shouts during a party at a strip club, had me on the floor the first time I saw her. That's saying something! Finally, the film ends with one of the best movie scenes of the 80s. Watch special appearances by Ron Wood of the Rolling Stones, Leo Penn (Sean's and Chris Penn's father) and a random look-alike Michael Jackson at the party. Add a score of none other than the man himself, Eddie Van Halen, and you can not go wrong. For Van Hagar fans, keep an ear out for riffs that can be found on albums such as 5150, OU812 and For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge. <br /> <br /> If anything disrupts the course of the film, this is a small subplot involving Randy Quaid as an exhausted veterinarian from Vietnam. It just seems out of place and useless. Other than that, it's almost perfect. If you are a fan of silly but fun 80s movies and you have not seen this one yet, you are expected for something special. RENT IT NOW !!! <br /> <br /> p.s.-The credits indicate that Cameron Crowe made an incursion into the skin of one of the film's policemen. Is his back turned during the scene because I have not found him yet? Someone please help me.
