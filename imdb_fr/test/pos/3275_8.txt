Ok, maybe Posse can not compare to other popular cowboy / western movies. But that's because he did not have the funding that these films had. Obviously, whenever you want to produce a story such as this one, focusing on historical African-American involvement (and NO, servants and "mammals" are not a historical implication), Hollywood will not support you. And believe me, that was not the case. Producers and actors have sacrificed a lot of "minimal" spending to do "Posse", just so the story can be told. I think that alone is commendable. Posse may not be an Oscar movie (and they do not like black media too much), but it's a start. It's fun, and it introduces us to the black cowboy, a character with whom most of us are unfamiliar.
