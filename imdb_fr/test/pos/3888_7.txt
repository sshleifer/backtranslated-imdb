My original title for this review was going to be: "The end is disappointing, the triumph of the film". But I actually thought of this one on the way home. It's not the fairy tale that most of these films are, it's a game that changes, and although its end is initially disappointing, it slowly sinks and hits the center in a satisfying tone. <br /> <br /> The plot follows a man named James Aaron (Jeff Garlin of Curb Your Enthusiasm, who also wrote and directed) a troubled actor who lives in Chicago with his mother and who deals with both his obesity and his inability to find someone to love. <br /> <br /> Yes, it sounds cheesy, but it does experiment with elements that make it somewhat unpredictable, and even makes you wish for longer. The end came quite abruptly and made me say "c'est tout!?" But once it starts to wreak havoc, it really makes you smile. <br /> <br /> This has a lot of serious tones, but do not worry, because it's also very funny. Some scenes offer huge bursts of laughter and those who have seen Jeff Garlin's stand-up will recognize a couple (mainly when delivering a speech to the career day on the niece's kindergarten class and bombs) . It starts on a serious note you do not expect, but the following is very funny, funny and very poignant. This is the kind of movie you watch and enjoy forever. And as I said before, even if the ending may seem absurd at first, once you take the time to think, it's a real joy.
