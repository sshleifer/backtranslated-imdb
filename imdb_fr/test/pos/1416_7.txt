A brief history of time. The cosmological content of this documentary is fascinating, inspiring reflection and the man ... brilliant. Still, I had a hard time enjoying this documentary. <br /> <br /> The way family members and teachers were interviewed seems so unnatural. These members were questioned about specially constructed sets and were misdirected. Above all, their accounts appeared as very acted and directed with force. The non-inclusion (deliberate) of the questions posed manipulates the information provided in a very hard and impersonal format. <br /> <br /> I do not know who is responsible for the interview, but they did a terrible job, which hurt the viewing experience. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's still a fascinating documentary that deserves to be seen. , if only for the interesting concepts presented.
