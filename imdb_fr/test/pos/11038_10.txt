This Popeye cartoon from World War II had very good gags of sight and was clearly above average for its genre. It was also very well drawn, with very good angles, good details and ... well, lots of interesting things. <br /> <br /> It comes back to Popeye at sea in his little boat and accidentally running in a small Japanese boat, with two guys on it. (Incidentally, why have "Japs" always been represented with big round glasses and arched teeth?). <br /> <br /> Be that as it may, these seemingly innocent Japanese sailors want Popeye to sign a peace treaty. Oh, my boy, think the credulous Popeye, "wait for the Admiral to see that!" In one of those beautiful scenes of art that I was referring to above, we slowly see how this little Japanese ship is really a big destroyer ... and Popeye is in the depths ... uh, water! "Why, you double-cross Ja-panties!," Cries our Sailor Man. <br /> <br /> It's fun to watch how he gets out of the situation.
