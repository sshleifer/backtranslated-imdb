SENSATIONAL!! Talk about a film that divides the audience! It's a real love or hate it a little film. Personally, I really appreciated. I noticed that other critics compared it to Pitch Black - it's a bit silly, because the only thing they have in common is SAND! People can be really stupid. No, this movie is much more in common with The Thing (people do not notice it's amazing - they even have the same basic music). There are many Carpenter touches, blue-collar heroes, lively humor, endless landscapes, hilly things not understood. Perhaps what prevents this film from being a true classic is its deference to Carpenter's other works. No less Dark Star with whom he has something in common. I would be interested to know how much does it cost REALLY? $ 8000? Is it possible? Maybe it was based on a short film of $ 8,000? But I was strangely moved when the various types of space died. They are so underrated that it's like watching one documentary at a time. That said, the scenario is a little awkward and only half of them can play, but I'm not sure that the captain's great player is part of it. But his weapon is great !! Indulge, if you like Carpenter at first, you may not enjoy it, but do not expect 2001.
