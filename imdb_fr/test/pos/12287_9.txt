I do not want to ruin the film for anyone, but, it mimics the reality of life in many ways, and if you're really honest with yourself, you'll agree with at least a few scenes. <br /> The actors' game is not only believable, but convincing in a way that pleases the characters. Plus, it's funny without trying too hard. <br /> <br /> And, yes, I really believe that a suite is justified here. See the movie, you will understand why. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended, especially if you like movies that have a real message.
