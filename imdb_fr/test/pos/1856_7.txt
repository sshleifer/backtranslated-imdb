As a non-theist, I will not comment on the theory of the great men that changed the world 150 years ago. Sure to say, science is evidence-based, religion is based on blind faith. Nuff said at that time. <br /> <br /> The film was produced by the BBC and, to be honest, it could very easily have been shown on television. Although the acting is superb, the film itself is not really worthy of a movie. That said, if it affects a larger audience, so be it. But I saw a lot of vintage dramas on BBC TV and they were up to it. Do not expect too much thrill when you go to see it. <br /> <br /> In a way, I found the film almost lamentable to apologize to religious fundamentalists. Although this creates a good feeling of tension throughout the process, I could not help but want to get to The Origin Of Species sooner (you'll wait until the end). And that seemed to insinuate much more than I knew about Darwin's struggle with himself and his wife Emma, ​​describing him almost as a kind of crazy lunatic sometimes - which is hardly true. There are many other mistakes and facts missing from the true story that preceded the publication of Origin as well, but the premise of the film is almost entirely centered on the difficulty that Darwin encountered in his book, and a small part about the death of his beloved daughter Annie. This gives the film its most moving scene, where Annie dies as she asks one last time to hear Darwin tell her the story of a captive orang-utan who died of pneumonia. However, you will probably feel a closer connection with the primate in this scene than with Darwin's daughter. <br /> <br /> With the controversy that apparently surrounds the film in the United States, it will be useful to promote it and the more people will see it. But to be honest, there is actually very little that insults a mythical deity. This is hardly the headline of a theory that goes back 150 years. But, as basic Christians (and many other religions we all know well) like to wave a placard or two whenever possible, I guess this movie is as good a excuse as any other. Personally, I do not see what everyone is talking about. But maybe they are just singer
