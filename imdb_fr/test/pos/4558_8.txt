I saw this movie without knowing anything about both his film and his stars, Chris Farley and David Spade, and I must say that this movie is a classic comic book. It's so stupid sometimes that it can only be hilarious. Farley is brilliant as a foolish idiot who takes the road with his father's right arm (the equally excellent Spade) to find the financing needed to rescue the family auto parts business. Relax, put your brain in autopilot mode and have fun. Brian Dennehy (Cocoon), Rob Lowe (The world of Wayne) and Bo Derek ("10") are among the main actors. Highly recommended for good laughs.
