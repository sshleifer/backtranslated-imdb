I saw this movie twice now on the cable. The first time I saw it, it surprised me. The skaters I saw were the ones we followed in Skateboarder Magazine in the late '70s. These are the guys we copied and tried to skate. I'm glad a film was finally made, which gives an accurate account of how it was created. I am almost 40 years old now and I suppose a rather tense guy with all the problems of life, however; this movie did a great job of bringing me back. Back to vacant pools, halfpipes in the back yard and trips on the Cherry Hill NJ road. I think that to fully understand this film and appreciate it, you had to live it. Otherwise, it will probably not impact you as it has been done to me. But for those of you (and you know who you are) who lived it, you know exactly what I'm talking about! Anyway, I do not care who you are, if you have the chance to see this movie ... do it! I thank the Dogtown Z-Boys for the memories of my youth and thanks to Stacy for making this movie! GOOD JOB!
