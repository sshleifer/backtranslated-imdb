"Christmas in Connecticut" is a jewel not to be missed! Elizabeth Lane, a precursor of Martha Stewart, is a magazine columnist and the most ideal mistress - the perfect woman, the mother and the domestic goddess. The only thing is, it is none of these things - a false total. Unfortunately for her, she is about to be discovered. Its publisher, Mr. Alexander Yardley (an awesome comic from Sydney Greenstreet) has the brilliant idea of ​​inviting a famous war hero into Elizabeth's "perfect farm" for the Christmas holidays. Only thing, there is no farm, "perfect" or otherwise. The comedy explains how Elizabeth must keep her true identity secret so as not to lose her job. Elizabeth's colleague, John, owns a farm in Connecticut, which solves this problem. However, he wants to marry Liz, but she does not want to marry him. He offers her his wedding, although he knows that she does not feel the same way for him as for her. He still offers and assures him that he is ready to wait. And here Barbara Stanwyck, as Liz, delivers one of the most devastating blows I have ever heard of. With perfect innocence, she answers: "Can you wait so long?" OUCH! In addition, the scenes between Una O'Conner and S.Z. Sakall are hilarious. They do not seem to love each other (although we really suspect). They are rivals in the household and S.Z. The shredded English of Sakall is matched by the strangled pronunciation of his name by Nora ("Mr. Basternook"). "My name is FELIX!" It's amazing how much of this black and white film is Christmas. Excellent work of character by all involved. Do not miss this one!
