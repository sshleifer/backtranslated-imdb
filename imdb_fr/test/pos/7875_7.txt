Imagine this episode "Dragnet" in which Friday and Gannon embark on a typical hippie inequality lair of the 1970s, but instead of giving a lecture to everyone, they "get it". This is in short "Joe". <br /> <br /> This film about a bigot of the working class and a rich guy who just killed his girlfriend's drug dealer's boyfriend has been terribly dated and most of the supporting roles are scalded, but it's always interesting to watch. Peter Boyle, then about 35, plays Joe (the bigot) and looks like James Gandolfini. In her film debut, Susan Sarandon plays the doe-eyed girl and, while she may not necessarily be referring to her future greatness, you can not take her eyes off her.
