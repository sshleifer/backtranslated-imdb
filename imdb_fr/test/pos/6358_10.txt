This film by newcomer Dir./Writer Jose Reyes impressed me a lot. The distribution was excellent. "Jorge Cordoba" performed a powerful and shocking <br /> performance as the main character of "Rafa". It's inspiring to see independent films with this level of talent. <br /> <br /> It takes talent, courage and determination to go out and make a quality film. <br /> <br /> I admire all those who can take an idea of ​​the concept to the design and go to the end of the road. <br /> <br /> It's easy for people to judge young filmmakers harder, but I applaud Jose Reyes <br /> <br /> and the talented cast for their hard work.
