What gives the show more credibility is the latest technologies used by the cell / the FBI and the authentic clichés in Europe, the United States and the Middle East, no expense is spared to tell the story with precision. The actors are relatively unknown but the game is superb with the help of a very tight script that keeps the viewer constantly at ease with many unexpected twists.
