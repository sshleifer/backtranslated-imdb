Although I like Walter Matthau, I had the impression that the majority of his roles were adapted to his personality. This role is one of the exceptions. He plays a charming and dishonest dentist. This role requires much more intervention than in most other roles. I liked the fact that the film is honest about how a professional can be dishonest in order to avoid any engagement in a relationship. Her whole purpose was to find a way to build relationships with a much younger woman, but not to be engaged in any way. The alibi - uses his secretary (Ingrid Bergman) to pretend to be his wife. At one point in the film, the so-called Mr. and Mrs. are actually persuaded to believe that they were really married. The end was good, as a middle-aged man discovered that it was more useful to chase someone in his age group. The film was funny, funny and did not sell as a preacher.
