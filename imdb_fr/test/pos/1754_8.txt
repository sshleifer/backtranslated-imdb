What I liked most in this animated feature film of 1941 is the great impression it gives for the early 1940s. These are the songs, the clothes, the cars, the jargon of the building of the day, etc. You have the impression of going back in time. <br /> <br /> Reading some of the reviews here, I find that it was difficult film-luck, being published a few days before the Pearl Harbor attack. Wow, no one would be interested in going to the movies for a long cartoon during those eventful and shocking days, I'm sure. Too bad, because people missed a beautiful animation would have really impressed back then, almost 70 years ago. The colors are pretty, the designs are good and the story is complex, as we search for insects led by "Hoppity" and her beautiful daughter "Honey" to make him happy and safe from danger. It is also that they all find a place where they can live and do not fear that humans will trample on them. <br /> <br /> There is however a nasty villain, "C. Bagley Beetle" - and two of his henchmen. These assistants ("Swat, The Fly" and "Smack, the Mosquito") are comical, complete with their Brooklyn-ese accents! The story is familiar: a nasty old man wants to marry the sweet young thing and uses unscrupulous means to force his hand. The good guy, meanwhile, has the par√© stacked against him but in the end, of course, prevails. <br /> <br /> My favorite part - it will sound worse than it was - was when the guy "Hoppity" was temporarily electrocuted and he danced in black and white. It was a fantastic animation! <br /> <br /> You know, it's a good thing that I did not see this as a tiny child; I would have been afraid to play outside and crush all these nice insects! You never know what (or who) is in this grass under your feet!
