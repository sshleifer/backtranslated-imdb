There is a good article on the price of a neglected silk. The bimbo in the office shows the price she got for $ 22 (closeup of the tag). Later, Mary Astor finds the etiquette in the boss's room (proof that bimbo slept with him). Still later, Mary Astor is about to have an affair with Ricardo Cortez, she examines the price of her neglected silk ($ 14) and recalls how much she was disgusted with the bimbo, as well as the fact that she spent $ 8 less on the "most obvious" woman she has ever met. Morality is obvious, but it is well done. The film would be stronger if the character of Robert Ames had been performed by a more powerful actor (he is too discreet for an independent salesman and spends most of the film with the face turned away from the camera), and if Ricardo Cortez had had more to do than to smile ironically. Both male roles are bland and forgettable, and are bothered by the male pancake makeup so popular at the time of the film. However, the character of Mary Astor is interesting, attractive and credible. Behind the closed doors is definitely worth the detour.
