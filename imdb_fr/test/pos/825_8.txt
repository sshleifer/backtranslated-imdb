After 10 years, we can finally say that our Belgian Action Star is back. Personally, I found that it was even better than Wake Of Death, making it its best movie since ... 10 years !! Okay, it's not like its flagship years as Timecop, Universal Soldier, Sudden Death or even its best effort so far: Hard Target (one of the best action movies ever made by one John Woo's best action directors.) Well, the story is exciting, the dialogue is pretty funny, this one is better than expected. The bad guys are great, as in Hard Target, and the fight scenes are "old school". Real fans know what to expect. I must say that I abandoned him, but Van Damme is finally back. More please ....
