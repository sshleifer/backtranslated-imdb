This film is certainly one of the best of its kind. A Victrion Age Story about love and courage. The depth of his story is a story that will arouse the deepest emotions of love and hate, with very interesting twists, it is an indispensable film for the public not only lesbian but also for all the spectators. I can not say much more or I will spoil the experience for a new young audience that may come. Another good job for Sarah Waters. It's also a great way for Sally Hawkins to conquer audiences who can only glimpse her talent in another work by Sarah Waters, in "Tipping the Velvet". It is also a must.
