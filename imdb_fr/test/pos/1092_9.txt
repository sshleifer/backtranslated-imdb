I still remember watching Satya for the first time. I was completely blown away. It was a very different film from the other gangster films I had seen. So realistic, so mumbaiyya and so credible. Despite "Company" (which was a very good effort) and "Vaastav" (more focused on the protagonist's journey) that came closer, no film from the underworld could ever live up to Satya. <br /> <br /> When I look at Ab Tak 56 for the first time, I thought, "Indian cops now have their own" Satya "". Nietzsche's quote at the beginning itself tells you that it's not an ordinary movie. What is striking about the "encounter" at the beginning of the film is the relaxed way in which it takes place. You realize that this is part of their routine. <br /> <br /> Ab Tak 56 is not the story of an honest or corrupt policeman, but a police officer ready to do what it takes to get rid of criminals when all legal means are exhausted. With simple shots and shooting angles, director Shimit Amin manages to capture the essence of the characters and gives a realistic and approximate impression to the film. The assembly seems inexistent and therefore effective. The music is also impressive and haunting and will accompany you a long time after you leave the movie theater. <br /> <br /> But what is important to me is the dialogues and superlatives of each character. . Sandeep Srivastava did a remarkable job as a dialogist. If I start to list my favorite dialogs, I'm afraid I'll have to rewrite the complete script of the movie. <br /> <br /> The film boasts of breathtaking performances. Yashpal Sharma is detestable as sub-inspector Imtiaz Siddiqui, as is Jeeva as Deputy Commissioner Suchak. Revathi, Hrishita Bhatt, Mohan Agashe and Kunal Vijaykar have small roles that they play to perfection. Nakul Vaid as rookie Jatin Shukla was a revelation. The scene where he must draw hesitantly on the wounded gangster ?? Oh my God! He learns under the tutelage of Sadhu Aghashe and firmly believes in him. <br /> <br /> Prasad Purandhare as Zameer Zafar is impressive. His conversations with Sadhu are real dialogue writing jewels. Never before in Indian cinema has there been any film that has shown such a beautiful relationship between a policeman and a gangster. <br /> <br /> It's not that I was not a fan of Nana Patekar before this movie, but this movie fan to a devotee. Nana as an inspector Sadhu Agashe gives the performance of a lifetime and is one of the best I have ever seen in Hindi cinema. From the way he talks to his expressions, from the way he taps his cigarette to how sips his tea ?? it's almost like Nana can not do anything wrong. He is at his best in every scene, especially when he teaches Jatin how the police work. His calm and composed way of doing things is scary sometimes. His dialogue and his body language convinced me that he was one of the best actors in the country. It's a pity he did not win any popular prize for this one. Last but not least, Shimit Amin brilliantly manages to gather all these talents and to exploit them at best. come with a modern masterpiece of Indian cinema. In an industry that is badly accustomed to raising stories from here and elsewhere, Amin takes an original scenario and brings it to life with magnificent treatment. I just hope he continues his great work and does not give in to Bollywood-isation! If he can do it, I'm sure he'll count on it in the years to come.
