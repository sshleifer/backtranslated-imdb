The film features another exceptional collaboration between director William Wyler and director of photography Gregg Toland, the first after Toland's Citizen Kane. But the talent of these two men was centered on the realization of a perfectly designed film, understood in the good old American sense as a beautiful story. The technical aspects of the film are approached so that the viewer is absorbed by the action that takes place on the screen without submitting to the power of the image. The technique is perceived as a means of representation unlike the Citizen Kane, where Welles baroque style has almost drawn the attention of history to the way it was told. One of my favorite moves in this film is the drama of Homer and Al's homecoming. If Homer's daughter, Wilma, comes right to him, Al is also addressing his wife. This is a brilliant initiative because it only shows through the use of the image the nature of these relationships as we will see them throughout the film: Wilma adores Homer and she accepts it as it is, the Al's wife also loves her, but she does not feel prepared to welcome him home. Also later in the film, we discover that their wedding has not always been a bed of roses. <br /> <br /> Wyler is a director whose strength lies in the fidelity of his work without feeling the need to boast. He wanted to show his audience how difficult it was for American soldiers returning from the war to integrate into a society that did not understand them or treat them with contempt. With perfect distribution and good dialogue, Goldwin and Wyler have produced a film that will forever be the model of any other home movie. The three hours coincide with the "rough cut" because the audience tester of the time never felt for a moment that the action was slow and that each scene of the film seems perfectly justified. Everything is beautifully built, each character gets a good dose of visibility, nothing is left to chance and it is a shame that Hollywood never manages to bring as many characters conflicts on the screen. TBYOOL explores the depth of the American way of life, the American family and society to a degree that gives other movies the same tone as "children's time".
