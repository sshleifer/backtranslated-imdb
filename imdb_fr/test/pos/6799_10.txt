It's a beautiful film. The scenes are well represented. Anne Revere's dialogues are very well written and inspiring, the philosophy and thoughts that this film gives and the things it teaches make it wonderful and wonderful. <br /> <br /> Mickey Rooney is awesome in the movie and his role runs through many emotions as the movie progresses. <br /> <br /> Elizabeth Taylor is very pretty, her scenes in the movie are intrinsically poetic, the camera follows her the way the music makes you feel makes every scene of her beauty ethereal. <br /> <br /> this film has a good spirit and a beloved classic so loved. <br /> <br /> Angela Lansbury is quite amusing in her role Although unrecognizable if you have seen her play the role of "m" in "the Manchurian candidate". <br /> <br /> Donald Crisp has fully done justice to his father's role and the scenario provides ample justification for his role. <br /> <br /> it's a very good movie and a must-see watch for family and kids, a Christmas favorite.
