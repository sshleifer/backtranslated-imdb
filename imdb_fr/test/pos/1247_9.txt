It's one of Bruce's most underrated films, in my opinion it's a great, heart-warming film with a neat story and an incredible Bruce Willis performance! All the characters are great, and I thought Willis and Spencer Breslin were just great together, and Bruce Willis is just amazing! This is certainly one of Bruce's best comic performances (the waaaaaaaaamabulance thing was excellent) and I thought it was very well written and well done, as well as the finale is particularly cool! That's nice and it's cool to see how the character of Russell (Willis) changes throughout the movie! Moreover, the end was pretty good. I think it should be over 6.0 and it's one of the best Disney movies I've ever seen! In addition, there are many surprising moments. All the characters are extremely friendly, and he also has a cute love story angle, as well as Bruce and Spencer Breslin who both have really fun lines (Holy Smokes!). It's one of Bruce's most underrated films in my opinion, it's a great, heart-warming film, with a neat story and an incredible Bruce Willis performance and I say it's a must! The management is great! Jon Turteltaub does a great job here with a very good camera job and keeping the film very fast. The game is excellent! Bruce Willis is amazing as always and is amazing here, he gives one of his best comic performances, he's hilarious of a wonderful chemistry with Spencer Breslin and Emily Mortimer, he had some funny lines, and was dead during all the movie, it was the main reasons why I liked this movie so much! (Willis rules !!!!!!!). Spencer Breslin is fantastic as the younger version of Russell, he was very funny and did not piss me off once, he is one of the best kids actors! Emily Mortimer is good like Amy and was really cute. I liked her, she had decent chemistry with Bruce too. Lily Tomlin is funny because Janet liked me a lot. Jean Smart is good with what she had to do, which was not much. The rest of the cast is fine. Overall, you have to see! **** out pf 5
