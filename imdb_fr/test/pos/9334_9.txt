For those who remember the initial impact of this video, it will never be forgotten and just watch Thriller to be twelve years old. But, even if it's a great video, it's not perfect, even if it seemed like it at the time. When this video was first broadcast, no one had ever seen anything like it before. Now, music video support has grown dramatically and a new Thriller vision will reveal its flaws. Why was it necessary to deconstruct the song? When Michael Jackson walks next to the girl after they leave the cinema, he sings all the verses of the song jumping the chorus. After he's become a zombie, when it comes time to sing again, his makeup disappears inexplicably and he sings the chorus again and again, as if to compensate for his previous absence. It may have been the first time a song was deconstructed to fit the visual elements of a music video, but it was certainly not the last time. This continued to be a problem in the MTV era. The best videos, like Jackson's Billie Jean and Beat It, used visuals in the service of music, not the other way around. Still, Thriller is a lot of fun and must-see on Halloween.
