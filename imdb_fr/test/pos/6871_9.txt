Late one night, on Tom Snyder's "Tomorrow" show, I watched Tom ask his guest Henry Morgan what he considered "perfect". Morgan replied, "Anything with Glenda Jackson." And although I do not consider that this film is perfect, it confirms very well this notion. I was going to use the clich√© that Hollywood would not make more photos like this one, but I just saw "Up in the Air", another smart movie about two people over 35 who fall in love with the movie. love. This is where the similarities end. "Calls At Home" is a pure pleasure to watch 2 professionals like Matthau and Jackson agree and look completely natural while they are there. I saw this film at the theater in 1978 (at the age of 18) and it took me another 20 years to understand all the jokes. Bill Tilden, the great tennis player of the 1920s, could not play the lead role in the film and British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain would not play the megaplex very well today. Another thought: the original theatrical release included a montage "Walk on the Beach / Fallen", in the air of the Beatles / George Harrison, "Something". It seemed a bit forced at the time, but this song has since been replaced by a rather generic replica of Henry Mancini's music for later release in a video and cable. Too bad, because this scene is there, now, another victim of the music license, Hell.
