Functioning as a kind of intermediate point between "Waiting for Guffman" and "A Mighty Wind", "Best in Show" represents a canine show and the different people who bring their canine friends to participate. Some are weird, some are crazy and others, but they all make the movie good. The director Christopher Guest is particularly funny as a gay Harlan Pepper, who tries a lot to promote his dog. Eugene Levy, Posey Parker, Michael McKean, Catherine O'Hara and Bob Balaban also do excellent work (I can not imagine they do not do excellent work, at least not in a Christopher Guest movie). As a person who has never attended a dog show, this film is my main exhibition. They look really nice.
