It's a movie that will certainly brighten up your day. Kermit the Frog, is just an ordinary frog in his swamp, when a talented agent stops to tell him that Hollywood is looking for frogs in the movie (lol). On the way, Kermit meets Fozzie Bear, Miss Piggy, Gonzo and his Chicken Camilla, Rowlf, The Electric Mayhem, Bunsen Honeydew and Beaker. Kermit also owns a chain of restaurants, Doc Hoppers French Frog Legs. All in all, Kermit and the Muppets go to Hollywood. <br /> <br /> This movie is recommended to everyone, young and old. <br /> <br /> It contains wonderful musical numbers, like "The Rainbow Connection," I'll go back someday, "and" Movin 'Right Along. "The Muppets also use many modes of transportation in this movie Kermit rides a bike, Fozzie drives a Studebaker and another car, Gonzo takes off with a bundle of helium balloons (which is one of my favorite moments in passing;)), and Kermit and the rest Muppets finally follow the ride on Electric Mayhem bus (Dr. Teeth, Floyd, Janice, Scooter and Animal), who find them in the desert after the fozzie car crash. <br /> <br /> Even Sesame Street Muppets make Cameo appearances (ie, Big Bird walks down the road on New York City to break into public television) The end is also a very comforting moment. created is in the final scene, alo One last cover with "Rainbow Connection". <br /> <br /> But these poor Muppets worked so hard on their set, then everything collapses and the camera explodes into a huge ball of sparks. You would think that everything is in ruins and destroyed, but the rainbow shines through the roof at the end, and all sums up the magic of this movie and you know everything will be fine. <br /> <br /> Perfect 10/10. Watch it and you will be delighted by the pleasure and sadness of this film.
