Dylan and Bobby are childhood friends and they are in love as young boys are sometimes. But Dylan has met a girl and is starting to put away those childhood things. Bobby knows he's not interested in girls and misses what he had with Dylan. <br /> <br /> Told in a cheesy, 80's pop video, in a movie for the house and in a souvenir for the video, this film tells a confusing and sad story, but all too often true, which will enchant many people. <br /> <br /> This film reminds me of a lot of memories and really touched my heart, but I wish the filmmaker went a little further and left it on a happier note. Yes, we all love and lose, even when we are young, but there is always tomorrow, especially when we are young.
