It's just a good western fashion ... not too complex or long. He does not deceive himself thinking that he was made only for entertainment. Yet this is one of those westerns that you can watch once and finish without going back. There are former partners, Randolph Scott and Glenn Ford, whose friendship is strong despite the fact that Cheyenne Rogers of Ford has participated in bank robberies (he even steals Scott Sheriff's horse Steve Upton unknowingly his good friend for which he is robbed). In the red valley, Upton is under heavy surveillance for a bank robbery that has resulted in several deaths. Claire Trvor describes Countess Maletta, a friend of Cheyenne who gives him and her boyfriend "Nitro" (Guinn 'Big Boy' Williams) a place to stay for the moment. Cheyenne wants to go straight, but finds it difficult when Jack Lester (Bernard Nedell) and his complacent group want to rob the Red Valley bank. It is actually Jack who is behind the murders, but Cheyenne's troubled past is hard to escape. He and Nitro will be accused of the murders they did not commit (the robbery was committed by Cheyenne) and it will be up to Upton to save the day before Lester is murdered. Cheyenne has fallen in love with Alfred McLeod (Evelyn Keyes), which is ironic is that Alison's father, Uncle Willie, is in fact tied to banker Stanley Clanton (Porter Hall) in a planned flight with Lester. steal the spoils from the city of Red Valley}. Will Upton discover the treacherous stratagem of Uncle Willie and Banker Clanton? Will Uncle Willie get through without his conscience always disturbing him? This movie has a great fight in the living room and a shooting dandy at the climax. Columbia could not have chosen a better genre to start the coloring process, because this film has beautiful mountainous plans while men pursue it on horseback, etc. Do not expect to have your socks removed, but the film is simple and well paced.
