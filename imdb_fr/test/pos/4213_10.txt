I was about ten years old when my uncle took me and my brother to see this martial arts movie at the "DRIVE IN" during the circle training at Long Beach. The title was "HAMMER OF GOD" which I will never forget for any reason, but what I remember are the different scenes that left an imprint in my mind forever. <br /> <br /> My brother always reminds me of the movie even though we have not seen the movie for a long time. From time to time, I looked for it in rental shops and from time to time I consulted the Internet and, for some reason, it seems that it is never available or that nobody knows which movie I am talking about. <br /> <br /> If I only knew if and if it was available, I would like to buy this movie. If anyone is aware of its availability, please let me know.
