I lost counting how many times I watched this movie. I never got tired because it's a movie that can be enjoyed and interpreted on so many levels. they only make such films. <br /> <br /> After recently watching the fascinating documentary on the making of this film (Hearts of Darkness: a journey of filmmakers into madness), I am even more surprised. that this film was even finished and yet alone has become so great. <br /> <br /> the fact that they actually shot this movie in the jungle of the Philippines is the greatest asset of the film. you really feel like you're in Vietnam. <br /> <br /> all the actors are fantastic, my favorites being always Robert Duvall ("I love the smell of napalm in the morning !!") martin sheen, and the great Marlon Brando. <br /> <br /> many people complain about the film too dark, bizarre and cerebral near the end. Well, remember what Coppolla said about this film: "This movie does not talk about Vietnam, it's Vietnam!" what he means is that this film is about MADNESS and not about war. <br /> <br /> This film is based on Joseph Conrad's new "Heart of Darkness" and takes place in the context of the Vietnam War, instead of the Civil War. war like in the book. I think it was a brilliant combination in my opinion. <br /> <br /> it's a perfect film that presents challenges, is dark, violent, sometimes humorous and well done in every possible way. <br /> <br /> a real classic <br /> <br /> note: 10
