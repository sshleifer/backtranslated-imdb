Ok, everyone agreed on the best season. The first. And killing Boone was a bad idea. Killing others was bad too. Blame the directors and writers for this. Bad Boys. BUT. I still think it's the best scifi series of all time! Sorry guys, I can not help it! I notice that the quality of the series has decreased after the first season. Nevertheless, it's easy to accept that Liam is the new main character, if you're done with Boone. He is really ... mysterious. What shocked me most was when Lilli was written and how. It was something she did not deserve! And what do we have? A blonde chick named Renee, absolutely devoid of character! But these Taelons remain mysterious and you wonder about their real projects until the end. True Suspence. Conversations between Zo'or and Da'an are sometimes brilliant. <br /> <br /> I understand that when you go to an episode of the 3rd, 4th or 5th season, you may not understand this show. But when we look from the beginning, we can not go wild! <br /> <br /> The acting game is awesome, the special effects are wonderful, the music is beautiful and the plot intriguing. I have to see that, guys!
