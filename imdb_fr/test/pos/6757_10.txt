A brilliant animated piece that was way ahead of its time and certainly ahead of anything that came out in mass production at the same time in history. The influence of this work on Tim Burton's "Nightmare Before Christmas" is obvious. One can only imagine how much Starewicz enslaved each frame of this superbly detailed masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Very few animation films of this caliber have been produced. It is unfortunate that more people have not seen this jewel. <br /> <br /> Apparently, IMdB now requires comments to have at least ten lines, so this is the tenth line. It must be something new - but I really have nothing else to say!
