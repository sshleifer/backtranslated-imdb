This movie is a bit similar to "Better Off Dead" because it has some of the same stars. This one is not so good. Of course, it's pretty funny and nice, there's something about "Better ... that I like, much better." He has these guys go to Nantucket to spend the summer vacation. that they meet this girl who is trying to save here the house of this guy who wants to make a lobster restaurant, this guy does not really like lobster, because in a scene, he plunges it into boiling water and installs a stethoscope so that he can hear it screaming, torn between this girl and the girl of the son of the guy who wants to make the restaurant, this leads to a great confrontation between boats, a bit like in "Summer Rental", even if it works a little better here the plot a little better.But what is the problem with the boat races at the moment? Was there a strange fascination with them? For the most part, this movie makes you laugh a good clip, but "Better Off Dead" was even better because it was the first and the jokes worked mie ow.
