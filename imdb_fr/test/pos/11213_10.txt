People must learn to watch what is on the screen. It is a great film based on a slow and detailed collection of details that serve to establish the personalities of these two men. The fear of Yusuf (Emin Toprak), the cousin of the country, is well described by his fear of talking to women. He has at least three chances to start a conversation with a young woman and loses them all. He has several decades of singles before him, or even unemployment. <br /> <br /> Mahmut is a different case. He came out of the small town working hard (we imagine), and his resentment towards slackers like Yusuf is palpable (he leaves crumbs on the expensive carpet - the slob!). We are shown a group of friends talking about Tarkovsky, among other things, and we note that Mahmut regrets - but only a small regret - that his work has become commercial over the years. The chasm between the cousins ​​continues to widen. The theme of the mousetrap is wonderfully alive, it highlights Yusuf's compassion and confusion, as well as Mahmut's resolution in the cold blood. <br /> <br /> I remembered two classic movies of men behaving for each other: The cousins ​​of Chabrol (the rich boy with Hitler pretensions played by Brialy is still in my head) and Kiss of the Spider Woman (William Hurt does not understand why everyone is so mean). Nuri Bilge Ceylan occupies his place among the dozens of important directors currently in activity. I only hope that in the future he will rely on collaborators instead of directing, writing and filming himself.
