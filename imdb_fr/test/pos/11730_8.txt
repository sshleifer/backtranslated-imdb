That's how Burt Reynolds describes this film, which turns out to be his best. He plays Tom Sharky, a vice-detective who is on the trail of an international gangster (Vittorio Gassman) and the man he funds to become Georgia's next governor (Earl Holliman). In William Diehl's novel, the story is more complex because the candidate runs for president. It's a very long film that takes three hours instead of two. The filming in downtown Atlanta and the Peachtree Plaza Hotel create the perfect atmosphere for the story. Reynolds does not laugh a lot in this one compared to his comedy films. He is very serious here, especially at the beginning of the film, because he is demoted for a drug crisis that went wrong. However, the film sometimes plays more like a voyeuristic drama than a detective film with Burt trying to get close to the gangster's wife. It is only towards the end of the film that the violence is accentuated which leads to the culminating point of the bang bang. Like Lalo Schifrin's excellent score of DIRTY HARRY, Sharky's Machine offers an excellent urban jazz soundtrack with guest stars such as Chet Baker, Julie London, Flora Purim and Buddy De Franco, The Manhattan Transfer, Doc Severinson, Sarah Vaughan and Joe. Williams. Al Capps manages the score with magic. This film has become one of the best police dramas ever made. Check it out. <br /> <br /> Score, 8 stars out of 10
