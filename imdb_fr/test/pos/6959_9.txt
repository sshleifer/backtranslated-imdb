I saw this movie for the first time on a sick day at school about ten years ago. Compared to movies for the life I usually watch, it has become an instant favorite, albeit obscure. <br /> <br /> I've seen it maybe twice since. I think some games are a little lame, maybe the plot could use more action. Nevertheless, it captures the fantasies and realities of children with a unique and warm character. Magic realism is on a par with Amelie's and heart with The Wonder Years. Despite the particular development of my tastes, I always find the subtle magic of this film, its adorable characters and its enchanting simplicity.
