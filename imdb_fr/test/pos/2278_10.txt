You have to like baseball and at least a bit like Tom Selleck, but if you meet these criteria you should really enjoy this movie. Selleck plays the former Major League player who is traded (?) In Japan at the end of his career. Look really well thought out and fascinating about Japanese customs and behavior. Excellent support performance from Selleck's director ("Japanese Clint Eastwood"), his girlfriend Takanashi and his interpreter. The chemistry between Selleck and Takanashi works very very well, it's really a beautiful romantic film outside of baseball. Look for Haysbert as a teammate long before becoming a persistent player for Allstate. The film ends very well. Easily in my top fifty movies of all time and maybe my favorite on baseball.
