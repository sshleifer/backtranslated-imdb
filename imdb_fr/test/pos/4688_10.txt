Hello, I must say that you have incorrect information about the series. The main author was Richard Carpenter, he created the series. Later, there were other authors, but they only made a few episodes. <br /> <br /> The first director to have done most of the series (I think the complete series 1) was Ian Sharp, who created the distinct look of Robin of Sherwood. <br /> <br /> Clannad actually saw some of the material and read the scripts. I know for sure because Richard Carpenter said it at a Con in England last year. <br /> <br /> I think it's a masterpiece of Television-Entertainment. lines. For me, always one of the best TV series of all time!
