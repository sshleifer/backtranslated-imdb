I saw this film when it was an entry to the Santa Fe Film Festival. Heavy film! The representation of a completely dysfunctional family pushed to another extreme level could have left me depressed to the extreme, with no very amusing visual gags and dialogues along the way that shed light on the overall tone of the film. The relatively "uplifting" end gave hope to those affected by the initial tragedy. Still, I did not leave the theater ready to go to a fun party. The film stayed with me for several days. <br /> <br /> Bring back memories of "ordinary people", but with humor mixed with tragedy. I thought the acting was great, especially Sigourney Weaver and Emile Hirsh. The way each character handled the tragedy was sometimes sad, doomed to failure, but sometimes hilarious. Smart dialogue and situations.
