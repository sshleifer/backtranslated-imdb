Dad (78) and I (46) had a good time watching the movie today. For a guy best known for his serious roles, De Niro is a heckuva comic actor. Of course, it's useful to be able to play with your previous movie footage. Think that one of these roles, 15 MINUTES, was a cop faced by media interference, and that you have an interesting set of comparison / contrast performances. <br /> <br /> Murphy also plays another of his Axel Foley sort of characters. Shatner plays a burlesque of himself, a parallel world that was best known for TJ HOOKER and not for STAR TREK. <br /> <br /> It is interesting to see how the film comments on the contrasts between the reality of police work and its counterparts in fiction on television and in cinema. Shatner gives lectures on the right way to slip on the hood of a car; De Niro points out that the holsters scratch the finish of the hood. Ironically, as the film progresses, the character of De Niro begins to incorporate the illusions of the policeman-policeman's reality into the real case where he works. <br /> <br /> The film is inspired by a variety of sources to make the commentary it is derived. So what? Satire must draw his humor to exist. In addition, the film presents original moments of originality. For example, I am pretty sure that the method of death of the wicked has never been practiced before. <br /> <br /> A little criticism about the reality of the weapons involved: should not these weapons have suffered any decline? To penetrate the steel, these bullets must have sufficient inertia to penetrate. And the highest inertia of any ball is when shooting. So ... throwing a volley of these killer tanks should have pushed the shooters back on their buttocks. Oh, damn it ... it's a satire. Perhaps the lack of recoil of weapons is in itself a satire of the B-F-Guns used so casually in thrillers. <br /> <br />
