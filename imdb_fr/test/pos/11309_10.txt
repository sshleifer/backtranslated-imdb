This is one of Julie's greatest tributes to music, alongside her album "Trapped in the Body of a White Girl". To quote the great Medusa, "Dare to be naked, just wear your underwear, you'll get a return home every time" - Wow !!! That's good advice. "You can dance at my party, yeah, justify your dance shoes! ..... You're invited to the party in my pants ... Yeah go boy dance, at the party in my pants" Julie Brown is hilarious! !! It's almost sad that this video lasts only 51 minutes, but every minute is great !!!
