"Quitting smoking" can be as much a question of getting out of a pre-ordered identity as of drug withdrawal. As a young rural man coming to Beijing, class and success had to hit this young artist's face as a call to part with his roots and far surpass the actor success of his peasant parents. Problems arise, however, when the new man is too young, when he demands too great a distance from family, history, nature, and personal identity. The divisions that ensue and the confusion between the imaginary and the real, as well as the dissonance between the ordinary and the heroic, constitute the essence of an intestinal verification or a complete escape from oneself. Hongshen slips into it and his long lonely road can be sinister. <br /> <br /> But what exceptionally convincing feature, honesty and sensuality the director Zhang Yang and his actors bring to this trip. No clich√©s, no stereotypes, no rigid gender roles, no scenes of sex, romance or violence required, no street language required and, to spoil nothing, no money supposed to launch acts of character and whims. <br /> <br /> Hongshen Jia is in her mid-twenties. He is a talented actor, impressionable, vain, idealistic and perhaps hungry emotionally. The perfect recipe for its facilitators. Soon, he is the "cool" actor, idolized by the youth. "It was hot in the early 90s." "He always had to be the most fashionable." He needs extremes and gets into heavy metal, adopts earrings and a scarf. His acting plays mean the arts, friends - and roles, but not those that offer a personal challenge or contribution. And his self-criticism, stunned by the immediacy of success, opens the doors to an irrational doubt, to self-hatred: "I did not know how to act" "I felt like a fake" - and to drugs available to counter them . He said, "I had to get high to do what the director wanted." Thus, his identity as a shallow actor as an actor becomes, through drugs, an evasion of identity. <br /> <br /> Hongshen's disengagement from drugs and its false life is very gradual, intermittent - and stubbornly his. Loneliness, space, meditative thought, the refusal of speech, replace therapy. The summary is out. And much of its change occurs outside - not in idealized places, but mainly in green areas under highways, bridges and skyscrapers in Beijing. Physicality is almost romantic, but it is not. Bike rides to Ritan Park, long spontaneous walks, sun and rain, grassy picnics, sky patterns and kites that absorb his daydream are very specific. It drifts to arrive, while seeking benchmarks for a more real and realistic identity. "I started to open up," he says in retrospect about this period. And the contact seems to begin with his slender body that projects a kind of positioning of the dancer (clumsy, graceful, humorous, telling) in a current situation. If the mind or spirit is missing, his legs may force him to walk all night. <br /> <br /> The rejection of certain roles is at the heart of his return. To mark his end of action and his determination to adopt a new identity, he breaks his videos and television, and hits his head until he is bloodied against his poster "John Lennon Forever". He has dropped his iconic anti-establishment artist --- but he is the only viable guide he knows. He even represents himself as the son of John (Yoko Ono) and adopts his "Mother Mary" as intercessor at his "hour of darkness" and his "time of trouble". (the heartbreaking and trembling pain in the park - hallucinatory and skitzoidal trials) "Music is so much more real than acting," he says. And speaks of Lennon's influence as "showing me a new way of doing things". In the mental institute, life-saving apples (resistance, food) reflect Lennon's presence, as does Hongshen's need to hang up his hero's poster in his redecorated room. <br /> <br /> If Lennon's influence is stimulating, Hongshen's father's influence is rooted. Although father and son are both actors and users (drugs and drinks), it is Fegsen's differences with his son that underlie his change. Because the father is safer in himself: he accepts the fact that he is Chinese, peasant in a line of peasants, director of rural theater. And he controls his habits and emotions. It is this recognizable identity that pushes Hongshen to treat it as a sounding board, sometimes with anger and anger, sometimes with humor (jeans, Beatles) and passivity. In his most insane and violent exchange with his father in which he accuses him of being a liar and a forgery, he exposes himself more than his father: "All the acts that I committed before were bullshit ... life is bullshit. "And in Hongshen, insisting that" you're NOT my father, "he replies softly," why can not a peasant be your father? " <br /> <br /> Under the direction of these two teachers and with the additional help of his mother, his sister, his friends and the inmates of the rehab center, he establishes a tangible connection with a real (not all) self. As the long-term effects of the drug diminish, so does its old identity. Debt replaces pride and mistrust. Integrity banishes its black cloud. All its edges soften. "You're just a human being," he repeats incessantly after being released from the bond he was given for refusing to take medicine. Back home, the lean peasant soap is fine to him now. And his "rare and true friendships" once again begin, as he is so obvious in the back of a poignant closing scene with his musician friend. Hongshen says of this movie: "It's a good opportunity to think about my life". And I could add, become a new actor, related to art and life. Like Lennon, he succeeded without losing his identity.
