I am Egyptian. I have a green card. I live in the United States since 1991. I have a very common Arabic name. I am married (non-American but not Egyptian and non-Arab). I have children who are born in the United States. I have a doctorate in cell biology in the United States and I travel for conferences. I earn a six-figure income and I own a home in Washington, DC. I pay my taxes and my 1 or 2 parking tickets. I have no defect on my record since I arrived in this country in 1991. I look more Egyptian than the character of Ibrahimi but my spoken English is as good as his. <br /> A few months ago, I was returning from a conference / company in Spain, via Munich, Germany, to Washington, DC (Home). A German officer took me to Munich airport as soon as I got off the Madrid plane. He was waiting for me. He was about to start questioning me until I just told him, "I have no business in Germany, I'm just passing through." He let me go with the greatest disappointment. It was nothing compared to what happened in Washington at Dulles Airport (which was not as bad as what happened to Ibrahimi in the movie). The customs officer asked me some questions about the duration and purpose of my trip. He then wrote a letter C on my personalized declaration form and let me go. After recovering my checked baggage, I was stopped at the last exit point (shit from Homeland Security). I sat for 3 hours with many people of different nationalities. I was not told why I was detained. I was not allowed to use my phone or ANY other phone. At first, I was passionate, asking to be informed of the reason or let me go, but I decided to drop everything and wait. I asked if I could call my wife to tell her I would be late, but I was told no. When I tried to use my phone and as soon as my wife said "hello", an officer shot her and threatened to confiscate her. When I asked them to call home because my family was waiting for me, they said: "Three hours is nothing, we will contact after five o'clock". When I asked to use the toilet, an agent accompanied me. The toilets were funny. I guess it was a prison-style metal toilet without a toilet seat. Finally, they called my name and gave me my passport / green card and told me you could go. I asked what was the problem, they said "nothing" !! I know it was only 3 hours but I was tired and wanted to go home to see my wife and children. <br /> <br /> As for the film, it was very well done. Unlike most films that involve Arabs and use non-Arab actors who only speak gibberish, this movie in Arabic was 100% correct. I guess the country is Morocco (North Africa).
