Sir Arthur Conan Doyle wrote a number of reports in Sherlock Holmes, but the popularity of the famous detective ensured that the sequels in movies and films would extend well beyond the author's works. <br /> <br /> In "Sherlock Holmes and the Secret Weapon" Holmes, Basil Rathbone, patriotically serves British intelligence to protect the viewfinder of a Swiss scientist. The film dates back to 1942 and I wonder if producers and writers have realized how essential the viewfinder's secrets were (the US viewfinder Norden was kept as zealous as the new radars that would change the course of the Second World War). <br /> <Holmes and his faithful but expected companion, Dr. Watson, Nigel Bruce, fight Dr. Moriarty, Lionel Atwill. As devilish as Moriarty has always been, it's a bit shocking to see that he's engaged with Hitler. Does not man have a vestige of decency? I suppose not. But Atwill is deliciously pervert. <br /> <br /> The story is rather fast as Holmes and Watson seek to recover the stolen bombshell's components before they can be delivered to a submarine. Rathbone is his usual suave and several holms disguises are well made. <br /> <br /> This story and other Holmes stories from the 1940's are now available on DVD and oldies.com has put together a very nice set of four wooden box discs: this movie is included with a Bonus CD of an interview with old Doyle. The game costs about $ 26 in major DVD and CD stores, but I found that and other games at oldies.com in a warehouse club at $ 14.98. Transfers are very good. <br /> <br /> Very nice and relaxing to watch late night. <br /> <br /> 7/10.
