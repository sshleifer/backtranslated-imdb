I have been writing crime fiction for a number of years. When a writer develops a story, he always has a character / actor in mind to bring him to life. Last weekend, I found a new one at Paul Vario, where he was playing with Uncle Benny in Eddie Monroe. It was an elegant film highlighted by the presence of Vario on and off the screen (his voiceover narration was also heard). I also particularly liked the actress who plays Benny's niece and Eddie's ex-wife, although everyone did a good job in this exciting movie about playing with bad guys and the double crossing that goes with it. A nice job all around ... and Mr. Vario shone brightly. He must be my Tony Gangi someday ...
