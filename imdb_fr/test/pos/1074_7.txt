It's not really a question of wine. No, Nossiter's real targets are those who would like to rationalize and assimilate the peculiarities of local (wine) production for commercial purposes. To this end, he made an excellent objective film. Independent, enthusiastic, charitable, emotional and imperfect independent wine producers sit side-by-side with Amercians and media-savvy Europeans: a winemaker's art opposed to the manufacture of laboratory-produced and market-driven products. It's an open show that does not lead to the conclusion. <br /> <br /> Nossiter's film is sometimes annoying to watch - the cameras are neither hidden nor steadicam, far from it. There are also a lot of legends and subtitles to browse, a duration often too short on the screen. <br /> <br /> However, Michael Moore is better than the game that Moore can not play. The characters speak for - and therefore condemn themselves - themselves. Worth a visit 7/10
