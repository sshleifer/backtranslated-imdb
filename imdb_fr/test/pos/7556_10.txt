The film follows four friends of the 1950s (when they are in high school) until 1981. This is Danilo (Craig Wasson), a Yugoslav immigrant. Georgia (Jodi Thelan) a "free spirit"; David (Michael Huddleston), who has no personality, and Tom (Jim Metzler), a tall, strong, handsome and strong. All three are in love with Georgia but she only likes Danilo. The film focuses mainly on these two - it relates their lives, their love and their appeal to each other over the years. Danilo also tries to win the love of his immigrant father. <br /> <br /> I like this film but it's not without drawbacks. Thelan's high and strident voice is annoying (but you get used to it); the story jumps very quickly; The lives of Tom and David are never explained (Tom presents himself with a Vietnamese woman and children and David has a wife whom we never meet until the end); some crucial scenes are poorly written and there are obvious cuts before the release (probably to keep the movie at 2 o'clock). <br /> <br /> But everything else is so good that you can easily forget the problems. The story is convincing: you really get to know and understand the characters and you find yourself still trapped in life. With a few exceptions, Steve Tesich's scenario is good. In fact, Tesich himself was a Yugoslav immigrant and based most of the story on his own experiences. All the actors are great - especially Thelan and Wasson - also Reed Birney presents a strong and friendly performance in the role of Louie, Danilo's roommate in college. And Lois Smith is very interesting in her role. And look for Mercedes Ruehl and Glenne Headly! <br /> <br /> Basically, it's a great story about immigrants, adulthood, America's love and that covers perfectly the years 1950-1980. > This film was (unjustly) decried when it was released. The studio did not know how to advertise (it's a difficult film to market) and criticism trampled on it (Pauline Kaels' criticism in "The New Yorker" was particularly harsh). He barely played in theaters (I had the chance to see him in 1981 in his theatrical short film) and simply disappeared. It's a shame. This is a movie that is just ripe for reissue. I do not bet on it - but you never know! Some 10 all the way!
