I remember watching this series greedily and being very disappointed with the end. In the years that followed, I tried to find out if I could get a copy on video or on d.v.d., but to no avail. However, I was delighted to find this website with the details, to be disappointed again at the time of purchase, that the available videos are not read on English recorders! This production was so wonderful, quite accurate with Nevil Shute's novel, taking the scenario after the end of the war, with Joe's and John's common life - absolutely wonderful - and I only wish I could see him again, since it's an original projection, there was no resumption on British television.
