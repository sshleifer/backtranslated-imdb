I managed to see the premiere of this movie on MTV last night and I needed to tell everyone that this movie had caused thunder. It is obvious that D fans will particularly appreciate this movie, as it contains many jokes for those who have seen the HBO series and more than enough for new fans and the mass of future converts. The music really shines with the new songs "Kickapoo" (which is much better than it seems), "Master Exploder" (perhaps the 3rd best song in the world) and "Dude (I miss you totally)". There are plenty of great scenes (car chase, rock-off, meeting) and cameos (including Dave Grohl as Satan!). I could really go on for hours but I do not want to give up the movie. Go see him. You will not be disappointed.
