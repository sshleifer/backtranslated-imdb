It was my second experience of the Monkey Island series, the seven years since the opening game. What was my answer? "Oh, great, we play a cartoon." I'm happy that my brother silences me and keeps playing, because the jokes have once again caught my attention, as well as the wonderful dubbing of Guybrush d'Armato - not to mention all those who worked well (I still think Elaine CMI sounds better than EMI). The cinematics do well to illustrate something that happens, and the art of the game and cinematics are excellent. When we found the CD containing the originals, Secret and LeChuck's Revenge, we were both ecstatic and spent hours working on Revenge - such a moment was when we sat down and blew half a day on it . However, CMI must be the most played Monkey Island game, especially for the return of the sword fight and the high seas fight. That moment when you meet Kenny and he tells you he's gone directly and then, "I run arms!" had my brother and I in tears of laughter. And that's not the best part of the game, not far away.
