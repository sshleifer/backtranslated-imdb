I may be a good old Virginia boy from the Confederate United States, but this man does it for me. This mustache annoys me. I remember the first time I saw a video. This girl he beat was amazing. The depth of his playing when they cut the weathered facade was a new level of masculinity. It reminds me of the granite sculptures of our mount. Rushmore. If I could ask him a question, it would be: "If you were a hot dog, would you eat yourself?" Will Orhan go on a meeting tour? Take note of the big names such as Gordon Lightfoot, the true music of the heart never goes away. Long live John Denver. Gracias my friend, O.F.F.L. (Fan of Oran for life)
