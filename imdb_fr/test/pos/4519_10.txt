I just watched this movie during an advanced projection. I did not read the book and I did not know anything about the story, but I went there because the book was voted "Book of the Year" by two local colleges. So I can not compare the book to the movie as others have done. <br /> <br /> In short, I thought it was an incredibly moving story. The acting was credible and the vision of Afghan culture and political history was both interesting and shocking. My oldest friend is Iranian-American. That's why I felt an affinity for certain values ​​and traditions of the Middle East described in the film, because they reminded me of the moments spent with his family. The themes of friendship, family, human values ​​and courage under fire are universal and well developed in the film. I will not list the details of the parcel, because these can be obtained elsewhere. But based on the technical aspects of the film, acting and, above all, its heartbreaking story, I would certainly recommend this film.
