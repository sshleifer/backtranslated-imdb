The first films of Dead End Kids (before they were renamed "The Bowery Boys") were all very entertaining and well-produced Warner Brothers movies. Although they are rather stereotyped, they still had excellent writing, a good game of action and good behavior over time. Do not confuse them with the cheap movies of Bowery Boys by Monogram Pictures. Despite the presence of Huntz Hall and Leo Gorcey, these films were several notches inferior to the quality of previous films. <br /> <br /> The film begins with beefy John Garfield winning the lightweight championship. Unfortunately, shortly thereafter, he is drunk and is accused of a murder he did not commit. The problem is that he was so busy that he was not sure if he had not killed him. He fled and led a life of tramp. Finally, he will meet Mayist Robson and the Dead End Kids - as well as a lady who, you know, will become his girlfriend in the time allotted to him. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film was not so far away. It's surprising, but because of the quality of the film, it does not seem to matter. Garfield and the kids are at their best and this is a movie that will please everyone except the most difficult viewer.
