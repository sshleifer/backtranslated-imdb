That's exactly what I expected. Relaxing, fun and fun. The couple of actors were great, as well as the selection of the scene. I recommend it personally. It's a kind of movie that the whole family can see at the same time without anyone feeling uncomfortable or bored. This cute movie will make you smile and laugh too. And the action scenes are tasty. Classics of modern American comedy. And very well done.
