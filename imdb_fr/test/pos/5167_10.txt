My wife and I saw this film once in 1989 and we enjoyed it so much that we wanted to see it again. It was so moving that I called it a tearful. The mystery on which Billings was sent to report is really not a mystery. Angles !! It seems that every time he turns around, something happens to him, everything is fine, and I think it scares George a little, considering that he does not realize what he did. This proves that even the coldest people can change with the right attitude. If only we could all treat each other the same way, the world would be a better place. to buy I'll grab it.
