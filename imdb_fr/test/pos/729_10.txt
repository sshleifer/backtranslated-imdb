It could be easy to complain about the quality of this movie (you do not need to throw tons of money into a movie to make it good, it will not guarantee that it is worth watching ), but I think it's totally missing. If you're waiting for fast cars, T & A or a movie that will flourish for you, then do not look at it, you'll be disappointed and stunned. <br /> <br /> This movie was really nice, kept us on the edge of our seats and made us really think. The writer has obviously put a lot of thought and research behind this film and it shows until the end; remember to keep an open mind. <br /> <br /> Note: The school scenes were all shot at McMaster University. the rest was done in Toronto.
