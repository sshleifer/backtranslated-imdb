I was lying in my bed, flipping through the channels ... and can I have channels ... 500 of them. With more than 70 movie channels, I probably watch a movie on cable, once or twice a month ... A DVD robbed me. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I flip and I come to this film and because I see Natilie Portman, I take interest. 110 minutes later, I'm still interested. How could this be? When I first saw the film's previews for the first time, I remember making fun of it. I never thought I was going to watch her ... too bad for her. <br /> <br /> The story is based on a book, and you can tell it. The film is very episodic, and it's not as if the film had a beautiful plot, it sucks you. Maybe it's his performance that makes it. I'm pretty sure it had to be. <br /> <br /> This movie was good for no reason ... <br /> <br /> Peter's Movie Score (out of 10): 7
