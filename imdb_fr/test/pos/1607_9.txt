I can not really explain why I find it so attractive and "The Leopard" not; it may be because the focus is on everything that was great with this movie, those intimate moments that Visconti can render so beautifully. Like this film, the pace is majestically slow, but this time it is not excessive. This is the kind of movie where nothing happens but twenty minutes go by like that. I think that's partly due to the way the movie handles flashbacks that act like a mini-story. Like "The Leopard", he has a nice role to play that brings out the same kind of worn-out pathos - though Bogard's performance is more inclined to open up to become unfathomable, especially in the look: he has a smile really stupid that it's easy not to like. It is often very beautiful in quiet moments. It's the opulence of Visconti's films, the grandeur of ball scenes, which I find tedious, as they exchange individual clarity with mass precision. But here it's part of the problem - Gustav surrounded by a visual din. <br /> <br /> The way in which the object of Gustav's affection is presented to us is quite brilliant - the camera shows a girl, girl, girl, then this beautiful boy with feminine features. It's like an allusion to Shakespeare's sonnets, and it does not look hard. (Only when the camera looks at Tadzio all the way down, we walk away and we see his long slender legs, and we realize that he is not a boy, but a teenager.In the beginning, we are obliged to hand over questioning Gustav's attraction in an uncomfortable way, Visconti must have known and he does not fear that.) Visconti is extremely patient with Gustav; we have an idea of ​​man, we know him. It is a largely silent performance, and when he opens his mouth it is to spit venom; so it is not surprising that he wants the boy with open, angelic features to be projected on him. There is a difference with Tadzio (we never know him, just as we never know a handful of grotesque Fellini, but it's because his life is another, his own film), but he's not as seductive as it was created (there is a scene where it turns around a pole is too much). Tadzio does not necessarily lead him - he looks at him; Visconti is content to enlarge. <br /> <br /> The film does not indicate that Gustav is gay - Tadzio is not even really a man, he is a pretty version of a boy (delicate, pale, vaporous, with golden curls) that everyone seems to like it (including a gorgeous and slightly older young man with whom he struggles). What comes closest to showing what one might understand as a reference to Gustav's homosexuality is the barber's famous scene, which reveals his repressed vanity. <br /> <br /> This is not totally successful - the whole section with Alfred is a mess and unnecessary scenes, people carrying long-range bags, could have been excised. Some parts are heavy, like when Gustav's boat comes in and the foolish boys cross it - the looks on his face are too obvious. (But in the same scene, Gustav leaves, he wants a new rower, something so inexplicable that he catches up with him.) But there are scenes - touching for the first time - that develop remarkable intensity. and calm. Tadzio repeats again and again a piano song, notes quivering in the air, may be the best example of the film's worry. There is a discussion that contains a debate that interests me most: Can art be spiritual if it satisfies the senses, or should it go beyond them? (Tarkovsky, who believes both Visconti and Mann, is the best example of someone who goes beyond simple sensory sensations.) I think he manages to do both. 9/10
