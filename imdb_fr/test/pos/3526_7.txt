Unfortunately, I can not help but feel a little disappointed after my MUCH and anticipated "Just Before Dawn" viewing. Jeff Lieberman is a great filmmaker and he can undoubtedly do great things on a small budget, but I expected to see a much more sadistic and macabre slasher from the early 80's. But actually, I'm starting to think that it is not Lieberman who is responsible, but WE gores them! It is more than obvious that Lieberman intended to make his interpretation look like "Deliverance" and not "Friday the 13th", which immensely popularized the subgenus the year before. The horror and the constant sense of threat do not come primarily from machete mad maniacs, but from the truly sinister and isolated forests of Oregon where this film was shot. In case the film seems slow and uneventful, it's only because Lieberman takes his time to present the dark woods and the strange mountains as extra characters in his film. We almost never see the murderers in person, but there always seems to be someone luring behind the trees or under the mountain lakes. Keeping this in mind, "Just Before Dawn" becomes a highly admirable and indeed much better horror effort than his contemporary colleagues soaked in blood. In the midst of an almost infinite selection of bloody and disgusting slashers, Lieberman has managed to re-emphasize the tension and development of the character. The storyline revolves around five 20-year-old friends camping in Oregon's forests, where one of them has a small piece of land. The woods are deserted and campers are naturally unaware that Ranger Roy (George Kennedy!) Advises them to return to civilization. Shortly after, they suddenly meet an innate family whose twin sons have deadly tendencies. The five main characters are surprisingly friendly and convincing! No irritating stereotypes for which you do not feel sympathy, like slutty girls or footballers. Because of this "natural" character, you automatically encourage them, even when they almost end up turning into savages themselves. The photographic work sublimates the film with a level of tension sometimes unbearable and the scary electronic score of Brad Fiedel only adds to this effect. "Just before dawn" is a slice of horror of the early 80s, provided not to let the blood run off your TV.
