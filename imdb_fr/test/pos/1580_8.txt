I would like to say that this movie was completely awesome. I can see how many people would think it's just a shocking movie. It's not completely wrong, but it's as shocking a fiction as Chuck Palahniuk's books are. One of my favorite movies of all time, Bijo no Harawata is a type of movie that is roughly done and you can have just about any reaction. It's scary, funny, stupid, disgusting, full of unusual and exciting material for some people. The first time I saw this was with my friend and his mother brought it home for him to see. He said it was just a jaded Japanese movie, but I've seen so much more. It is poorly made, certainly, but it also has a certain poignant character. As the director himself says, this is a shocking film made for some reason. It's like atrophy. If you leave audiences limp, then the whole human race will be sweet. I think it's a good philosophy and I totally agree with it. Bijo no Harawata is the kind of movie where gangs violently violate fitness, yogurt and all that new-wave stuff.
