The battleship Potemkin would have been a favorite of Charlie Chaplin. It presents a dramatized version of the mutiny of 1905, when the crew of the Russian battleship Potemkin rebelled against his Tsarist regime officers. <br /> <br /> The film is a film classic and a masterpiece of creation editing, especially in the famous sequence of Odessa Steps in which innocent civilians are wrecked in the bath of blood; events of one minute are drawn in five by frantic cross sections. The film contains 1,300 separate shots. In 1948 and 1958, it was judged the best film ever made by a group of international critics. Battleship Potemkin is in the public domain, in some parts of the world.
