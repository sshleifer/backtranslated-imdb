The Ator series is an eloquent example of what should be the B movies. They fail in all aspects, but in such a hilarious way that they are more fun than sad. "Ator the invincible 2", aka "The Blade Master", or "Cave Dwellers" shows us the favorite clone of Conan in Europe, Ator, where we left it in the first film, after having presented a long recap of all the events of the first film. This time, the world must be saved from "The Nucleus", a kind of bomb, represented on the screen as a bright light (I guess they could not afford an accessory). It includes invisible attackers and samurai. As in the first movie, many sequences are used (including a fairly obvious excerpt from "Star Wars"). Completely laughable and incredibly bad - it's an exceptional B movie.
