(Contains spoilers) <br /> <br /> Russia in the 13th century. The opening plan shows the remains of the last invasion: uniforms molding, human skulls and skeleton of a horse. Prince Alexander Nevsky (Nikolai Cherkasov) chased the Swedish army and impressed the Mongolian ruler to such an extent that he proposed to promote him to the rank of captain. But Nevsky answers: "Die in your country but do not leave it". He intends to fish, build ships and trade. But he warns against a more dangerous enemy: closer, wicked and no opportunity to buy: Germany. Their goal is Novgorod. They have already arrived in Pskov: mothers and daughters are suffering for their fathers and sons. Occupying marauding forces distribute the spoils. The rich merchants want to buy their freedom (still a place for some anti-capitalist), but the "people" are ready to fight. They want Alexander as their leader. Pskov is burned to the ground. The Teutonic knights feel invincible and just smile enough for Russian women who helplessly watch how their fathers and sons are slaughtered. Babies are thrown into the fire while senior Church dignitaries watch and stay idle. In Novgorod: Olga Danilovna has two admirers: the rich and serious Gavrilo and the great and joyful Vasili. She promises to marry the most valiant. Vasili calls Alexander Nevsky in Perejaslav. The prince decides not to wait for the attack but to strike immediately. Even the women have donned chain armor ... The invaders want to bite "the Russian bear", but the Nevsky ploy resists: Lake Peipus is his war zone: his men know the territory, but the Germans, more heavy, will break through the ice ... <br /> <br /> Open your eyes wide and watch the most impressive battle scenes ever filmed. It's not just the multitude of extras (who were, I think, hurried in this patriotic exercise), but Eisenstein's masterly management of such a large number of individuals: he moves divisions like pieces on a chessboard and almost every shot resembles the composition of a painting by Rembrandt or Rubens (including horses in fantastic outfits). Russia in winter seems daunting in itself, but Eisenstein's visual imagination is standout. Heaps of corpses are plunged into the cosmic light under an endless horizon. As night falls, Olga and other women search for survivors with torches. A devoted hawk sits on his master's corpse while a crow awaits the right moment to spot the deceased's eyes. Eisenstein's management and Prokofiev's score make ALEXANDER NEVSKY the "Rolls Royce" among propaganda films. Nevsky is, of course, Stalin's alter ego, and the Russians are tall, handsome, heroic, and they have a perfect hairstyle. The Germans are bearded savages and look like members of the Ku-Klux-Klan. The actor who plays Vasili gives a show composed of a man and four characters: first in love, then heroic, love of youth and comic relief. Cherkasov's main duty is to look heroic. In the end, Nevsky-Stalin displays his generosity: he forgives the "little soldiers" and looks for soap for the knight. Only a bearded assassin and a traitorous cleric are handed over to the crowd. He does not forget a last warning: He who comes with the sword will die by the sword ... He kept his promise. 10/10
