I really like this movie. I have to get this on DVD. I have 2 VHS copies, but the quality is so bad that you can not read a joke written on the door of the room. I'm still amazed that Blankfield did almost nothing after that. He made both Dr. Jeckle and Mr. Hyde completely credible. <br /> <br /> The film is undermined by its low budget. (An atrocious montage jumps in the middle of the word and has been described in "Siskel & Ebert".) But, there are a thousand jokes, visual gags to subtle references, which more than make up for it. I often find myself quoting lines (or singing "I have nothing to hide") and, from time to time, completely describe a scene that corresponds to a conversation. There are at least six scenes that are part of my favorite comedies of all time. <br /> <br /> Spectators without a history of cocaine use may miss a lot of gags. <br /> <br /> "Here, take it." * Visual driving while waving buttocks through the window. * "I said, 'Is this seat taken?'" "Beautiful burn!" Visual leggings, headdress, jockstrap and swim fins. * "Yes, I am right-handed." * "Me me!" said the woman trying to sell nads. * "Bernie will love this." * "It's my feet, Jack." said the black feet. * "Why should we tell you?" ... "SHE'S IN THE SUPERMARKET!" * "Ivy!" on the supermarket PA. * Loading the entire cart into the ambulance. * etc.
