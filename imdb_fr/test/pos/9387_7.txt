Death bed: The bed that eats. <br /> <br /> Judging by the title, you can guess what this movie is about. And yet, there is much more (background) story in this film than one might suppose. <br /> <br /> Okay, the main plot is about a bed that eats people and food, but there are also some minor intrigues. I will not spoil them for you, but it's a nice touch. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, in this film, the acting is very mediocre. The fact that most dialogues are not even spoken by the actors does not really help to improve the quality of the film as a whole. <br /> <br /> Because there is a lot of dubbing work. The thoughts of the characters are also revealed to the observers. Sometimes it works, sometimes no. <br /> <br /> The effects are good. Of course, it could be a lot better if you compare it to today's movies. But you really should not; judge the film as it is and do not take it too seriously. You have to admit that a killer bed is pretty creative. If you are easily scared, do not watch this movie. You may never want to sleep again ... <br /> <br /> Death Bed: The bed that eats is a strange jewel of horror with a small budget, but I would recommend it to fans of horror films. <BR/> <br /> In conclusion, I give this film 7 out of 10 stars for its creative history and unexpected twists here and there.
