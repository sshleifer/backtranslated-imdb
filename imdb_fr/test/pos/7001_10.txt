This film is about the crew of a spaceship crashing on a strange, bright planet with three suns. Among the passengers are the convicted serial killer Richard Riddick (Vin Diesel) and his nemesis Johns (Cole Hauser). As survivors of the wreckage begin to find their bearings, an eclipse of the three suns occurs. Shortly after, scary creatures begin to appear and begin to remove the team members one by one. During the eclipse, Riddick starts on his own, his eyeballs have been brilliantly operated, which gives him a night vision. The crew must rely on him to try to put them safe. <br /> <br /> This is a very elegant film, whose color of the sky changes from scene to scene, which gives it a very strange appearance. Vin Diesel is brilliant like Riddick, really threatening but obliged to help people who would otherwise only see him as a threat. There is also an underlying humor in his performance, which adds another dimension to the character. This is the kind of role in which Vin excels, the anti-hero, whose character is not as unidimensional as it appears at the beginning. I can not imagine anyone else in this role, it could have been written specifically for him. <br /> <br /> Roll on the Riddick Chronicles!
