Humiliating representation of the human tragedies of war that provokes reflection. A small but altruistic view of a family's interactions with the enemy during the Kentucky Civil War. This film diminishes the "glamor" of the war; showing its effect not only on the soldier but on the whole family unit. <br /> <br /> Many of today's movies show the war as an opportunity to showcase the "hero" and other fascinating features of the war, but very few attempts to show the true effect that war actually takes on a community. This film tries to do this by recalling the memory of a person these days. This film is supposed to be an approximate translation of a real event, when in reality, this film is probably a factual reality of hundreds, even thousands of "real events" during the civil war. I urge people interested in our civil war to watch this film.
