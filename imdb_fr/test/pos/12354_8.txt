Sheba Baby is still underestimated, probably because it has a rating in pg instead of the usual grade obtained by a Grier movie. all that the PG means is that Pam does not take off her hat, she does it in every other movie she's played. it's more exciting than Coffy, more action. it takes off slowly but by the time it is on the screen, the chills have begun. as Dolemite of Urville Martin, it is the heavy one who seeks to have Sheba's father, but she does not have that. she is waging a war against a woman against martin and her friends. the best scene is with a stupid pimp in his car which I always laugh. I thought it would be silly because of the note on the page but I was wrong to replace sex with violence and in a blaxplotation movie that can only be good!
