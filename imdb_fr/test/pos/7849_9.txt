The Beguiled is one of the few Eastwood movies I've ever seen before shooting the DVD today. And from his distinct shot to the macabre climax, I was completely captivated. Today, too many filmmakers are substituting special effects, fast editing and dizzying camera work instead of character-centric stories, but director Don Siegel has made the most of this relatively simple plot. . <br /> <br /> The story concerns a lady who is finishing her studies and is on the verge of various skirmishes during the Civil War. Women supporting the south find a seriously wounded Union soldier (Clint Eastwood); By caring for him, he begins to manipulate sexually frustrated women for his own ends. <br /> <br /> Geraldine Page is excellent in the role of director with a secret, and her descent into madness is subtly transmitted. For a film that takes place virtually in one place, it never loses its visual interest. It is even possible that the normal status quo, long abandoned when Eastwood's machinations are discovered, is restored; but mistresses and students are coming down on a darker road ... <br /> <br /> It's a totally different movie style from the same director, Dirty Harry, made the same year, and yet they're all two as beautiful. Eastwood plays well against his stoic anti-hero image, but there is also a mysterious quality attached to his character. We never really learned much about him before his incarceration, and the viewer is free to choose his shady character. Naughty or victim? Whatever you think, all I can say is that I really enjoyed it.
