I was about 14 years old when I saw the musical version of Lost Horizon. I loved the movie and the songs so much that I went to the movies several times to see it again and again. My mother bought the record and I learned the songs by heart, as with "The sound of Music" (which people hardly know in Austria). I think the problem with some of these self-proclaimed critics whose comments are published is that they do not have a romantic soul and have not seen the film through the eyes of a young teenager. Maybe he's a fan of Ingrid Bergman but I was happy with Liv Ullman. Could Ingrid Bergman sing and dance? What was so great about her? Maybe the critic did not appreciate because he needed new glasses or new contact lenses because he sees a close resemblance between Liv Ullman and Bill Clinton. It was the idea and story behind the film, philosophy, which was the most important and interesting factor, and a musical color made the film more entertaining and enjoyable without damaging the intellectually appealing aspects. It is unfortunate that many movies with so-called big actors and actresses with unimportant themes / stories are quite boring in comparison.
