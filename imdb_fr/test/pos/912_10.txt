This film not only deals with human feelings and emotions, it also talks about everything that could be but is not. Poetry in movies can be terribly boring and annoying, but this movie is a pleasure to watch. Not to mention the incredible Irene Jacob, a great French actress, one of the best in fact. When the movie ends, you can only feel sorry. After all, when something is really great, we want more (finally, for another great K Kieslowsky film with Irene Jacob, we can always watch Veronique's double life)
