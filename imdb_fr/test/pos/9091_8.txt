When I watched Flatliners for the first time, I was amazed. A good movie had all the necessary characteristics: the cast was superb, the plot was superb, and in the case of thrillers, there were real "thrills" everywhere. <br /> <br /> Keifer Sutherland offered a marvelous performance as a main character, portraying a scientist who believes he can find the answers to life and death by killing himself and then returning to life, essentially in " stealing "the secrets of death. Kevin Bacon offers an excellent performance as a morally more decent counterpart to Keifer, while Julia Roberts offers her most compelling role. William Baldwin describes a student who excels in class and, apparently, in sex. And Oliver Platt, in another outstanding performance, represents the voice of reason for the group and the most innocent. <br /> <br /> The story is relatively simple, but original, and the acting is refreshing - no doubt a remarkable demonstration. film for the genre, and one that set the standard for measuring other thrillers for me. <br /> <br /> 8/10.
