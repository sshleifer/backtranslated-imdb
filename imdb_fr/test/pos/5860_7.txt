He is a homicide detective who is fighting two rich young kids who have nothing better to do than plan and hide a complicated murder. They seem to surpass the police forces as they see fit. they mock the detective by planting clues and dragging them into a wild goose chase. This one has a decent plot with some twists at the end of the movie. Sandra Bullock does a great job as a woman at the limit, not sure of herself and does not fight for her inner demons, she does not seem to keep a man in her life, especially partners, they seem to continue to leave her for some reason. Overall, this is not a bad movie, it prevents you from guessing the very shocking end.
