In 1993, I saw Teen Devian televising at Doordarshan on a Friday night and I could not believe that such a remarkable film was ever shot in Bollywood. It was breathtaking ?? a film with a "modern" screenplay, superb music, three charming ladies and my favorite superstar Dev Anand. In this unusual scenario, Dev falls in love with three women ?? the simple Nanda, the delightful Kalpana and the sophisticated Simi. They too are in love with him and want to marry him. This places Dev in a dilemma (which is the crux of the scenario) - who to marry? He consults a hypnotist who asks Dev to look in a crystal ball. Dev finds the answer and marries Nanda. Beautifully directed (probably by Dev Saheb himself and not by the official director Amarjeet), the B & W classic has evergreen music ?? some of the best compositions of SD Burman (generously aided by RD Burman). "Uff kitni thadni hai yeh ruth" is probably the sexiest song ever composed in Hindi movies. Majrooh Sultanpuri must also be honored for writing memorable lyrics. Teen Devian is a musical in the breeze that fits the style of Dev Anand. Unfortunately, Teen Devian has never received the recognition and popularity it deserves. <br /> <br /> A must for Hindi moviegoers, I will rate the eternal favorite 9.5 out of 10.
