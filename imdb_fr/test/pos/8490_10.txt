Jamie Foxx conducts a brilliant cast on this powerful journey into the life of the mind-blowing, emotionally disturbed pop-jazz genius Ray Charles. Although all the actors play well, Mr. Foxx has won more than just an Oscar. If it were possible to name an actor several years in a row, I would do it for Mr. Foxx. Foxx does not play that Charles, he recreates it. CJ Sanders and Sharon Warren also deserve special mention for their portrayal of Ray's mother (the inspiration of his life) and his young Ray. These two characters provided the most powerful support for the film. <br /> <br /> The tragedies of Charles' fight against guilt, the death of his younger brother and his mother, blindness, discrimination, dependence and success are perfectly integrated into the tapestries of his music . The music is beautiful, the scenario is, as far as I know, perfect, and the acting is nothing short of legendary. <br /> <br /> The staging method of the film deserves a discussion. Taylor Hackford - a director I am generally ambivalent about - had to choose aspects of the larger-than-life and complex story of Mr. Charles's life that would tell his story in the most honest, the most spectacular and the most understandable. Although some disagree (apparently wanting a documentary instead of a theatrical biographical film), I believe he has chosen his themes admirably. Much of the success of this film lies in its constant concentration on a few lingering themes in Charles' life - his deep love and respect for his mother, his need to be loved and accepted, his complex of dependence and guilt, his musical genius, and his deep fear of responsibility to others. Charles is portrayed as a man fighting valiantly against an army of personal demons. I learned more than I could have imagined about one of the men I was listening to on my old turntable with my father in his living room on Sunday night while football games were on television. And nothing was smeared with sugar in "Ray". Themes are addressed with power and human dignity. These themes create a unifying drama that spans the length of his long, illuminated life. The power of these themes, the power of the script and staging, the music and the acting make it one of the most enjoyable and evocative biographies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Recommended for all.
