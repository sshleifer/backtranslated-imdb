Battleship Potemkin is a celluloid masterpiece. The management of <br /> <br /> Eisenstein is really a show. The film tells the story of a ship of disgruntled sailors who are tired of being abused by their senior officers. <br /> <br /> Finally, the sailors finally have enough abuse and send the <br /> <br /> officers packing their bags. During this period, the Soviet Union lacked dandruff <br /> <br />. The government wanted to get its message <br /> <br /> to the people. So they created a national film company and <br /> <br /> one of the members was Sergei Eisenstein. The films were filmed on a tiny budget <br /> <br /> and the lack of film stock forced Eisentein to be cautious <br /> and select the images he shot. In the end, Eisenstein had to <br /> <br /> reuse the footage to create a feature film. <br /> <br /> The most famous action scene in this film is the most talked about massacre on the steps. This scene has been imitated by Bananas <br /> <br /> and more recently in The Untouchables by Brian De Palma. If you want to learn how to make movies, I urge you to watch Battleship Potemkin. <br /> <br /> This is one of the essential elements. <br /> <br /> A +
