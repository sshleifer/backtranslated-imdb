I sometimes wonder if maybe Meryl Streep has become so accepted as the most impressive and versatile actress ever since, well, maybe that's just about the beginning of the sound era that her talent is perhaps now taken for granted. There are probably about three tics on which she relies regularly throughout her performances (mostly a pinched lip), but other than that, her performances are surprisingly variable and original and fresh expressions of functioning internal. Although "Sophie's Choice" and "A Scream in the Dark" and "Silkwood" may be more spectacular, her work here and in "Bridges in Madison County" is also remarkable - just more subtle. In "One True Thing", she is usually gentle and in love with her domestic life, and Streep looks attractive and charming to what might be routine, even boring. I think she has to develop these mini-theses for each character and find out what makes this person real and interesting. She works from within with each character, and it is perhaps this essential quality that has elicited the main criticism of distance or self-awareness. I do not think she's cold at all, but instead she thought about the unique qualities of her character. I think his critics confuse self-awareness with intelligence. Few actors would think and be creative enough to make Kate Muldrun light and carefree in her beloved intimacy, and then reveal unprecedented depth due to her sincere attachment to this intimate environment. Her performances are of unequaled consistency, she rarely does anything wrong. I wonder if it's conceivable that one of Streep's photos does not seem to be diminished because of her presence ... Anyway, Kate loves her house and her affection for her "family life" is as endearing as his new conflict in the house is appalling. When all this is confused and Kate begins to recognize that she can not function in the same capacity anymore, and she breaks the pie dish and shouts that she's not disabled, it's painfully sad to watch her because that was not someone inclined to emotion. Streep is smart enough and generous enough to recognize how everything works better because she felt Kate's dramatic validity and that's really the only scene where she lets her character go. But it is incredibly true to see a character who can really surprise you by posting something you would not have thought possible. Again, the character of Streep has at least three dimensions ... God, that sounds like a thesis, but as an actress, Streep just has a special intelligence, an incredible empathy and great capacity for expression. The film itself is probably a little mediocre. I guess William Hurt is supposed to be an idiotic fool, and he does very well the pomposite. I think Hurt is really a little scary, though. The script is pretty classic - another homage to Streep that she was as touching and believable as she was.
