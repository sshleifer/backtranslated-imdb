I recorded this as a teenager in the mid-1980s, based on the cable guide's synopsis (the treasure hunt aspect appealed to me), with no knowledge or expectation of the film. What a nice surprise when I saw it! It was a very funny movie and I remember watching it a few times. I thought the concept was well done, the harmless competition between the different groups appealed to me and I thought the treasure hunt itself was pretty smart. Sometimes it seems that people are expecting too much from the movies. not all movies will have an important "message", stellar acting, production values ​​or special effects. Sometimes the movies are just for entertaining and fun, and this one succeeds on both counts. It was so nice to read the comments of the actors who played the twins. I have not seen this film for years, but if I did, I think I would have a reaction as warm and enthusiastic as when I was a teenager. At the very moment I'm typing this, excerpts from the appropriate but appropriate cheese-making song trot me in the head: "When midnight craziness begins to reach you ... no matter what you say, it does not matter what you do. ..! "
