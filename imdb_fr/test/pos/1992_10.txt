David Cronenberg's "ExistenZ" is a well-crafted reflection of the philosophy of existentialism. He tackles the problems of a culture connected to technology, which can no longer distinguish between fantasy and reality, nor between organic and mechanical. The film shocks the public by replacing mechanical technology with organic and metabolismic technology. In this context, technology can be part of the human body. After playing the virtual reality game of "eXistenZ", the real world looks like a game. As a result, human behavior changes to apply violent gaming impulses, even when the game is over. In eXistenZ, technology has shifted from machinery to a biological organism that connects directly to the human nervous system; an idea that reflects the belief of Marshall McLuhan, who is a well-known media theorist, that computers are extensions of human consciousness. As the phone is an extension of the ear, television is an extension of the eye, a telegram is an extension of the high-tech virtual reality of the central nervous system is an extension of human consciousness. In eXistenZ, the technology is biological and therefore more humane than in our world. But as technology becomes organic, humans become more mechanical and therefore less free, unable to resist their gaming impulses. EXistenZ is a virtual simulation of the existence of man. Jean Baudrillard describes a society mediated in his book Simulacra and Simulation, in which all power to act has been transformed to appear. The world has gone into a pure simulation of itself. In eXistenZ, it is obvious to see Baudrillard's mediatized society under the themes of the invasion of the body, the loss of control and the transformation of oneself into others. <br /> <br /> While you are in the eXistenZ, consciousness slowly replaces with another identity, your role in the game, which is a reflection of the subconscious life of each individual. As you gain control of your hyperreal life step by step, the aura of your real life disappears. For Baudrillard, "the simulations or simulacra became hyper, more than real". Our hyperreality, like the world of Cronenberg's computer simulation, "feels now and, for all intents and purposes, is more real than what we call the real world." (Baudrillard) The goal of the game, which we can essentially call "experience", is quite metaphorical. Because you can not even know what an experience is unless you live it. As the existentialists say, life without exact explanation is absurd, the game of eXistenZ is also absurd. Cronenberg, ironically reflects the absurdity of our lives. For example, in the game, the other roles stay still unless you ask them a preprogrammed question. And when you put their funny and aimless state in the representation of our lives, the exposed absurdity really shocks. <br /> <br /> The theme of the game is to understand what it is for? This hidden metaphorical question creates anxiety for players playing eXistenZ. They have no doubt about their existence, but they do not know the underlying reason for their existence. Gasoline. <br /> <br /> Existentialists have argued that human beings do not have a fixed nature, nor essence, like other animals and plants; every human being makes choices that create his own nature. In the formulation of the French philosopher Jean Paul Sartre of the twentieth century, existence precedes essence. The choice is therefore at the center of human existence and it is inevitable. even the refusal to choose is a choice. Freedom of choice implies commitment and responsibility. Because individuals are free to choose their own path, the Existentialists asserted, they must accept the risk and responsibility to follow their commitment wherever he leads. I should perhaps mention that "eXistenZ" also deals with the concept of freedom of choice. You realize your last role in the game by making the right decisions. If you do not, the game becomes unrecoverable and boring. So, you begin to question the game, your existence rather than your essence. You suddenly become alienated from the game with a schizophrenia and realize your position outside the game. Finally, eXistenZ is a well-designed simulation of life and therefore of existentialism. <br /> <br />
