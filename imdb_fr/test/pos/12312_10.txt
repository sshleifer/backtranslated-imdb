It's really the only chance to see the magic of James Joyce's writing come to life. His novels are all infilmable (in a real sense) and this is the only long story he has written. This was John Huston's latest film and only reached the screen after his death, and it's easy to see his touch of grandeur. The Dead is poetic in its onscreen approach, it tells us more about Ireland than any modern movie about the IRA and "troubles" could ever hope to tell us more. Hopefully more people will watch this film and know the best of John Huston and James Joyce, and perhaps visit this story in your local bookstore (and find out that this is probably the biggest story ever written).
