This film caught my attention from start to finish with lots of laughter and realistic staging by the actors. Glynn Turman, (Preach Jackson) is the star of the photo and plays the role of a smart guy who loves poetry and has a very sexy friend. Lawrence Hilton Jacobs (Cochise Morris) was an outstanding athlete at Cooley H.S. and even won a scholarship to a famous college. There are scenes in this picture with the Chicago Police Service chasing all these guys in a Cadillac and a visit to the Lincoln Park Zoo with monkey dung thrown around him. The music is exceptional and there are some great photographs around the city of Chicago. Great movie, enjoy it.
