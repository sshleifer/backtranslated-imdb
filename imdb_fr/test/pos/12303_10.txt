Writers and directors, by the nature of their craft, deviate from the action in their work to show a glimpse of the characters and situations. Here, Huston and Joyce have moved back from an even bigger frame to show us the ultimate vision of what it means to be human. Until the end of the film, it seems that the film is not talking about anything, the kind of typical circumstances that fill the daily life. It's only towards the end of the final scene that we realize it's all about it. <br /> <br /> It is not possible to watch this final scene without simultaneously experiencing pity and deep affection, yourself and the rest of human beings.
