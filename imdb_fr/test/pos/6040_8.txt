Elizabeth Ashley receives calls from her nephew Michael - he cries, screams and asks for help. The problem is that Michael died 15 years ago. <br /> <br /> This film scared me in 1972 when it was broadcast on ABC. To see him again, years later, it works ALWAYS. <br /> <br /> The film is a little slow and predictable, the dead are very tame and there is a happy ending, but give way. Elizabeth Ashley is excellent, Ben Gazzara is fine and it's fun to see Michael Douglas so young. And those phone calls still scare me. In fact, I had to light a light during one of them! <br /> <br /> A scary little TV movie. Worth to be seen.
