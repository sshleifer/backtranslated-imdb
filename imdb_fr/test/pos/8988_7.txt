Young Warriors (1983) <br /> <br /> Although it's a deeply flawed (and, in some ways, foolish) film, his way of always defying expectations makes his viewing decent for the fan adventurer of Sleaze. <br /> <br /> Meet Kevin, a Yuppie student, and his gang of adorable fraternal boyfriends. In what begins as a particularly egregious teenage sex comedy, we follow this group of jerk-offs and their antics, which involve, among other things, making pledges to tie bricks to their genitals. The film suddenly shifts when Kevin's first-year high school sister is brutally raped and hit in a coma by a bunch of bikers who seemingly have nothing better to do. When she dies in the hospital, Kevin takes his revenge, much to the chagrin of his detective father. <br /> <br /> So far, we have gone from Porky's-Lite to the Last House On The Left territory is apparently becoming your revenge movie of typical urban activist. However, the portrait of Kevin and his gang goes from vaguely sympathetic until they become crazy murderers. The film has the merit of not highlighting the fascist anti-crime rhetoric that Kevin continues to throw up, while letting him understand that he feels as he feels. <br /> <br /> The atmosphere goes from mild to grim and serious very quickly, and in the end, it is so excessive and exploitative that it will make you incredulous. And that's the strength of this movie. You never know what to expect. <br /> <br /> With over 100 minutes, it's a bit long for this kind of fare, but you will not be bored. Most of the time, badly done, with cardboard cutouts for the characters and some particularly ridiculous situations and dialogs rather stupid, it will not appear any more on the list of forgotten classics. I've had a kick for that, though, and I'm sure anyone reading this knows if they're ready to do it.
