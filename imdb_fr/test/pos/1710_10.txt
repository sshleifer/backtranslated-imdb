"Saturday afternoon" is one of Harry Langdon's best-known short stories, and for good reason. It's one of his funniest and best movies. The conspiracy - as it is - is an old staple: a stung chicken husband runs away for a party with his boyfriend and a few other girls. It's a solid and well-used comedy scenario, but the difference here is Harry Langdon himself. His slow, inefficient, confused, and innocent nature has somehow sunk into marriage with a woman who feels he must be ruled with all his might with an iron fist, and he can only deceive her because he can not say "no" to the exhortations of the friend Vernon Dent and the pretty eyelash of the girl. <br /> <br /> It's a very adult problem to be confronted with such a powerless and childish character. Harry does not want to cheat, but he can not do anything about it. In a marvelous comical affair, he can not bring himself to say goodbye to the new kiss of his girlfriend: he sneaks the kiss against her and shames his hand as if to chastise him. The film is a three-reel comedy, ten minutes longer than the two-reel films that Harry Langdon had previously performed for Mack Sennett, without further intrigue. Maybe it was even designed to be two rolls. It works perfectly, because it leaves him plenty of time to inject the slow reactions and perplexed looks and half-actions that his comedy so often lives. <br /> <br /> He's at his best here, and the show is really the curious magic of Harry Langdon and his ability to turn comedy from almost anything. His little smiles, his look while manipulating the money he has hidden under the rug, his childish attempts to enter the battle in the end. I think his comedy makes us recognize something fundamentally innocent and confused that makes us feel that the whole world is too much for us, but at the same time, allowing us to understand what Harry does not understand (like the fact that the women he kindly brings to his friend to encourage him after thinking that the date has been sounded are actually whores), he forces him to realize with a little sadness that we are no longer so innocent. His comedy is also able to make us say "Awwww" to make us laugh, often at the same time. <br /> <br /> Here, Harry wants to refuse to deceive his wife, he wants to tell his wife whose boss and regain power in his relationship, he wants to fight against the two violent men at the end of the film but he just can not affect his environment, and sometimes we all feel like that. <br /> <br /> The film is perfectly directed by Langdon's frequent director, Harry Edwards; he moves at a fast pace and never stops while taking the time to present and present at best Harry Langdon's motionless and responsive comedy. Vernon Dent, who often plays with Langdon, plays one of the roles where he becomes almost a comedy partner thanks to his very effective couple with Harry. The gags are spaced so as to give maximum effect, and Harry gets his own version of a Lloyd or Keaton style waterfall at the end. Here, the comedy is not in Harry's big reactions to the danger of sitting perched between two cars in motion, but in its slow to take it. <br /> <br /> This is a hilarious film, and a perfect example of the comedy of one of the most unique and talented comedians I have ever known.
