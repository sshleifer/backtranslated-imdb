The story of a young boy, Dexter (Joseph Mazzello), suffering from AIDS, who befriends a rough boy (played by Brad Renfro), his opposite, The Cure is sad, but a little too soapy, shoot your emotions "message" movie with his heart in the right place. For this alone, it is a recommended view. Perhaps the highlight would be to watch them make friends and go out with each other when no one else accepts them. <br /> <br /> However, as the real story centers on AIDS in boys - things start to move when a day at the local supermarket, Dexter catches the eye of a tabloid tabloid magazine that says that a doctor from New Orleans discovered the cure. Obviously, they are both naive and plan to leave for New Orleans as much as possible. Which pulled me a bit in two ways. It warms my heart and I hate doing nit-pick, but I found the wandering plot in a melodramatic and predictable sense and the debates have a shiny layer on them, as only movies can do. I could not escape the idea that I was watching a film about self-discovery, illness and growing up. For example, I know they are young, but I found it hard to believe what these boys are doing. For example, boiling tree leaves and drinking hot "tea" or eating an experimental diet of chocolate bars, as they believe that it will combat the devastating disease. Not to mention their trip across the country as they do without legal repercussion or downright frightening. Still doubts, these movie conventions you expect, it's a story that deserves to be seen especially with the family.
