This film has attracted less attention than "League of Their Own", perhaps because it only has one "name" star. But while women's professional baseball was only eight years old in Midwestern cities, Japanese baseball is a much larger entity, both in terms of financial underwriting and popular support. That alone would make it the best movie. <br /> <br /> "Mr. Baseball" shows the realities of life in Japan-ball: organized cheers, deference to referees, pressure from corporate owners on extreme conservatism of the game - and no hot dog player is welcome. <br /> <br /> This also affects the isolation in which all gai-jin - but especially an American jock, and not the most comfortable in foreign cultures - has the feeling of living Dai Nippon. And the Japanese, for their part, do not feel comfortable with foreigners and show it in different ways ("the zone of striking of the gai-jin", complains an American player, "bigger than a Buick . ") <br /> <br /> The scenario may not have won a prize, playing again on the theme" redemption by improved game ", but I found it much more enjoyable to watch than the "League" pokey. Highly recommended for those who want to see another angle on this great sport.
