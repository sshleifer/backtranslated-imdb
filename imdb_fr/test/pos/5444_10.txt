Considered as a whole for his ideas and dissection of the current bipartite system and political process, I think it is an excellent film. While the film was not the comedy I expected, but once I came out, this film really made me think. Much of what we see and hear about any election is such a joke. In particular, there is a debate scene in this film which, in my opinion, was a masterly critique of our political debates and the "discussion" of these policies. I encourage anyone who thinks our process is good to go see this movie. If you want to make fun of something, Robin Williams and Christopher Walken are not their usual personality. In this film, they show us that the truth hurts, but that the truth is funny.
