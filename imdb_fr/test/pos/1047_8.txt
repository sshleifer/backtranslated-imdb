A magazine columnist who writes about the life of her farm house while living in an apartment in New York must develop a plan by learning that her publisher and a war hero will spend Christmas with her. After a slow start, it turns into a fun little comedy screw, thanks to a nice distribution. Stanwyck stands out from her previous role as femme fatale in "Double Indemnity". Morgan is gentle as the affable war hero while Greenstreet is well chosen as publisher. However, Sakall steals the film as a leader trying to master the English language while speaking with an almost incomprehensible European accent.
