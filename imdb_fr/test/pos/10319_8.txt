For the record, I'm a fan of Curly. But I must say that in reality, Shemp was not so bad. Yes, he might have missed the same kind of slapstick as Curly, but in his own way he was hilarious. At least he was not as bad as Joe Besser. <br /> <br /> In BRIDELESS GROOM, Shemp plays a music teacher (Stooge? A teacher? yeah, right), who recently inherited half a million dollars from a dead uncle and Moe and Larry must prepare him to marry a woman before six o'clock in the evening, without money. <br /> <br /> It was one of Stooges' first sketches with Shemp, before they started recycling their material. It may not be surprising that Shemp was a part of the Stooges before Curly intervened, so it seemed natural. Slags gags are hilarious, especially this scene with Moe and Shemp in a phone booth. Stooge essential runs to be honest.
