It's a perfect movie to watch with a loved one on a cold, snowy night. If you like to laugh with your horror, then this movie is for you. The ingredients of a true classic cult. He has everything you would like to see in a horror movie. A beautiful girl, a hero, the jester, a monster truck and of course a family of mutant satanic killers. This one is full of blood, guts and blood. I strongly recommend watching it in the early hours of the morning and not be distracted by the sounds of the Monster trucks, {Bad {But Funny}} and our Hero eyeball stew. Not as good as the Evil Dead but a close second. Just remember WARNING ..... DO NOT EAT BEFORE VIEWING THIS FILM ...
