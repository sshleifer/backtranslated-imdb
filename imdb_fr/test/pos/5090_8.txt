A silent historical drama based on the story of Anne Boleyn, the queen's new lady-in-waiting who captures the lustful eyes of Henry VIII, an anxious king of ardor who loves to celebrate, drink, hunt, and amuse himself in front of his court. jester, watch jousting, and hunt around young beauties who jump from attractive cakes and pretty females around the castle. Well, he soon canceled his marriage, married Anne and told him that his sacred duty is to produce an heir. She fails on this point and he soon has an eye on another maid of honor. Meanwhile, Anne passes almost the entire film in a state hesitant, disturbed or downright ready to burst into tears. She's just not a happy camper (or is it just bad behavior ?!). <br /> <br /> This film is a solid entertainment, with an exciting story that caught my interest for two hours. - In addition, I had pleasure to see the very sumptuous medieval costume presented here on a beautiful sepia tinted print. Emil Jannings is quite striking and memorable in his well-made interpretation of King Henry VIII - he really felt like Henry VIII. I'm not so sure of the performance given by the actress who plays Anne, seemed a little exaggerated. The DVD of this film presents a proper and well-made piano score that fits this story perfectly. A very good movie.
