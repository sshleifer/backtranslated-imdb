More than 21 years old, the film version of Ruth Gordon's play describing her experiences in preserving Garson Kanin's marriage after joining the service offers Irene Dunne one of her best later roles on the big screen. This is also in line with what was then an optimistic mind in America about not spoiling peace as in the First World War and sowing the seeds of another world conflict. <br /> <br /> The play Ruth Gordon wrote and performed in 224 in 1944 on Broadway. It was limited to the bungalow that Gordon and Harvey Stephens, the main male leader, had on a training base. If you look at Broadway's generic list, it is stated that the production was "staged" by George S. Kaufman, instead of being directed by him. I'm not sure of the distinction, but I imagine that with intelligence and strength as strong as those of Kaufman, the production must have been an interesting period before the opening night. <br /> <br /> When Columbia bought the Sidney Buchman had to go through several scenario reenactments to move the action beyond the bungalow. The film bears very few traces of its scenic origins. <br /> <br /> Alexander Knox plays husband and Charles Coburn, the employer of writers Dunne and Knox. Knox became not only a publisher, but also a columnist. His words and thoughts help sell the paper and Coburn is in a bind. But Knox thinks he must enter the war, the defining event of his time, to speak authoritatively about the kind of post-war world he wants. It was not a rare theme in those years. <br /> <br /> Irene Dunne has good comedic moments, as she did when she ran into Cary Grant. In fact, Garson Kanin directed them both in My favorite wife a few years earlier. Coburn is his old water buffalo habitual and capricious, who finally has a good heart. <br /> <br /> Over 21 was an optimistic photo that, unfortunately, was not accurate about what the allies and I want to say. could bring to peace conferences to create a better world. I still hope a new generation will succeed.
