George Barry is a genius. "Bed of death: the bed that eats" is a prototype of most of the fictional "slipstream" and campfire surrealism, which is now very chic. Really innovative, non-conformist, and just awesome. Hyper-strange actor, subtly nightmarish atmosphere. I recommend reading Stephen Thrower's book "Nightmare USA" (a chapter is devoted to Barry and "The bed of death: the bed that eats"). Available at FAB Press. On a related note, "The Bed of Death: The Bed That Eats" and "Beyond the Door of Dream" are a perfect bill. Moreover, it is commonplace and tired - and finally ironic - to criticize a low-budget cult film for its "bad quality" or "technical inadequacy". The aesthetic of film B is part of the charm of these films. No amount of CGI could replicate the cumulative effect that "The bed of death: the bed that eats" has on the viewer with an advanced palace.
