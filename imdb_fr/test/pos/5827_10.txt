What a beautiful sight! A dramatic show very underestimated. It's great to see that there are no main characters and that each episode, one or more other characters are the main characters. I think the best character in the series is Vern Schillinger. He is a tough guy, a bad guy and an Aryan, which makes him a real bad prisoner, and there are many we all know. This series has many murders, I think it's a bit too much for the murder of the series, but I must admit that this is one of the reasons why I find the series so great.I think some characters were killed early, but some still made their mark. You can not compare things like Prison Break to this series, they are totally different. I think some of the actors in the series are also very good and underrated and should be given what they deserve. A great show, my favorites. A show that should be considered one of the best for years to come.
