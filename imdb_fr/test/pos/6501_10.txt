I just saw this movie at resfest and was floored. I've never been a big fan of scratch, but this movie made me addicted to getgo. It's a documentary, but I never felt like it. (I do not remember the last time I had so much fun watching a documentary). he has a refreshing style and energy, insightful and never too preachy. production values ​​were also high. (shot on film with cool cuts and an amazing soundtrack). Overall, a smart, entertaining and illuminating piece.
