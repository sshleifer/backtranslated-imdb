I can not imagine why he has not been released yet. Sutherland, Lane and especially Chris Evans do a spectacular job. Wake up, studio directors! <br /> <br /> The story is based on the experiences of the author / screenwriter, who grew up as a "poor kid" in an extremely wealthy community, where class is paramount and makes the difference in all aspects of life, from clothing to justice. <br /> <br /> During the questions and answers of the film, the author was asked about his experiences, and especially about what we do not know about the ultra-rich. He said that they were not stupid, that they were very intelligent (unlike what they could do themselves), that they had projects and that they were a threat! <br /> <br /> In many ways, this film is extremely timely.
