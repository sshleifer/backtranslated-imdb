I saw this film as a child and I can not wait to see it again. Did he survive? I decline the 1980 version entirely as fluff. I am sure that many do not think it is necessary to preserve these films. He is so unhappy to discover a jewel lost after his departure. Today's young people are not aware of the hallucinatory quality and impact on life that a film seen in youth may have later. This film, "the blue lagoon" had this effect on me. How many of us wanted to be in a place safe from the fears and chaos of the modern world. It was the idyllic story of a boy and a girl wrecked on a tropical island. there are problems to be sure but in the end they fall in love and they have a baby. Life should be so simple and beautiful.
