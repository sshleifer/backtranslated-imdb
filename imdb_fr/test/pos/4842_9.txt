Being relatively young, I did not know how serious the antisemitism was in Brooklyn, where my family is from. This movie absolutely horrified me. I've seen a lot of movies about prejudice, racism and anti-Semitism, but it seemed harder than most others. <br /> <br /> It was definitely one of the best independent movies I've ever seen. I had to travel 45 minutes to see it and it was well worth it. Almost everything in the movie was awesome. Sometimes it was a little slow, but it did not really bother me because the movie was very atmospheric. It happened in the 40s and it really looked like it was the 40's. The acting was great ... William H. Macy was as always great, as was Laura Dern, and I was pleasantly surprised by the performance of Meatloaf, playing the nasty antisemitic neighbor. <br /> <br /> 9/10
