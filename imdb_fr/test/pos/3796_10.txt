I rarely write reviews, but this film simply requires more attention than it receives because it contains the most hysterical kidnapping that was shot in a comic sequence that was never filmed. <br /> <br /> I only saw it once and found it as the funniest movie I had ever had the privilege of watching. I laughed from beginning to end. It's a real shame that it has not been released on DVD or video. <br /> <br /> You can not compare his cinematography with that of It's A Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World or Promise anything. Only this scenario is not as complex as Mad World. <br /> <br /> I hope this film will be released in the near future because it would be a shame to lose such a jewel of comedy among the funds we have today.
