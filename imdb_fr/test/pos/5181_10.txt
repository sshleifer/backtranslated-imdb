I just watched the movie tonight and found it brilliant. It has no special effects that amaze you, and it's not violent or bloody, no terrorists or extraterrestrials, but it's brilliant. It's just beautiful, nice and it brought me to a different era, a much simpler time, where people could take their time walking down the street and looking at the ocean. I think it was beautiful and I recommend it. Nick was a great character and his friendship with Harry was one of the highlights of the movie. Everyone is entitled to their opinion, but I think everyone should look at it, especially when they feel depressed or when they want to share something nice with their friends.
