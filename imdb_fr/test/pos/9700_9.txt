We have all seen countless previews and trailers. If you liked that Knoxville is overthrown by the bull, you will have a carnal pleasure in the first part. I have to warn the masses, however, I have considered taking my son (under 18) with me but I am relieved not to have done so. This compilation of odious sketches contains some that, although as hilarious as they may seem to the adult community, are not for the immature. These guys have to be paid a great ransom to tolerate some of the sneaky stunts, sometimes played at their expense. In particular, Bam Margera and Ehren McGhehey are offended by the group in a few particular stunts. Enjoy
