I first saw this on request. Or on television. I'm not really sure. But this must be my favorite movie of all time! I mean, this movie has blood, blood, laughter and chills all the way through the movie. I recently ordered "Monster Man" from Amazon and I watch "Monster Man" since I have it. Believe me, you will love this movie. <br /> <br /> P.S. The commentary on the DVD is really fun. They also said something about "Monster Man 2" during the commentary. Hope they do "Monster Man 2"! If you have the option, rent the movie or buy it. You will absolutely love it! It's the best movie released in 2003. <br /> <br /> 10/10
