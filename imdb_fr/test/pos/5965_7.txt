Many animation enthusiasts see Wladyslaw Starewicz as the forgotten genius of a special branch of art, puppet animation, which he invented almost on his own. . . and, as it happened, almost accidentally. A young man, Starewicz was more interested in entomology than in film, but his unsuccessful attempt to film two beetles of the stag led to an unexpected advance in filmmaking when he realized he could simulate movement by manipulating carcasses of beetles and photographing them a while. This discovery led to the production of the surprisingly elaborate classic short film THE STAREWICZ, THE CAMERAMAN'S REVENGE, which he produced in Russia in 1912, at a time when film animation was in its infancy. <br /> <br /> The tumult of the Russian Revolution pushed Starewicz to settle in Paris, where one of his first productions - as if by chance? - was a dark political satire known as "Frogland" or "Frogs who wanted a king". Most of Starewicz's films contain a variety of black comedies, but here it is very dark, it is more intended for adults who can enjoy the satirical aspects than children, who would likely find the confusion overwhelming. (I'm mature and I find it pretty upsetting.) And indeed, the film copies for the English-speaking viewers of the 1920s received title cards filled with word games and nonsense to help alleviate the final one. <br /> <br /> Our story unfolds in a swamp, the Commonwealth of Frogland, where citizens are unhappy with their government and have called a special session to see what they can do to improve the situation. They decide to beg Jupiter for a king. The crowd is impressively animated in this opening sequence - it would have been easy to make sure that so many frog puppets are alive at the same time - while Jupiter, for one, is portrayed as a funny white beard in the clouds that looks as if he preferred to take a nap. When Jupiter sends them a tree god that considers them impassive, the frogs decide that it is not an improvement and require a different king. Irritated, Jupiter sends them a stork. <br /> <br /> Delighted by the presence of this formidable new king who dominates them, the frogs greet him with a delegation of dignitaries dressed in a formal way. The mayor moves forward to hand him the Commonwealth key while news cameras record the event. To the horror of all, the stork eats quickly the mayor then happily engages in swallowing citizens at random. A title card reads dryly: "The news of the king's appetite is spreading throughout the kingdom." When frogs, now terrified, once again ask Jupiter to help him, he gets carried away and takes flashes in contact with their community. The moral of our story, delivered by an unfortunate frog just before being eaten, is: "Let yourself go pretty well." <br /> <br /> Given the period of this gripping little film, and the fact that it was made by a Russian émigré at the height of the civil war of this besieged country. It would be easy to see this as a parable about these events. Starewicz may not have thought of Russia's turmoil when he shot "Frogland", but no matter what prompted him to choose his material, the film is an edifying story of universal application. "Frogland" could be the Soviet Union, Italy, Germany or Japan in the 1930s, or any country of any era that drops its guard and is overwhelmed by tyranny. It's a fascinating film, even charming in its macabre form, but its message is not a joke.
