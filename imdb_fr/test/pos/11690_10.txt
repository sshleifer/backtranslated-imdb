I must first admit that I had doubts about the director. He made some films (with Jarkovsky) on the recent "Czech = East" story or more precisely about the families (individuals), how did they survive historical moments. But it was still like bittersweet Chinese foods. This movie was totally different. It was pure, it shows the bones of life, it shows the variations of human nature. This film is an excellent work of art (history, acting, image, music) but it shows you the life around you in a day much brighter than we do not want to see. By the way, I saw it on a DVD (with English subtitles) but I'm afraid that in the United States, I can not get it.
