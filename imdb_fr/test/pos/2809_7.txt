The film is good and I think Tiffany Amber is very beautiful. I liked the movie. Can anyone tell me how can I get the songs from this movie? Even the soundtrack will do the trick. If that's not possible, can I at least get the names of the songs with their respective singers? I tried to search amazon.com but it is not there. I tried CD baby, not there either. I have browsed Google for details, but there were none. I would be grateful if anyone could give me the answer to my question. I know the songs belong to country music and are sung by a country artist. I just need the title names with the singer. I would recommend this film or rather the songs to any loving country.
