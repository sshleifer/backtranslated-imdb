This production was pretty good. The usual fabulous landscapes, interesting and offbeat characters. It was so strange not to have the office / residence of Captain Hastings, Miss Lemon and Poirot, so prominently in the original mysteries of PBS / BBC. <br /> <br /> In the original series, so many things Bureau. Hastings reading the newspaper, while Poirot "exercises his little gray cells". Miss Lemon intervenes at any moment. <br /> <br /> Poirot without Captain Hastings would be like Holmes without Watson ... he can certainly solve the crime, but it's not as interesting. <br /> <br /> And what would be a mystery Poirot without Hastings, with his impeccable manners, falling in love with a beautiful and inaccessible woman.
