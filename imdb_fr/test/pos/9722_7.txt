Despite its pedigree, the most interesting things about this series are not animatronics or puppets, which, although charming, are little more than demonstrations, at least in the story I've seen, STORY SHORT. In fact, even if I do not admit it, the main pleasure of the program lies in this oldest art, narration. <br /> <br /> John Hurt, in Rowley Birken QC-fashion, grotesque, medieval makeup, tells a story of stories told, sitting by the fire, accompanied by a cynical dog. One winter's day, poor and hungry, he sees a beggar companion thrown out of the royal kitchen by the bad cook. The storyteller manages to give them an excellent soup. Furious, the cook asks the king for permission to boil the wicked, but, happy with the spirit of storytelling, the monarch offers him a reprieve - for 100 nights, he must tell the king a new story: if he does not manage to do it, he will give it to the cook. <br /> <br /> The story may be old, but it is told brilliantly. Anthony Minghella's script is terribly dramatic (as well as a playwright), witty, and raises troubling concerns, such as fears for oneself or the power of culturally autonomous storytelling linked to the maintenance of ideological power. For a children's program, it is a reflexive reflexive thought (the fact that cinema is the new oral culture) makes little sense. In spite of the Americanized style, there is a charming sense of medieval agitation, its grotesque and arbitrary terror, as well as its magic and power.
