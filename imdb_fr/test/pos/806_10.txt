This film deserves a 20/10 if I could give one. "THE HOLLOW" is a great novel by Hercule Poirot and the turn at the end misleads most people. I am delighted that this film remained totally faithful to the novel. There was no major difference that I could spot. The only difference was that Poirot had been introduced into the story earlier than in the novel. The acting was superb and the music, as usual, was of incredible quality! David Suchet is perfect in his role, and the rest of the cast is perfect in their respective roles. In no other film I've seen so far, Poirot has been so brilliantly described! Hats off to the producers - they made a movie that I will cherish with many others, and that I will cherish for a long time!
