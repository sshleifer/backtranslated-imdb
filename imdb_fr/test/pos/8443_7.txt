It's been a few years since I've seen this movie, so forget most of the details. However, I loved it at the time and found the plot extremely captivating, with the culminating heart stopping. I remember being literally on the edge of my place at the theater in 1979. <br /> <br /> Jane Fonda plays a Los Angeles reporter, Kimberley, who stumbles over an accident at a local nuclear plant. She wants to make the story known to the public, helped by her hippie cameraman (Michael Douglas) who photographed the event, but a grim plot tries to hide everything. Jack Lemmon is absolutely terrific in the role of conflicting middle manager of the nuclear power plant, divided between loyalty to his company and "acting right" by reporting the perilous situation. His facial expressions speak volumes here. <br /> <br /> Apart from the captivating plot and the overwhelming tension, this film is about Jack Lemmon, his character and his superb acting. As for Jane Fonda (I was a big fan of that time), I guess she just went from her anti-war protests to the nuclear industry. <br /> <br /> This film seems to be conceived as a tactic of nuclear fear. Despite Chernobyl and Three Mile Island (there are different types of reactors), our Canadian CANDU reactor is safe and well respected around the world. I would not hesitate to live near the nuclear power plant about an hour away, where my friend will work as a very competent engineer. Apparently, they closed for every single problem, regardless of the financial loss. I sincerely doubt that there are plots. It's hard to imagine a highly skilled leader or operator willing to take the risk of collapsing or anything ... it's a joke. Of course, morality is to spare no expense or effort, neither for the construction of the facility, nor for its continued security. <br /> <br /> If we want our Western lifestyle, we have to get our energy somewhere. For those who claim that nuclear energy can never be completely secure (it is true, of course), they should perhaps volunteer as coal miners or return to the period before electricity and the towers. buggy. <br /> <br /> Please, have fun with this entertaining and very suspensive movie that apparently is based (presumably? embellished?) on a true story. It's a real cooler, a thriller and maybe (?) A killer, but please, do not worry about the operation and safety of nuclear power plants.
