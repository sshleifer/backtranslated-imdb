Hilarious comedy and low budget at its best. This set of unique individual sketches with a very extensive autoregressive humor is reminiscent of Kids in the Hall, really hot. Be prepared for some of the most random and repetitive lines, filled with ethnic insults and awful language. Sex toys included! <br /> <br /> There should be more comedy like this today. This collection of sketches on a DVD will justify many views and readings to appreciate certain parts. If you enjoyed The State and / or Wet Hot American Summer, get ready for a little more glory. If you even consider this for a younger audience, I would say that every child on the planet should see it.
