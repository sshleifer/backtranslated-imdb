How important is the director, anyway? In this film, made at the end of the 1960s in a politically tumultuous time when questions of social organization were primordial conflicts, asks this question by making a film that turns the camera away from the action and asks only to reveal director, William Greaves. This is an important work because it appears like no other film shows the difficulties of blocking, organization and staging; this reveals the role of the crew, which most administrators would frankly wish to see disappear completely and the invisibility of is essential to suspend disbelief; and it also takes into account the role of the performance and the scenario, as well as how they correspond / do not correspond to reality and what that has to say about the way in which the director ultimately influences the reality (if any ). <br /> <br /> the documentary, or pseudo-documentary, or the fictional narrative (the one you prefer, through your interpretations of the themes) has its brain in the over-educated crew, too intellectual, his courage in lost artists struggling to understand vague and ambiguous directions, and his heart lies in the director, who wants to portray, represent, express without any idea of ​​how to do any of these things or the reason he wants to do it. It is a film that deliberately repeats banalities to see if they can become more than banalities. It is a film that sometimes shows several shots at the same time, to leave the montages to the public and to show how different shots can change perspective. <br /> <br /> This is an important work that will interest all actors in the sector. and the process of making a movie should look and understand. Like many experimental films, it has no real appeal to the public - it's not for them. It is for the industry, and for the 1960s, that you have to know what to do with a group support that is always based on a single "voice" and an "author". <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
