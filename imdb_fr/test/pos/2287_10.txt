It is an excellent little known film. Tom Selleck plays an exceptional role in this film with Japanese Clint Eastwood. I would like to see if this movie has already been released on DVD, there are places that have clearly been cut. Hiroku (Tom's love interest) was clearly cut off. It would be interesting to see more Japan in the film. Baseball footage is by far the most realistic of all baseball movies, I'm pretty sure most of the players were current or former baseball players. I like to load the cassette of this film at least once a year. The best scenes involve the lack of hat flip flop after Tom gets noticed in the big game, and an extremely sensual scene where Tom takes a hot bath with Hiroku. Dennis Haysbert is also doing a great job. He is happy to see that he is finally recognized, not only in baseball movies (he was also in the Major League).
