<br /> <br /> The kind of film that asks the public too much, but disappoints most of them. I think of the Mexicans who saw it (either to support Mexican films, or to see a cast of Mexican stars), half of the people left the theater when I went to watch it, it is certainly not the kind of movie one could expect. I also think of people from other countries who dared to spend 2 hours watching it until the end, "what a shit". To understand Cronica from a desayuno, one must be Mexican and know the lower middle classes (or better, be part of it). There is nothing accidental in this film, the family is and what many families, at least in Mexico, share. You have to see it with a great open mind to fully accept it, this is not the kind of movie you understand perfectly after watching it. The older brother did not let anyone sit on his RED couch, the sister remained no matter how she wanted to leave, the youngest brother went on an excursion, and all that interested her was the yellow radio, the mother had to go prepare breakfast for the family, as tense and unbearable as the situation. The father came back after who knows how long, allowing the mother to live a night of passion that turns out to be rather momentary and that ends up repeating all the attitudes of her sons ... The stories around the house are surreal ( and the film is too), a transvestite in search of his penis, a factory worker and his suicide attempt, underpinned by the kisses of his girlfriend, a fat man on a bicycle after an interesting conversation on homosexuals with his sister? women? mother? ... The music is not too pretend but it does a lot, not more than a snare, a cymbal, some strings. Thank you, a movie like this one has been made and released. <br /> <br /> One of the best Mexican movies to date! And one of the least understood, even by the Mexicans themselves, no matter what identity should have been felt. . <br /> <br />
