After reading the book before watching this adaptation, you would think he would have lost some of his thrill. However, the story is so smart that I could never get bored. <br /> <br /> Sally and Elaine have really put their heart to heart in their roles and have brought to light so many characters. I fell in love with history and women again. <br /> <br /> It's beautiful to watch thanks to the direction, the sets and the costumes. Despite the speed of television, I do not think that anything important has been lost in transit. He was standing on the edge of my seat with many wonderful moments of heartburn. Appreciated thoroughly. This is the kind of television I was waiting for.
