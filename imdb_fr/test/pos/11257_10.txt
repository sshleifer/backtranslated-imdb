I just saw this movie tonight (November 5, 2005) for the first time. I wanted to watch it because I saw the diaries of basketball (Leonardo Di Caprio) and I loved it, but it was much heavier. I think he had a good representation of drugs to a certain extent. I have sympathy for Nick Stahls, probably because if I was a person I was crazy about, I wanted to help him out. A student and a promising athlete who spends all his time training and studying. It is understandable that he wants to try teenage life (the crazy side of life). wanted to see what it was about and because of his appalling family situation that resulted in his most tragic death. A really sad movie, but a flaw that I noticed is that you do not have a pretty good idea of ​​the damage to families, but other than that, great performance in a heartbreaking movie.
