I admire the sea and have spent several years in the navy. I am therefore a bit biased on this point. I missed this documentary on his first release, but he made several people buy it on DVD this Christmas (2002) and I got it! Some movies are incredible and I have a lot of respect for those who do this kind of documentary, seeing that the 200-tonne cruise of blue whales across the sea is an incredible sight, they looked like submarines. I like the level of information and facts conveyed by the storytelling, it's just, I do not want to know a lot of scientific data, just some basics, to see that this is enough for most people. The BBC has the gift of putting things at the right level for the intended audience. <br /> <br /> A very good documentary, with the movie "The world at war for me", the DVD is of excellent quality. If I had a minor criticism, it's some of the sound effects obviously added here and there, I think they hurt some scenes. But congratulations to the BBC and Discovery.
