I was introduced to John Waters' films when I saw "Women's Issues" at the IFC. I was disgusted but for some reason I enjoyed it. Then I picked up the Pink Flamingos DVD in the John Waters box. The movie is about Babs Johnson "The dirtiest person in the world" living in a Maryland caravan with her mother obsessed with obese eggs and her disturbed son "Crackers". In the film, you'll see unhealthy scenes like sex with chickens, drag queens, people eating faeces, torture and all kinds of random humiliation. The film has a soundtrack of 60s rock and roll artists. The only problem is that some parts of the film seem to drag on and get a little boring. I found "Female Trouble" a little more fun. Classified NC-17 for explicit sex, violence and disturbing images. Enjoy.
