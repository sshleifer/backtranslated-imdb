Let's start then!))) <br /> <br /> The film itself is as original as Cronenberg's movies usually appear ... <br /> <br /> My intention to see him was certainly JJL doing actresses preferred. She is as beautiful as usual this cute! <br /> <br /> I would not say it was my favorite movie. It's still interesting and fun to follow. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast is not very impressive, but it's not a kind of misunderstood star network. ;) <br /> <br /> Recommend with confidence!))))
