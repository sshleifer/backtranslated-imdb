I like movies that show real "American" people and tell the truth. The film is simple and that seems like the big thing about it. It has been played here in Norway (Amazon said above that it's USA / Canda but the box says "All Regions." I must say that it's not for US viewers.) She played here in World Raw Views, a theater, I ordered it and later I ordered it, the cup was different and much better, see and you're going to like it or maybe hate it Sorry Bush fans but this movie drives you crazy because it makes sense Everything is contained there, except that I respect it, it's not for the empty minds, it's too long and too difficult to follow, but at the second reading it makes more sense.
