That sums up pretty well ... nerdy. MacDowell's inability to act is sometimes painful, and Hurt needs money to take on such quiet roles, but I still enjoyed it. In a word, Travolta. He is awesome in this movie. Still, I can not give the film a high score, but it certainly deserves better than it seems.
