The best romantic comedy I've seen in years. This is not the kind of blur on Ben Stiller's Hollywood film or Adam Sandler, and much less syrupy than an epic of Hugh Grant. Julianne Nicholson and Jay Mohr are perfect actors and both offer flawless professional performances as a committed couple who decide to spend some time sowing their sexual oats before the wedding. Instead of playing strictly for laughter, the writers and the director concocted a nice mix of human feelings and comic action. Nicholson is just great as a clumsy seductress and Mohr does a great job as a man who reluctantly enters the game but soon finds himself enjoying his adventures a bit too much. We see just enough characters to complete the plot without distracting from the main story. Andy Richter (serious friend) and Helen Slater (distraught single mother) are particularly talented. There is enough meaning and emotional complexity to make it much more than just a boy-girl farce. Indeed, with just a little more rhythm and a little more, this film would be a comedy of the top 10.
