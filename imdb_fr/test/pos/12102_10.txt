If you are a fan of Turkish music and the Middle East, you are in luck. This film is a documentary about current music in Istanbul, from traditional to modern. It is very good. You could not do better if you went to Istanbul yourself. We have interviews with Orhan Gencebay, excerpts of modern music icon concerts, a tour of shows with a Gypsy audience, Turkish hip-hop (surprisingly very very good) and much more. Some of the best singers I have ever heard. A Kurdish woman singing in a hammam (steam bath) that will tear your heart. A lot of social and political background. If it's your thing, you'll have a good time. I could hardly sit at the theater. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack of a CD is now available on amazon. Expensive.
