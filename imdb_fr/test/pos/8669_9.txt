I believe that history has two angles. First of all, it is the satirical global vision, presented in an obvious Kafkaesque manner, that underlines the sordid spectacle behind some of the most common, but pleasant, or comfortable, moments and elements that are generally sufficient. for man to continue to function in society. Like: a good job, a good house, a good wife, a good car and even a good mistress. Apart from this so-called common happiness, some who can not help asking themselves more awkward questions, such as their origin or the weather, may have another form of happiness, while there might be a reason for them to be the time that there might be something they missed, or, even more sinister, the time that there might be something that the system itself is refusing them. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the most interesting aspect of this film, I believe, is the fact that it attacks head-on this natural constraint of dissecting the world around us, challenging it by our personal judgment and condemning it generally because it does not serve us better, because it is not tailor-made to suit us. the person. <br /> <br /> The symbolism behind the train accident suggests, I believe, that our destiny may be dominated by destiny or by some other more universal power, even in the face of our so-called power to decide when we want to go out. Instead, the man is returned by this more important power (let's call it THE SYSTEM, because the writers clearly avoid calling it GOD, perhaps further emphasizing that the SYSTEM is man-made and so can to be controlled by man, unlike FATE, which is a concept closer to religion) in his own words, not by killing him, but by showing him that there is a place for the man who asks for it / wants too much, perhaps suggesting that true fulfillment does not come from the outside world, but from within, and if the outside world "decides" to bring you some comfort, you should learn to accept it, without question the fabric of each aspect. <br /> <br /> Uncomfortable, but requires you to reevaluate some of the existential questions that became commonplace in the last century, such as what man can do in a world increasingly emptied of substance, a a consumer-oriented world in which man can be traded without making any difference in the whole, but only to the extent that it is useful to the system.
