I loved this film! This is my favorite number one. Although there were some flaws (which film has no flaws?), This film was very well written, directed and produced. The characters in this movie are very real and believable. They adapted all the characters to a specific role. I think the most obvious thing about "Here On Earth" was the love triangle as well as the other emotional situations introduced in the film. It's not one of those movies where you obviously can not relate to anything, because it's about situations where everyone is or has been. There are so many different things in this movie that it's hard not to understand it. I am only 18 years old and I can even understand. It was comforting and heartbreaking at the same time. "Here On Earth" will make you laugh, cry and sometimes angry. I give this film an excellent review and recommend it to anyone who loves romance and passion!
