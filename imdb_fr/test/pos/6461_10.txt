It's a powerful film that never seems to have come back after Joe McCarthy's censorship period. It influenced me as a Jewish teenager with friends of different colors whose father's family had suffered under Fascist regimes in Europe in the second quarter of the twentieth century. Unlike the latest scam, "On The Waterfront" which seemed to take some of the same themes and tweak them to fit the Hollywood political correctness of the time, she told her story directly and in respect of characters and reality. it mirrored fictitiously. It was an antidote to "Gone With the Wind", "The Birth of a Nation", "The Triumph of the Will" and so many other glorifiers of hatred and violence. I would place it alongside the recent German film (also virtually hidden in the United States), "Rosenstrasse". <br /> <br /> I remember that the TV version, also in black and white format as well as the story, was blackened. some stations because the wife of the black hero appeared white. As a young civil rights activist, this created a conflict for me because, on the one hand, I was opposed to cigarette smoking and on the other hand, to boycott in Georgia a sponsor of the TV show, a major tobacco company (I do not remember which one - who else?). <br /> <br /> I would like to find a CD of the film or television series to allow my sons to see something that has enlightened my opposition universally to racism (as opposed to fighting against racism against Jews ) and the recognition of the inherent link between racism and militarism.
