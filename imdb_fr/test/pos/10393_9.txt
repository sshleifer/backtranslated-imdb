Beyond the Clouds is in many ways the strangest movie I have ever seen. Not for its cult appeal, gore, or even for its ideas, but for the elements that make it a masterpiece of cinema. Beyond the Clouds was directed by Michelangelo Antonioni, one of Italy's most famous directors. However, if you watch this film only briefly, I mean passively, it seems to be one of those melodramatic and often vain romances. This film deserves a lot of attention, to the point of embracing all its cheese. By cheese, I'm not talking about a slice, but a cheddar brick! The music seems to come from an Italian porn, the story and dialogue of a cheesy Japanese soap, and the metaphors are so obvious that you want to hurt your head. <br /> <br /> But once you've figured out all that, you're engaged in an existential work of art. The cheese fits into the subtle film and draws our attention, perfectly, to what needs to be known. The basic plot is composed of four chapters, unrelated, and all about love. We learn that no matter what happens or what is said, people can not communicate with each other. Instead, they can only communicate with each other. I guess that's why the dialogue and the plot are so cheesy, because the conversations are too irrational with a lack of causality and the reaction of people too melodramatic. <br /> <br /> I left this film thinking of myself; maybe all of life is a big melodrama. We judge our feelings towards others as real and determined. I hate, because I'm right. But what does the hated think about it? Maybe they think my hate is stupid and arbitrary. In other words, melodramatic. <br /> <br /> Thus, melodrama is actually an existential function. A silly novel is simply a human interaction under a magnifying glass, allowing us to see the futility of who we are and what we do. <br /> <br /> This is an excellent film, I recommend it to everyone!
