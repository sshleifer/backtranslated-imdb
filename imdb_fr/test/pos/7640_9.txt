I do not see why everyone gives this film negative reviews?!?! I loved this film! Bled is a form of abstract art and if you do not like art, I understand why you would not like this movie. It was a great shot of the mean, played the vampire movie. If you are looking for a fresh, new and ingenious vampire movie, then this is for you. But if you want one of these characters to turn into bats, into wolves and blend into the movies in the light of the sun, then watch your old Dracula movies. Of course, the budget is a little weak, but they did a great job with the budget they had. I am very happy to have found this film because I was about to give up the vampire genre. I thought this movie was brilliant! I congratulate the author, the director and all the people involved in the film.
