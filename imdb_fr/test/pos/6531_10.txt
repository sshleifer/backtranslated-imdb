I'm probably a little too old for this movie, 16, and being a guy, the story is a little too little girl, but I really thought it was a great movie. All the girls in this movie are so hot and so big actresses, from Alana to Adrianne, to Deena, Kimberly and the pretty girl who plays Alana's little sister, Rachel. I'm not a big fan of pop-star with very melodious songs, but I thought that Aaron Carter really did a good job in it and seemed to really like this movie and made it real. My mom loved all the older pets she grew up with, so that's cool too. I kept thinking that I loved a lot of people and wondered if I would see them again? A suite would be cool. I rented it, but I could buy it too, because I have a ton of DVDs and I like to come back to see something that I missed. However, I could not buy it at Blockbuster, so I do not know where I could buy it now, but I'm going to watch that. Anyway, I'm a 16-year-old guy, I've already said, I know, but I'd take quite a date to see that. It's really good for all ages, really. I think even my little half-sister who is 6 years old could see that. That's what's so cool about it, it's something that all ages can see. I'm sure it was done on purpose, but it really works. Girls can dream of being with Aaron Carter, and guys like me can dream of all the hot girls in this movie. There is something for everyone.
