Was curious to know the name of the Tuscan village where filming took place in Italy. I know the name of the villa: Villa San Girolamo would however like to know its exact location in Tuscany. The cinematography is excellent and it would be wonderful to visit this region. I would also be interested to know where the shooting is in the desert. I would travel a lot in Europe and Africa and I would be interested in visiting the book and film regions. Please email me with any information on the sites that anyone could have. We would be very grateful. And if anyone knows if the villa in Tuscany is still habitable, it would be great too. I am waiting for any information and thank you in advance for your time.
