I have not seen this movie for 30 years, so I do not know if I would like to see it as much as when I was 12 years old. At the time, however, I loved this movie. It's a good "starter movie" for pre-teen girls. Be careful in the end, though. There are tears and lively emotions. <br /> <br /> Looking back in a 2008 perspective (with much more knowledge about child psychology, politics and political correctness), I think it would be interesting to look again . Patty's carefree and abusive father, her indifferent mother, and her privileged sister all helped make her vulnerable and hungry. Patty was sad when Anton left. She was heartbroken when he was killed. The rage directed at him later was shocking. After all, she was only 12 years old. <br /> <br /> What I remember most is the way this film taught me that even "enemy" soldiers are also human beings. All German soldiers were not heinous Nazis. When I was older, I saw TV shows like Hogan's Heroes and The Rat Patrol that also argued that "normal" German soldiers were not the same as the Gestapo. <br /> <br /> "Normal" soldiers have been recruited. The Gestapo was handpicked among the volunteers for their particular hateful attitudes. I think one of the privileges of being a Nazi was that they had special missions and they were not going into combat. Their specialties were interrogation and torture. <br /> <br /> Later, during the Cold War, I would think of Russian soldiers and remember SOMGS. We have been taught that the Soviet Union is "perverse". But the reality was that the Russian soldiers were not there to destroy America. They had a job. Their government probably told them that our government was trying to destroy their way of life. Which was kind of true since the United States fought to put an end to communism. <br /> <br /> The lesson is still applicable today. The German soldiers were not the same as the Nazis, just as the Muslims are not the same as al-Qaeda.
