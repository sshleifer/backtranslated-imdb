When I went to the video rental store, at the time when the DVD was still almost unknown to me, I had seen all the movies from the store that interested me. Or so I thought! The man behind the counter told me he had something for me that I really want. He gave me "Plunkett and MacLeane". At first, I doubted, but I trusted his advice and ... man, I'm really happy to have won this jewel! It's one of the best adventure movies in years, if you ask me! Of course, with Robert Carlyle as the lead actor, how much can a film become? Liv Tyler is once again what she is good and nothing more: to be pretty. Nevertheless, you may very well feel that the cast apparently had a lot of fun making this movie.
