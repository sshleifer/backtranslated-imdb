In the 1980s, patriotism and, in some cases, total jingoism were quite high. "Can we win this time," a famous song by Rambo: First Blood, Part II, could almost sum up the number of people who felt at that moment. A nostalgia for the style of film they grew up with, bullets on the wall "we're good, your bad ... now, let's blow something up and get home" While Rambo, Rocky, and for the most part Gun seemed more likely to attract an older crowd, with Iron Eagle speaking directly to the kids. Canadian writer and director Sidney J. Furie brings out all that you love and hate from this era. The kick in the pants tilts the hymns of the 80s (never say die, Gypsy Road, etc.) at the top, and sometimes an action adventure almost incredible. Iron Eagle was successful for a reason ... it was F.U.N - Fun. This is the type of movie you can turn on, sit back and enjoy every totally ridiculous moment of the '80s. You do not have to wonder if it could really happen, or if acting is really believable, it's just fun ... and that's all you can really ask for in this type of movie ...
