I agree with the comments of the previous author on the excellent performance and the plot. Began watching this movie by accident ... (lazy Sunday afternoon clicking on the channels to see if anything good was on) ... ... and was hypnotized by Martin Sheen and Emilio Estevez. Wow! Gut ripping! Congratulations to all (always admired Martin Sheen) but particularly impressed by Emilio! Excellent work as an actor and director ... simply superb! So why did not I hear about this movie? I will have to spread the news.
