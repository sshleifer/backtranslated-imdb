SPOILERS AHEAD ------------------------- Mel understood. From the opening credits to the end credits, this film has a good laugh. Dave Chappel shows why he is a comic force. Cary Eewes wears the film most of the time, but the support cast fills up when the plot is far from Robin Hood. From the beginning, this film proclaims that it should not be taken seriously. If you take a time machine and give the characters thoughts of modern antics, you will get this movie. What makes this film special, do you say? Throughout the film, Blinken and Acuhu walk side by side, becoming great friends and companions of Robin Hood. But we never say to Blinken or he does not understand that he is black, until the crowd says "a black sheriff" replica Blinken "He is black". It's a timeless scene. One of the most interesting films of our time.
