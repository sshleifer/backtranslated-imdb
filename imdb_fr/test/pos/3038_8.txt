This film is a piece of the time in which it was shot ..... Realistic. The films were not covered with sweets in the late '60s and early' 70s. The producers did not try to create a happy ending that did not exist. The absence of a happy ending would create a stir in the audience that, hopefully, would motivate them to take action. At least that's what it seemed at the time. In the world of cinema today, this film probably would not be finished. There certainly would be no end, no matter how realistic. The sad reality is that the film described a situation that could not be improved without an increased action of improving the relationship between the traditional thinking of the South and the progressive movements of that time.
