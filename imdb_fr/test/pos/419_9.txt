Wherever I hear people say the show is wrong because its principle is too far-fetched ... well, maybe a taxi driver who feels good Philly pushes a little ( at least the taxi drivers I met) The series is great. <br /> <br /> The fact that this series is a little away from reality is a problem, but it's still nice and fun. It is very easy to watch and even if you know that Mike wins in the end, he never wins in life. David Morse is an excellent actor and does a great job in the title role. His support cast is excellent and I must say that the location of the series is particularly interesting! <br /> <br /> All in all, I watch this show not because I'm looking for a good dose of reality or a program that is rich in action. I'm watching this show because it has great acting, a good premise and a good story every week. It is also an advantage when I can choose the landmarks through which it passes, or know which intersection it is. I love this show and I love Philly !! Give this show a shot!
