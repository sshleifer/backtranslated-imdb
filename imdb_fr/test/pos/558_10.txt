A documentary to see absolutely. ----- This movie had so many things to consider while watching. It was an excellent documentary on the trial of a 15-year-old black child, Brenton Butler. He accused of killing a white tourist in Florida. It shows how the police collected the statements of the husband of the deceased wife describing the man who killed his wife. The husband seemed to want to change some things to merge with what the police said the young man wore. Police little to investigate the crime. Patrick McGuinness, Brenton's lawyer, strives to obtain information to help his client. He tells viewers what he thinks and the strategy he will use with the police to show his incomplete investigation and hitting his young client to make him confess. The camera goes with McGuinness to where Brenton was interrogated. McGuinness also takes pictures of the room and how the audio is controlled. He asks a police officer at the bar and asks what Brenton has heard from one of the investigators and is challenging their own words. McGuinness is investigating with Ann Finnell every place the police should have gone and what she should have done but did not do it. The film shows the Butlers as a loving Christian family who believes in the innocence of his son and believes that God will free Brenton. They visit him in prison and pray with him to encourage him. There are group prayer scenes for Brenton, the lawyers, the judge and everyone involved in this case. I am a white man and I was surprised to see how blacks in high police positions treated other blacks. It was very disappointing to see black and white policemen stay together when they thought they had their man. The police have a hard job and I think most of them are honorable, unlike those in this movie. I think it's an excellent film for all actors in the justice system, including judges, police, lawyers and even potential jurors, to watch this film and learn from it.
