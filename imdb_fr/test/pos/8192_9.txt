May contain Spoilers <br /> <br /> This historic movie has been so refreshing. Although this may exaggerate the real events, it shows the heartless nature of the Emperor Who, for whom he was later infamous. And there was not a single computer-generated person inside. I think it's great that China produces such an epic movie. The costumes and sets were beautiful, the performances also excellent. Dignity to Death is a major theme of this film and I think it reflects Chinese history and culture. I also appreciated a little hint of terracotta warriors, a 3D sculpted map of the conquest of China with individual soldiers. The Emperor Who, of course, will later be buried in his life-size terracotta warriors. <br /> <br /> I also enjoyed the scene with the dwarf, it was a very interesting character, even if he had only a small scene. <Br /> <br /> 9/10 <br /> <br />
