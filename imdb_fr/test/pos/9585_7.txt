'All Abir-r-r-d' by Friz Freleng is one of the best cartoons of Sylvester and Tweety. Unlike the many repetitive cartoons in the series that simply transplant the same tired gags into a new set, "All Abir-r-r-d" fully exploits its concept. Tweety and Sylvester are pets that are sent by train unattended throughout the country. With both a vigilant official and a vicious bulldog, Sylvester has some work to do. The Sylvestre and Tweety cartoons have always benefited from the presence of additional participants and "All Abir-r-r-d" is a good illustration of the help provided by these additional characters. Although these creations are not particularly memorable, they throw other obstacles on Sylvester's path and make it a more interesting battle. These two short courts, Sylvester and Tweety, have a lot of pressure on the right buttons, and although Tweety is often particularly irritating by his forced kindness, there are delightfully violent puffs between Sylvester and the dog, resulting in a surprisingly brutal paroxysm unfortunately ruined by a last non-quibbled by Tweety.
