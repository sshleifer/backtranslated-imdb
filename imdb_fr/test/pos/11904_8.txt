This film is the Latin godfather. An unlikely gangster bridges unlikely alliances and forms an empire. I enjoyed the action and the exchange of guns, as well as the agile and colorful characters. This film is not an Oscar, but it's really entertaining. Hey, who needs an Oscar anyway? <br /> <br /> Chapa has some balls to lead and play (I think he produced it too?) of this movie. It reminds me of another filmmaker who likes to do everything, Robert Rodrigez. Continue like this, is there a continuation in the works? There are a lot of chains that need to be linked. The son comes back and avenges the death of dads?
