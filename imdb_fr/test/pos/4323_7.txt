Woaww Is it only now that you notice the links between all the characters? Of course it's Libby! And for the guy in the trap with Desmond, everything already seen ??? Yeah !! He was the "same" guy who gave Sayid money after killing or torturing the other soldier in episode 14 of the 2nd season: One of Them. In fact, it's not quite the same guy he named Joe in the 14th episode and Kelvin in the last 2 episodes. Twins ?? :) Who knows ?? JJ Abrams ... mmmm, I'm not even sure :) There are hundreds of links like this one between all the characters. <br /> <br /> But it was just in response to Libby's comment. <Br/> <br /> I found these 2 episodes much more interesting than the whole season 2. Throughout this season, I had the impression that I missed a lot of things and very few things that I had learned. Especially at the very beginning, the first episode of the second season is excellent, then the second is a kind of backtracking of the first ... I found it disappointing even if I'm pretty sure that everything in Lost tends to make sense . It was just an example of the frustration I had with these episodes. <br /> <br /> Let's go back to the last two episodes. I think we learned more new things in these 2 episodes than during the whole season. But all we are learning are small pieces for the next puzzle, like the involvement of "parents" of Desmond (sorry, if I spoil too much, believe me or not, I try not to make). So, many things mentioned in the past 2 seasons are still unclear or have been developed once, then nothing. And again, there is new material as if all the holes in the photo were not enough. We all want to have an overview of all of this, of course, but I think we will have to be very patient. I hope there will only be 3 seasons. Anyway, I'm not sure to watch more than 3 seasons. There were also a lot of actions in the very last episode. And a good cliffhanger at the very end. <br /> <br /> Basically, yes, I loved this last episode ... and yes, I want to see the third season.
