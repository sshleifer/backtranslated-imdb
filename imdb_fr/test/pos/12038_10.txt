It's a hard-to-find film in the US, but if you can find it - and you're interested in Percy Aldridge Grainger's life and music, you'll be thrilled. It's quite accurate historically. Richard Roxborough's Grainger looks amazingly like Grainger at this time. Karen Holten Emily Woof is a little prettier than the real Karen, but it was an inaccuracy that I was happy to discover (!). But I think what struck me the most was Roxborough's ability to capture Grainger's outrageous personality. Barbara Hershey's Rose was also a treasure. If she looks much younger than Rose at this time, he is overwhelmed by the fact that she captured Rose's obsession with Percy. It is an easy film to recommend. (I should note that when she saw "Passion", my wife had no particular affinity for Grainger and her knowledge of music, but she was totally captivated by the film.
