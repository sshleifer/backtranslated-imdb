We went to the cinema hoping for a big budget and had an art-house movie. The film was digitally projected on about two-thirds of the screen, with the classic inclined contours of digital projection, and its stereo soundtrack is limited, which was a waste of time for the cinema. the same old historical content that we have all seen before, but heavily sanitized to prevent the public from getting sick. The live action scenes, which were few in number, were constantly reused in a classic documentary style, which became annoying after a while. the rest knew something we did not know. <br /> <br /> I guess the producers made the film to celebrate the ninetieth anniversary of Gallipoli. I have to wonder if they should have bothered. <br /> <br /> Seven out of ten for trying and out of respect for ANZAC.
