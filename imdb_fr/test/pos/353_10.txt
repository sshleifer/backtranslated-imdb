The Mario series is back and, in my opinion, better than ever. Galaxy is the most creative Mario to date. even more than super mario 64. the controls are excellent; Some of the best for the Wii. beautiful graphic design too. the levels are very big and the good old bosses are back. there is a lot to explore in this game; definitely a high level of replay value. I only have 2 complaints: 1: the story looks a little like Mario 64. and 2: the difficulty is not very great; although it requires a little patience. Mario fans: the game you've been waiting for. Casual players: this game is worth more than the purchase. 9.8 out of 10
