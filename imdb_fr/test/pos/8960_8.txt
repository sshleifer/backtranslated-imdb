Yes, this movie has a lot of gay characters. There are also heterosexual characters, characters who are unsure of their sexuality, people who are searching for truth about their existence. <br /> <br /> This is not a movie about sexual orientation. This is the loneliness and difficulty often encountered by human beings in making contacts. Film-making, Denys Arcand intelligently balances the different dimensions of relations and the contrasting and constantly evolving relationships. The serial killer item is a bit less successful (it looks more like a way to summarize various points of the plot and, unlike the rest of the movie, it is thematized). <br /> <br /> Thomas Gibson centers and directs the film; it is a silent performance but behind his beautiful and arrogant exterior, he slowly reveals a terrified soul who is afraid to show or accept the love of those around him. The actors are strong, especially Mia Kirshner, the friend of Gibson, a renting realm with precognitive powers. Its role is more of a metaphor than a literal pretext - strangely innocent and depraved at the same time, it represents the light and the darkness of the sexual consciousness of the characters. <br /> <br /> The film involves and surprises often in the development of his character. The effect is a bit like Robert Altman who directs a script by David Mamet - the dialogue does not fear some painful observations apart from a few artificial moments of the beginning. Often, in our search for love and a conventional "relationship," we ignore the love that already exists around us - our friends, our family, those who are able to see us as we are. Arcand and writer Brad Fraser make thoughtful observations about the different ways people try to escape and deny their loneliness and how this denial haunts us in many unexpected ways. <br /> <br /> This film is a rewarding experience. It may not be for the bigots who can not go beyond the sexual orientation of some characters to see the transcendental message of greater hope and redemption. Loneliness is a universal experience. A film like this, which dares to explore the dark side of our lives with an intelligent and insightful eye, deserves applause and an open approach.
