I must admit that thanks to this film, I'm afraid of models. hahaha. <br /> <br /> but yes, first of all, the role in this film, at least according to my criteria, is rather heated. most actors are pretty decent in their roles. the script also seems to be very good too, of course, some cheese stuff, but also well written characters and damn scary scenes. I still have shivers to think about this scene with the guy and the models. brrr. <br /> <br /> Yeah, I would say you should watch this movie, it's pretty good and very entertaining. a good watch. 8/10
