This film is mainly based on people's emotions and interactions. There are only three places (the school, the store and the coach's house) that are really used. It's mainly at the coach's, though. A movie does not need special effects or incredible views to be breathtaking. <br /> <br /> Four friends who had bonded during their basketball days met up. One is rich, important and has no real love apart from money. We want to be mayor again, but his competition is tormenting him. We want to be the principal of the school and take care of his family. One is an alcoholic on a trip. <br /> <br /> First of all, I love the actors of this film. They have all been names familiar to me. They proved their value here. <br /> <br /> One of the most important moments is when Tom, played by Gary Sinise, explodes in the coach. He screams and runs wild about how the coach cheated in the winning match. He whistles the trainer's whistle and returns his slogans: "Forgive me, father, for I have sinned!" It's amazing to watch, with an energy that cools you. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended for anyone who understands human emotion and does not need glittering effects to interest them.
