I must admit that I did not expect much from this film. I was surprised to appreciate him as much as me. The script was not Oscar material, but it was not horrible either. The game was great by Mark Wahlberg. Jennifer Aniston played an important supporting role and looked as good as ever. What made this film for me is music. If you do not like 80s glam metal or hair bands, then you probably will not like this movie. It's all about rockstar. Some shots were present, but did not lower the film at all. I would recommend it to anyone who loves rock and roll and who remember to get up and scream !!! 8 of 10 for fantastic acting and great music. <br /> <br /> Jason
