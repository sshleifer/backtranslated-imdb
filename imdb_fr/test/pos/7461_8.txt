Having found the place intriguing, read the reviews and being a fan of Angel, I watched this movie. It's sexy and original, and quite fun. David Boreanaz is Keith. He's a married man, stay home, dad, and he feels a little inadequate in his marriage. He makes the mistake of entering a narrow circle of teenage girls who are fascinated by the idea of ​​doing it with an older man. They will do everything to get into bed, including begging, lying and singing, but they mostly try to push their buttons. The resulting hazel makes Keith tremble and push friends to the brink. David Boreanaz shows some skin in this one-- and he looks hot. Yes, he plays a sordid cheater, but he shows enough vulnerability and tenderness towards clumsy teens to end up congratulating him. One last thing, when someone moans "oh yeah, oh..oh..OUAH !!", it's hard to see them as a rape victim.
