This animated short is a remake of one of Tex Avery's previous short films for Fred Quimby at M-G-M (Tired Dog). An escaped convict (here just known as Joe) who has just come out of "Alka Fizz Prison" is trying to stay one step ahead of Droopy (known here as Sgt.McPoodle of the Mounties) but still manages to cross it, in one way or another. It's easily one of the most casual and fun shorts that came out of the M-G-M animation studio. He manages to get the most laughs from the shocked reactions Joe encounters every time he meets McPoodle (including some equally disturbed sound effects - ie car horns, screams, elephants, etc.). ). As with any Avery M-G-M, expect frenetic kinetic stimulation (accompanied by surreal visual gags - that Joe tries to run away from McPoodle and actually run away from the movie). Pop this one in your DVD player and laugh stupidly.
