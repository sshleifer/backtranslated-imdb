Time does extraordinary things. He is the ultimate judge. Time has given Married To The Mob an extra dose of freshness. There are no dead moments or low blows. It's more a delight now than it ever was. Michelle Pfeiffer creates a mafia widow who is as far from a caricature as anything she has ever done. A true original creation touching or hinting at the stereotype just to guide us, but its Angela is quite unique. The legendary Dean Stockwell presents us with a mafia boss as real as threatening, but hilarious. And Matthew Modine? Why did I think at the time that he had no chemistry with Pfeiffer? I was wrong. They are wonderful together. They reminded me, this time, of Barbara Stanwyck, Fred MacMurray of "Remember The Night". I am writing this comment now to encourage you to visit or revisit this jewel of Jonathan Demme.
