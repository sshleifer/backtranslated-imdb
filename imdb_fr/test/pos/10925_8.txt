I just saw this movie and it made me cry. It's a beautiful drama about two brothers who fell in love, and I think it's a good idea, especially for those with a closed mind, to look at this one. I came to love the genre of short film after just seeing a couple, because they must impress you so quickly, and I must say that this one was definitely his mark. He was describing some things I had never really thought about, incest for one. <br /> <br /> I must admit that I did not worry too much about the end. Once, I would like to watch a film on the theme of homosexuals without wanting to kill me later. They almost always seem to end in a tragedy. It was 'cute' however, how they should be together, even if it was in death. <br /> <br /> I gave him eight stars and I recommend it to everyone too, because I think it gives a 'inside look' to the world, that this movie brings you in. <br /> > <br /> Thank you for listening, enjoy it.
