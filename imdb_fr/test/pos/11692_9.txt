Beauty in difficulty (Kráska v nesnázích) is not a big title. All the descriptions in this movie fail to capture what it really is ?? an adult fairy tale. A poor girl is courted by a prince. The "girl" Marcela, played by the beautiful Anna Geislerová, has the beauty of Isabelle Huppert, with red hair, a face and a seductive, sexual and fascinating silhouette to infinity. She has the louse of a husband, but they have a lot of sex. Children listen to love through the walls. It's tough and passionate, because the sex of the working class often seems to be portrayed in the film. But it is also up to us to recognize that it is the thing that binds them in an otherwise incompatible marriage. The husband, a professional car thief, is finally arrested and thrown in jail. We do not know how she got married, but she is not really a great class. But she is beautiful, intelligent (we assume) and loves her beautiful and resilient children. She deserves more. And she could have the life she deserves - eventually. (No spoiler!) She is forced to return with her mother after her husband has been sent to prison. Mom has a second hideous husband (read the ugly stepfather). It's a real horror show. He is considered an abuser towards children. He is obsessed with cleanliness, but fights badly at the table, while demanding manners and decorum from the children. He is really a poor socially disabled devil. Mom supports him, like Marcella's husband, at least he is strong - hideous but horny. The ambivalent, confused and layered characterizations are what makes the film so powerful and interesting. These characters have flaws, some seemed to be motivated by class, others by innate character. These flaws and character details are charming one minute and despicable the next. The public must really negotiate a conflicting sense of class, sexuality, ambition, commitment, and the role of a woman as mother and wife across the rapidly changing terrain of history. Basically, as in many films like the wonderful Icelandic film "Thicker Than Water (Blóðbönd)", children can be the victims. What is right in the end may be the best for children - who are our salvation and our future This is a theme that is being played today in movies ranging from the Pan maze to the kids of men, foreign cinema recognizes in complex moral stories that life is confusing, brutal, unjust and, as adults, we must act together to convey something worthwhile to the next generation. If we give in to our lowest instincts, we risk losing ourselves and the world. The extraordinary, complex and colorful characters of Kráska v nesnázích speak of the qualities of pushing a woman, what embodies the hope, what is the class - is it the economic status of the fabric of his character? The film is richly human, as embodied by the last two shots, which moved me incredibly and unexpectedly. So subtle and intelligent that comparing this to an American film seems unfair. Americans sometimes seem to lack the desire to consider that the paradoxes of human nature do not offer predefined solutions. But in this ostensible fairy tale for adults, there are interesting moral issues. Do not be fooled by the simple story; It's a good movie.
