A must see. <br /> <br /> Ten different directors each present a segment based on their favorite operatic aria. You do not have to be an opera fan to watch this movie. (Although, of course, if you hate opera, you're really going to have a bad time with it!) <br /> <br /> Unsurprisingly, the segments range from brilliant to just. Most of the problems seem to relate to Godard's contribution - whether you think he's bright or pretentious, his segment will not change your mind. <br /> <br /> Some of the pieces have a clear story; others are more like a montage of connected images. <br /> <br /> None of the pieces last more than 10 minutes; if you are not happy with the screen content, wait for the next segment and think about the culture you absorb. <br /> <br /> Keep an eye out for the performances of Buck Henry, Beverly D'Angelo, Elizabeth Hurley, Brigette Fonda, Tilda Swinton and John Hurt. (The Buck Henry segment alone is worth the price of entry). <br /> <br />
