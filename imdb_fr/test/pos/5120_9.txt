I watched this movie only because I did not want to leave my 9 years old and her friend at the theater themselves. Honestly, I went to expect a good nap, but I found myself fascinated by the movie. I would recommend it to anyone who asks for it! Roy's mother was in one of my favorite TV shows of all time a few years ago, playing a siren (Maximum Bob). She was really cute in this movie. The three main characters were all excellent young actors. I also enjoyed seeing and hearing Jimmy Buffet. The film itself was pretty good - featuring some of the aspects that make Florida such a big country. I'm glad I ended up going to this movie. And to say that I was disappointed not to be able to see them see "Stick It" - I think it was MUCH better!
