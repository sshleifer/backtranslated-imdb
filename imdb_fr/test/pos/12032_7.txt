Hollywood has turned the mafia into a production chain that ranges from banal to excellent, despite the quality of acting and a reasonable scenario (much of which is - for a change - true!), This effort to "home entertainment" must collapse slams in the middle. <br /> <br /> The script is not only obvious (all checklist boxes end up being checked), but spends a lot of time trying to create a pastiche of the best of others' work. The Godfather is the most obvious, but there are also other references. I will not bother to name them. Nevertheless, it is a borrower of good taste! The producer seems to set a quota of shots and murders (one at least every twenty minutes?) And the end is weak and "so what?" I'm told that there are different versions of this production, so maybe that's the version I've seen. <br /> <br /> Gangsters do not make money, they take money. Usually by fear. Some seem more interested in murder and chaos than making money. They were the first to leave (in real life and here). "You can not make money with a gun in your hand," said Luciano's Charlie Lucky at one point. One of the smartest gangsters, although everything is relative. He was a skilled white slave trader and a drug dealer before being sent home to Italy. <br /> <br /> The old school "mustache of Pete" was kidnapped by the new bloods that wanted power and money for themselves and to free themselves from the right jacket of Italian-Sicilian power (not rarely doing business outside of themselves). The young Turk knew that they had to join forces with other groups (especially the "Jews" who knew how to launder money), which is at least mentioned and acknowledged. What is less clear is that most immigrant groups had their own mafia - but most of them earned their money and became legitimate. And why not? Who wants to die in prison? <br /> <br /> Joseph Bonanno was a ruthless man, willing to kill if needed, but not an unjust or stupid man. His story was tragic to the extent that he could have made money in the earthly world and he showed a special ability to avoid being killed. With a little luck, of course. <br /> <br /> Despite the range of respectable names and the three main actors (Bruce Ramsay, Martin Landau and Tony Nardi), there is neither the charisma nor the talent to bring us and feel anything it would be. We are simply passive observers in a life we ​​are happy not to have to lead. The people presented here are born in a cruel world, but their only brand is to make it more cruel. <br /> <br /> If you can not get enough of the gangster type, it will be better than watching Godfather 1 & 2 for the tenth time and it's even better - as basic entertainment - than 'horrible firefight who was Godfather 3.
