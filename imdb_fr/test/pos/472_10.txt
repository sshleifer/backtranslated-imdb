I am a nightmare of filmmakers ... especially of the multiplex variety, the US dollar. Although not a student in this field, I still have a high threshold for suspending disbelief and including the filmmaker's vision, if I can find it. That's why a pearl such as "You're Alone" is such an exciting discovery. Intimacy and rhythm attracted me and never let me go. Jessica Bohl and Richard Brundage present thoughtful nuanced performances and director Gorman Bechard is discerning in presenting what is a naturally disturbing day in the lives of two seriously injured people. <br /> Spoiler under <br /> <br /> I bought the DVD version and shared it with several people. Reactions ranged from incredulity about Daphne's ability to carry out the task for which Buddy paid her to an inability to watch the entire movie because it was too real and emotionally devastating. As a compulsive and skeptical spectator, I must either be grabbed by the collars and dragged for the ride, or left to chance and seduced by the filmmaker. This film took the last path for me and in the end, I was so involved that I felt the horror and pain of Daphne because of his role in the death of Buddy. My reaction to this film reminded me to watch Peter Greenaway's "Cook, Thief, Wife, and Lover" many years ago. In the end, I was fascinated, repulsed and unable to take my eyes off this movie. I have watched this film many times now and I really appreciate the director's eye and ear. I know of other works he has made, including two unusual films, "Galactic Gigolo" and "Attack of the Killer Bimbos", as well as a diverse bag "The Kiss" which I recently learned he had was killed in the cradle by the producer. does not really represent the vision of the directors. Too bad, because I loved the two previous films and I even found "The Kiss" interesting but I wish that "The Kiss" is available in the editing of the director with all the vision and the original music. I look forward to the future work of this interesting director and directors, Jessica Bohl and Richard Brundage.
