Sweet young nurse Charlotte Beale (a lovely performance of lovely redhead KO Rosie Holotik) goes to work in an isolated rural asylum led by Dr. Geraldine S. Masters (the excellent Annabelle Weenick). Allyson King (the sumptuous Betty Chandler) is an aggressive, insatiable and aggressive nymphomaniac. Judge Oliver W. Cameron (a brilliant Gene Ross hammer), the veteran paranoid, Sergeant Jaffee (played by Hugh Feagin), kind giant Sam (the lovable William Bill McGhee) and old lady Hazel Ms. Callingham (the very irritating Rhea MacAdams). Dr. Masters dangerously encourages patients to embody their fantasies, which, of course, results in a series of brutal murders. Director F. Brownrigg, based on Tim Pope's astute and overexploited scenario, does expert work to create and maintain a stifling, dark atmosphere, bubbling madness and oppressive claustrophobia. Robert Farrar's phantasmagorical score, the filthy scenography, some appalling murders, Bruce B. Alcott's grunge cinematography, full of exquisitely robust and captivating histrionics that derive from an unnamed game (Ross, in particular, is a total eye and the conclusion of a truly shocking surprise blood bath add even more to the contagiously infectious enjoyment of this tracheal choice of the 1970s low-budget regional horror cinema.
