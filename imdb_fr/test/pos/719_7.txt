To summarize this film: good for television but too small for the theater. I liked watching this movie at home but I will not watch it a second time. The concept is good, but what ends in the film is only a summary. The end had a "nice" turn but remains unsatisfactory. It may have been the intention of the director, but it was not settled as it should be. But again, it's a kind of movie OK.
