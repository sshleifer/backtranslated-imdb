Nightbreed is certainly my favorite movie, I have already worn more than one cassette. The makeup is great, the story is beautiful. This takes a few different twists and is not as deep as the story on which it is based (Clive Barker's Cabal), but for a movie adaptation, it remains very faithful to the source material. The only problem with this movie was the producer's futile attempts to turn it into a teen movie, hence the end changed to allow sequels * to be rolled in the eyes. Apparently, one day, we will have a director's cup that will (hopefully) clarify this nonsense. Until then, I would suggest it to anyone who likes dark fantasy type horror rather than Freddy / Jason / Micheal type slashers. I really do not know what would be comparable ...
