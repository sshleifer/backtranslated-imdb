Hey, what do you expect from a movie with a very small budget!?!? Although I have not seen "Dahmer" (2002), I can say that, as a result of what the media has said about Jeff, it's a fairly accurate description. I studied the Jeffrey Dahmer affair and learned everything I could about this man. It's a low budget movie, but it shows the mentality of a serial killer. If you can go beyond the gore and see what the story behind a sick mind is. I loved this film! Get ready for a reduced budget and no blood. It is a story seen through the eyes of a murderer and his actions and thoughts of childhood through his arrest. My favorite phrase is: "If they had bothered to look in the back, it might have saved many lives" Enjoy!
