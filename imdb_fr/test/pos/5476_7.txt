What I saw from Wolfgang Petersen's films was pretty good. He knows how to direct action, create suspense and interest you. Eastwood tends to be great, sometimes excellent. This applies both to his acting and his staging. They both have a solid job here. The concept is not bad and the game of cat and mouse works well. Malkovich behaves rather well, and the game is played between Eastwood and him. I guess that will not introduce anything new, really ... but he never really claims, nor does he need to do it. These are two big players, each playing a fundamental role that they have proven at other times in their careers that they can cope remarkably well, and with a magnificent director at the helm. Really, it's entertaining, well done and just perfect. Editing and cinematography are good. Playing and writing characters is also. The film manages to be suspensive and intense, and if you allow it, you will probably be entertained and engaged, even if there are films of superior quality. The rhythm is almost perfect. I recommend it to all fans of the main actors, the director and / or this type of film. 7/10
