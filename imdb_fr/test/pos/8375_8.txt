It's a good movie taking place in Vienna about a taxi driver, Toni (Donald Buka), who steals the identity of a passenger when he is shot while sitting in the back seat. his taxi. This gives him an identity since he is an illegal immigrant, but he must play the role of the victim until he takes a flight to the United States with a ticket on behalf of the victim. Mrs. Manelli (Joan Camden) scolds her, but she is accused of mental disorder by her husband, Claude (Francis Lederer), concert pianist. As a result, Toni is off the hook. Claude does not want to separate from his wife, but she runs away. There are a lot of twists and finally, Toni and Mrs. Manelli are trying to get by - they are both trying to escape their lives in Vienna. The final is tense and exciting. Will they go away ..... ?? ... <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the image quality is not fantastic and a line is drawn in the middle of the image for a while. The actors are all very good in their roles, especially the portrait of Claude Lederer. Heinth (Manfred Inger), owner of the taxi company, Marie (Inge Konradi), girlfriend of the hometown and inspector (Hermann Erhardt), also play an important role in history. <br /> <br /> It's a good movie.
