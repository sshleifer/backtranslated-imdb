It's a good episode, but it's not my favorite. A lot of people like it and on a creative level, it's great. Most episodes have no dialogue, which is a great idea and "Hush" handles silence very well. Plus, this episode features Tara, whom I really like. But, I do not like Riely or the Initiative or Maggie Walsh and they seem to have a lot of time on the screen in "Hush". Also, I do not think the gentlemen are so scary and I get tired of watching sand yachting around Sunnydale. I know that I am a minority, but I tend to fast forward parts of "Hush". Of course, there are other parts of the episode that I find great, so if you watch on DVD, I recommend you to watch this episode. It's really a classic. <br /> <br /> "Hush" revolves around the fact that the whole city loses its voices. Demon men seeking skelatal, the Gentlemen, arrive to collect seven hearts of human victims, but if they hear a human cry, they die. So they steal the voices of everyone in town. Buffy and the Scoobies are trying to figure out what's going on, while the Initiative is also starting to investigate. Meanwhile, Xander realizes how much Anya matters to him and Willow meets another witch, Tara. Buffy and Riely are finally face to face fighting the Gentlemen. They are both stunned by what they learn ... He's a commando and he's the Slayer. In the end, Buffy saves the situation, but now she has to deal with her new knowledge of Riely's secret life. <br /> <br /> In reality, the creativity of "Hush" is not seen in broad outline. ground. It is the overwhelming silence of the episode that makes it so formidable. The characters try to communicate in different ways (white boards, pantomimes, obscene gestures, etc.) and everything works very well. After a while, you forget that there is no dialogue because they are so good at expressing themselves. During the "talking" parts of the episode, there are many references to the importance of really "getting along". Anya claims that Alex will not really talk to him. Giles ignores the protests of Spike and Xander and insists that Spike move into Xander's apartment. Buffy quickly substitutes the word "petroleum" for "patrol" when she talks to Riely for not having to explain her call. And in the end, when Buffy and Riely really learn the truth about each other, they sit without saying anything. It's really cool. <br /> <br /> This episode has a lot of good parts. I like people to forget that they can not talk. Buffy and Alex are both trying to use the phone. Riley can not use speech recognition in the elevator of the Initatives. People are trying to scream. That's basically what everyone would really do if they suddenly had no speech. And I think it's hilarious that Spike has to move in with Alex. (They will also share an apartment for a little while in Season Seven.) Alex and Spike have fun arguing with hilarious puerility. I also like the beginning of the relationship between Tara and Willow. Tara plays an important role for the rest of the series and she and Willow are pretty cute together. It's nice to see them just begin. <br /> <br /> However, I do not understand how the gentlemen choose their victims. They just seem to float around the dorms and pick random people. Also, I do not like Riely. I never liked it, but from "Hush", I almost wait for Angel to come back to town and bat. Finally, what happens to Olivia after that? It looks like we just met her, she and Giles have a romantic relationship, everything is fine ... and she suddenly fell. I do not understand. <br /> <br /> My favorite part of the episode: Giles "Who are the Gentlemen?" Scoobies conference. The whole scene is beautiful and his heads are just hilarious. He creates similar flashcards in "First Date" of Season Seven. Almost every time Giles draws monsters, it'll be fun.
