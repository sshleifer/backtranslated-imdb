Chucky (the deadly doll of "Child's Play" and 2 crappy suites) is dead. But his ex-girlfriend Tiffany (Jennifer Tilly) recovers his remains and (with "Voodoo for Dummies") revives him. Then, in circumstances too complicated to enter, HE is killed and her soul is put in another doll! Together, they fall in love and take a beautiful couple (Nick Stabile, Katherine Heigl) to take them to Chuck's coffin to get an amulet to make Chucky and Tiffany real people ... <br /> <br /> Much better than that sounds. After the last two suites of "Child's Play" (both horrible), I was expecting the worst, but it was actually a lot of fun. The movie does not take itself seriously for a second (seriously - how could it?) And the lines and situations are rather fun. In addition, some VERY bloody murders were committed to satisfy our horror fans and the film does not stop turning. The film also contains some things that are not usually found in a horror movie: a gay best friend (Gordon Michael Woolvett), intelligent and not laughing, and a sequence in which Stabile takes off his shirt only to show his muscular body. John Ritter also has a nice comrade as sheriff. <br /> <br /> The acting game is good - Stabile is young, VERY handsome and friendly; Heigl does not have much to do, but succeeds. Brad Dourif (Chucky's voice) and Tilly are hilarious like deadly dolls. My favorite part is when the dolls have sex (do not ask) and she asks for a rubber and he answers: "But I'm made of rubber!" The special effects are good (no ugly CGI here) and it's one of the few horror movies to mix humor and violence in an entertaining way. It's worth the detour. I give him a 9.
