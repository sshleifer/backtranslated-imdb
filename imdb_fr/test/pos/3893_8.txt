No wonder, but a good movie to see once or twice. Bill Macy shows that he can do more than just act; his writing was damn good. Excellent distribution, especially Jamie Cromwell, private interpreter of the extortionist. <br /> <br /> The biggest strength of the film lies in Macy's work, which reminds us of Jerry Lundergaard's role in Fargo. He has many scenes where he is extremely funny as a sticky, manipulative and deceptive character. It's nice to see him become a weasel and for a moment I was happy that everything was going well for him. *** out of four
