I also saw The Last Stop at the Moving Pictures Film Festival in Prince George. I must confess that the only reason I went to see him is that I'm a big fan of Callum Keith Rennie. And he did not let me down. He gave a good performance of a rather unpleasant character and presented the only comic relief of the whole film. <br /> <br /> The film itself is the usual scenario of the movie "A lot of bad guys trapped in a snowstorm," but there were a few twists that let me guess. The characterizations were strong and the whole distribution performed rather well. Rose McGowan was the only problem with the casting. She was so cold throughout the movie that we had no idea of ​​her character's personality or motives. Apart from her and a few small continuity problems, it was a well-written and well-played thriller.
