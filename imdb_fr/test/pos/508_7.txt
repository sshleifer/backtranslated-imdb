'Blade' would be an extremely superior comic book, a vampire hunter action / horror if there were not two minor flaws. # 1 I loved seeing the Invincible Blade / Snipe slicing and dicing, but all "Yes!" fist / punch was literally a disappointment. # 2 Bad, do not do that horrible, CGI ?? even for the 1998 standards. This is mainly in the last third, but some are scattered. Okay, despite these minor infractions, I really enjoyed this movie. All the actors did a suburban job and the fact that it now looks like another "Matrix" scam is hilarious considering that it came out a year ago. So maybe "The Matrix" copied "Blade". Be that as it may, it's a movie for many types of viewers: comic book geeks, action fanatics and horror and vampire lovers. So, we have Blade, half-man / half-vampire, or "day-walker" and his accomplishment, Whisler (at "Batman and Alfred") battling the undead who apparently far surpass the number of humans. Who knew? In a rare act of humanity (Blade is rather an antihero), our ninja / vamp sword rescues a newly infected blood specialist (as if by chance). Meanwhile, troubles get mixed up among vampires when you want (you guessed it) supreme power and need Blade to get it. This is not the most original concept, if you read what I just wrote, but it's still very nice. You will want to see Blade succeed, you will root in spite of his imperfections and manners. And you'll know what's coming next because it's the typical 1-2-3 act of an introductory cartoon movie. Look at it without trying to go too far. Such as Vampire SPF-1000 "solar lotion"? Really? What about the scalp? Would not it burn again? Just like the money they burn for weapons? Uh, all right, I'm going too far. Again, sit back and enjoy the techno-charged fun ride.
