Look, this film is obscure, brilliant, and a classic that should be sought by any means necessary. I suppose the powers that be have decided that he would always be relegated to the ranks of business. Nevertheless, we could only pray for the chance to see this one on DVD. I would say that it beats even the great Phatasm. If you like a dark movie, with lots of spooky pictures, look for this one and see how a horror movie from the 80's is supposed to be.
