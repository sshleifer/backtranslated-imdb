At the end of the cycle of horror movies Universal Monsters and before the golden age of science fiction movies, House of Dracula is more science fiction than horror and incorporates some of the most playful elements {read: nice} that would come to characterize the sci-fi movies of the coming era. Lon Chaney Jr. plays the werewolf and John Carradine, Dracula and Glenn Strange, Frankenstein's monster. <br /> <br /> A mad scientist begins to "heal" the two monsters of their "diseases" using modern techniques {read: crazy} science. When the scientist's beautiful assistant nurse turns out to be a hunchback at the beginning of the film, the viewer is alerted to the fact that this film will not be a typical Universal meal; this film foreshadows the kind of sordid exploitation that we take for granted for the science fiction of the 1950s. <br /> <br /> If the slower pace of older movies does not bother you, black and White will not throw you out, this movie is recommended to watch. In fact, it is not available on DVD at the moment, but it is broadcast occasionally by AMC, so watch it, otherwise you can always select it on your TiVo!
