Somewhere, somewhere, somewhere .. you GOTTA see this movie. Breathtaking antennas and incredible performances by extremely talented actors.You think that Cirque du Soleil is blowing your head, wait to see what these two women are doing - the most important, the path and the emotional struggles of Jane (Dreya Weber) are universal to many women. A beautifully crafted film that deals with the complexity of relationships and lasts until you are ready to give up. This masterpiece will affect both women and men. Ned Far (director / screenwriter) and Dreya Weber (star / producer) with ridiculous talent, had the courage to say it honestly and sincerely. This movie will hit hard - see it ALWAYS you can - or you will not be "aware" when it becomes one of the most talked about movies.
