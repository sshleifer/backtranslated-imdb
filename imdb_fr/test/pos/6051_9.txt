Having been navy, I can tell you that the D.I. is to this day a faithful representation of Marine Corp training camp and the transformation of boys into men. Jack Webb is excellent as Sgt.Jim Moore, a hard, but fair, drill instructor on the island of Paris, North Carolina. The film is centered on a rookie who does not seem to "understand the program". A newer movie, Full Metal Jacket, also shows life in basic training and is worth the detour.
