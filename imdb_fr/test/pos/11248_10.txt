Key to the VIP is one of the most entertaining, informative and hilarious shows on television. The idea is original and well executed, because it manages to preserve the aspect of reality, while remaining entertaining. All judges have a razor spirit. They are not the nicest of all time, but if you're looking for comfort, go watch a girls movie. Say what you like about the validity of the series, but it is absolutely real. I know people who participated in the series and they confirmed it. <br /> <br /> If you want to laugh, watch this show. It's one of the best comedy shows ever made.
