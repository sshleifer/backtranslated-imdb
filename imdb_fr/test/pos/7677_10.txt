I saw this film when I was very young. It's my favorite of all time. I was unable to get a copy until recently and his viewing reminded me of so many good memories. I loved Porgy's portrait by Sidney Poiter, his character with so much strength and courage. The part of Pearl Bailey, although small, was reminiscent of many members of our own family. My favorite songs were and still are "Bess You Is My Women", "Porgy, do not let me handle it" and of course "Summertime". According to the guidelines, if I interpret them correctly, I can not post where I got my copy, sorry. That's why I registered so I could share this information. Before signing up, the instructions are not published. <br /> <br /> Telephone numbers, email addresses, URLs. Availability, price or order / shipping information.
