'Identity?? . . . . I am part of my environment and I have separated from them and it is what makes it possible to clearly differentiate the identity of each one and all that has already happened to us "(Ntozake Shange, in Fires in the Mirror") <br /> <br /> Pieces such as Decalogue V were used to intimidate me, I felt that if I accepted them, I would compromise something, which I thought was not really worth entering I understand what naturalism is trying to say, I have experienced a tangible katharsis, and one that has fallen into existence on an ad hoc basis, and one that is still alive, with which I still have to rely. always in me. <br /> <br /> The film was not nice, in itself.It is not necessary to say that the death penalty is a bad thing.There are certainly bad guys; they die or not, it's for another film What Decalogue shows is that there are good and beautiful people who kill and other people when their society and their primal convictions push them. <br /> <br /> The "science" of naturalism is what helped me appreciate the Decalogue V. It's not worth leaving a writing space to explain why I would not leave myself before but I now see the value of doing art like that to "make" people, or maybe to make people feel something. <br /> <br /> There is a method for Lazar's compromise. . . light. Much of this meaning makes sense only retrospectively. This should not be too strange an idea: after all, how much respectable science does not make sense in retrospect. I grimace when I say it, but naturalism seems so much more productive and much less nihilistic when I have the power to tell myself: "this ruin, this process, this natural process makes me want to turn the system around". <br /> <br /> I do not think that naturalism paints an apocalyptic portrait of humanity by telling us to give up our powdered wigs and head towards the woods. Instead, I think it's the cataloging of evidence and experiences that we are, of course, free to ignore. We can ignore everything we want, if we want to give naturalists more corpses to bury. <br /> <br /> Of course, despite their specially designed aesthetic without any sympathy for the probable and catastrophic fate of their characters, they are passionate about readable inaction and snobbery writer. I see the risk charming in the hope that the public understands what to do with what he sees. As it has been mentioned, it is dangerous to see their destiny immortalized in stone. There is a danger in the hope of denigrating the Natural because it does not correspond to his vision of the world. <br /> <br /> And I do not think the "optimist" should be rich or lucky. I have not seen it, but it seems that the American Beauty film proves the inadequacy of the circumstances as a provider of vision or comfort. There are ascetics, wolverines and beggars who wonder where their humanity is, who lament because they find nothing that separates them from their landscape. <br /> <br /> The landscapes can be represented in a powerful and beautiful way, but in reality, the landscapes are not enacted. They change, of course, and dramatically, but only by a great set of natural laws over which no one really has the power. But that can not be changed on its own.
