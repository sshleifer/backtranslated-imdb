Joline (Heather Graham) leaves after her husband Carl (Luke Wilson) who has disappeared to empty his head of himself and their marriage. Joline, who is engaged in their marriage, begins her journey to find Carl, but along the way, she discovers a lot about herself. During her journey, she meets a multitude of interesting characters who unconsciously help her find her way. <br /> <br /> In my eyes, this is a classic road movie that is moving at a good pace (some viewers may find it so slow). Throughout the film, he keeps his humorous note while Joline reacts to the madness of the world around him with a warm smile, conscious and sometimes sad. All actresses and actors give wonderful performances and the score is impeccable. 9/10
