I remember watching this movie when it was released as a TV movie of the week in the early 1970s. <br /> <br /> Although I have not seen this movie for over 30 years, I remember how scary it was ... the corpse of the sister in the basement, the storm raging outside, the scary house without electricity and a killer still on the scene. <br /> <br /> They simply do not do movies like this one anymore. Elizabeth Montgomery was a very underrated actress and I loved her not only in "Betwitched", but in many of her post-Bewitched roles, such as this one and "The Legend of Lizzie Borden" (1975). <br /> <br /> I really want someone to come out with a DVD that has several of the 1970s TV movie of the week on a DVD. Would not it be great to watch "When Michael Calls," "Bad Ronald," "Do not be afraid of the dark," "Crowhaven Farm," etc., on one DVD? I know there is a market for a DVD like this for all of us, Baby Boomers, who grew up in the 1960s and 1970s. Maybe, if we're lucky, someday someone will we offer a DVD with a great selection of TV movies. movies like that.
