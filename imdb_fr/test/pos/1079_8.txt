I saw this at the London Film Festival last night, apparently the shortest version. The summary of James McNally on the content of the film is very good. Nossiter very skilfully associates his wine survey with broader concerns about globalization, homogenization, the effect of the media, the power of capital and the need for diversity. <br /> <br /> The film is shot by hand. DV outfit that some might find confusing, but that allow Nossiter to surprise people repeatedly, which would probably not have been possible with more conventional equipment. <br /> <br /> Despite the sprawling sensation of the film The editing is very accurate, giving us not only a parade of dogs of the world, but also a number of comments from people interviewed with somewhat contradictory visual images, and giving the others enough rope to hang themselves. To a certain extent, this evoked the recent work of Michael Moore (although Nossiter operates in a more subtle way), but the film's roots probably go back to Marcel Ophuls' "The Sorrow and the Pity", both in the way in which the film is built and in the emergence of "salt of the earth" French peasants as the stars. De Montille father and son were present at the screening of the LFF and answered questions later. Indeed, we all need a little mess - bravo Hubert! <br /> <br /> Overall, this great movie has implications that go far beyond the world of wine and allow us to build ourselves as people and organize our world.
