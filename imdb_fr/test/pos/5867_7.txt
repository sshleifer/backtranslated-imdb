When I was very young, my mom recorded a series of four Looney Tunes / Merrie Melodies short films and I watched them all over and over again. A Coy Decoy was one of those shorts and I was really shocked to read in another comment that it had been banned. When I was young, I probably did not even understand the Black Beauty gag. Still, that's probably why it's been banned, though, until I look at it on a video site, I do not even remember the gag. While watching the video, I remembered some shots, especially the shrinking of Daffy's hat and the eyes of Daffy who became watchmakers while the lure encircled him in The Lake. I was not bothered by the gag, which was probably why the gag was banned. Instead, I was inundated with childhood memories of watching this short film. Because of how much I loved this short child, I rate it 7 out of 10.
