Kirk and his team visit a mining colony of the federation on an isolated planet rich in mineral resources. The devil in the dark is the Horta, a very unusual, silicon-based life that crosses a solid rock. The Horta kills minors and, it is decided, must be destroyed. But how? <br /> <br /> It is difficult to pursue this criticism without writing a spoiler. So I simply focus on the technical aspects of the episode and discuss his themes. The special effects are acceptable, but most scenes of the Horta seem a little absurd. The acting is pretty average for TOS. Some of the miners are a bit clumsy. Nimoy has the toughest role of all in Devil in the Dark, and he's doing well. <br /> <br /> Why is it still one of my favorites? <br /> <br /> Devil in the dark is really a game of anthropological and ecological morality disguised as adventure. More than many episodes of this great television series, he stresses the importance of maintaining an open mind and at least a certain degree of empathy towards others. Moreover, this implies one of the most interesting, or even probable, twists in the initial series. <br /> <br /> Enjoy!
