A very strange, psychedelic, esoteric experience (and I said a weird experience? :). <br /> <br /> But at least on one level - she did exactly what she was supposed to do. He bridged the gap between the Hollywood idiot and Hollywood idol of teen pop idols, which was the Monkees television show, and that of the grown-up and musically evolving adult, which was still a bit ridiculous. Monkees from the 70s and beyond. <br /> <The most important line of the movie is Mike Nesmith's: "If they think we're plastic, wait until they see how we do it." That the Monkees are tired of all the negative comments about their image and their work is a matter of record. They repeated it over and over again during interviews. They needed to remake themselves and what better way to do it and have fun hilariously with the machine that created them. And at the same time, they commented on our whole society (news, movies, art, everything) and said, "Hey, why are we attacking us, is not all that made at one time or another? " These are the Orwellian "proles" (the Monkees represented the persecuted "men of all times", even the most idiots of the TV series). ideas, liked music, liked the effects, loved the movie! But then, as Peter Tork says in the movie, "But then, why should I talk, since I do not know anything?" :)
