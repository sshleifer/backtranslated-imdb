A brutally simple story of murder and capital punishment by the state. If painfully slow and precise in the description of capital punishment (from the preparation of the owl to the victim who is pissed in his own pants before dying), she has the power to change her mind about the death penalty. The set of Dekalog comes from this story: Dekalog's screenwriter was the helpless advocate who tried unsuccessfully to defend and then comfort the defendant.
