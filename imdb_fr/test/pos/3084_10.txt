Cary Elwes has to say he's performing better than Costner in RHPOT, but anyway. <br /> <br /> I must say that this film makes me laugh so much, mainly because the actors just sit there and think "but what are they putting on", but in a very, very, very good way. so in their roles <br /> <br /> 10/10 of me with challenge <br /> <br /> "Because unlike some other Robin Hood I can speak with an English accent"
