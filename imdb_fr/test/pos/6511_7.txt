If you like silly comedies like Airplane, you'll love this movie! It's really in the style of the airplane and Scary Movie. A funny movie! It has the strangest character cast in the same movie. Michael Jackson, Evan Marriott, Joyce Giraurd, Stuart Pankin, Charlie Schlater and Eric Roberts. The special effects are hokey, but I think they are supposed to be because it's silly comedy. There are apparently two versions of the movie, one on Blockbuster and one on the official website: MissCastaway.com. The one on the website seems to be a preliminary version signed by the director. There's also some fun stuff behind the scenes filmed at Neverland with Michael Jackson. The film was shot in 2003 and says that PG is fun on the box.
