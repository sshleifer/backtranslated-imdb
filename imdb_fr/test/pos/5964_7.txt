Frogs who wanted a king or a frog are the most cautious stories of Ladislaw Starewicz about people wanting the government to solve their problems, which I have never seen. The irony is that they pray to the god Jupiter for their answers. Jupiter responds first by sending a stump and then a stork. Neither works and the stork is particularly dangerous for amphibious creatures! Frogs have human qualities when we see them dress in the latest fashion of the day and we see them take pictures or use a camera when the stork arrives! As I said, this short film is a political allegory more appropriate for adults than for children. In fact, I first saw this on the Rhino VHS that had Bambi Meets Godzilla. That alone should tell you what to expect here!
