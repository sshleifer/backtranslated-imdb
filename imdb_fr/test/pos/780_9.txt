I can not help but disagree with a previous comment that "Driving Lessons" is more than a little twice, but one man's indictment is the support of another, I suppose. In my book, this film succeeds in pure charm, which is not a trivial matter in itself. <br /> <br /> I can not help but wish the story is a little less classic In the end, the plot seems anyway as a background for the interactions between the characters. Evie Dame of Julie Walters is a glorious actress above and above the hill. Even though Evie has not had a stable job for years, we still do not know if she visited reality for the last time (think of Edina from "AbFab" at age 65, at one point she is even constrained to control his kitsch factor). Some may find it annoying, but I think it's the purpose of pointing out how much it pushes Ben's reserved buttons (Rupert Grint) to force him out of his shell. Ben is also isolated from reality, living all his life under the thumb of his overly dependent mother, whom Laura Linney manages to breathe a little life, even though he is a fairly one-dimensional character (your old religious mother dominant). I am rather impressed by Rupert Grint who, in my opinion, gives a very honest and credible performance (not to mention the sweetness of all), I can not think of many teen actors to whom I can say that. <Br/> <br /> The heart of the film is what happens when the worlds of Ben and Evie meet. At first, Ben is naturally shy, but also intrigued, because Evie is essentially the opposite of everything he has known. With the combination of Evie's persistence and Ben's helpful nature, real sweetness is created between them, resulting in an improbable journey on the road that gives Ben his first true taste of independence. <br /> <br /> The tone is always light, even after a few short melodramatic passages, but there was always a surprising amount of emotional resonance, a credit for the main actors. All in all, I would say that if you're ready to sit and be charmed by great performances, "Driving Lessons" should not disappoint you. However, if "cute" is not part of your cinematographic vocabulary, it is better to stay away. <br /> <br /> Another minor comment, the soundtrack highlights the music of Sufjan Stevens, a nice touch.
