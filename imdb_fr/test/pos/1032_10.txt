President Harry S. Truman once said that the only thing new in the world is a story you do not know. <br /> <br /> Seven years before the great film "The Making of the Atomic Bomb" by Richard Rhodes ", the BBC produced a seven-episode mini-series," Oppenheimer ", which consisted of a study of character of the people who designed and manufactured the weapon that ushered in the atomic era, permanently linking science and technology to the state (and especially military), not just making history, but changing the world to always. <br /> <br /> The production is impeccable, the casting is nothing short of miraculous, not only the main characters, but even the secondary characters have strange resemblances to the people represented.In particular, Sam Waterston plays the title role of the American physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer, scientific director of the Manhattan project, based in the Los Alamos, New Mexico laboratory (the site he personally chose), Manning Redwood as general R. Groves, who oversaw the entire Manhattan Engineering District (the official name of the project); David Suchet, physicist and ultimate enemy of Oppenheimer, Edward Teller (who, almost forty years later, whispered in Ronald Reagan's ear and brought us the Strategic Defense Initiative - "Star Wars") and Jana Sheldon under the name of Kitty Oppenheimer. The attention to detail is always excellent. <br /> <br /> Both thriller, half love story - and ultimately a tragedy, this series faithfully recreates a chapter in world history - and science - that we dare to forget. Highest recommendation. <br /> <br /> (NOTE: viewers who enjoy this series will also enjoy Jacob Bronowski's 13-part series, "The Ascent of Man", as well as Michael Frayn's television series "Copenhagen", presented to the BBC.)
