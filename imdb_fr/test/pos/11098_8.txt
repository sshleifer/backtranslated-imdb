The Falcon and the Snowman is the true story of two college-educated LA children who became spies for the Soviet Union. One, played by Penn, is already a drug dealer at the height of his eyes. The other, interpreted by Hutton, lands a job in an aerospace company where his job is to manage a highly secret cable installation. There, he learns that some dirty stuff used by the CIA vis-Ã -vis foreigners do not please America. Remember that the film takes place in the early 70's, at the time of Vietnam and Watergate. Dismayed by what he learned, Hutton's character decides to betray his country and convinces his friend to join him. Neither is long on the brain, it does not take long for them to feel unprepared. <br /> <br /> This is not a thriller, but rather slowly. If this is not a problem for you, then the rental is worth it.
