I would have liked to be exposed for the first time in a movie theater during its first release, like some commentators. It's really a treasure. To be fair, I have not seen another version of Goodbye, Mr. Chips and I do not want it either. For me, this is a perfect version. I saw it for the first time years ago on TCM and I have never forgotten it. Yesterday, I had the pleasure of watching it with my girlfriend, even though I had recorded it on TCM a few days ago. There were portions of the film in which we both had tears in our eyes, it's really a moving film. <br /> <br /> And should not that be what movies are? <br /> <br /> The music is beautiful, the film was shot wonderfully. The acting game is top. And the story is delicate and timeless. <br /> <br /> One of my favorite movies of all time.
