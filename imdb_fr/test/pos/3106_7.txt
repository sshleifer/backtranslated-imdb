By going to a country house, they hear a new play, a theatrical producer, his secretary and the playwright find themselves stuck in the mud. They go to a neighboring house, to finish with the playwright's fianc√©. If you can not guess that murder and chaos are about to happen, then you are not paying attention. <br /> <br /> It's a good entry into the dark house genre. Not only is there a good mystery, but you also have very funny liners that wander around. The distribution is excellent and they are more than willing to have a good time with what is a good material. <br /> <br /> I would like to say that this is one of the best of its kind. should have been, but for me something happened on the way that made me drop the note to only seven out of ten. I can not tell you what it is, not for sure anyway. Maybe it's the feeling that I knew where he was going almost from the beginning, or maybe something else, I do not know what, but there was something that I could not shake that would was like this film despite the desire to love it. It just failed to be great and somehow fell short. <br /> <br /> That said, I suggest you see it. After all, it's a very spiritual film, which is fully entertaining, even if it's missing a lot.
