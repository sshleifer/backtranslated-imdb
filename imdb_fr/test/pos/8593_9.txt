To answer the question of a previous critic who asked for the name of the US official mentioned in "Lumumba", the name of the character is "Mr. Carlucci". Frank Carlucci would have been at that time second secretary of the American Embassy in Congo. Later, he was appointed US Ambassador to Portugal, Deputy Director of the CIA, Secretary of Defense and Chairman of the Carlyle Group. It is not surprising that Carlucci's biography on his website www.carlylegroup.com does not credit his services to the Belgian Congo. If his name was deliberately censored in the HBO version of "Lumumba", it may be to avoid the possibility that HBO will be prosecuted in US courts. The name of Carlucci, however, is clearly mentioned in the theatrical version of "Lumumba" that I saw recently. In this case, I expect him to deny any involvement in the murder of Lumumba. <br /> <br /> Other people commented on the impartiality with which the film "Lumumba" treats the parties involved: supporters of Lumumba, other Congolese, even Belgians. I think that the BBC documentary "Who Killed Lumumba?", From the book "The Murder of Lumumba" by the Belgian historian Ludo de Witte, gives a slightly more sinister idea. When closely examined, these films show that Lumumba's fate and the history of the Congo are not just black and white. Only the murderers of Lumumba believe it.
