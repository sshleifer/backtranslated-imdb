If you like your movies get your emotions from you, if you like your movies with a guy you can rely on and tell you, if you like your movies in black and white, you have to see this movie! Look at it from beginning to end, because you do not want to miss a beat. It's sometimes slow and you wonder when something will happen, and then when the plot begins to unfold, you'll be at the edge of your seat! I know I was! My mother told me about this movie because our family had the same things as the movie. We loved Frankie, who plays the leading role convincingly. Whatever you think of Frank Sinatra, put that aside, in the movie he's skinny and he does not sing, so keep an open mind. For the time when it was made, it tells a story that is still told today in homes all over the country, and perhaps even around the world. Please watch, if you like older movies, try this one.
