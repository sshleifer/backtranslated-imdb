true love. true love. crazy Love. beautiful love. ugly love. dirty love. sad love. happy love. silly love. intelligent love. beautiful love. mute love. love Love love. Minnie Moore understands that what she really needs is a man who trusts him, who loves him and who loves him madly. Of course, when this man arrives ... she tries to escape but seymour, marvelous seymour, he trusts her, he believes in her and will fight for her against her. I want to be like Seymour Moskowitz. I want to be that kind of man. a man willing to love without fear of failing but willing to fail. it's a kind of hero. it's my kind of hero ... and Minnie Moore is my kind of woman. Long live the cassavetes and all his beautiful group!
