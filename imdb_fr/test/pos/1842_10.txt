An impressive movie! Beautiful combination of talents! I am a huge fan of David Duchovny and he is remarkable in this movie! I would like to see him in more movies of this nature. His talents are clearly underused and so much more to offer apart from "Agent Mulder" (although I'm also a big fan of this series). He is easily the Cary Grant of our generation. If you have not seen this movie, you MUST! Beautiful love story that shows that love never dies ... it's forever with you. Minnie Driver is great and how can you go wrong with a casting MM. O'Connor, Loggia and Belushi? This film received no reward, but it deserved one. Good job Bonnie Hunt! ** By the way ... the soundtrack is excellent too! **
