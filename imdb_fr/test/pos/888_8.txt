Well, SWORD IN THE MOON finally got a DVD in Korea, and despite the generally negative answers I heard, and the DVD with a suspicious delay, I could not help but take it - any Movie wu xia is better in my eyes: D Maybe low expectations were a plus, as I was pleasantly surprised to find the movie very enjoyable. <br /> <br /> An assassin kills a number of ministers who have involved in a revolution that has usurped the throne, and the government's biggest swordsman is responsible for identifying the culprit. It does not take much time, but the answer is not the one he wanted to hear. Through prolonged backtracking, we learn why and the story of the swordsman, the assassin and the revolution. <br /> <br /> The movie is typically melodramatic for a Korean movie and resolutely serious - no hk-style comedy moments to be found here. The story may be a little hard to follow at first, but everything makes sense eventually. In the end, the film is a little wobbly, but nothing worse than a movie from Chang Cheh, and I found the film enjoyable. Production values ​​are high, with good cinematography to capture it. Combat scenes are not up to the best HK wu xia movies, but maybe they are not supposed to be - the fights are more "realistic" in that they look less like choreographed dance, but there is wire and casual CGI that put the film in "wu xia" mode. Unfortunately, the film does not have the best distribution, the main roles being a little lacking in charm and sometimes difficult to distinguish from each other. There's a young woman in the movie that I do not think I've seen before, but that gives the best impression of one of the main actors - not just because you see it, nekkid ... or maybe it's this case: p The film lacks the charm and grace of the best movies of HK wu xia, and maybe also beauty, but I only wish HK to return half of them - TWINS EFFECT 2 does not let me not hope that * it * will happen soon, although Tsui Hark surely still has it in him if he can get funding and casting. SWORD IN THE MOON will definitely not be on my favorite wu xia list, but it's better than ROMANTIC WARRIORS or LEGEND OF THE EVIL LAKE - maybe better than BICHUNMOO too, although I liked this movie a little bit more during a second visit. Obviously, he is not near the wonderful MUSA, but it is quite another thing. SITM will probably have a second visit in the next three years, which is perhaps the best indicator of how much I liked it :) 7/10
