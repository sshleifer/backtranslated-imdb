I totally agree with the other poster. NEMESIS is one of Christie's best adaptations with superlative plot and casting. <br /> <br /> The scene featuring Liz Fraser as the mother of the murder victim is a study of the game at the highest level. This underrated woman was a favorite of British films from the 1960s and had never had a break in American films. Discover her as a friend of Julie Andrews in The AMERICANIZATION OF EMILY of 1964. <br /> <br /> All artists of this prod have a chance to shine with and without a muse, Ms. Hickson, who has never been named for an Emmy for his work Marple. Shame on them! And dig the lesbian CID agents! :)
