Howard (Kevin Kline) teaches English in high school in a small town in Indiana. He finally marries Emily (Joan Cusack), much to the delight of her parents. The city is also in turmoil, as one of its members, Cameron (Matt Dillon), has been nominated for an Oscar. Everyone, including Howard and Emily, are watching the Oscars on television while Cameron is declared the winner! In his thank you speech, Cameron announces that he has been able to play his role as a homosexual soldier, thanks in part to the lessons he learned from a homosexual teacher he had attended in high school. You guessed it, it's Howard! But Howard is never "out"; in fact, he thinks he's straight! With all the city and the media waiting and watching what happens, will Howard and Emily get married? Or is Howard really gay and realizes he can not participate in the ceremony? It's a wonderful, funny and human movie about a gay man and his situation. As a man-who-did not realize-he-was-gay, Kline is excellent and touching. The rest of the cast is just as good, with Cusack a point as the mixed fiance and Dillon, Bob Newhart, Debbie Reynolds, Tom Selleck and others to delight the audience. The costumes are very beautiful and the setting in the lovely heart of Indiana is beautiful. Then the script, the production and the production are really very good. But the insightful, humorous and thoughtful look at the gay population is undoubtedly the best asset of the film. For those who would be offended by a movie on the subject of gays, yes, just skip this one. But for all those who want to laugh heartily and understand at the same time the situation of homosexuals, it is certainly the best movie ever.
