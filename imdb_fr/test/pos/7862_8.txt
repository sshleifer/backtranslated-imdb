It took me years to catch that jewel of a movie and it was worth the wait. In almost all his films, Clint still plays the hero. Be it a hero, an anti-hero or an avenging hero. In this film, he is pure villain and he plays it well. <br /> <br /> As a wounded union soldier, he is taken to a Confederate school for girls by students and teachers. Shortly after, he begins to seduce ladies, regardless of their age, and some are quite young. He also plays on their jealousies and opposes them to each other. In the end, you're never so happy to see Clint die of a terrible death. <br /> <br /> That's what makes this film a jewel. Clint has never made any film like this and after watching this movie, you'd like to have it. He plays the role of the villain so well that you will wonder why he has not made movies like this anymore. This also explains why the movie is not seen very often. Most people do not want to see Clint as the villain and Dirty Harry being released shortly after this movie, he has become a hidden gem. If you are a fan of Clint Eastwood, you owe it to yourself to watch this movie. You may not like what you see but you will not forget it soon.
