With In the Army !, this movie is one of Pauly Shore's best films, if any. Although the West Coast vs Midwest confrontation is not new, this film makes the story more entertaining with the wild and unpredictable antics of a new shore. While the change in values ​​would probably have been in the opposite direction, the concept as a whole was rather amusing. Shore's interaction with the family was not only hilarious, but Carla Gugino and Tiffani-Amber Theissen (she will always have Amber in my book) in two lovely and early roles. One of those movies that I have no problem watching when he's on TV.
