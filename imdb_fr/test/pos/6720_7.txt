Like many other critics here, I'm surprised to see many negative reviews on this movie. Dan O'Bannon's previous efforts were "Alien," a revolutionary innovation, in 1979. Because she, along with Star Wars, introduced the stylistic approach of "Used" or "Dirty Space" into the artistic direction for This type of It was the only way to produce them. <br /> <br /> Rather than rejecting "Lifeforce" as a kind of primitive exploitation and schlock, it is important to recognize that the film is based on the "esteemed" traditions of horror and science fiction British - especially Hammer and American International, such as Quatermass (specifically "Quatermass and the Pit", 1967), Doctor Who and "The Day of the Triffids" (1963), otherwise the works of Gerry Anderson ('UFO', ' Space: 1999 'and' Thunderbirds'). But none of these influences would be a surprise if other critics recognized O'Bannon's appreciation of the scientific genre for "Queen of Blood" (1966) and "It! The Terror from Beyond Space (1958) - The Immediate Sources for 'Alien' (1979). <br /> <br /> Of course, this film contains elements "inherited", but it is perhaps interesting to compare this film to its most immediate. Peers - "A American Werewolf in London" from 1981 and "The Company of Wolves" (1984) - other films of the 80s sharing the same "retrospective" while adapting these stories to the zeitgeist of the 80s. The films were based on previous incarnations of the same film, but their themes were essentially gendered (because they could do so) and, at the same time, they recognized the irony of their projects. <br /> <The "Wolves" of Neil Jordan played for many psychoanalytic memes floating in the 80s, while "American Werewolf" made them the theme as a film of "transition to adulthood" . This is called an artistic license, and the adaptations of these three films are no less valid than the comedy drama of the last days inherent in the franchise "Scream", "I know what you did in the summer last "and" Final Destination ". But these teen movies seem to be part of box office trends, while 80s movies like "Lifeforce" belong to the canon of British science fiction - even though it was written by an American. <br /> In many ways, this film stands up much better than the recent films on disasters and alien invasions ('Independence Day', 'Armageddon', 'Deep Impact') in that 'solutions' do not reside in firearms. battles, payloads and testosterone. The opposite of the pole, it is regrettable that Steven Soderbergh and James Cameron have not examined Tarkowski and Lem more closely before redoing 'Solaris' ... <br /> <br /> The purpose of this film was fun, not heavy nor stupid. <br /> <br /> 7/10
