At first, I did not like their way the director was constantly changing from past (gulliver trips) to the present (gulliver in the lunatic asylum). But it's really the best way to film the story even if you have to get used to it. Danson is remarkable because the main character and Edward Fox make a wonderful villain. The worst part is Mary Steenburgen as Gulliver's wife. She has never been gorgeous in Hollywood and in this movie, she makes her seem downright tired for some reason. I will never understand why the directors make an ugly woman when it adds nothing to the story! Besides, you want to strangle him for being so stupid in believing that lying is a nasty lie that Bates keeps telling him. Even his son can see through the bastard. Another good show and I note B +.
