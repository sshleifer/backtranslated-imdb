These two main characters Erkan and Stefan are an act of Munich comedy. I was wondering if this was one of those typical slapstick movies where the story is not important or just not there. But when I saw this film, I was very happy that there was a nice story and that the main characters were perfectly adapted to it. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's a lot of fun and it's not a common German movie.
