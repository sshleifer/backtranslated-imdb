I have seen a lot of Shahrukh's films and it's a very good role for him. He has such versatility, but he remains mainly in positive roles. As Rahul, he is very dark and disturbing, but I found myself understanding a lot of the movie. If it's nothing else, watch this movie for Shahrukh. He plays a very complex and real character in a very convincing way. The story is very typical and has already been done before, but the development of the character is very strong and fun. The opening is a bit confusing, but in the end, it does not matter. The songs that I found very nice give a glimpse of what the characters think. Very clever. I think this movie was very good and recommend it to all fans of Shahrukh Khan. It is to see absolutely!
