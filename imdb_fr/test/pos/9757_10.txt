I do not know where this film was shot, but since it was shot on location, it has the authenticity that this story deserves. This is the story of a young English woman who was taken prisoner by the Japanese in South Asia at the beginning of the Second World War, along with a group of other English women. There is no women's prison camp, so they have to walk for months, from one place to another, because the Japanese do not know what to do with it. The courage and resilience of the English women, as well as the courage of the Australian soldier who tries to help them, are at the heart of the film. This film is very long, maybe 10 hours. So you can watch it as it was shown on PBS, as a series, which adds to the feeling of the endless journey that this woman makes from England, across this remote island and finally to Australia. . History, cinematography, location and actors combine to make this film an event not to be missed. My only question is why this was not published on DVD!
