Some critics have compared Chop Shop to theatrical versions of City of God and Pixote. I have seen these two films as well as Chop Shop and, as in many cases, I do not think the comparison is justified. City of God and Pixote surely had a much higher budget. Chop Shop is an independent, low-budget film about survival and hope, disappointment and the pursuit of life. One of the scenes would have been filmed during the US Open and either the directors had incredible relationships, the scene was filmed at another time and US images were added. I say that because I live in the area where this film was shot and security is crazy during tennis games. It is also interesting to note that the actual names of the actors were the names of their characters in the movie. Back to the movie It's a nice story about survival. However, he ended up getting a 7 because ... sometimes the actors did extremely well. At other times, they seemed to be just reciting their lines. If the actors were less competent (as in the small budget "The Big Dis" for example), I would have been more forgiving. But in several scenes, each of these actors gave exemplary performances. At other times, they seemed bored. The manager could be at fault here. I also had problems with the end. This is one of those movies that "just ends". Maybe there will be a part 2? It's really worth it to be on DVD. I will not bother to summarize the story because this information is already available on IMDb.
