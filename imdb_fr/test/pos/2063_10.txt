It is a film that does not reflect in any way the real world. Nothing in this film has real meaning or real logic. It operates entirely in its own small world and your ability to accept it or not will determine your love or hatred for this film. <br /> <br /> I like the movie. <br /> <br /> Somewhere in the Au at the very beginning, I immersed myself in the completely unreal principle of the woman who has found her memory while the past comes back to haunt her. There was a moment in the beginning when I remember accepting the fact that this is one of those movies where the heroine knows nothing until it's necessary, despite all the logic that it would not happen not so. "Oh, it's one of those movies," I said to myself and became addicted when the movie took off for a frenzied two-hour pursuit. <br /> <br /> This is an action movie with brains and power as things follow logical and you have to be careful to follow some of the twists and turns. I like that a lot and I am pleasantly surprised when I meet people who feel the same way. People like it or hate it, if they've ever heard of it. <br /> <br /> If you like action movies, this is a film you absolutely must try. You may not like it, but it's certainly worth discovering. <br /> <br /> And as always, leave reality at the door.
