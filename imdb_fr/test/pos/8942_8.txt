Wales seems to have recently shot weird movies. In fact, Wales seems to be developing its own small film industry. I recently saw Very Annie Mary, which I thought was very good. But the plot with a view is not only unusual, it's funny funny, has a cast of wonderfully talented actors (Brenda Blethyn is incredible), and a plot that, although not quite original, is so intelligently written which could be almost disposable lines. It was the kind of movie I wanted to see as soon as it was over, and one of the few that I would really like to own. Although many characters are caricatures and you have to go to a Welsh village to enjoy it, they are also very human and the relationship between Blethyn and Molina is a joy to contemplate.
