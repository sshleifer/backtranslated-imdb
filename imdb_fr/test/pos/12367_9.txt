In a dark, dark New Year's night, a sick nurse, her life fainting slowly, demands that David Holm be immediately introduced to her. We do not know who David Holm is or why this nurse wants to see him, but his last wish is to talk to him again. On the other side of the city, comfortably nestled among the tombstones of the local cemetery, Holm (Victor Sjöström, who also directed) and two of his drunken associates are happily waiting for the New Year. "Here we can say at the right time to drink the New Year, "exclaims Holm, raising a finger to the big clock tower looming in the darkness. He does not know, however, that he will not be alive to greet him. <br /> <br /> To pass the time, Holm happily recites a ghost story. He had already had a friend named George, "a merry boy" who was "smarter than us all". Several years ago, a New Year's Eve night, George ended a potentially disastrous fight, fearing that the last man to have his last breath before midnight would be sentenced to drive the ghost tank for the next year, obeying the orders of Death and gathering souls. of the deceased. "And, gentlemen, George died on New Year's Eve!" happily concludes Holm, not bothering to contain his mocking skepticism about man's beliefs. <br /> <br /> As fate tells him, of course, a violent, unexpected encounter results in Holm's death on the stroke of midnight. While the transparent mind of man is delicately rising from his earthly body, he is witness, to his horror, of the distant approach of a ghost car. The driver, a frail, masked figure - a sickle clutched in his hand - gets out of the car and approaches. We are surprised to discover that the driver is none other than a decrepit George, who is preparing to pass on his terrible duty to this year's successor. <br /> <br /> Given the time at which "Körkarlen" is made, the special effects in this film are absolutely superb. Director of Photography Julius Jaenzon used double exposure photography to create the sinister, ghostly silhouette of the car and its accursed driver. Even today, the end result is very effective. A particularly impressive scene involves the ghost tank going to the bottom of the ocean to recover the soul of a drowned man. Another scene, strangely reminiscent of Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) in Stanley Kubrick's "The Shining," shows Holm demolishing the kitchen door with an ax to reach his wife and children on the run. <br /> <br /> Truly disturbing. Victor Sjöström's "Körkarlen", which is disturbing in its execution, is a fine work of cinema, successfully portraying Holm's constant alcoholic decline, his inevitable day of judgment, and an ultimate possibility of redemption.
