Sensational. I saw this movie and "Up" the same day within an hour of each other in different theaters. I first saw "Mr Bug", then I was totally disappointed with the "Up" tracking. What a beautiful and touching film! The films of the 30s and 40s can today annoy us with their melodramatic play and their dialogue, but as an animation, the same melodrama and the same humor can be wonderful. And the soft "organic" lines of the design of the 30's AND the music simply put you in a good comfortable atmosphere and you can enjoy the show with all its little characters: ladybugs, grasshoppers, bees, snails, bugs, flies, mosquitoes, beetles , crickets, and more, each with its own cute (but not dominant) idiosyncrasies. The interaction with the human world, from Nemesis (cigar smokers, high heels, innocent children playing foot-the-can) to friendly destroyers and unknown destroyers, is realistic and fascinating. You care about insects, AND about Dick and Mary. The protagonist Hoppity is not a perfect superman who comes "to fix things," but an optimist with starry eyes that guides everyone on the path of the garden (literally!), And whenever you think that it will end well in the style of the 1930s, another roadblock ...! I was on the edge of my seat much more than with "Up". I came out of the movie theater smiling and laughing: something that has not happened for a very long time!
