... I can not believe that I became addicted to this series instantly, having seen the first scene where I was deeply. <br /> <br /> Anyway, first of all, guys are hot, Cappy, Evan, Calvin, Fischer, Cappy, Heath, Cappy, etc. <br /> <br /> Second, the girls are cute, sexy, smart and are not afraid to be called bitches. I like this. Which at the same time does not make them mean and greedy, but simply realistic. <br /> <br /> Third, the relationships are really great, especially Casey and Cappy. Lately, each show is moving away from its original path and people are finding themselves with someone who was not even in the first season. The relationship between Cappy and Casey is a true love, a kind that lasts. They loved each other over the years and that did not end when a guest appeared. <br /> <br /> In today's world, it's perhaps incredible that two people love each other for a long time, but that happens. And people define themselves in college, so I knew exactly who I wanted to be in college with. Just like Casey and Cappy. <br /> <br /> I hope there will be many more seasons of this show and I hope we can see the relationship between CASEY and CAPPY NOW WHERE THEY WILL BE LIKELY, Thanksgiving ... J love this show
