"Pitch Black" was a complete shock to me when I saw it for the first time in 2000. In previous years, I have been repeatedly disappointed by all lame science fiction movies (Ex: STARSHIP TROOPERS) and I thought this movie would be different. But to be clear, this film scared me ... in a good way. I did not know that I was always afraid of the dark until I watched this movie. I had to bury my fear in the back of my subconscious when I was a child and that rightly deserves to stay there. <br /> <br /> Extraterrestrial creatures sent shivers down your spine; the person or persons who designed them have a twisted but brilliant and creative imagination to offer something as impressive and grotesque. <br /> <br /> I loved the way the writers gave each main character a story and showed their weaknesses and strengths without too much confusion. <br /> <br /> Riddick's (Vin Diesel) gift for escaping from any impossible situation and putting a fight to hell was the jaw dropping. At first you understand him as a cold-witted villain, but in a few moments you can see something human behind his animal side. But as soon as you discover it, it does something malicious. It certainly lets you guess until the end. I did not know whether to despise or admire him ... he is definitely a character of love / hate type. <br /> <br /> Johns (Cole Hauser) is the perfect example of a character who looks good but through a need for greed, shows his true intentions and what he is willing to do to survive. John's talent for knowing which buttons to press and which exact words makes him as devious as Riddick. <br /> <br /> Fry (Radha Mitchell) is a character who, as Johns so beautifully expressed, turned to her. first ass before considering the consequences. But what is endearing to her is that she quickly realizes her mistakes and tries desperately to pay for penance, even if she puts her life in danger, while others rejected all human values ​​and continued their momentum. <br /> <br /> Jack (Rhiana Griffith) just wanted to have a hero and was the first of the whole group to look for this hero at Riddick; Through the eyes of a child, good can be seen through the thick clouds of evil. I thought it was absolutely invaluable when Jack shaved his head in honor of Riddick; you know what they say: imitation is the best form of flattery. <br /> <br /> Imam (Keith David), like Jack, has the ability to see good in any evil. He uses philosophy to lead him through the hardships he encounters, and when time permits, he suffers rationally and then soldiers. In a way, it served to boost the morale of the survivors even though most of the characters acted as if they were not listening. <br /> <br /> The cast of this movie was absolutely perfect. Each actor brilliantly shone in his role and his talents were wonderfully mixed on the screen. <br /> <br /> This film may have had a small budget, but the direction of the director and the performances of the actor allowed the film to work and allow the public to use their imagination instead of letting some extremely expensive special effects do all the work for them. This film is a classic of science fiction. Look at him and judge for yourself (with an open mind). It will be worth it.
