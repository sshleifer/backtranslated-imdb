The first fully synchronized sound movie, Walt Disney's Mickey Mouse debuts on screen in the exceptionally entertaining animated short film "Steamboat Willie". Mickey is a worker on a steamboat under the supervision of Captain Peg Leg Pete (or Pete, as he will be called later). Mickey gets on the train with his longtime mate, Minnie Mouse, while Mickey tries to impress Minnie. This short film was wildly entertaining and entertaining. Presenters Ubbe Iwerks, Rudolph Ising and Hugh Harman helped Walt create the short film. "Steamboat Willie" essentially marks the beginning of the success of the Walt Disney Company.
