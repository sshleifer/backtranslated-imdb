The hawk and the snowman is based on a true story. Christopher Boyce and Andrew Daulton Lee (the traitors), played by Timothy Hutton and Sean Penn, received their code names from the KGB. Why? Boyce was a passionate falconer and Lee a coca head. The film is based on a true story. It is based on the book of the same name. Another critic asked what was their motivation? Disillusionment is not. The ideology is not. (Forgive my bad grammar), but I make a point here. What if it was not disillusionment or ideology? In a word, greed. At the time of the Boyce-Lee affair, money had become the main motivator and not the ideology. Do not believe me? Then look at the Walker Family Spy Ring that was broken in the late 80s. Three spies seriously damaged our national security in the 1970s and 1980s. John Walker, who started his spy career in the 1960s, Christopher Boyce and Andrew Daulton Lee. All three sold this country for thirty silver coins. If you do not know this sentence, I suggest you read the Bible.
