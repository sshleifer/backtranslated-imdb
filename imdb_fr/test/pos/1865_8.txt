I saw this movie on September 19, 2009 at the Cambridge Film Festival. <br /> <br /> The Beagle is only a few flashbacks, it's all about Darwin's life between 1841 and 1859, when he was living in Kent with his growing family, more than 200 original pages have already been written and he wondered whether to complete the book. <br /> <br /> The script is based on Randal Keynes' book Annie's Box (Annie, Charles's daughter, died when she was 10 years old). It is mainly a family drama, but includes sex scenes. However, participants are married, both on screen and on screen. Not too exciting, not a lot of science, but a well-made film that's nice to look at and pushes the right emotional buttons. A bit of a romantic weepie, actually. I guess the conclusion is that you can be an agnostic, free-spirited scientist, from an atheist family, while still being a romantic, an excellent father. <br /> <br /> Some of the characters and Darwin himself wonder if he "killed God", but the viewer may doubt it. What is beyond doubt, given the deadly struggle for survival and the predation network on the meadow (well known before Darwin and totally devoid of controversy) and the failure of Darwin's prayers, is that the 'idea of ​​a kind god of providence' his' creatures are untenable. <br /> <br /> I do not really see that many Americans are very opposed to it. Some may have problems with the title, which is probably the most controversial thing in the movie, or the fact that Bettany does not have a horn, tail or fork.
