Jim Henson has always seemed to produce great TV shows. This was unfortunately one of the shortest lived. It was endearing to hear each tale with their delightful morality. Each episode was a new story, with new characters. John Hurt played the role of storyteller very well and Brian Henson's sarcastic tone as a dog was always nice. <br /> <br /> The sets and costumes were very well done. Muppet's work, if any, is a classic work of Jim Henson. You know he's a Muppet, but his endearing appearance is more than forgiving. You find yourself delighted and compelled. When each episode ends, you realize that you have been very entertained. An entertainment that is rewarding, not one that fades after a few moments. You think about each episode and realize that each story is timeless and has a strong story about morality. <br /> <br /> I have not shown this to my own kids yet, but this is a lot more than family fun. I beg you to find it on DVD and get it back. If you can not do that, then find out how.
