Sean Connery is very good as Grand Raisuli, Lord of the Rif and Defender of the Faithful. It's an adventure movie with Arabs, Germans and USMC competing at one time or another. There is also a lot of humor in the interaction between the main and secondary characters. The story is based on the true incident in which a wealthy Greek-American businessman was kidnapped by the Raisuli in the early 1900s. Milius substituted Candace Bergen and her two children as victims of the abduction, which opens the door to many literary licenses. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, the film gives Milius the opportunity to remember the viewer of two of the most famous (though most of the time forgotten) political quotes of the TR era. Brian Keith (very good as TR) says: "Living Pedecaris or Dead Raisuli!"; and John Huston (also Secretary of State John Hay) asks the Japanese ambassador at a dinner at the White House: "Do you like a knife, do you like the fork?"
