In fact, I had seen the last parts of this film when I was a child. Thanks to the parcel search function, I could find the name of it. For years, I did not know the name, but the film stayed in my memory. The end gave hope that the main character would finally return to Earth. It was a pity he did not manage to make a series. This film reminds me of Journey to the Far Side of the Sun. Also known as Doppleganger. If you liked this feature, the other is worth a look. This was done before The Stranger, but shares a similar plot. Yet different. I just recovered The Stranger on eBay in VHS. I hope they make a DVD, but it is doubtful unless the DVD is available. Some pilots make a DVD on the budget and this one may do it.
