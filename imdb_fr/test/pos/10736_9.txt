I do not think so! I mean yes if you compare this movie to The Godfather, or maybe a bit older film like Casablanca, or maybe even a newer movie like The English Patient. There is no camera work or cinematography like these other movies, but that does not mean it's a bad movie, or is it? I think the reason this film is underestimated is that many people still compare it to other Oscar-winning big films (you should never do it), which makes it difficult to understand the beauty and realism of this film. In the categories Best Film, Best Actor in a Leading Role and Best Actress in a Supporting Role, this film really deserved them. The magnificent Dustin Hoffman offers us once again one of his best performances. A few times in this movie, I forgot that it was not his son because it was so real! I have never seen a movie about relationships in different families where it was so easy for actors to play that specific role but still beautiful. Dustin Hoffman passes the test handily, in my opinion. There are some actresses in the world who deserve to be called the best: Katherine Hepburn, Meryl Streep, Jane Fonda and Ingrid Bergman (I can not help it, I think she's great). Meryl Streep, while playing a supportive role, is amazing and real, and you can not help but be attracted to her talent and the way she makes it real and her. Wow, that's all I can say. Justin Henry was great considering his age, his tears and his relationship with his father and mother was beautiful, so I say good job to the adorable little Justin Henry. <br /> <br /> As I watched this film a third time, alone, I could not stop crying. I tried but I could not. Thank God, I was alone! It's probably the purest movie I've ever seen. Apocalypse Now, Norma Rae, Breaking Away and All That Jazz were also nominated in the Best Film category. I'm ashamed because I did not see any, but from what I've heard, Apocalypse Now is great, but when I heard about Norma Rae, I only thought about Sally Field. I think that, considering the other nominees, this film deserved five Oscars and that it would continue to touch and make others cry for a long time, just as it did for 28 years. Congratulations to all the actors and actresses of this film for giving us excellent performances and unforgettable memories of this film. <br /> <br /> Thank you for your time.
