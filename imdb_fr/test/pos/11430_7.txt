Based on Ermanno Rea's novel The Rejection, the story is about the slow friendship between the Italian maintenance technician, Vincenzo Buonavolonta (Sergio Castellitto), who may be perceived as the ugly king of Prince Caspian and who played the lead role in Bella Martha) and a Chinese translator Liu Hua (Ling Tai). In fact, they started on the wrong foot, the first blaming him for inaccuracy and slow translations of what he meant to say to a Chinese delegate who had bought defective equipment. Vincenzo wants to do what is right, which is rare nowadays, that is to say to inform potential buyers immediately of the faults and subtleties that their purchase would bring, and given that it is disturbed by the fact that the transaction was concluded It then takes time to create a component that would fix the problem. <br /> <br /> But it also means going to China in search of the elusive machine, which is well hidden and seems to have disappeared. without leaving a trace. With the reluctant initial help of Liu Hua, they embarked on this treasure hunt from town to town, which took us to less-visited places of China, far from Beijings and Shanghais, in cities like Wuhan, with industrial decorations such as steel mills and nuclear power stations with their smoke chimneys dotting the landscape. The mighty Yangtze River is also appearing. Throughout the journey, travel narrative style films, such as learning about culture, ideals, food and, basically, understanding that the world is without strangers, focus on the usual pitfalls provided that efforts are made to build links. While allusions to a romance between the two protagonists are suggested, he rarely asked the question, until perhaps late in the film (hey, opposites attract, no?) <br /> </ br> > In addition to large industrial plants and factories, we see various cottage industries, such as seamstresses working in sweat shops, as environments, and I think Cotton too, with noodle making. As a film, he offered me the opportunity to travel without leaving my seat to observe, and the merit of not judging on a foot of moral exception in terms of exploitation and others. And congratulations also that the film engages a dialogue based on the native languages ​​of the characters, rather than (and I will not name names here) another film / intercultural collaborations where the dialogue is forced-dubbed and went out unnaturally , and really boring. Some might think the secondary characters are too nice too, always opening their arms and doors to a stranger, but I would like to imagine that, perhaps, in more rural areas, people tend to be more sincere, more friendly and , basically, not caught in the rat race trampling on others or being trampled. <br /> <br /> If there is a message to remove from the film, besides the fact that I mentioned that the world is without strangers, it is a I remember that some of the things that I esteem important may not be for others. Importance is something that is given to something else and whose basis really depends on how we define the limits we set. So, given our limited lifespan, I think I should lighten my life a bit more, live and let live, and sometimes enjoy the illusion that ignorance could be happiness.
