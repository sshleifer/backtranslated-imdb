The details of The Big Trail were so incredible that I had the impression that the film was shot at the time it represents. I have never seen such real cars! They were big, loaded with accessories, and even felt like they had been filled with details under the blankets, which was never to be seen. Every grain of earth, every scratch, every shine was there. Modern computer technology could never recreate the scenes of the many wagons as they moved across the country or in a circle to repel the Indians. The wagons were all real individual vehicles, each with their own team of horses or oxen. <br /> <br /> The actors' clothes could not have been more authentic. With the exception of John Wayne's deerskin outfit and Marguerite Churchill's beautiful dress, the clothes were very common, very ragged or dirty in an authentic way. Many actors and actresses were born before electricity and indoor plumbing were common and they needed to feel comfortable with the environment. All Indians were real Indians rather than white extras painted in beige. <br /> <br /> The women of the old west had to be tough because there was a lot of work. In each scene showing the work done by the people in the train, women are shown cutting wood, firing logs, etc. This realism was so natural that it did not seem to be a statement about the role of women in survival. <br /> <br /> The plot of revenge and romance is played well. Nothing is overrated or over-played. <br /> <br /> Something got lost along the way in the 1930s in Hollywood. Although I like the fake landscapes and the controlled environment of old movies, The Big Trail manages above all to feel real. The more I see big budget movies of the silent era, the more I love them. I can think of some of the 30s that I saw that equaled the size of the best of the 1920s. If there were home movies made at the time of car trains, The Big Trail is that to what they would look like.
