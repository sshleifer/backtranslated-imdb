An online poll conducted in 2006 by TV Asahi on the top 100 all-time favorite animated television series in Japan ranked the series in fourth place. It tells you everything you need to know. Go and look at it;) I will not comment on the story, simply because I do not want to ruin anything. I only ask you to keep watching after watching the first episode. The animation is really good and above average television. The best thing about this series is that there is finally something new. I mean, it's not revolutionary, but it still offers a new idea and nice characters. You will not regret entering the world of Suzumiya Haruhi. <br /> <br /> and the best thing a movie is coming soon
