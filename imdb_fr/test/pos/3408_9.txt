I am a history teacher and I liked the film overall. My teenage girls enjoyed it during the holidays. Is it 100% accurate and is it a bit sinuous in places? Yes..but my children have moved away from the computer and the game console to spend four nights watching everything. <br /> <br /> The battle scenes were impressive and we met lots of historical characters. Lloyd Bridges like Jefferson Davis and Hal Holbrook as Abraham Lincoln stand out. We all thought that Phillip Casnoff like Bent was awesome and charming. We all thought Charles had stolen the show from Orry and George. <br /> <br /> We'll come back with the movie!
