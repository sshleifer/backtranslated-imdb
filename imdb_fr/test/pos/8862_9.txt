Antarctica, winter 1982. The team of an American research base is surprised by a couple of crazy Norwegians who chase a dog with a helicopter, trying to kill him. All Norwegians are killed and the Americans have only one dog, some bodies and questions. It's the beginning of the biggest horror / thriller movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> From beginning to end, you feel a tense and paranoid atmosphere. Helpless and alone in a no man's land. Ennio Morricone has been nominated for a Razzie Award for his score. Why I do not know because, as far as I know, his score is simple, scary and very good. It really puts you in a good mood. <br /> <br /> The acting game is great! The best performance is probably given by the dog who is just amazing. For Russell and the others, I can not say anything less. <br /> <br /> You may be thinking in 1982 and the special effects are not the most impressive? Well, think again! You did not see everything until you saw that. Bodyparts falling and creatures changing shape ... Rob Bottin did a great job. Today, makeup special effects is an important step. <br /> <br /> The movie did not have a big screen hit because of other extraterrestrial movies at the time and so it's not very well known. In fact, you can almost consider this as an unknown film. No one I asked to hear about it. However, the film has survived for more than twenty years as a cult film on video and DVD. Twenty years is a long time and, apart from the haircut, the film is still up to date. This film should be considered a classic. <br /> <br /> The film is without a doubt one of my, if not my favorite. I've seen it many times, but it's as good as the first time I saw it. As a Norwegian, the only thing I do not like in this film is that MacReady always calls Norwegian Swedes!
