For perverse reasons better known to them, these IMDb boards seem reluctant to consider the great Billy Wilder as co-screenwriter on at least two of his early classics (this one and Ninotchka), when any buff can detect the Wilder's hand at work. As it happens, this is the first time he has teamed up with Charles Brackett (who gets a credit) and it was a good start. One speaker noted how satisfying it was to see such films in old-fashioned cinemas, and I totally agree with that. In Paris, one of the smaller houses of Revival presents in one of its rooms a more or less continuous retrospective of Lubitsch and I am happy to say that it was presented to a very grateful public, whatever their age, although I doubt that there was any living. It was released in 1938. The famous Wilder schtick, the meet-cute, is particularly tasty when Cooper, millionaire but cautious, tries to buy half pajamas in a department store on the Riviera and faces the resistance sales Claudette Colbert introduces himself and agrees to buy the other half. The gag gets even louder when, after exhausting the chain of command of the store, the manager calls the owner, who is in bed and leaves him to chance to reveal that he is also wearing only the upper half of the pajamas . The film is full of visual gags like this, balanced with a verbal mind that makes it almost perfect. Claudette Colbert is only wonderful and has the support of Edward Everett Horton as an impoverished father. Like Franklin Pangborn, David Niven, fourth actor, has a funny "affair". If Gary Cooper is not up to his role, he has the verbal dexterity and the sophisticated character that Wilder's scripts advocated at this stage of his career. Do not have everything and what you have is almost perfect.
