A kind of culpable indulgence these days, it was an obligation to watch when I was in high school. It's really a great illumination of the nascent punk scene in LA in 1980. While the band is playing, Spheeris prints the subtitle lyrics, which is of course necessary if one really wants to know what the guy is screaming about in the microphone. But it also transforms the POV of the camera into a tourist, through this extraterrestrial world. The group's interviews reveal an honest approach to music that no longer really exists. Again, it is not as easy to find old church cabinets at $ 16 / month as Black Flag Chavez does. Do you know how many unreleased groups do not try like the Dickens to get a record deal? These guys did not care. And who can not like the comment of the little French who was the "singer" of Catholic Discipline (of which Phranc was a member). His hoarse voice delivers one of the best monologues ever captured in a film: "I have great news for the world ... The new wave does not exist." Phew! What a relief!
