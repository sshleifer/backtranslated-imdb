I just saw "All Illuminated" at the Telluride Film Festival. It's a really remarkable film. Very emotional, sometimes funny and comforting. Bring your tissues! For those of you who love a film that makes you cry, I remember the endings of "Babette's Day" and "The Notebook". The stories were completely different but had the same emotional power to make me cry, just like this movie. <br /> <br /> No revealing here. As IMDb describes it, the summary is a young man's trip to Ukraine to follow his roots and find the village where his father grew up. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is in English and Ukrainian (and in Russian too, I believe). This creates wonderful linguistic moments, depending on the circumstances, interpreted more or less faithfully by a character in the group, depending on the circumstances. <br /> <br /> The landscape is beautiful and the musical score is treated with wonderful influences from Eastern Europe. Make sure to respect the credits of the final melody. <br /> <br /> This is the first film by Lieve Schreiber who started as a director. It's well played. I give this film a 9, one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. I highly recommend it.
