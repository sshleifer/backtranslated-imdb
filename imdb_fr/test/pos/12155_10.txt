A German freshman, Stefan hitchhikes during the summer holidays in Paris, where he falls in love with a mysterious young woman he meets on the Parisian freak scene. He then follows her to the famous island of Ibiza, where the hippie met Wolf, a man who throws Hitler-Jugend knives, owns bars and hotels and holds Estelle under the thumb with drugs. The couple tries to escape Wolf, Stefan has become addicted to dope and jealousy for Estelle, who is groovy and free-spirited. Great photography and music, the plot is quite usual for the period but it's not a kind of film exploitation, cold and dramatic. Morality is quite strong (he was looking for the sun ...) but I would not say it is a film against drugs, even if it puts a lot of emphasis on drug use.
