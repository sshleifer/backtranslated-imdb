It's one of Hollywood's best horror / suspense movies for years, if not decades. Although, in my opinion, this movie was predictable in places, it contains everything a good movie of this kind should have CHILL, THRILLS, AND yes a lot of GORE !! HOUSE OF WAX SAFE BOOK !!! In some places, it was pretty wacky, the acting was not great, but my review score for HOUSE OF WAX is eight out of ten ...... if you like to be on the edge of your seats , I must admit that the film that suits you best was to see that the whole city was waxing ...... I like these museums myself, but after seeing this film, I'm going now look at them in a whole new and different way!
