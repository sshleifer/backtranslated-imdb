I was expecting a good movie. What I got was an even better movie. The chemistry between James and Smith is incredible. Glad to see it in a major movie for once! <br /> <br /> The film works because the actors play their role perfectly. Will Smith is fantastic with endless charm; Kevin James is hilarious, and Eva Mendes ... well, let's just say that she plays this role of bitch / sweet / boring to the best of her abilities. <br /> <br /> What I liked in the movie was the fact that Will Smith did not even need to try to be kind. He was right !! The "Doctor of Appointments" had all the right things, said everything in the most perfect way, without ever going beyond. <br /> <br /> The fun parts are hilarious ... and the cute and romantic parties are unforgettable. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie. And no, it's not a girls movie.
