This film tells the story of several couples facing post-war life. Through many moving testimonies, the public learns how war has changed people, while their human spirit has triumphed. <br /> <br /> My favorite scene is that of a young man on duty, returned home as a double amputee (after losing both arms to the elbow) is sure it would not be good for his love, who always wants to marry him. Her daughter simply said that she would help him do what he could not do, but that everything would be fine. Moved by this true manifestation of love, the man embraces his fianc√©e in tears. <br /> <br /> The scene where a man on duty has asked for a bank loan is also a highlight. When initially denied as "high risk", a senior bank official spoke, saying, "You fought for our country and you protected us - that's enough for me." Your loan is approved " "The best years of our life" won 6 Oscars, including a special statuette for the disabled actor who showed us the whole life that continues and that will be worthwhile, even with a serious handicap. This film is a joy to watch again and again. A real classic! Highly recommended!
