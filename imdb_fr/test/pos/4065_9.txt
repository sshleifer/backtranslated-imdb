"Showtime" is a fun movie featuring comedians, comedians, Robert DeNiro (Meet the Parents, A Bronx Story) and Eddie Murphy (Shrek, Dr. Dolittle). The story is this: At the beginning of the movie, detective Mitch (Robert DeNiro) and another detective go to a TV store to try to dismantle criminals. When the cops arrive, Tray (Eddie Murphy), a cop, tries to stop Mitch without knowing he's a cop. During this scene, there are a lot of fun things that catch the eye of television producer Chase Ritz. She is so excited about their adventures together that she decides to make a TV show called "Showtime" starring Tray (the cop) and Mitch (the detective). But it's just the fun part. The rest is strictly suspense and action. There is a foreign man who sells and manufactures extremely dangerous weapons. By playing LAPD in the series and in real life, DeNiro and Murphy have an adventure in this story. On a scale of 1-10, I give it seven or eight.
