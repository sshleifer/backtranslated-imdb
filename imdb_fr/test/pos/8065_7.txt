Although the concept of a 32-year-old woman representing a 12-year-old girl may seem popular with today's sophisticated audiences in the 1920s, this was what Mary Pickford fans wanted and expected from their parents. favorite star. The opening scene features Annie's tomboyish character as the apparent leader of a multi-ethnic street gang in a comic "battle" with a rival group. The sight of a young girl being kicked in the jaw and being kicked may seem a little rough, but the scene is set at "Our Gang", so much so that it would be difficult to take it seriously. Anyway, Annie can take it as well as take it. Once Annie returns home and replaces her street clothes with more feminine clothes, it becomes harder (especially in close-up) to imagine this beautiful young woman as a street kid. However, for those who can get the necessary suspension of disbelief, the rest of the movie has its rewards. Swaying between comedy (Annie's group rides a series) in front of a feeling (Annie plans a surprise for her Irish policeman father) in front of a tragedy (her father is killed on her birthday), the film gives Mary a opportunity to please his fans of all times. <br /> <br /> Of course, the required "happy ending" is finally achieved; the perpetrators are apprehended with the help of Annie's friends and rivals and she is seen for the last time in the company of her friends riding a busy artery on a sunny day. Which is a good way to finish a Mary Pickford movie. <br /> <br />
