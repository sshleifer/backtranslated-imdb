My first criticism at IMDB, after a few years of constant use of this site ... <br /> <br /> Anyway, I saw it on the tube the other night, I loved it. It's in the spirit of a dangerous spirit or a substitute, but it's much better. Was certain that Rex was Speedy Levitch in Waking Life, but after verification, it seems that no. <br /> <br /> I can understand why many have problems with this plot and its poetry, but I also think that these people are close to mind. While the end was not exactly what I expected, but overall, it was so unique and well done, I can not complain. I would not say it's corny, as a reviewer did, it was more successful than most of the 80s movies. And they refrained from playing really dating 80s music. <br /> <br /> I do not remember everything that made me smile when I saw this, but it has realistically shown very creative people surrounded by mediocrity and if I share the point of Rex beliefs or not, I like the original attempts to describe the meaning of life. And his theory of Mutant is, to my knowledge, original. He also walked a lot, but they showed how confused he sometimes was and why he might have psychological problems. And then, in his moments of clarity, he was an extraordinary philosopher, a person who noticed the small details of life and tried to express them. <br /> <br /> I was also very impressed by John Savage as a teacher. Usually, actors fail in this role. He brilliantly succeeded. <br /> <br /> If you enjoyed Waking Life, I invite you to watch this film if you have the opportunity. <br /> <br /> 9.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> pk
