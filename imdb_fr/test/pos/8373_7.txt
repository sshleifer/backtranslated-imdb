The only reason The Duke Is Tops, one of the many "running movies" made during periods of segregation, is worthy of note today is because she made the debut in the movie of a 21-year-old singer named Lena Horne. She plays Ethel Andrews, a singer who has to leave her producer mentor, Duke Davis (Ralph Cooper), to get into the big movie. Davis, however, must pretend to have taken the money for her services before her so as not to feel sorry for having done so. He then teamed up with Doc Dorando (Lawrence Criner) for a series of medical shows in the south of the country. Meanwhile, in New York, his new producers bombed a lot of people because they entrusted him with the whole show instead of just becoming the specialty.

Mrs. Horne's song is well presented here and it is interesting to see her so young before her professionalism is fully acquired later in her career. According to IMDb, among the other supporting players, an appearance by Lillian Randolph, Annie in my favorite movie, It's a wonderful life and Amanda Randolph's sister I just saw in the short film The Black Network, in as a woman with Sciatica complaining. not to be cured after taking Doc's medication before Duke explains it's for the feet! And as a long-time resident in Louisiana, I would like to take note of the two actors here in this movie: Monroe's Joel Fluellen as a strong client and Marie Bryant of New Orleans as a sexy dancer who appears near of musical apogee. So, just for Lena Horne, The Duke is Tops worth a visit at least once.
