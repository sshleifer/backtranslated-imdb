John Parrish is a former Union officer planning to sell his ranch and land to the Wilkison in Anchor. The problem is that the price offered is way too low and when they start intimidating Parrish and his workers, he changes his heart, especially when the situation deteriorates sharply. <br /> <br /> After looking at this one, I had a feeling of frustration, mainly because of the cast that was involved. When you have Edward G. Robinson, Glenn Ford and Barbara Stanwyck in the same movie, you hope they will have a story and a storyline that will allow them to excel. Unfortunately, they do not have the chance to produce a Western classic worthy of multiple visits, or is that what I expected too much to do, it is to do a disservice? I slept on it and decided to think more about the photo. I think so, it's fair to say that the actors in question deserved a better story from which to work is, in the end, a plot that was betrayed forever, and then some. But The Violent Men is still a very gratifying film, regardless of the obvious missed opportunities in production. <br /> <br /> Glenn Ford as Parrish is still as cool as the nose of an Eskimo, and it's always a pleasure to see Babs Stanwyck play a bitch because she's good at it. While Eddie G, when one gets used to it in a western, goes well in what is an underwritten part. Robinson, who intervened at the last minute when Lee Wilkison, Broderick Crawford was injured, is the one who has changed the most, but he even supported characters such as the evil Wade Matlock Richard Jaeckel} and Judith Wilkison {a radiant Dianne Foster} impress. But for all that, Robinson's "naughty" crutch is at least memorable for all the right reasons. <br /> <br /> Rough about action and shooter, it's with twists and almost Shakespearean tragedies that Rudolph Mat√©'s film rises above the banal, with all this beautifully framed by the superb cinematography of Burnett Guffey. Lone Pine in Alabama has been used in many Western countries {see Seven Men From Now for another glorious use}, but here Guffey really excels and manages to dazzle the eyes every turn. The Violent Men is not an excellent western image, and perhaps a better director than Mate could really have given Donald Hamilton's novel {{Big Country}}, an adaptation he can be proud of. But for every little complaint I personally had with her, I found two more reasons to really love her, for sure, that's recommended, of course. 7/10
