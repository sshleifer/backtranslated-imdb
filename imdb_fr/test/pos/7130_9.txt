We have just returned from the European premiere of The Gamers: Dorkness Rising. <br /> <br /> All I can say is that if you are a player (CRPG, RPG or LARP), this movie is for you. And if you are not a player? Well, it's still a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> The acting is certainly not worthy of the Oscars, but throughout the film, it adds to the charm. The humor is omnipresent, with great attention (the tribute to Gary Gygax is particularly successful, if you can spot it). The actors are very down-to-earth in their appearance, worthy of the fact that they are ordinary people enjoying an ordinary hobby. <br /> <br /> The quality of the sound and vision of the film is adequate, but again, all this adds the atmosphere that defines this film as the movie Dungeons and Dragons, written and performed by players for players. <br /> <br /> Not afraid to use system-specific terminology, they still manage to authorize product placement. to be part of the film, but in a very understandable way and quite right. It also addresses some of the perceived biases that some players may have about other players and solves them pretty well. <br /> <br /> Overall, the film is based on a balanced balance well thought out. of character, intrigue and entertainment (the bard has an incredible value for money). <br /> <br /> In the end, it's hard to score this movie; so I gave him 2 scores. <br /> <br /> Score (for non-RP'ers): 7/10 (A few moments might elude you, but the main sections of the movie work so hard and do much more.) <br /> < Score (for the RP'ers): 10/10 (Everything goes together, in ideal quantities, with perfect charm and feeling)
