Gerald McBoing-Boing is one of the most influential characters in making the UPA a map more than any other. This story of a little boy who only talks about sound effects has kept his charm for 57 years. In addition to effects, I loved music, animation and abstract backgrounds, Marvin Miller's story, just about everything. And he won the Oscar for Best Animated Short Film in 1950. I'm happy to have seen him on YouTube after hearing about Dr. Seuss' story for so many years. And the Rocky and Bullwinkle creator, Bill Scott, has also contributed, it's great! I hope to see the following shorts made in the series, if not on YouTube, so maybe in a DVD collection. Now, I guess I will watch another UPA short film out there ...
