"Sorte Nula" is the best-selling Portuguese box-office film in 2004. This low-budget production (estimated at $ 150,000) started at Christmas alongside American Blockbusters like National Treasure, Polar Express, The Incredibles and Alexander, moviegoers. Despite the tough competition, the short film was surprisingly successful, beating all the other Portuguese films of the last two years in its first few weeks. The film is a mystery / murder in the humorous tone skilfully written and directed by Fernando Fragata, become a reference in the field of independent European film. Did I like the movie? Oh yes!
