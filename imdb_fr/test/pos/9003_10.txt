First of all, I know almost nothing about rugby. Therefore, although I found the rugby aspect of this film very interesting, it could have been any sport and I would have enjoyed it as well. The fact that it is rugby has made it neither better nor worse. <br /> <br /> What made this movie great is the story itself, based on the events of the past 30 years in the Highland rugby club. Coach Gelwix is ​​the kind of coach that all parents would like their kids to have, someone who cares more about the person than about sports (even though they've won 17 national championships and lost only 9 matches in over 30 years!). The more I learned about the coach and the team the more I like this movie and its message. <br /> <br /> I saw other sports movies that seemed great at first, but then I looked for details to find that most of these movies were 10% factual and 90% fictitious, the factual 10% being greatly exaggerated. Not so with Forever Strong. It may sound too good to be true, but that's amazing about it. If it was fiction, it would be a nice story and nothing more. Instead, the film is a source of inspiration and makes you want to become a better person. <br /> <br /> Do not miss this movie because of some negative reviews from professional critics. I read some of their reviews and most of them gave the movie some horrible reviews. These are usually the same critics who love movies that most people hate. In fact, I would be worried if some of these critics had given the film good reviews because I almost always disagree with their opinions. <br /> <br /> Go see this movie and post your review (positive or negative)! Currently, most audience reviews are positive (here and on Rotten Tomatoes and similar sites), and I am interested to see if this trend continues. Thank you!
