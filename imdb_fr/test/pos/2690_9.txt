I guess my husband and I are a little slow. In general, we do not prepare for a series until they have almost completed their useful life. In this case, we only started looking at the KoQs in the sixth season. I do not know how it escaped our radar for so long. Other than the fact that we are not big fans of television by appointment. Our schedules are such that we do not like to commit to watching shows every time they arrive (and we did not have a DVR yet). So, I guess it was only when TBS started broadcasting its daily reruns in the evening, that we started to watch constantly. <br /> <br /> By the time we became addicted, there were only two seasons left before the end of the season. the series was canceled. But we still watch it almost every day on TBS. I'd rather see the shows this way, because you can watch multiple episodes every day, and it helps to create continuity and what's going on with the characters without having to wait a whole week. <br /> <br /> But the episodes Stay alone to the extent that stories are not carried from week to week. But it suits me, because you can watch an episode, then miss weeks - and resume everything. <br /> <br /> My only criticism is that writing was not always consistent. Some episodes would be scandalously hilarious, while others would be only slightly amusing. So, I'm not sure he had the quality of the writers that Seinfeld or Raymond had. But I loved the cast and the characters are all very believable and realistic. Kevin James is just funny to watch! So, even if the plot is not so great, James's body language and expressions are worth the detour. Leah Remini is great as a "play-the-hetero" woman. I think it's harder to play the straight character to laugh than the comic character, and she does a great job. She's chic for sarcasm and insults like no other. She is a difficult cookie! And who can forget Arthur as the father of Carrie, who lives with them in their basement. <br /> <br /> This is an excellent series and I was sorry to cancel it. But a big thank you to TBS for keeping the king alive during the reruns!
