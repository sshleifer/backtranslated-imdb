This film is so wonderful that it captures the game life. I laughed so much at this. The film tells the story of a group of players who have difficulties with a campaign devised by their Dungeon Master. The film moves from the real world to the game world as it plays the campaign it portrays in the game world as a character, and then returns to the real world when it does not play. The campaign is the basis of a module that Dungeon Master, Lodge, is writing. The problem is that Lodge can not finish its module because the characters can not finish the campaign. They are more likely to kill and loot than role plays. Lodge wants them to play a role in the campaign, which they have never done before. They decide to call for extra help so that they bring one, wait for it, a girl to play. Lodge also makes a npc, a non-player character, a paladin, who can not witness or hurts, to play. The film is how they do it all and the more I do not want to ruin the movie so I will not say more. This film may not be a big budget, the acting game may not be worthy of an Oscar, but if you like the game, the dungeons and the dragons, look at it definitely. They had a lot of fun making this movie and it shows that I'm not going to criticize it for film problems such as continuity or anything, it's a low-budget movie that's just fun. There is a comedy slap stick that I like and a lot of good writing in my opinion. So, if you want a fun movie, try it.
