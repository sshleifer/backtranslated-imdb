This film was recommended to me by the same person who blessed me with a copy of The Chronicles of Narnia. Shadowlands is one of the most amazing scenarios ever written. He is well executed, played and directed. Cinematography is a little dark for my taste but I'm sure it was planned. The screenplay looks like poetry in some parts of the film, all through the film, I found myself taking a break to reflect on the comments we just made on the screen. It's a wonderful piece of film and I can only hope that more people will meet and add criticism. Just a warning if it was a 6-cloth film for me. Very touching. Very sincere performances.
