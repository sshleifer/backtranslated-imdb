"Best in Show" is an often hilarious fake documentary that takes us into the world of dog shows and some of the dog owners who are preparing for the event. The only thing that separates this film from the actual dog shows is that the dogs of "Best in Show" act more healthy than their owners! Funny leading comedians including Eugene Levy (who co-wrote the film), Catherine O'Hara, Parker Posey, Michael McKean, Jennifer Coolidge, Jane Lynch and Christopher Guest (who co-wrote with Levy and directed). They are all funny, but Fred Willard steals the film with his explosive performance, as an exhibition announcer who says the most outrageous things. Plus, the dogs are cute too. "Best in Show" is not exactly the laugh that I expected, but there are bursts of laughter and worth seeing. <br /> <br /> *** (out of four)
