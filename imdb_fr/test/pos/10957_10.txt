It should be noted that this film was not "improvised" (as you probably think), despite what the title at the end suggests. The film was very scripted and repeated - Cassavetes did not have enough money to support the inevitably high production costs of an "improvised" film, even if he wanted to produce such a thing. "The improvisation" of the film is contained in the performances of the actors and the emotions that they release from the lines. I'm sure I'll come back again and again. The depth of emotions that Cassavetes is able to draw from the smallest gestures and interactions is incredible. I do not know how he managed such amazing performances with the actors, especially in the conditions in which he worked. It is truly a magnificent monument of the film that I would recommend to anyone interested in exploring beyond the Hollywood mold.
