There is a recent political documentary called Why We Fight, which attempts to examine the infamous military-industrial complex and its hold on this country. It is considered both controversial and incisive to plead against this complex and the war fiasco we are currently facing in Iraq. Yet a much more famous series of films, bearing the same name, was shot during the second world war by Hollywood director Frank Capra. Although considered as a documentary and as having won Oscars in this category, this series of seven films is actually a pure agitator, more in the spirit of Triumph of the Will Leni Reifenstal scenes that Capra recycles for his own purposes. That said, this does not mean that it does not have vital information that was missing from the following generations of documentaries about the Second World War (such as The World at War, praised by the BBC), and that its value as a main source is no less valuable. They are cleverly designed and, having recently bought used DVDs at a discounted store, I had the option to choose a free DVD with my purchase. I chose the DVD collection from the Goodtimes Four DVD series. <br /> <br /> It's rare that something free has been so valuable. Although DVDs do not contain supplements and the sound quality of their prints varies, these films give a glimpse of the spirit of Americans two-thirds of the century, when racism was blatant (as in many classics of war, Warner Brothers). cartoons of the time), and there was nothing wrong with blatantly distorting the facts. The seven films, produced between 1942 and 1945, are Prelude to War, Strike of the Nazis, Divide and Conquer, The Battle of Britain, The Battle of Russia, The Battle of China and War Comes to America. <br /> <br /> Overall, the film series is worth watching, not only for obvious reasons, but also for the subtle elements it reveals, such as the use of the plural for terms such as X million when we speak of dollars, rather than the modern singular, or the most used graphic of the whole series: a Japanese sword piercing the center of Manchuria. But it also shows the complexity of trying to apply the norms of the past to the current wars. The lesson of the First World War (avoiding foreign intrusions) did not apply to the Second World War, whose own lesson (acting early against dictatorships) did not apply to the three great wars that America has since conducted: Korea, Vietnam and Iraq. The fact that much of this series emerges from uncertainties from one era to another only underscores its historical value in this era of information plugging. It may not help you to distinguish the truth from the lies and the propaganda of today, but at least you will realize that you are not the first to be in such a tenuous position, and you will not be the last.
