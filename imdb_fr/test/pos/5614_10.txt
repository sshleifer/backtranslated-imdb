As you can see from the few comments posted here, mine may be the last ones you'll see, unless there's a big DVD or TCM re-reads it! - This is a kind of "Our group" movie with a group of different kids. MGM was definitely the music studio - if musicians, dancers and singers were not under contract, they were on the tap. Heifetz was one of the most expensive ..... who does it for a little charity work !!! The fees he received at that time were unheard of. Another musical film with Jose Iturbi (Mexican pianist) featured a hundred children playing a simple melody on 100 pianos ...... Skeptics who think that young children are not musical are wrong: I have been one. <br /> <br /> As all write, "Frankie Smith" - a good American name - (Gene Reynolds) was the mean but good-natured child taken by the owners of a music school. Can you believe that Walter Brennan ("Prof. Lawson") of all these Western films was the man who ran the school? Joel McCrea ("Peter McCarthy") and Andrea Leeds ("Ann Lawson") were the biggest stars of "They Shall Have Music", with a host of well-known extras (many of whom continued to become stars in their own right). rights). As others have pointed out, almost all of the children in the orchestra (in fact, the Los Angeles Meremblum Symphony) have been a huge success, either as musicians (for the studios) or in other enterprises. <br /> <br /> Sad to say, there are not many youth orchestras today - a sad mistake. Parents who have children at school are usually so busy trying to keep their heads above the water, and many do not even know what happens to children at school. Music instruction can be expensive, and almost EVERYONE would have a football team ..... <br /> <br /> This is the cheapest Jascha Heifetz concert you'll ever hear in this film. .... at that time, a quarter. His game is brilliant, even if he seems to prefer to be elsewhere ..... without emotion. By contract, any Yo-Yo Ma concert is so happy that it makes you want to run out and buy a cello ..... this guy has a good time .... like the children of the "street" "concert, when they will trick Heifetz into playing in their school. <br /> <br /> All orchestral numbers have been played by "children", and they make the sound easy. I like this type of movie - their intrigues are so simple, it does not take you two days to determine if you enjoyed - or understood - the movie, at all. We need new movies like this one - we can not do anything but encourage the youngest to play other instruments than the guitar ....... Bravo!
