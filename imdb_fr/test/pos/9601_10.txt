I can not add much to what has already been said, except that I will have to do it because of the minimum policy of 10 lines. <br /> <br /> I did it on a DVD-VHS copy, but the quality is pretty mediocre and I desperately need to be officially released. <br /> <br /> I can imagine what extras I would like to see (the character of Tim Healy swearing his way through one of these 'Football bloopers type programs would be great!). You can imagine now, do not you? But of course, it seems like most people will have to keep dreaming about a DVD release. <br /> <br /> It is obvious that there must be someone in the ITV DVD publishing department who also knows something about British culture, Web is he aware and has it it enough to consult IMDb from time to time? Never mind.
