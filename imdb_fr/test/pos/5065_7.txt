RENDITION's critics were generally unfavorable, so I waited until he went to the local discount theater to see him. The film tells the story of Anwar El-Ibrahimi, an Egyptian-American scientist who was ripped off his international flight and was interrogated after a strange coincidence that links him to a terrorist attack recently committed in a country in Africa. North. Not as bad as I feared, it's an interesting and stimulating entry into the thriller genre "ripped headlines". <br /> <br /> The film finally raises difficult questions about American prelude methods. information from political prisoners: is crossing the previously uncrossed line using (openly) torture of suspected terrorists something that our country should do? Does it provide useful information that saves lives? If so, at what price? What kind of monsters do we create when innocent people are captured and tortured? By sanctioning the use of torture, what kind of monster do we become as a country? It is always disappointing to see that a film with such a provocative material is neglected and has certain details that make the films look great. For example, I would like to have empathy for Anwar's wife, who spends the entire movie trying to find him, but the only identifiable personality trait she has is a state of advanced pregnancy. RENDITION also seems to imply that Arab women who do not comply with the arranged marriages of their fathers only ask for trouble, and there is a poorly designed album kept by another of the main characters of the film which lays out in too much detail all the details the information on his love interest is precisely to have an urgent need at this particular moment. I laughed loudly as the moment should have been filled with dread. <br /> <br /> The film features a good central performance by Jake Gyllenhaal and strong appearances (but too brief) of Hollywood veterans Meryl Streep and Alan Arkin, as well as impressive filming by Omar Atwally in the role of Anwar El-Ibrahimi, as well as actors Moa Khouas, Zineb Oukach and Yigal Naor, whom I would very much like to see in later films that have nothing to do with terrorism. Good luck to them. The five stories followed by RENDITION are well assembled, until the filmmakers insert a slight but effective turn that finally alludes to the endless cycle of carnage engendered by the violent attacks of terror.
