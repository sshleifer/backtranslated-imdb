I love that movie! When I saw this film on television when I was a kid, it scared me. Probably because the models give me goosebumps too. Jocelyn Jones (Molly) is an excellent actress. Chuck Connors is great, M.Slausen.I'm glad to see him play such a different role. The other actors in this film are also great! Tanya Roberts (Becky) and Robin Sherwood (Eileen) are great actresses and I hope to see them in future movies, including Jocelyn Jones! <br /> <br /> So if you like horror movies but are tired of seeing the same thing, watch this movie!
