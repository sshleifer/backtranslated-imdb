I found this movie on Netflix and I had to add it to my queue. I was not disappointed when I got it, because it's as funny now as when I saw it at the movie theater in a car at the time. <br /> <br /> It reaches a climax. various characters as they begin their journey across America on the "Honky Tonk Freeway, America on Wheels". It was a strange comic role for William DeVane since I remember him as Kennedy in the 1974 television movie "The Missiles of October" and I felt that no one could have realized this character too. although he. <br /> <br /> It reminds me a little Dick Van Dyke in "Cold Turkey" where Van Dyke played the role of local minister. The role of mayor, minister and activist DeVane was typical of small towns, which made his character fun and real. <Br /> <br /> Howard Hessman and Teri Garr as a spoiled family in the camper were also targeted. Anyone who has crossed the country with young children, (are we still there?) Will enjoy these scenes. <br /> <br /> The scenes of a small town struggling for survival reminded me a lot of the small town I grew up in, but they treated it with the charm and humor that you often only see in small towns. the cities have disappeared because of the highway system and this gives a realistic and humorous view of what they had to do to survive. (Did anyone use zoo animals?) <br /> <br /> All in all, it's a light comedy without a particular message, but a humorous look at America in the early 80's It's worth looking at if you just need a little courage.
