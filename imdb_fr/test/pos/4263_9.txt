Jarl and Moodysson are part of an endangered species of political filmmakers. The Swedish public should understand that it is trying to reveal the truth when the government and the media are actively distorting and concealing the events surrounding the EU meeting in Gothenburg. It is absolutely heartbreaking to see how these innocent children were abused and drugged by the Swedish police and sentenced to jail time in political trials for sending SMS messages and for revenge for other actions. The only disadvantage of this film is that it will not reach the vast Swedish masses, it will only be presented in theaters and will not be broadcast on video or television. <br /> <br /> The political film is important. because it can bring new perspectives and illuminate complex problems and has a role to play as a mass educator.
