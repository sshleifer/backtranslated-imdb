Too added with too much removed from a big western written by McMurtry about Texas vs. Rangers. Indian. This scenario removes this only to fill this mini series of warm and fuzzy relationships that, in reality, were secondary to the main storyline. This ends with a totally unbelievable and detached ending that is not written in the book, which makes you doubt how we will be transported to Lonesome Dove. <br /> <br /> The main characters in the series were actually very well chosen, the locations were excellent, but this mini series should have remained true to what a good book.
