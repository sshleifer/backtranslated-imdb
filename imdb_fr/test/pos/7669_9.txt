I had the great pleasure of recently watching this beautifully filmed widescreen adaptation of the 1943 scene (which, unlike the original 1935 production), included many spoken recitatives. It was fashionable at the time, so to blame the film a tradition of 16 years. The film should be seen, if only for Sammy Davis Junior, a brilliant cat performance, such as Sportin 'Life, crawling in and out of the shadows. Her seduction of BESS by Dorothy Dadridge "There is a boat to leave soon for New York", is one of the many strengths. Almost all the main music is intact and beautifully sung. This is certainly not what the recent PBS and MET versions have done. It is a pleasure to note that time has not diminished the film and will be made available in the near future to generations who have not had the chance to live it.
