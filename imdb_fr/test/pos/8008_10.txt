Of all Bat's movies, Batman Returns is my favorite. This beautiful, dark and fun movie is one of Tim Burton's best works. Although it is much more violent and darker, it is the Batman that the creator Bob Kane had considered many years ago. Michael Keaton resumes his role as avenger of Gotham City. This time, he faces two deadly enemies, Danny Devito's Penguin and Michelle Pfeiffer's Catwoman. Danny Elfman, actor and actor of the film, takes us on an exciting adventure during which Batman fights the forces of evil trying to seize Gotham City. Christopher Walken makes a beautiful appearance as Max Shrek, a clever businessman who has an evil ploy. But of course, Michelle Pfeiffer is the one stealing the show. With all these components, you have a movie that will amaze you. That's why you go to the movies. He has everything. It's a shame that Tim Burton did not have the chance to lead the other suites. If that's the case, I think the franchise will still be fine today. Batman Returns is an amazing experience for fans who love cool movies.
