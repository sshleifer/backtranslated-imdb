WOW I like this movie. This is definitely added to my list of movies in the ghettos. <br /> <br /> Juice - Featured Tupac 'I do not want Giva F ***' Society Threat II - O-Dawg 'I'm going to smoke Anyone, I'm coming do not frost F **** New Jersey Drive - Hey, they steal cars in the middle of the day, they obviously do not eat ***. <br /> <br /> New Jersey Drive is the best movie of the hood. He is at the top of the list, the company Menace II is the second and the juice third, Clockers is really stupid. <br /> <br /> The New Jersey Drive is Pwnage also Mac Mall & Young Lay - All about my fetti are heard throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> Lords of the underground - Burn rubber, another good song, just like Ill & Al Scratch - do not close the reader <br /> <If you're a fan of GTA-SA, you're going love this movie, AND the amazing soundtrack. The soundtrack is basically rap on the theft of cars ^ _ ^ SWEETTTT Movie!
