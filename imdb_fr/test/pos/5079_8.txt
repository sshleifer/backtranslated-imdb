I liked this film. I saw it in a packed house at the Toronto International Film Festival the day after the gala match, which was set to go well. The director, Gavin Hood, was supposed to be present at today's screening, but alas, his twins being born a few hours ago, he had to take a plane. "He made two jokes in 24 hours," he joked. <br /> <br /> Rendition refers to "extraordinary rendition" - a term used to send suspected terrorists to the United States without the legal consent of their parents. nations and prisons abroad to be interrogated and detained. <br /> <br /> It's quite predictable - an innocent Egyptian-American man wrongly accused of being a terrorist "disappears" while on his way from South Africa to Washington. He is sent abroad, while his wife at home (Reese Witherspoon) fights to find him and release him. But what makes this film special are some good storytelling choices: 1) a human story of what is happening in the area where a suicide bomb has exploded; 2) the humanity of a CIA agent trying to understand and be honest with what is really happening; and 3) the chronology of the story that makes it a tight story that moves and shakes at the right time. Ah - relief! And a mixture of emotions that swirls as the story struggles for an end. <br /> <br /> A powerful action game around Meryl Streep as a remarkable actress.
