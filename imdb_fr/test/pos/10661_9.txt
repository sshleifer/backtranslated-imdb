Eisenstein created the Russian theory of editing and this film is the best example. It took years before anyone could use their ideas and make them work (The Limey, 1999). Nevertheless, the landau scene really demonstrates the discombobulated nature of the RMT. Of course, as in most movies, it takes time in some parts, the beauty of the film is incredible. One of the best silent movies I have ever seen.
