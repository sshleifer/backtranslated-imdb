BIG FAT LIAR, in my opinion, is an absolutely hilarious film with a moral. When Jason (Frankie Muniz - "MALCOLM IN THE MIDDLE") and Kaylee (Amanda Bynes - "ALL THIS") played these tricks to Marty (Paul Giamatti - DOCTOR DOLITLE), I really smiled and felt good. That's what I liked most about this movie. In fact, everything that happened after Jason's trial was mistakenly in Marty's hands was hilarious. I particularly liked Jaleel White's cameo. When I saw it for the first time, I was not sure, but when I asked my mother if it was him, she said, "Sure!" Before closing, I would like to say: "As I said earlier, this story has a moral, and this morality is to always tell the truth." In conclusion, if you are a fan of Frankie Muniz, Amanda Bynes or Paul Giamatti, I highly recommend this absolutely hilarious film with a moral.
