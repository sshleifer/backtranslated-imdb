I caught this movie locally around 4:30, I did not expect it but, after the opening credits, I knew I was in something good. <br /> <br /> There are still some situations left to your interpretation to "discover" that Your attention is therefore a determining factor. <br /> <br /> The whole psychological thriller deals a lot with the development of the character and the way the main character performs things. <br /> <br /> Your under-consciousness also plays an important role because through a series of events and dialogues, you will be able to make a correct interpretation and generate an opinion. <br /> <br /> The technical aspects are very good. Really good actually. Kelly Overtone is extremely sexy and sweet to the eye although she wears her white clothes most of the time. <br /> <br /> The fear factor is almost non-existent, but there is still a lot of mystery and tension to dig. <BR /> <br /> I would recommend it to those who love supernatural and psychological thrillers.
