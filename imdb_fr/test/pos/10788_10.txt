Talk Radio is, of course, probably not the best known of Stone's movies, but do not be put off, this movie is ripe for discovery, I challenge anyone not to be bewitched by it. With the best performance of Eric Bogosian's 80's cinema, for me (with JFK), it's still Stone's best moment. Stone does not seem to talk much about it lately and did not comment on the director on DVD like all his other films. Stone does not have to blush, most filmmakers would like to kill a shot like a movie like this. <br /> <br /> The studio's claustrophobia is intense and Champlain's opinions are still important arguments for the moment. The speech "legalize all drugs" is powerful and you could agree with it. In my opinion, the film talks about freedom of expression and the fact that sometimes people do not like to hear things with which They do not agree. The speeches and conversations with the listeners are very convincing, even troubling, a shiver ran through my back when a mad man called Champlain saying that he must rape again because the city makes him crazy, it's totally shocking. The tension is sometimes unbearable when the Heavy Metaller Kent becomes disconcerted, of course, Champlain does no favors by ridiculing him. Champlain (or should I say Bogosian) is intrepid in the film and the performance, totally hypnotic, a pity that the Bogosian played an important role in Under Siege 2 (dear god !!). A scene that did not sound right was when Dan (Alec Baldwin), Barry's boss, asks him to calm down. Barry does not seem to be the kind of person who is silent and who does as he said, it seemed a bit artificial and clich√©.The scenes outside the studio are criticized too formulated, that's right, because Stone is trying to make the film more cinematic and allow the viewer to see the beginnings of Champlains, but it does not quite work. <br /> <br /> This is a brilliantly cinematic film with very close shots, deep focus, extreme speed, a fantastic 360-degree set that is used for the breathtaking final monologue. Must see the cinema, it makes it rare because it was ignored at the time but it receives again the attention it deserves so amply. A th @ classic should be studied by generations of film students. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10 for an inventive use of "Bad To The Bone" before T2, a brilliant cast that includes John C Mcginley (Dr. Cox of Scrubs) as Stu, Leslie Hope (24 years old) ) in the role of Champlains girlfriend, John Pankow and Alec Baldwin in costume and Micheal Wincott who plays three roles (a very underrated actor), the tension between listeners and Champlain who is very thrilling @ times and of course bravo to the stars Bogosian and Stone for such a fantastic movie. Enjoy!
