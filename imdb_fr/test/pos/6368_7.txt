I am surprised that this comedy, well above the average of the 80s, scores only 5.2 on all the voters of the BDIM. Dan Ackroyd does his usual satirical trick as a scam artist who takes advantage of a great opportunity to steal a contract from his prison doctor. He retired to California to begin his work by giving advice on a radio show posing as Dr. Lawrence Baird. The only person who knows himself as an impostor is the drunken priest (Walter Matthau) who comes to be pampered by the new wealth of Ackroyd who has blamed him. Charles Grodin also performs well. For its genre, I think this film deserves the same credibility as "Ferris Bueller" or "Trading Places". 7.5 / 10
