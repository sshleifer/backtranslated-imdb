The Ascension (1977) <br /> <br /> Larisa Shepitko is a name that very few people know. Her brilliant career as a director lasted only a decade and ended abruptly with a tragic car accident. Despite her short career, she managed to create some of the best Soviet films of her day. His latest film, The Ascent, is widely regarded as one of the best Soviet films of the 1970s. Nevertheless, his work remained in obscurity for the ensuing years, usually only available on rare, mediocre copies on video . This has now changed thanks to the people of Criterion. They published two of Shepitko's best works in their department Eclipse - Wings and his penultimate masterpiece, The Ascent. <br /> <br /> Placed during the darkest days of the Second World War in snow-capped rural Russia, two supporters are forging their way in search of food after their party was attacked by Nazi patrols. They are originally only to go to a nearby farm, but when they arrive, they find it razed by the Germans. Not wanting to return empty-handed, they continue their way deeper into enemy territory. Along the way, they must confront not only enemy soldiers, but also the harsh conditions of the Russian plains, a potential betrayal and their own soul. <br /> <br /> The film does not fall into a conspiracy or simplistic destinations. He tackles difficult issues with painful rationality. It never takes the easy way or gives us comforting answers. The second half of the film is filled with moral dilemmas. Shepitko shows us the intimate horrors of war through the internal conflict between his Russian counterparts - those who collaborated and those who fought back. Although she clearly shows the collaborators, she nevertheless explains why many have turned to such tactics: survival. <br /> <br /> The film contains a number of religious references, especially as we approach the crucifixion. It is a spiritual journey in the hearts, souls, and minds of both followers and those they meet. Shepitko and his director of photography capture the trip by shooting in black and white. The camera moves in long shots, like the photographic work of another of the greatest Russian filmmakers, Andrei Tarkovsky. Shepitko, like many others, was clearly influenced by Tarkovsky's style, and the ascent resumes some of his rhythmic notes from Ivan's childhood. It's a stunning film to watch and it does a fantastic job capturing the cold and terrifying atmosphere of occupied Russia. <br /> <br /> Shepitko's husband would pay tribute to his great film a decade later. Elem Klimov created his own masterpiece of war with one of the greatest films I have ever seen, Come and See. The story and themes of this film have clearly been influenced by The Ascent. Although this film is also rather obscure, it has attracted much more attention than any Shepitko film. It did, however, serve as a bridge to Shepitko and was one of the best ways to keep his work alive. <br /> <br /> The ascent is a truly magnificent film, and should rightly be considered one of the best movies of the 70's It's superb cinematography is inspiring; his mood is frightfully authentic; and his lessons are unforgettable. Whatever the definition of the word, it is nothing less than a masterpiece. What a misfortune that Shepitko's career was interrupted just as it was reaching its peak.
