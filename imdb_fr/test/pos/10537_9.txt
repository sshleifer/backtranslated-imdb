I saw this at the Tribeca Film Festival, in the family section. I'm not sure if one of my children really had the film, but I have to say it was a wonderful short film. <br /> <br /> 'Nostradamus and I' is an interesting short film about the hopes and fears we all felt growing up in the 1980s, which extends to what my kids are feeling today. Then we had Regan, today we had Bush. Instead of nuclear war, we have terrorism. <br /> <br /> I really identified with the main character and I myself came out of a "Curehead" in high school. We all felt like nothing at the age of 16, but it's great to see a movie where they find everything counts! <br /> <br /> Again, I probably would not have put that in the family section. There were too many cursed words for young children, but it was a wonderful and enjoyable movie to watch.
