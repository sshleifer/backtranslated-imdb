"Here On Earth" is an amazing, beautiful romantic story about Samantha, who has health problems and boy problems. While her love for her current boyfriend, Jasper, fades, her love for Kelley blossoms like a new springtime flower. <br /> <br /> I found this film very touching, very warm, very romantic and touching. I enjoyed every clip of this movie ... and it's pretty rare! I highly recommend this movie to all moviegoers! It is a film not to be missed !!! : D <br /> <br /> By the way ... if you are a very sentimental person who cries easily while watching movies, bring some fabrics !!! By cons, it was really a very good movie! Very romantic ... and surprisingly good !!! : D <br /> <br />
