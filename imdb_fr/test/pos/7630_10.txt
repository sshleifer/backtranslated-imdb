Prepare to meet your Messiah - they call him Masten Thrust. Male models have become increasingly difficult to find in today's overexposed society. Every two days, a related model is forced to apologize in tears for juvenile indiscretion or he innocently drank some on his ranch. The Last Dinosaur is the story of the last great hunt of Masten Thrust, a former big game hunter who plays the role of supreme model. Despite her haggard features and bulbous nose, women, including Joan Van Ark, are attracted to him, just as Meatloaf is to the words of cheese. Thrust is openly sexist and does not apologize for his elaborate lifestyle, which includes a red handkerchief and a private jet with a working fireplace. <br /> <br /> Thrust embarks on a mission to find and chase the last dinosaur on earth when Ironically, after a busy life, it is truly the last dinosaur. Despite her propensity to shout after everyone in her presence, her employees and her friends are loyal to her. He can act as if he is drunk, but make no mistake, if he calls you "Ding Dong", you are a "Ding Dong". <br /> <br /> Do not deprive yourself of your own ballad, Thrust's song shamelessly. praise him and his virility. A sample of lyrics includes: "Few men ever did, what he did, or even dreamed, what he dreamed / Few men even tried, what he tried, most men have failed, where he has conquered / The world holds nothing new in store for him, and the things that amaze us, make him only a nuisance / Few men have ever lived, he has lived or even the market where he walked. "Even the forbidden artist, BMTG, Clay Aiken crush those words and become a talking machine. <br /> <br /> Thrust and his team of scientists focus on the" Polar Borer " "With a mini bike helmet, although Thrust offers the luxury of the red scarf all around, its giant forest filled with human beings digs into the earth and ice to go out into a lagoon. of the earth soon fall on the scientists who force Thrust and his team to save their lives.After escaping a little dino, Masten c ouche and bursts of laughter, not so much to celebrate it but to recognize "the game is running". <br /> <br /> Shortly after, it is not surprising that we see some men slightly bent over the cavemen glancing at their visitors. Thrust, who does not just kill a dinosaur, decides to give himself the mission to attack a wide cave. Throughout the film, the only T-Rex contradicts the belief that dinosaurs have a brain the size of a peanut. Despite its huge size, the local T-Rex is able to stay close to its victims, almost unnoticed. With the surprise effect, T-Rex simply crushes a scientist or two and loots the campground. From time to time, one sees the throbbing and cagile push, screaming after someone, shooting something or flirting with a virile primitive J-Lo. <br /> <br /> The push resembles that of James Tiberius Kirk, not just his addiction. love, but also when it comes to making complex weapons using limited natural resources in a short time. Thrust and the other members of the team build a high-precision catapult that throws a big rock into the skull of the cunning T-Rex. Realizing that even him, Masten Thrust, can not avail himself of this addition to his trophy case, Thrust decides to stay in his prehistoric environment. The crew, more and more reduced, then let Thrust live her days with her charming, although a little gay, and introduces her to his personal collection of STDs. This is only a brief summary of a film so complex and rich in BMTG traditions that it takes several viewings to absorb his message and realize that Masten Thrust is the solution. The press conference, which includes a screaming spurt, rumors, and the introduction of the big Bunta, is a classic moment. Also look for a death-like body, Ricky Schroeder, lying on logs, and the most powerful use of someone called "Ding-Dong" in cinematic history.
