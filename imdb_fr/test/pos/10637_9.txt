I saw this film at the Toronto International Film Festival in 2001. The Pianist reinforces the thesis "Austrians = sinister" that I am formulating. Isabelle Huppert won a well-deserved Cannes award for best actress for her portrayal of a woman who, in her efforts to achieve the artistic ideal, loses her humanity. Trapped in her talent, she represses her emotions and sexuality until they can only be expressed in a twisted and terrifying way. When a young student falls in love with her, our hopes grow, but are quickly wiped out by the realization that she can not experience love like any other. It's too late for her and the heartbreaking last 30 minutes of the film are devoid of the beautiful music of the first 90 minutes. The message seems to be that music itself is not enough without the life and beauty it describes.
