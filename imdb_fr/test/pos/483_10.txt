I saw this for the first time on Thames TV and loved it. Later, I saw a terrible story from someone who had not watched or listened to it. So, I bought a copy, and then bought another copy! The only sad thing is that it is not available on PAL VHS or DVD Region 2. The Australian version is great, but this one is better! I could buy another one .............
