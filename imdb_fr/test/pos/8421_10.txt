This is a film about a six-year-old child from a village in Maharashtra (an Indian state) and his grandfather who come to Pune (a city in Maharashtra) to look after the child's eyes. Here, the grandfather learns that the child has cancer in both eyes and that they must be removed to save the life of the child. the film only deals with the main characters, their feelings and their actions until the operation. <br /> <br /> The film is not a clich√© typical of the Indians, so expect to see songs, novels or melodrama. This is a high-quality sensitive film that uses dumb expressions rather than dialogue to get the message across. attend the scene where the grandfather is informed of the need to remove the eyes of the child. the acting is superb, the dialogues are heartbreaking. your heart goes to the grandfather who has the unenviable task of talking about the operation to the child and his mother. <br /> <br /> the treatment of the subject was excellent. the film was done with great difficulty by the director, Sandeep Sawant, who had to knock on many doors to gather the RS. budget of six million (about $ 130,000). even then, the end product seems polite and has decent production values. Also witness the subtle contrast of the town's village presented by the director by incorporating random images of the boy's life in the village. Sawant definitely seems to prefer village life. <br /> <br /> Everyone's action is excellent. Amruta Subhash, as a social worker, is competent in adding the required human touch to her role. Sandeep Kulkarni as a doctor is great, showing the perfect manners of a doctor. Ashwin Chitale as a child is a natural. he does not seem to act. everything in him is natural and does not seem forced. <br /> <br /> But Arun Nalawade is the grandfather first and foremost. he is amazing in his role. mere words can not describe his work. It's a performance to cherish forever. <br /> <br /> Shwaas is a sincere effort to make good cinema. it should not be ignored simply because it shows that if things are simple, the results can be really surprising. 10/10.
