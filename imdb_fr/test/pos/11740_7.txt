After many years, I saw this beautiful love story and thought about how I would react, half a century later, to a film that made so many girls cry and sigh at that time, when I was a teenager trying to understand. the behavior of women, in a small town in Brazil. <br /> <br /> This time, however, what caught my attention in the film was very different, namely the insistence with which the doctor, Dr. Han Suyin (Jennifer Jones) the journalist Mark Elliott ( William Holden) clearly explained his particular ethical situation as a Eurasian. In fact, she is constantly emphasizing this point in their relationship, repeating that she is willing to assume her love for him and pursue him in a "Western" way, provided that she does not betray her Chinese side as well. . . It seems to the viewer that Suyin is eagerly striving to achieve a very subtle conciliation between these two unstable and opposing aspects of his culture, as they will immediately engage in a manifest conflict in his mind, at least in vain. <br /> <br /> Therefore, Suyin's attitudes still leave poor Elliott ?? a determined man, brave and extremely practical ?? worried and perplexed, without knowing how important it is to give to his words. For him, whose love for her is clear and simple, the situation is perfectly clear: if we love each other, let's make a couple and immediately start a life together. "Not so fast", it seems, verbally and non-verbally, answer him all the time. <br /> <br /> In fact, the Chinese side of Suyin would never allow him such a pragmatism. And, while reinforcing this much sought-after balance between her two worlds, she often points out to her that a very particular feature of Chinese culture is deeply rooted in her mind, namely the incessant "raids" on the real world by invisible beings of a spiritual or nonphysical world. For Suyin always alerts Elliott of the danger of life, not because of an objective and concrete threat (as would be the case of the perpetuation of English colonialism or the eminence of a Japanese invasion), but because of the threat of gods and other mystical and mythical beings to poor, fearful and vulnerable human beings. <br /> <br /> In fact, it seems that many Chinese deities are constantly watching to make people's lives totally miserable. Because of this, mothers have to dress their precious baby boys with girls' clothes so that they are not taken away by jealous gods; everyone should always be ready to make loud noises to keep the clouds away, so as to avoid covering the view of the moon; the peasants are informed that they must shout loudly: "The rice is bad! The rice is bad!" to protect their crops from being stolen by deities; and, at a burial, it is advisable to isolate the deceased's family from the curtains so that the gods do not take advantage of their grief and fragility. <br /> <br /> In other words, Suyin introduces us into a culture in which the supernatural has a real existence, as if a rather disturbing pantheon of diabolical and sadistic gods was always about to interfere negatively with the most banal acts of anyone's daily life. <br /> <br /> The story unfolding in Hong Kong in 1949, it is clear that China was at that time almost a semi-feudal society, while the country from which Elliott was born was not yet dominated by fierce capitalism, launched by the United States after the first oil shock in 1973, took over the world. Therefore, at least in one aspect, both sides of Suyin's Eurasian personality were still far more innocent than they would be today. <br /> <br /> A lot of history has been born since ancient times. With regard to China, the main fact is that, after several phases of a communist regime, the country has finally achieved, over the past two decades, the condition of a very aggressive economy much more accurately described as capitalism. State. And what happened to that old spirituality that captivated Suyin so much in Hong Kong in 1949 and with which she so impressed Elliott, passionate, under that tree on the hill behind the hospital? It's gone, completely gone! In summary, if this story happened today, Elliott would not need to travel to China to offer Suyin to introduce the Third Uncle and his entire family. In fact, the two men would now be incomparably closer to each other, in their great pragmatism, speaking as if nothing had happened!
