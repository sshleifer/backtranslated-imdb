I do not do a lot of reality, but it is exceptional because, in the end, the viewer draws something useful in addition to entertainment. I do not have children, but Super Nanny's lessons will be of great help when (and if) I'll do it one day! My only complaint is that the show has been diluted since it was in the United States. I prefer the British version, with a harder nanny approach. Is it just me or does anyone else think that the American version is a bit flexible ... now it's the "gentler, sweeter" nanny? I think we need a spoonful of sugar for the medicine to drop after all! Still, nothing wrong with a happy sappy ending, is it?
