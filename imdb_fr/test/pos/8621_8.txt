It is very difficult to find new information about JFK Jr. and this beautiful film contained very little, but it was a pleasure to watch. The cast was very good and the screenplay, although resembling a documentary, was also good. The only complaint I would make is that it was not long enough. Perhaps a two-part film could have told us more about his "pre-George" past and his relationship with his mother, sister, and other relatives. Certain elements of Richard Blow's book "American Son" would have greatly improved the film. WTBS should be applauded for producing such an entertaining film.
