"Hoppity Goes to Town" was the second and final feature film by Max and Dave Fleischer, who created a parallel universe to Disney. If we remember Disney movies today, the two films "The Gulliver's Travels" by Fleischer have been forgotten. <br /> <br /> "Hoppity" is a haunting original, not an adaptation like the first picture. This is a major asset, one might think. No, the critics, rarely on the Fleischers side, tore themselves up for that. Yes, the story is not as tight as "Gulliver", but how do you hate a movie that is so joyfully displayed? <br /> <br /> It is filled with great musical numbers and a very engaging story, which would be a crime to reveal. The characters are adorable and charming and there is heart in this film. <br /> <br /> The Fleischers have really outdone themselves here and have never completely redone it. Most of their time would be spent on reels once this week at the box office. It's a shame they did not continue to create features. Who knows? Their next attempt may have become the masterpiece they were aiming for. <br /> <br /> **** on 4 stars
