<br /> <br /> When I insensibly praised Thousand Acres, I thought I had an entertaining story of King Lear and of course, Michelle Pfeiffer was there, so what could go wrong? <br /> <br /> Very quickly, however, I realized that this story involved a thousand other things, apart from Acres. I started crying and I could not stop long after the movie ended. Thank you Jane, Laura and Jocelyn, for bringing us such a wonderful and compassionate film! Thank you actors, for your involvement and for portraying the characters with such depth and sweetness! <br /> <br /> I recognized the sister angry; sister Runaway and sister in Denial. I recognized the abusive husband and why he was there and then the Father, oh oh Father ... all of them played beautifully. I also recognized myself and this film was a revelation, a relief, a chance to face my own truth and finally do something about it. I sincerely hope that Mille Acres has had the same effect on others. <br /> <br /> Since I did not understand why the cover said that the movie was about sisters arguing over the land - they did not fight each other at all I watched it a second time. Then, I could see that if we had not lived a similar story, we would easily miss the underlying current crushing with terror and fear and the deep bond that unites all the sisters. This is exactly why people in general often forget the truth about their neighbors, for example. <br /> <br /> But that's another reason why this movie is so perfect! <br /> <br /> I do not do it. give a rat ass (sorry my French) about how much King Lear's story is followed. All I know is that I can honestly say that this movie changed my life. <br /> <br /> Keep up the good work, guys, you CAN and make a difference. <br /> <br />
