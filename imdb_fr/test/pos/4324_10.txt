First of all, I just have to say that I am a big fan of LOST. All those who make the show, I love them. Really, everything is in it. <br /> <br /> I'm glad they have great people, for example Jack Bender is the greatest director, well, maybe after J.J. Abrams. And of course, all the credit of Damon Lindelof & Carlton Cuse. They are geniuses. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the finale of season 2 is certainly one of the best episodes of LOST! Live Together, Die Alone focuses on the story of Desmond David Hume when he visited the island, and Henry Ian Cusick is so great to play this character! The directors of the series would have been very stupid if they would have let the elders die on us. <br /> <br /> Thus, in LOST, the survivors of the crash of the plane have been there for 65 days ... 65 days, man. Whileas Rousseau has been here for sixteen years, and the others have been there since God knows how long. Referring to Jeffrey Lieber, Lindelof & Abrams. Anyway, I hope we will have the answers we need, in season 3. You can not wait! My vote is new.
