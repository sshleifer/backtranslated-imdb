The opening scene of this movie is pretty amazing. I saw a number of sci-fi movies with great special effects, but my roommate and I looked at each other after the opening sequence and he clearly said "sensory overload". The plot of the film is quite simple, but the advantage of this sci-fi film is that it lets the audience understand the essence of the technology instead of wasting time to explain it "subtly". The creatures of this movie are also very interesting. You will not really see them before about two-thirds of the course. All in all, a very entertaining movie.
