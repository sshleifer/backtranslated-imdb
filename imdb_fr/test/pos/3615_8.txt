At first, I did not like this movie, but as it progressed, it became better and better. I love music and I was impressed by Cage's ability to simulate the movements of the mandolin. My son was with me and he also loves the movie a lot for his music, his story and the way the story unfolded - slowly showing how Corelli won the hearts of girls. The acting and the story were well done and well directed. At first, Corelli's bravado was irritating, but he quickly grew up for you. The twists in the plot intrigued especially the relations with the Germans. I would like to see this again to follow all the side plots. I also want to buy the soundtrack to replay the music.
