I first saw it on the big screen with my girlfriend. It was a fun party with cool music. Kristine was on the cover of Playboy and the central page, if I remember correctly. She is really cute and cheerful and has a lot of charm. The film made me want to see her more often so I kept an eye on her for other things. She is in Steven Spielberg's "I Wanna Hold Your Hand", Barbara Streisand's "The Main Event" and Bill Murray's "Meatballs", as well as in many TV shows like Night Court and his films. My friends and I really appreciate it. But her main role in Alice in Wonderland is at the center of attention, with Kristine being the center of attention, probably the sexiest girl I've ever seen in the movies.
