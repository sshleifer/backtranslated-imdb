Mishima - a life in four chapters is in my opinion the best Paul Schrader film to date. The mesmerizing cinematography, accompanied by the mystical score of Philip Glass, added a totally magical aura to the story of one of Japan's greatest novelists, whose originality and picturesque narrative are beautifully depicted in this picture. Like any gifted person, Mishima was preoccupied with serious personal conflicts, the main one of which was the conflict between "the pen and the sword", as the director put it in his last chapter, or the struggle between the a poet who is sensitive to homosexual feelings, living in a notoriously masculine society with secular warrior traditions, thus widening the gap between the sensitive and the militant side of Mishima himself. <br /> <br /> All Schrader's films (and those for which he writes scripts) are essentially stories This also applies to Mishima, who, apart from the education of Japanese military schools, is educated with a love for the theater and the words. His passing was marked by these two key moments of his life, namely the words and theatrical end of a play. A movie like this happens from time to time, and most will have to wait all their lives to reach that beauty. 20 out of 10 !!
