Although I agree that it was a 1950s sitcom, I do not think it's "typical". First, Donna Reed was a STRONG woman, unlike the mothers of the 50s sitcom. She defended the value and equality of women (remember the episode where the TV presenter said "just a housewife ") and Donna defended all women and all women, especially those who do not work outside? And when the women rebelled against something in the series, it was not trivial ... it was always something that showed women had the right to be treated with the same respect as women. men. Do not forget that Donna Reed was married to the producer of the show and had a lot more to contribute to making her character a more powerful character. <br /> <br /> Children were smart, but not early. They were normal children. And they could ACT. <br /> <br /> Another element that made the Donna Reed Show special was not only to watch the children, like their parents, but also to feel the chemistry between all the actors of the real situation, who then came out in the characters. Shelly Fabares and Paul Peterson often wrote and noticed that they were treated like the children of Donna Reed and Carl Betz, and that the adults fiercely protected the child actors and treated them accordingly. Donna and Alex also had some sort of sexual chemistry that was not seen on the other shows of the family. And the characters could be imperfect, and in a major way, and yet accepted for flaws and errors. They were not super parents who did not hurt and had no emotional ups and downs. They were normal people acting like normal people. <br /> <br /> Women's rights, drug addiction, abused children, single father, poverty, children who need quality health care but can not afford it ... everything has been shown on this show . Nice revolutionary for the time. <br /> <br /> Donna Reed's show did not last eight years for no reason. And it might have lasted if Tony Owens and Donna Reed had not divorced. <br /> <br /> This show is very underrated and should be presented in a way that other generations can appreciate the quality. <br /> <br /> In summary, I agree with the original poster, which is obviously about the show, but I think Donna Reed's show has so much more to offer than casual entertainment.
