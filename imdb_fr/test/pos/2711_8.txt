There's a clever little scene in The Karen Carpenter Story, where the two carpenters are in a recording studio, and Richard makes an impromptu decision to blackmail Karen for the studio owner. <br /> Richard chooses the wrong key for Karen to sing, so Karen sings over her natural range. You can see a look of perplexity on the owner's face; he supposes that she really does not know how to sing. Richard quickly realizes his mistake and tries again a different key. The next thing you hear is Karen's amazing and beautiful voice, and the owner makes a priceless double take. Well done! For some reason, I have never forgotten this scene. <br /> <br /> Karen Carpenter's story tells of Carpenters' meteoric rise and Karen's struggle to overcome anorexia. Many things are ignored. It's not a documentary and the film left me a lot of questions. There is very little talk about Karen's solo adventure (the CD was released only a few years ago, so if you buy it, you'll wonder why they waited.) It's one of Karen's best works. The songs are not as timeless as his work with his brother Richard, but it was a good recording, in my opinion). <br /> <br /> I heard that you can listen to a cheap and worn-out radio in the middle of the third world, it would seem to be more static than anything else. But when a Carpenter song is played on the radio, you might think you're listening to a $ 1,000 Hi-Fidelity unit. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie!
