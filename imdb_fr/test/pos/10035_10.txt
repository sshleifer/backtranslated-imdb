The film is excellent. One of the most remarkable things about this is that Flynn's performance is superb. This is worth emphasizing, as he has often been ridiculed as an actor by Bette Davis and his collaborators. Little big horn. The cold, calculating look on Flynn's face is extraordinary. He is much better than Spencer Tracy or many other well-vaunted stars. P. Huntley Jr as Lt "Queen's Own" Butler. The reason he stopped making films is disconcerting - it might have been thought that he would have been created for years later as a character actor.
