The melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya is based on a rather flattering formula of dramatic cartoon at the Japanese school. The formula looks a little like this: <br /> <br /> 1. The main protagonist comes from the outside world of normal society and has super powers. <br /> <br /> 2. There is a very beautiful and sexy girl in a secondary role. <br /> <br /> 3. There is a normal character who shares the main role in the story. <br /> <br /> 4. Unusual things happen in a usual social context. <br /> <br /> 5. Sometimes the story is about the main protagonist and the normal character who connects to the existence or destruction of the world. <br /> <br /> 6. Nobody makes absolutely any effort to get all the magic powers. They just have it. <br /> <br /> 7. Usually, people who are not part of this nit group are not aware of their super powers and continue their daily lives. <br /> <br /> You are there. The melancholy of Suzumiya Haruhi is made in this spirit that has become the hit formula of comics and cartoons in Japan. Even if it follows a classic formula, the series is beautifully designed and the episodes are always placed in an interesting fall in the normal social conditions, which always turn into unusual circumstances surrounding Haruhi Suzumiya. Every actor in history brings an unusual insight into everyday life that we are not usually aware of. The philosophical turn of their ideas is what makes this series very entertaining. The visuals are first-rate and beautifully made. <br /> <br /> The crazy ideas that Haruhi always seems to offer, as well as the complicated parameters of the story, can give you headaches from time to time. The fact that the episodes are played out of sequence complicates things further, which adds to the confusion. When I watched the episodes of the chronological sequence, some of the plots finally made sense. I recommend that you do the same. It's a lot more fun to watch the show this way. Google <br /> <br /> List_of_The_Melancholy_of_Haruhi_Suzumiya_episodes <br /> <br /> for the correct sequence of all episodes. And oh, you may notice the headache while you watch this, as I did. Let me know if you had it too.
