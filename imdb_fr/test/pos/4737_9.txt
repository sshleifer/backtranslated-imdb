Waco: Rules of Engagement is very good at not drawing conclusions for its viewers. It simply presents interviews, images of confrontation, images of congressional hearings, telephone conversations, expert testimony, and so on. and allows you to draw your own conclusion. <br /> <br /> Here everything has been done with 100% objectivity, but it's very convincing. You will not like Koresh after seeing this before, but I tend to think that you will come to believe, as I do now, there are many things that have not been told to us about happened before and during the impasse.
