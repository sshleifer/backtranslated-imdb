Like all other Mel Brooks comedies, Men in Tights is hilarious. But considering this as a scandalous comedy, I think many do not realize that the movie is so funny because the characters themselves are so well played. Elwes is the well-spoken former British nobleman, Lewis is an eternally upset king (I hope it's all worth the NOOOOOOIIIISE!), DeLuise is a fantastic godfather, Roger Rees is a worried and cynical sheriff .... The actors and the actresses are so faithful to their roles that the jokes flow with ease. Yes, we have already seen this kind of comedy, but the only comedy allowing a better development of the character, in my opinion, is The Big Lebowski. Very very funny.
