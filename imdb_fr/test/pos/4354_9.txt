Although perhaps less entertaining than some of Herzog's works, Little Dieter is another good movie from one of the world's greatest film artists. Departing from the usual themes of Herzog, Little Dieter is a fascinating and uplifting character study about a brave man and his efforts to continue living after a traumatic experience. <br /> <br /> Dieter Dengler wanted to fly from an early age. The war with Viet Nam gave him the opportunity, but instead of putting the war in a cockpit, he spent most of his life as a prisoner of war. Dieter tells the essence of his story with eloquence and passion, with the occasional help of Herzog. Herzog makes very few voices during this period, but brings many subtle and powerful sound and visual effects - which should not surprise those who know him well. <br /> <br /> Dengler is a fascinating and extremely friendly person. As humane and as alive as they come, I found the story of his life and his incredibly inspiring optimistic personality. Thanks to Herzog for having it (re) presented. <br /> <br /> The scale of the film is not as broad, and the drama is not as fierce as many of the early films that made Herzog a force counted with. Nevertheless, I highly recommend it to its fans and those who like documentaries. It's a very interesting and well-executed film.
