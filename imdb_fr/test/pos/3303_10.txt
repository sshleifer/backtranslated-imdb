The best of everything. What is the best of everything? It's different for everyone but for most of us it's love. But alas, not everyone knows where and to whom to turn for true love. This story goes from the search for love. Sometimes in all the wrong places and for all the wrong reasons. But as the saying goes, "we are captains of our own ships" and so are our lives. We are responsible for the choices we make in our lives. Once we make these choices, we must live with them. As we look at this story and see these women making choices that will probably change their lives forever, we wonder if we would make the same choices as these women or would we be wiser? Who knows?
