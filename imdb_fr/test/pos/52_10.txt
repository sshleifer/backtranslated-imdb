It's a must-see movie. You'll laugh, you'll cry, and when it's over, you'll want more. Well written and convincing, this film attracts you and holds strong. The cast was perfect, the characters determined and the performances outstanding. "Nanny" is the standard to which all women should stand: strong, indulgent, protective and never critical. "Nanny" is for me the embodiment of what a Christian mother and a woman should be: a true pillar of the community. If I were half of the woman "Nanny", I would consider myself well. I would have been devastated if "Nanny" had died at some point in the movie, but since she did not do it, I will definitely buy it when it comes out on DVD. I only hope that the story will continue and that Ruben will return to Lackawanna to try to rebuild the city piece by piece and person by person.
