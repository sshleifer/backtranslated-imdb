I saw the beginning of the movie Muppet, but just half. Because I only looked at Mrs. Kelly's friend. The songs were the best and the Muppets were so hilarious. They learn that if they believe that at the end of the rainbow, everyone can do it, regardless of its size, regardless of its nature (which was included in the trailer). <br /> <br /> Kermit is my favorite protagonist (meaning he describes the main character) and so are the other Muppets. Mel Brooks was amazing when he played Professor Max Krassman. The scene where Miss Piggy saves Kermit by doing Kung Fu to these guys. It was so cool. <br /> <br /> The Muppet movie is Jim Henson's best film with the most hilarious characters and people cherished for his hit movie.
