I saw this movie when it came out and I never forgot it. My uncle Antoine is much, much bigger than the sum of his parts. The film is vaguely about a pre-teen who is sent to live with a parent in a small town in Canada. There are adventures that seem more or less typical but below there is a current building. MUA has a quiet pace, but be patient, the reward is coming. I think the film was subtitled and, like all the non-English films I've seen, it's best to avoid any dubbed versions. The dubbed films inevitably reflect the attitudes of a new director and actors, with the added need for synchronized lines on the lips that do not quite fit. The English Amarcord is a parody, for example, while the subtitled version sings. My uncle Antoine is well worth the time to find him and watch him in French.
