Soap is an interesting and very brilliant film at times. You must look at it for its strong characterization and the risks that the plot takes about two troubled individuals who fall in love. You must know the story through various critics, so let's talk about what's brilliant in this movie. <br /> <br /> First, the two protagonists are so real and so fascinating. The first is a woman who has given up a four-year relationship and is angry enough to sleep with someone who looks like her. The second is a man who has always wanted to be a woman and whose pain and loneliness are expressed with such sensitivity and brilliance. You hate the first and your heart bleeds for the second. <br /> <br /> The second thing about this movie is the whole concept of loving someone for who you are, regardless of sex. So, would you still like your partner if he / she had to change sex? The film explores this idea and is beautiful. <br /> <br /> But there is a point where the film fails. I hope that the relationship between the protagonists has developed better. What they feel is that love does not manifest itself until the end. But look at it and post here your thoughts .......
