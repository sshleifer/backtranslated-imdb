Errol Flynn at his best as Robin Hood of the West, fighting against the military bureaucracy, the Confederates, the Indians and the carpetbagger business scammers until the end of his great and ultimate end. Not to mention the very reliable O. de Havilland as Lady Mary of the West. Never try to relate this story to facts and real people, it does not work. Enjoy it, because no one has ever claimed to make a documentary when Raoul Walsh and Errol Flynn collaborated.
