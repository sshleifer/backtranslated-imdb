The UK's funniest film I've ever seen, "The Supergrass" is a story of sex, drugs, creamed teas and murder at the seaside. Dennis Carter (Adrian Edmonson), Mean idiot, wants to impress his so-called girlfriend, Andrea (Dawn French), because she thinks he's too law-abiding. So, to bring her on a romantic getaway with him, he offers a program that may impress him and inspire him to spend time with him. The problem is that Dennis's lie is that he was somehow involved in an international drug ring and, while telling him, a couple of police officers heard his boasting and hit him. That's how this witty movie begins, full of subtle comedies and crude jokes. Dennis is stuck in the local nickname and, to the officers' great happiness arrest, there seems to be no way out (Andrea's previous attempts to explain that this was a lie were dismissed by a hilarious melody of "Stand by Your Man" by both officers). Next is Commander Robertson (Ronald Allen), chief of intelligence, Scotland Yard. He concludes an agreement with Dennis that if he helps him catch the drug traffickers, he will be released and as he pleases. Dennis agrees and teams up with Harvey Duncan (Peter Richardson) and Lesley Reynolds (Jennifer Saunders). The rest is an unforgettable palpitation experience, with Robbie Coltrane in the role of Sergeant Troy adding a humorous color to the film. His walk along the dry dock against "The Two Frankie Tribes Goes to Hollywood" is superb and is probably the best scene in the history of cinema. Michael Elphick and Patrick Durkin play marvelously well with the two officers who nicknamed Dennis. Alexei Sayle plays the role of the policeman of the bike! If you want something good to watch on a Saturday night, I suggest you rent it. You will not forget it!
