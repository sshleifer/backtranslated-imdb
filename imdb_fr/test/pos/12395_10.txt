First, I noticed this movie 10/10. For me, it's just one of the best I've seen since I was born (I'm 23, but I've seen many movies). The story is cruel, but the reality is too. It penetrated deep inside me and stirred my bowels. I saw it about 5 or 6 years ago and it still shakes me - and I still remember it! <br /> <br /> Secondly, there is no "national preference" (this expression is a direct translation of French) for this film. I mean, it's not because it's a French film that I put it so high: it really caught me when I saw it. Also, I do not know Marcel Carne's filmography well, so I do not know if it's his best film or not, but I know it's not his most famous movie: HÃ´tel du Nord, Quai des Mists and Les Enfants du Paradis are the most famous. <br /> <br /> Third, the film is in black and white, but it deals with the intertemporal problems of youth (not acne) like love, friends and studies in a modern way. It could even be redone image by image with real young actors, a Dolby sound (tm) and special effects (a car accident), it would always be a good movie! <br /> <br /> Problem: Maybe it's a movie to see by young adults (from 16 to 25 years old) - and above all, of course - so that its message is well understood ... I say it was a good movie?
