The greatest tragedy man faces is the one who, so often capable of the divine, settles down for the mundane. As a result, such great tragedies emerge. Death in Venice is one of the few films with the patience and courage to tackle this fact. He confronts the human eye with beauty and inspiration in their two most inevitable human forms: self-denial and decay. This is without a doubt the biggest film to have no significant influence on traditional cinema. His refined austere look, his sonic echoes, his mix of languages ​​without subtitles and his themes extremely difficult to reproduce are impossible to reproduce: as much an accident of his particular production as the vision of his director. Central performance, at once rigid, aroused and vulnerable to expression and decadence, highlights Bogarde as if he were not the best British actor of his generation, so certainly the most adventurous. Able to keep sympathy as his desires captivate him and make him interesting despite the endless plans and Mahler scoring him above. Not a Friday night with your girlfriend, but certainly OK if you want to explore the limits of human spiritual limitation.
