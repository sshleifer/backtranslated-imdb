I would give this movie a 8.5 or a 9. I thought it was just hilarious, I do not know how we could not think this movie was funny, but the only thing that disappointed me was that There was a little too much raw stuff. because personally, I think when they take off bicycles and things like that, it's a lot funnier, but I'm sure there are people who think the other things are very funny, so it's not what I want, but anyway, it's a good movie, go see it and after you must buy too if you do not like this movie because I'm sure a lot of People think that this film shows how bad our society is or it does not matter, it's just my personal opinion and you have yours. the jackass casket is also something worthy of being downloaded or purchased or whatever you do to get your videos
