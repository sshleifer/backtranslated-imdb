H.O.T.S. is not for those who want hardcore porn. Instead, this film is a forerunner of many classic films like college and university cult movies, such as REVENGE OF THE NERDS and PORKY'S, and a post-cursor of the world-renowned ANIMAL HOUSE. A good time if you like a lot of 70s / 80s Playboy girls and a cheezy slap-dick comedy - but nothing if you want to use it as a base material ... <br /> <br /> > HOTS is an "unauthorized" sorority of sexy outcasts fighting against Pi's popular and trendy girls. He has pranks, a housekeeper Aunt Jemima-ish, and even an overheated robot that makes him relatively amusing to watch if fools are your "thing" ... <br /> <br /> Well ... I like breasts too (or probably more ...) than the next guy - but with all the ladle sh! I did not see, I could not help but wish some hardcore scenes to make this one really worth it. I knew it would not happen, but I still hope H.O.T.S. had a little more sex and a little less cheeze. Not quite as remarkable as NERDS, PORKY'S or ANIMAL HOUSE, but worth a look for fans of these types of movies ... 7/10 <br /> <br /> PS ... and I I forgot - this one has a shower consumed Danny Bonaduce is probably the best role of his career apart from his "reality show" ...
