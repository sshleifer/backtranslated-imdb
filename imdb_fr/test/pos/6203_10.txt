A drama, suspense and developments of character that you would appreciate if you like the drama that engages you and entertains as well as educates. <br /> <br /> The authors know their material and it shows. Management is always engaging and not blazing, and the acting is great. The reason this series has not won any awards tells me that the "powers" in Hollyweird do not experience drama or much else. <br /> <br /> There is a twisting of the plot in this episode in the end was a complete surprise and was very well played. I'm glad it was not used as a shock scene for a climatic end of this series that would have been more typical and dull. Rent this series at once! Hope his return from celluloid extinction.
