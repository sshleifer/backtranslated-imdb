This show is amazing! I like every episode. Carrie is a fire eater and Doug is an adorable and sometimes stupid man. Arthur, Spence, Danny, Deacon and Carrie's boss just add a finishing touch to the show, featuring all the fun moments, pee in your pants. In one of the seasons, Doug tries to make Carrie drink, because she is nicer when she is drunk. Good husband, right? Carrie does not do much better, when her boss needs an IPS driver to testify in a small business at her job, Carrie hesitates, as she considers Doug a loafer and does not want him to embarrass her, so she engage his friend. . Wife of the year. But who I think is the funniest, shouts Arthur at random. He is hilarious and angry. Hey, you would be too if you were living in a basement where the mold has a funny smell and makes you dizzy. This show is hilarious, and if you have not seen it yet, you have not lived!
