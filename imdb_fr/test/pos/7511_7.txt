this movie is funny funny funny my favorite quote from the movie "I think I saw a half-naked Indian in my room last night" answer "it was not a hallucination, it was an Indian in your room" and another is "what the hell are you talking about but what are you talking about?" but if ever I'm admitted to a hospital like this, I'll be ready to write my will on the spot ... I would say that there were in my opinion three very amusing characters in this funniest movie, but three is the funniest for me even if their replicas were few ... and do not throw me on the patient who cracks, hehehe, this- there that I will keep secret too.
