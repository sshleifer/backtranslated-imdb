Although I know the poet Dylan Thomas very well, I do not know anything about his life. Whatever his life and especially his marriage, I imagine that The Edge of Love manipulates things a bit, but unless you're a historian or a poet, you care. <br /> <br /> The film is less about Thomas than about the two most important women in his life. One is his wife Kathrine, and the other is Vera who was his first love. A romantic night on the beach as a youngster is one thing that both have tried to put behind them but can not, now grown up, they are good friends. I forgot to mention that this happens during the war. Vera becomes engaged to Captain Will Killing, who puts her pregnant and leaves for the war. During her absence, Vera begins to fall for Thomas and Kathrine has fallen in love with him. She is also carrying another man's child. Things get even more emotional when Capt Killig comes back <br /> <br /> As you can see, this is a very theatrical scenario and takes shape in a slow and magical way, with perhaps too many sequences of sands dialogue. But not everything is lost yet. For a non-Hollywood production, I think Edge of Love is as elegant as possible. It is certainly more dimensional and intelligent than about 90% of contemporary novels, whether they are produced in Hollywood or not. This is partly because it takes place during the war, which creates a more compelling and less artificial emotional conflict, much like the atonement. it features a talented actor and cinematographer equal to Joe Wright's Oscar nominations, but the need for steady stimulation and progression is much greater. Things go well at the beginning and end, but the middle part indicates where your attention can be put to the test, unless you are deeply and deeply rooted in the story. <br /> <br /> I doubt that The Edge of Love has this kind of effect on the viewer, but it's a good movie to check. it could even make a good dating movie, knowing he's so much smarter than the girls' movies that little friends are forced to bear today.
