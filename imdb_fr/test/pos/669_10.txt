the fact that there has been so much noise is ironic, the aim of the program being to shed light on how the media deals with such "taboo" topics, such as pedophilia. the set of press, the costumes, the insignificant presenters, the men on the scene shouting above all you can see behind them, the useless graphs and statistics of CGI, all this was a satire, a satire very very funny . how c-list celebrities will say absolutely anything if their agent tells them it will be beneficial for their career ("nothing proves it, but it's a scientific fact"). It may be hard to watch (with Milly Dowler and the cambridgeshire girls, as well as September 11th), but satire is supposed to be a challenge and we should not be afraid to stand up against the blatant alarmist media and titling, just because it's a tricky business. It is shameful to see how this show has won no awards on television for its intelligence, observation, courage, action, and provocation, but it is not surprising.
