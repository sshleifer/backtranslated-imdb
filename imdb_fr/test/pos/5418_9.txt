Man I'm happy, I can leave comments for this draft of 10 minutes. I love it. <br /> <br /> After not seeing it for years, I fell on it the other day and watched it again and again. <br /> <br /> "Stop shaking your eyes" and "shake a rock and roll band 'and' stop sawing the table 'freaking classic lines. <br /> <br /> Art is deliciously The rare and wonderful dialogue, find it and love it, I can not recommend it too much. <br /> <br /> Thank you, Ms. Kogan, visual arts teacher in high school, for showing us this again and again. Thanks again to the NFB for letting it go, thanks to MTS for showing it (for free at least for now). <br /> <br /> I want a Big Snit t-shirt now. would love a cell animation, but at 440.00 hours, it will not happen. <br /> <br /> Find this movie and watch it.
