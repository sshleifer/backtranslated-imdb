This almost ignored masterpiece is to make the Monkeys aware that they are fictional characters in a movie (Head) and that everything they said or said had already been written in a script (invisible) that they seem to follow. Head was written by Jack Nicholson, Rafelson and Peter Tork on a three-day trip to LSD in a suite at an expensive hotel in Hollywood. The other three Monkees only acted on it. <br /> <br /> They fight against this in any way possible by doing things that are not in the script. They deliberately graze their lines, move away from sets, tear sets, hit other actors without reason; and finally, commit suicide by jumping off a bridge. <br /> <br /> For example, in the fast flashes of a psychedelic party scene, if you watch frame by frame, you can see Rafelson sitting next to the camera and cameraman, deliberately projecting himself into a mirror. It reveals that the party is actually a counterfeit and that it is filmed in a studio with actors who suddenly leave their character and move away in the middle of a conversation when the director shouts "cut!" <br /> <br /> Monkeys, however, never leave their characters, because these characters are also what they really are. It ends up being the heart of the coming revelation. <br /> <br /> At each turn, they realize that their increasingly strange actions were exactly what they were supposed to do in the written film, they could not escape reality. You say they went crazy and walked in the sky (which turned out to be painted on paper and suspended from the ceiling as the backdrop of the decor)? No problem! Hey, hey, these are the Monkees, and those crazy guys are still aping! <br /> <br /> In the end, even their death did not free them. This is how the film was to end. Their motionless, waterlogged bodies are retrieved from the river, placed in another box, and stacked in a film studio warehouse until characters are needed again for the studio's production. <br /> It's all the more moving because the Monkees are really fictional characters who have interfered with the real world. They did it by the power of their music. <br /> <br /> Ironically, towards the end, Peter Tork has what he rightly regards as an extremely deep revelation that solves his problem, but unfortunately, no one listens to it. <br /> <br /> Peter realizes: "It does not matter if we are in the box (the movie)". It means that it does not matter whether the will is free or illusory, and that "the only important thing to do is to let the present moment happen and to happen ... We just have to leave" now "HAPPEN, as happens ", without analyzing, evaluating or judging whether the experience is" valid "according to an abstract definition. <br /> <br /> When you can not even tell the difference, to be free or not important does not matter - to know if you are the "right", it's just a loss of unnecessary time. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie at a very important moment in my life. I was trying to figure out how to escape the "geek and scary nerd" by thinking intensely instead of just having fun (like sex) like everyone else. But the revelation in Head broke the recursive trap I had imposed on myself and helped me more than Nicholson or Nicholson would ever know. <br /> <br /> For decades, I watched "Head" and wished I could thank Pete. . <br /> <br /> Was it a good movie? <br /> <br /> Uh, why not, like ... <br /> <br /> == <YES> ==
