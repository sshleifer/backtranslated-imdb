I saw this film for the first time by chance when I visited my uncle in Arizona about 3 years ago. The VHS print was a little faded, but I was very haunted by what I had watched. Did all this make sense? Well, honestly, no. However, it is a movie that requires more than one view to understand all its aspects. The beautiful tragic score haunted me and the weird images were silent. <br /> <br /> Well, when I heard that Anchor Bay had released this quirk on DVD, I immediately took it. I was very happy with the transfer, even though the extras I missed a bit. Although the film is about the characters "O" and Sir Stephen, it really has nothing to do with Pauline Reage's original novel or with the movie The Story of O from 1974. However, the film takes into account the artistic and symbolism of an almost mystical kind. . "O" decides to prostitute himself for Sir Stephen in the 1920s in Hong Kong. His mission is to prove his endless dedication and love for his master by giving his body to other men. Naturally, Sir Stephen likes to watch her during her unpleasant sexual escapades and even finds herself a mistress. However, the roles are reversed when "O" actually finds a kind of love with a young male admirer. Suddenly, Sir Stephen feels the threat ... <br /> <br /> I feel that the film's deep meaning (including the tragic score and the artistic direction) makes this film a classic. The viewer is introduced not only to the life and past of brothelmates of "O", but to the turmoil of the 1920s in Hong Kong. Like the political context, prostitutes all need membership. Nobody is happy in the movie, even if they believe it. (However, "O" finds a sense of happiness with her young admirer). A prostitute remembers in tears the way her father acted like a dog when she was drunk, which naturally led to a fetish for making his clients act like a dog. Another older prostitute is obsessed with her past as an actress. She can not let this vision go. She treats her clients as co-stars and even swears to hear a piano in the river. <br /> <br /> As for "O", she has a flashback on the fact that her father leaves her in a circle of chalk. When he leaves, she feels a sense of abandonment. Of course, in the same flashback, Kinski becomes his father. I was very disturbed by this picture. I really felt for "O" at this stage of the film. She almost never smiles and this scene really explains why. Her fear of abandonment is so great that she considers Sir Stephen as her father and responds to all her obscene demands in the hope of proving her love. <br /> <br /> Another curious aspect of the film is the young child (who is aging at the end) who sells his fortune in a box. It's a very random character, but in a way it only adds to the sense of loss and emptiness in the film. At one point, the director even uses painted cardboard figurines to represent people. Now, if it's not symbolism for you! (Laughter) <br /> <br /> In total, I really like this movie. I think it is a very profound and somewhat moving experience. There are erotic scenes, but the scenes are not really meant to spark. Like the lives of the characters, the sexual acts are empty. They are movements, but they lack feeling and tenderness. (Again, the only sensitive scene is between "O" and the young man). "O" thinks that she is in love and that lowering herself is an honor, but she ends up having a choice. She too can be her own person and pursue her own happiness, but she also has the opportunity to stay in the circle that her father has drawn. The director leaves many questions unanswered, however, some things do not need answers. The spectator will make the judgment that suits them. <br /> <br /> I must say that I want a special edition of this DVD to be published with the director's comments. I think it would be fascinating to hear his opinion of the film and its message years later. It's a shame that the soundtrack has never been published. This film has a really mesmerizing and heartbreaking score. There is something in the persistent voice that makes my back cold. I can really feel the feeling of loneliness in the movie by simply listening to the music.
