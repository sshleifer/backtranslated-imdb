One of the genres that flourished in the 1930s was the variant of crime fiction known as the "mystery of murder," adding sounds to movies to help make the movie more faithful to what the audience lived in the original rooms. And as horror films were very popular in those years, reinforcing the horror elements of the intrigues, murder movies enjoyed a popularity almost equal to that of the previous decade (during which the first films of the kind have been produced). The beautiful playwright Charles Belden saw in this renewed interest in the mysteries of murder an opportunity to make his name after Warner Bros. chose his three-act play, "The Wax Works," to create the 1933 horror movie, "Mystery of the Wax." Museum. "Belden joined independent director Frank R. Strayer to continue making films, and" The Ghost Walks "was one of his best. <br /> <br /> In" The Ghost Walks ", John Miljan plays the role of Prescott Ames, a young playwright wants to impress a famous Broadway producer named Herman Wood (Richard Carle) with his new play Ames takes Wood and his assistant Homer (Johnny Arthur) to his country house for a reading of his room, but his car ends up bogged down in the mud during a terrible storm.The three men ask for asylum in an old manor belonging to one of the old acquaintances of Ames In the house, Wood and Homer are witnesses to the strange relationship between Ames and the owners of the house, however, this is a plan designed to impress Wood: Everyone in the house is an actor playing a role in his murder mystery. , the murder committed is real and well Wood and Homer think that everything is wrong (after discovering Ames's original plan), the cast knows that someone inside the house is a real murderer. As expected, the screenplay of Charles Belden's "The Ghost Walks" takes up the classic elements of murder mystery narratives of his time, as we have the stormy night in an old dark house as a backdrop , the group of suspects mandatory and the hint of comedy. However, what is interesting here is Belden's way of making the movie a parody of the genre with the many twists and turns he puts into his story to play with the clichés of murder mystery plays. The dialogues are excellent, witty and light-hearted, and although the plot certainly ends up losing a lot of speed (she follows the mysterious murder routine anyway), she never fails to be interesting and entertaining. thanks to its intelligent twists and especially. his original characters. It is interesting to note that, although stereotyped, it has never been denigrated and is sometimes really fun. <br /> <br /> In 1934, director Frank R. Strayer was already an experienced artisan on the poverty side of the film industry. but his partnership with writer Charles Belden would give him some of his most interesting films, and "The Ghost Walks" was one of them. Although produced with a limited budget and the typical production values ​​of independent films of his time, Strayer manages to take advantage of its decor and create an atmospheric film that fits the mood and tone of the story. The pace is sometimes a little too slow, but Strayer knew that the power of his film was based on Belden's script and made the most of it, allowing his cast to get the most out of their characters with great results. The performance is a bit typical and unoriginal, but Strayer makes this work effective, albeit limited, in this movie. <br /> <br /> As stated above, the screenplay is filled with great lines that make the unusual characters shine and thankfully. most actors play with this to their advantage. Veteran actor Richard Carle is remarkably funny as a grumpy producer Herman Wood, adding a lot of charm to his character, especially in his scenes with Johnny Arthur, who plays the flamboyant secretary Homer. Arthur is the one who gets the best scenes and he gives a hilarious performance by assisting loose but witty. John Miljan is just as effective as Presocott Ames, no wonder, but nothing serious, and the same could be said of June Collyer as Gloria Shaw (the interest of obligatory love), which is going very well. well. However, Donald Kirke is really nice as villain Terry Shaw, and it is a pity he did not spend more time on the screen. <br /> <br /> As usual with Frank R. Strayer's films, the budget is bad for the film. , while Strayer is doing his best, the film still looks a bit simple. However, the main problem is the slowness of its pace, because even when the film is filled with brilliant moments of spiritual dialogue, it moves at such a slow pace that it can become boring and tedious. It must also be said that, although effective in their roles, Miljan and Collyer are rather dull and mean compared to Arthur and Carle, and we would like the film to focus more on the comic couple they form than on the main couple . Finally, as noted above, the end is a little weak and is not up to the high and middle parts, although Belden is to be congratulated for having kept the creative conspiracy movements to the end. <br /> <br /> One could say that Charles Belden is an unsung hero of the "mystery of murder" genre, because among the many horror and mystery films that have emerged from the movie studios B nicknamed "The Poverty Row "," The Ghost Walks "is easily part of the best (The Strayer's previous film alongisde," The Vmapire Bat ") despite its shortcomings. And although it's certainly not a masterpiece of its kind, it's a nice way to spend a night enjoying the way it makes fun of its own origin as a play of murder. A very recommended movie if you like the genre. 7/10
