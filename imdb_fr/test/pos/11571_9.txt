It's now 2005 and more than 15 years since this cartoon was broadcast. I have not looked seriously or carefully for ten years. Now that I'm an adult and I'm in my thirties, I can look back with a serious eye while watching the episodes again. <br /> <br /> In its design, the drawing is partly a tribute to the classic Looney Tunes, but also own original show. There are some episodes that are structured like old cartoons. For example, there is a singer who attacks Buster and so he takes his revenge on this singer's concert - just like the old cartoon Bugs Bunny. The drawing that follows is similar to Looney Tunes, but in another era. If you look at the old Looney Tunes, they did a lot of things exactly like Tiny Toons. The old Looney Tunes made a lot of social comments and parodies. There were imitations of celebrities. There were a lot of jokes, jargons and nerdy dialogues. The comedy was surreal and far-fetched. You can also say exactly that for Tiny Toons. The style of comedy is "spiritually" the same. Without a doubt, a return to classics that had not been well done (at all) in cartoons in the decades preceding this show. We recognize cultural references in Tiny Toons and we can roll our eyes when something we do not like presents itself. But the reason we do not think Looney Tunes is nerdy is because we were not alive in the 40s. Also, Looney Tunes was original at that time, but today, the drawings animated are subject to several re-readings. It is therefore easy to perceive Tiny Toons unfairly because of our exposure to current events and our overexposure to cartoons in general. <br /> <br /> There are certainly differences in many ways - the timing, the delivery, and of course the duration of the shows. These are two different styles from two different eras, made in two very different circumstances: Looney Tunes for adults in theaters and Tiny Toons for children watching television. Nevertheless, they did a good job of making an original show with original gags AND always paying tribute to the comedy styles of the old Looney Tunes. <br /> <br /> Since Tiny Toons had a lot more time to play. with, they had real moments of great animated inspiration. You only have to watch episodes like 1 minute to 3 minutes, the episode of Plucky baby toilet ... there is so much more. For example, one of the best animated comedy dialogue exchanges is in ThirteenSomething when Babs and Buster are on the phone on a split screen, hoping everyone will miss each other. Bad communication is spectacular. Notably, the development of the character in this episode and in several others (usually those written by Deanna Oliver or Sherri Stoner) is pretty good. Female characters have been taken seriously as personalities and developed. What is unusual for cartoons from this period is unusual. <br /> <br /> This was the first modern cartoon that included many references to pop culture. reference humor. It was way ahead of his time. Tiny Toons really opened the door for writers to take the comic liberties that are so common in today's cartoons, instead of doing the old boring shit we endured when we were 80s. Yes, I liked Transformers and Thundercats, but Tiny Toons totally deviated from all that. It was a breath of fresh air. The new adventures of Bakshi's Mighty Mouse may have been a forerunner, but Tiny Toons has made this surreal comedy style a true success. <br /> <br /> Child, I totally forgot some jokes. For example, an episode is a tribute to the Marx Brothers that I completely ignored in adolescence. Now, I have a new respect for her. There are so many inspired gags that I have never noticed who are really bright. It's that kind of comedy that makes me think of Looney Tunes and Family Guy. I NEVER noticed this kind of comedy when I was a child. I think about this since most of the episodes I watched recently. <br /> <br /> You'll notice that kind of thing if you watch the show. Unlike some of the other commentators I know unfairly, I've seen all the episodes and thought through them, both as a child and as an adult. <br /> <br /> You can see that there was a lot of care given to the acting voice too. I'm not talking only about the main characters, but the secondary characters have been very well done and creative too. But back to the main characters, some of the main characters were brilliant. Tress MacNeille has, in my opinion, his best performances in this caricature. She has not been the same since. Rob Paulsen has also done incredible things here too. <br /> <br /> That does not mean that the series did not have bad episodes. There were plenty of them. There were also a lot of mediocre people. But by far, he has certainly had a lot of really funny episodes. It was particularly funny to watch at the time of the first broadcasts. <br /> <br /> Out of 10, I gave the show a score of 8.5 - and a big cheer for pushing the boundaries and opening the doors to the new era of cartoon.
