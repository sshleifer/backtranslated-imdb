It looks like Mr.Hazanavicius is back! The American class man comes back with a fun and clever continuation to the old OSS-117 ... while the directors tend to "over-refresh" the suites of old classics (Hazanavicius chose to work on a hero really Cheap, OSS-117, a kind of low-budget French 007, and decided to do it the old-school way ... Photography, body attitudes, choreography of fights and FX, everything is as a tribute to the way movies were shot in the 50's. And it works, because the tone and jokes of the movie are really good! Jean Dujardin perfectly embodies this stupid-arrogant-macho-selfish French spy, lost in a country that he understands only in terms of folklore and inferiority.Yes, that's how the West uses its colonies at the time (and, oh, no, I will not say it was something to do with what's happening nowadays in the same q uartier ... ah ah ah) ... It looks like an unfrozen Lino Ventura, with something like 40 pounds less, which is perfect for other cast members are also perfect, with everything you can dream Russian spies, Egyptian separatists and former Nazis. And of course, women, as there must be "femme fatales" in any good spy- the movies ... The plot is good (maybe not brilliant but really sufficient ...), taking place between real historical facts and amusingly reminiscing the way France (and others) treated her colonies at the time. It all started in 1955 with the disappearance of a British spy while he tracked a Russian cargo full of weapons in Suez. France then sends his best friend, Agent OSS-117, to find out what happened to the cargo and the agent ... The fact is that this agent is really as silly as possible, and he slips into the history without even understanding it, solving it in a very neat way. I must say that I had a bad feeling about the film, because the advertising around him was quite frightening and the French humor tends to be quite populist and flat (forget tanned 3 or camping ... ) but I was really surprised, and in a good way! I highly recommend it, that you wish a good parody of Bond-Esquire movies (much more fun than in DEBS for example, but less skirts) or that you are a fan of this sincere and frank way of filming which was theirs in the the 50's . Yes, it's smart and (really!) Funny, you understand again, Mr. Hazanavicius!
