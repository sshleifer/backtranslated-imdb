<br /> <br /> my favorite science fiction, an incredible crossing of mistrust and the distortion of reality. Probably the best performance I've ever seen playing with Jude Law. Incredibly original with interesting character developments and a story that runs so fast that it takes a few minutes after the movie to fully capture his genius. Even more fun by watching it again for the end changes the beginning.
