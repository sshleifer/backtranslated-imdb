The 1970s opened the door to the era of the largest and most diverse film in history. Some movies were excellent ("The Godfather", "The Conversation", "Mean Streets", Chinatown "," The French Connection "," Five Easy Pieces "," Jaws "," McCabe and Mrs. Miller "), others were not so great ("The Getaway", "The Outfit", "Badge 373", "Joe", "Taking Pelham One Two Three", "Brewster McCloud", "Castle Keep") And others were hardly worth the price of admission. <br /> <br /> However, each film was a breath of fresh air compared to today's Corporate Hollywood, where each film is awarded a great weekend to recover the cost, or go directly to the HBO chain and rent. <br /> <br /> What "Decade" does so well, is to tell the sudden sensation and rarely felt freedom, to which gives money to make a film, maybe personal, maybe not, sometimes with a handful of extras, in the middle of a busy street before the cops show up. Supervisors, suits, committees and lawyers are never part of the "System". <br /> <br /> The comments are great, especially Julie Chris tie and Dennis Hopper. While you are listening, you will slowly discover how many great directors (Coppola, Scorsese, Ron Howard, Dennis Hopper, Peter Bogdonovitch) have been called "Roger Corman's Commandos". Work long hours with a short salary. Shooting a film in less than a month. Learn all the steps of the job by doing it yourself. Product production on time and on budget. <br /> <br /> See "Decade" for his message. And for a long and varied list of films to watch made during these wonderfully turbulent years. <br /> <br /> But I would not complain if the IFC decided to dedicate another documentary only to the great pioneer of the most underrated film Roger Corman
