The inspiration for this film was the fact that the American gangsters are well dressed, but the Australians, when we kill a guy as soon as we look at the blighter, we can dress as badly as we want and people will not criticize you. <br /> <br /> Jimmy is a fighter, an illegal boxer, sometimes a bouncer. The work of Pando, the head of the local gangster (ie the infamous Kings Cross Australian District, not the celebrity of the London Cross, many British backpackers are finding the way difficult). <br /> <br /> Due to feelings of love, he packs a job, loses a lot of money and has to give it back to Pando before Pando and her husband can kill him. . <br /> <br /> A lot of black humor, interesting action, revelations about the underside and the human nature of Australia. It is very much about Australian nature and explores the nature of Australian criminals (as opposed to American and British criminals). <br /> <br /> One problem is that each of the elements of the story does not have enough substance and depth, but it is a paint with broad lines that covers a large part of the surface that was not not covered before; it is therefore worthwhile to put it as a whole. <br /> <br /> Combine it with "Chopper" and "Dirty Deeds" for your Australian Crime Festival or "Stock Lock and Two Barrels of Smokers" and "Miller's Crossing" for an international failing gang party criminals. <br /> <br /> By the way, Bryan Brown is a great actor who has made a very large number of very bad movies. Here is one of his great movies.
