If you think that a war movie can really make you feel war, you should see "Letyat zhuravli" (called "The Cranes are Flying"). It tells the story of Veronika (Tatiana Samoylova) and Boris (Aleksey Batalov), lovers on the threshold of the Second World War. They walk along the waterfront, watching the passage of cranes at the beginning of the war. Boris is promptly sent to war. Veronika hides with a family and ends up marrying the son she does not like. Meanwhile, Boris continues to roam the countryside, fighting the Nazis and experiencing all the horrors of the war until he runs out of energy. When Veronika - working in a military hospital - receives this news, she refuses to accept it until Boris' body arrives home on one of the trains. Simultaneously, the radio announces that Germany has surrendered and that the Allied Powers have won the war; the Soviet Union has lost 27 million citizens, but this is the beginning of a new era. <br /> <br /> This film has shown very well the human impact of the war, not only on the battlefield, but also its impact on the civilian population. It's really a movie that everyone should see.
