This superb post-war classic of the 40s tends to be overlooked these <br /> <br /> days. When it came out in 1945, it was cleaned up at the Oscars in 1946, mainly at the expense of "It's a wonderful life". Both films were nominated for the best film, the best director and the best actor, all won by Best Years. Frederic March, <br /> <br /> and Dana Andrews with an amateur actor Harold Russell (a <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> soldier in life, who lost both his hands in an explosion), play <br /> > <br /> soldiers return, find life is very different from what they remember <br /> <br />. Myrna Loy is superb as March's wife, who has to keep the family together in her absence.The scene of tears <br /> <br /> where meet March and Loy is beautiful . The three men <br /> <br /> find it difficult to readjust to life after the war, and <br /> unless Russell gets along with artificial hands and his finances <br /> <br /> (Cathy O'Donnell) trying to be too useful. Sam Goldywn said he did not care if the movie did not bring in any money, as long as everyone in America would see the movie, so that they would appreciate what these men went through. If a movie is worth 10 out of 10, it's this one.
