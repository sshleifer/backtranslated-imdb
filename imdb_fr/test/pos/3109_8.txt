My God, I quickly learn that sometimes, when we see a film in its youth, and see it again 20 years later, we get a different point of view, mainly because in 20 years, we learn more . For example, I did not know who George Cukor was - how great he was as a director and how much the film stole. All I can say is .. I really liked this film because it touched a field parallel to my life: the friendship of a whole life between two women. Can this NEVER exist? Well, at certain doses, yes ... and this film suggests a little ... "how". <br /> <br /> Be a young person with little experience of life the first time I saw so I focused more on the "rich" and "famous" parts in between. At the time, I did not know that there was a difference and what would happen to the two women who discovered that there was one ... and how it would affect their friendship. Through their men, their career, the decades that defined them. And after realizing that something was stronger than anything else ... their friendship and knowing each other better than anyone else could have done it. <br /> <br /> Then I became a little older, I studied cinema ... and I watched it filming again with my best friend from high school. We understand the angles "rich" and "famous" ... and we are still the best friends of the world ... but this film is not a cinematic masterpiece ... it can be considered a little campy ... a little higher up to the points (a bit on the 'Dynasty' and 'Dallas' levels for me ..) and honestly, I can identify with the "teddy bear" scene because we share a bear that means a lot more than a teddy bear fun toy through our trials and tribulations with men / careers, and al..so it's not as exaggerated as it seems ....! As many have already said, see Meg Ryan, Matt Latanzzi, Dack Rambo and David Selby is excellent in this 1981 film. It's a beautiful movie "chick"!
