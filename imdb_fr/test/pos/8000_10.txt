It has been said that Batman starts in the first Batman movie to "do it right", but I think it's a horrible overestimate because I think the new Batman movie, although bigger than Batman Forever and Batman and Robin is much worse than Tim Burton's classics, with this being the best of five. The darkness is beautiful, as are the music and landscapes, creating a mysterious Gotham City, unlike Batman Begins, where Gotham City is a city with a normal appearance. The bad guys are great in this movie. You can not literally leave the eyes of the penguin and the cat woman. I congratulate Tim Burton for using the penguin as a monster rather than an ordinary criminal or a clone of the old Batman television series. In Batman Begins, we have the scarecrow, who is not as demanding on the screen as the penguin or the cat woman. The film does not need to focus solely on Batman, because we already know his story and it's the villains we explore and we try to understand, and they are the ones who created the plot, with the penguin in race for the mayor and seek revenge for his parents' desertion by killing Gotham's firstborn, a task he failed. Danny Devito gives the best performance ever made by a villainous superhero in a movie, even surpassing Nicholson's prankster. The final scene where the penguins drag the corpse of the penguin into the water is touching and powerful. It's a tragedy that Tim Burton was not allowed to complete his trilogy, because Warner Bros., interesting in marketing, wanted to "lighten up" Batman movies. And they had their wish ... unfortunately. Tim Burton had planned to make the third film, using the Riddler as a villain, without Two-Face and Robin to spoil it, and I'm sure Michael Keaton would have signed. This is the last big Batman movie. Batman Begins is dark, but boring, tedious, ordinary, filled with terrifying villains and a playboy, Bruce Wayne. A good Batman movie, but the best Batman movie? Never. Batman Returns holds this crown.
