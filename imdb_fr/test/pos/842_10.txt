The third film of an incomparably brilliant cycle of exploitation films, and the third consecutive masterpiece, "Joshuu Sasori: Kemono-beya", aka. "Prisoner Scorpion: Stable Beast" (aka "Sasori: The Lair Of The Beast" where I live) from 1973 is a film that differs from its predecessors in some ways, but which evenly (or even surpasses) them brilliantly. The entire original Sasori series with the wonderful Meiko Kaji appears as the absolute highlight of WIP cinema, and all films, especially the first three, uniquely combine Exploitation and Art-house cinema like no other film does. "Beast Stable" is the third and last penultimate film "Sasori" with Meiko Kaji, the latest directed by the brilliant director Shunya Ito and, in my opinion, the greatest of all. The first film "Joshuu 701-gô: Sasori" from 1972 is an absolute masterpiece of exploitation cinema and more simply THE definition of exploitation-art. In the equally brilliant sequel, "Joshuu Sasori: Dai-41 zakkyo-bô", Ito added more surrealism and symbolism. The third film "Sasori", "Beast Stable" maintains surrealism (although it is not quite the same degree as the second), and has even more social criticism than its predecessors. Topics such as poverty, forced prostitution and exploitation of the poor are central themes of the film. <br /> <br /> This third film "Sasori" is ingenious and sublime in every way and is probably the biggest, usually brilliant, cycle (for me, it's this one, the first one in second position being close). Once again, "Best Stable" is both very artistic and very exploitable. This film contains a huge amount of brutal violence and rebellion, as well as sequences of immense surreal beauty. The beautiful beauty of Meiko Kaji is again brilliant in her role of Nami Matsushima (aka Sasori). I absolutely love this wonderful actress and I'm sure I'm not the only one to do it. The rest of the performances are also excellent, especially Mikio Narita is a police inspector obsessed with capturing Sasori. The musical score is the same in all three films, with "Urami-Bushi", sung by Meiko Kaji herself, as the main theme, which is great because the score is, quite simply, perfection. Like its predecessors, "Beast Stable" is an absolutely brilliant masterpiece of Exploitation-Art, that no movie lover can afford to miss. The entire Sasori cycle is at the top of my list of personal favorites of all time. "Beast Stable" is without doubt the most brilliant masterpiece of all! 10/10
