OK ... I've seen pretty much everything ... and some are considered classics that should not be (like all those Halloween movies that suck or even Steven King Junk) ... .... and some are considered OK, they are really great ..... (like the carnival of souls) ........ and some are simply ignored .......... .. like (evil ed) or (pumpkin head and cerebral death "Cort one bud"), then some stick in your head once seen and never leave ........... this is what it made me ........ and for my money it's better than the last house on the left ... The last house was great until the end ... so she blown pieces ..... what kind of mannequin will give a blowjob to someone who just killed their children ????. completely stupid .. go find the movie "bully" or even "fun games" if you want realism and be scared ....... ..but this damn thing holds me for years ....... .. a cause chuck Connors has always been scary ......... two Tanya Roberts is the best female victim of all time ..... ... three the chick be asleep in the plaster is the one of the worst murders of all time on movie ........ and 4th, the power of telekinesis hit me and came totally unexpected ....... not to mention the wax figures for the dumb puppets etc ....... he should be there with psycho, last house, chainsaw in Texas, etc ....... it's a classic ............. and rightly so ...........
