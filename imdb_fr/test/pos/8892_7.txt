University professor Larry Donner (Billy Cristal) is a writer stuck since his ex-wife Margareth (Kate Mulgrew) ruined it, stealing his novel that has become a bestseller. He does not hide his hatred for Margareth, annoying his girlfriend Beth Ryan (Kim Greist), a teacher in anthropology at the same college. While giving classes in creative writing, he is hunted by student Owen (Danny DeVito) who wants to know his opinion on his crime story. Larry says he did not like it, and explains that in all mystery stories, the murderer should eliminate the motive and establish an alibi, otherwise he would be caught. In addition, Larry suggests to Owen to watch Hitchcock's films to understand the structure of a suspenseful story. Owen, who wants to kill his ugly mother (Anne Ramsey), observes "Strangers on a Train" and misunderstands Larry's advice, believing his teacher wants to swap killings to eliminate the motive. Owen goes to Hawaii and, while aboard a ship, Margareth falls to the sea and disappears into the sea. He is considered dead. However, Larry has no alibi and becomes the prime suspect, while Owen upset the press to kill his mother as part of their supposed deal. <br /> <br /> "Throwing Mum Train" is one of the funniest comedies of the 80s and a great homage to Alfred Hitchcock. The direct reference is "Strangers on a Train", but there are jokes with "Vertigo" (with the camera running), "Family Plot" (with the car without pause) and other movies. The lines are excellent and there is an interesting point when Larry tells that every great novel or mystery has a train. Anne Ramsey is amazing in the role of a nasty and abusive dominant mother and the viewer will certainly feel grief and understand Owen's craziness. Kim Greist is very beautiful and Kate Mulgrew is the perfect bitch. Billy Cristal plays a character obsessed by many stupid and unreasonable attitudes that are necessary to the plot. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Jogue a Mam√£e do Trem" ("Jette mum of the train")
