I would like to start by saying that I can only hope that the directors of this film and its sister film The Intruder (directed by the great designer not celebrated Jopi Burnama) know in their hearts how much they made themselves pleasure my friends in the sleepy town of Jarrow, located in the northeast of the southeast. <br /> <br /> Since the opening sequence preceding the granting of credits that hangs very slightly despite the fact that a man crashed through a motorcycle window, the ruthless destruction of a silence lab , the introduction of one of the boring and anemic villains of the history of cinema and the creation of costumes that Jean Paul Gautier would find ott and screaming. Do not make mistakes; It is a truly unique experience. The early climax - an explosion (get used to it, a lot more where it comes from!) Followed by a close-up of our chubby heroine and the hilarious reading of the word "daddy" in living memory. And then ... the theme song ... <br /> <br /> Yeah, that deserves its own paragraph. Sung by AJ, written by people who should remain anonymous, it sounds the songs written for Rocky movies like Schubert. This is the motivational narcissism of the 80s heroes at a record level, with choice words such as "it's only you and me, it's the red thread" and we talk a lot about having to "cross the line. "(It's going to have a sense time - our hero cares little about the limits of the police work in good faith) abundant. Not to mention the supreme Indonesians cooing seductively in the title of the film. At this point, anyone wishing to go off officially no longer has a pulse. <br /> <br /> Our hero is the Semitic policeman Peter Goldson (brilliantly tried by Intruder star Peter O'Brien), the "stabilizer" of the title. The bull of the man in a porcelain shop and his work under a discreet blanket leave much to be desired, but he is undoubtedly an entertaining guide on the streets of downtown Jakarta, with a discreet local connection. Captain Johnny tow, as well as Peter's own squander space in the crime of fashion Sylvia Nash, who does little. So many highlights, so little time - Peter's arrogant "slide please" argues convincingly against baddie boss Greg Rainmaker (Intruder fans will know sticky bastard Craig Gavin under the name of the monstrous John White - name of hell, huh? No! Oh, oh ... well ...), the x marks the stupidity, our hero benefits terribly from the heroine Tina Probost at a time of weakness for her, the latter presents herself to an infiltration operation dressed as a member of a particularly flamboyant troupe dance. And believe me, it barely covers. <br /> <br /> There has not even been time to get into the plot around looking for a drug detection system and a kidnapped teacher with an alarming but laudable national pride . Or our hero comes to a funeral dressed as an extra during Boogie Nights. Or the hysterical folly between Captain Johnny and Goldson - two guys have never done more bad weather to Buddy Shtick than these clowns. The trowel may have been too subtle, he thinks. <br /> <br /> Oh that makes people flee, and you never thought that scenes of blind destruction and chaos could be so boring, but the interaction between the characters is amazing, the dialogue is really great. priceless and incompetence on endearing show somehow. Oh, and shoes, beware of shoes!
