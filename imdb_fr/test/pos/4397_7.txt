The Coen brothers did it again. Three convicts of the Depression era (George Clooney, John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson) escaped a gang in the Mississippi chain and began searching for a hidden treasure that will finance their new life. Along the way, they sing on the radio and become popular stars as well as escapees. Great laughs and a soundtrack that is a lesson / introduction to bluegrass music. <br /> <br /> Clooney is remarkable as a fast-paced and quick-witted Ulysses Everett McGill. Holly Hunter plays his separated wife. Turturro and Nelson are stumblebums without flaws. John Goodman and Charles Durning are also part of the cast. <br /> <br /> Dan Tyminksi plays George Clooney in "I'm a man of constant sorrow", Soggy Bottom Boys' song that serves as a template for the bluegrass-laden soundtrack also includes Alison Krauss, Ralph Stanley, The Whites, John Hartford, the Cox family and Gillian Welch. Kicks and slaps in the knees are fun for the whole family. You will be surprised at how relaxed and fun this movie is.
