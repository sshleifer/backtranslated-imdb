Drawn by Pain is easily one of the best movie pieces I have ever seen. Here are my reviews of episodes published so far: <br /> <br /> The first episode was even better than I expected and from all I had heard, I was expecting has many. I am already very impressed by the actors. The father was scary and played perfectly. The little girl is so expressive that she uses her eyes to convey such emotion. The animation was superb. The cinematography was incredible, each camera angle perfectly capturing the feeling of the scene. The editing was so well done, each scene blending perfectly into the next. The music captured the emotions quite well and dragged you into the story. I can not say enough about the beauty of this episode. This definitely opens the appetite! <br /> <br /> Episode 2 was even better than the first! Everything I said about the first episode continues, it's up to you to see even more character development. I can not wait to finally see episode 3, or the rest of the series for that matter. What is developing is an intriguing, character-driven plot that has all the attributes of a big but unpretentious Hollywood production. So much is said, with so few words. This series looks like something you have never seen and perched to become a real success. <br /> <br /> This episode was great! No other word describes it! WOW! Everything I said about the previous episodes is valid for this one, and yet it was even better! I do not know how you get to get something amazing and make it even better! The subsequent development of the characters proves that it is a piece entirely centered on the characters. Cinematography excels as it has always done and takes you into Emily's pain, fear, hatred and emotional ups and downs. I can not wait to see Episode 4 ... or the rest of the series. You really outdo yourself! <br /> <br /> Even though I liked the other episodes, episode 4 is the best for now. I like the progression of the character. I feel that we are really going to know Emily, her pain and her internal struggle. The other themes I mentioned in the previous reviews are repeated. Excellent cinematography, the writing is superb, the actors are faithful to their roles and created the characters, and the animation is simply incredible! Another great job from the DbP team!
