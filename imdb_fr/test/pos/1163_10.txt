When I watched the video for a local magazine, I called it "the greatest achievement in the history of American cinema". It was not completely the tongue in the cheek. TW & TL remains the best work of Milius and it is regrettable that he has so few opportunities to work. However, TW & TL remains a striking exhibition of what was once known as The American Character, in large part because of Brian Keith's superb portrayal of Teddy R. "The Rough Riders.") It is hard to criticize this film at any level: a magnificent balance of action, lightness, relationships and the serious subject of America becoming a major person in the world. world. In addition, TW & TL has an exceptional appeal: note the statistics showing that it is the best with men under 18, women 18 to 29 and over 45! Obviously, Candy Bergen has reached a sensible agreement with women as well as men.
