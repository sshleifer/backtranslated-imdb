I caught this at the Chicago IndieFest and I must say that YOU ARE ALONE is much funnier than the other reviews and even the website would make you think. Not HA HA funny, but sick, crooked, I can not believe she just said that, but it's so funny, really funny. <br /> <br /> Jessica Bohl, who has rightly won the best actress, is amazing to watch. There's never a moment when you think, oh, I'm watching a movie and it's an actress. She is too sacred for words. <br /> <br /> In fact, there are two scenes that I always laugh at, and I will not let them go, but in one of them, she's in the bathroom talking about everything she gets. paid to perform a certain service and how "awesome" it is. (I almost wonder how many people in the public secretly think the same thing !!!) <br /> <br /> In another, she talks about the definition of "sex" by a teenager compared to an adult , and if it is not the case. the most true dialogue I've heard in a movie for a long time, I do not know what it is.
