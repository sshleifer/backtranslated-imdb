A variant of the same plot was used in an episode of Simon & Simon (Thin Air) first broadcast in December 1982. <br /> <br /> The sex of the victim was changed, the surviving spouse making part of Rick's "old flames". It is also interesting to note that Gerald McRaney played a role in this episode of Rockford. <br /> <br /> Both episodes are based on a Howard Browne story - as shown in the list of "writing credits". <br /> <br /> Anthony James plays one of his classic bad-guy roles. <br /> <br /> The continuation of the concept between the Rockford files of Magnum PI, Simon and Simon is quite interesting.
