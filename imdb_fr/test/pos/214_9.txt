I remember looking at the police brigade! When ABC appeared for the first time in 1982, I thought it was a very entertaining show, thanks to the many visual gags, non-sequencers and scripts filled with word games. In one episode, there was a line where a man named Once had been shot twice. <br /> <br /> But unfortunately, ABC canceled the series after only six episodes. I thought the movie deserved a lot longer, but a network manager felt that the show was paying too much attention to the viewer because of the visual gags of each episode. One of them I remember was in the opening where the title of the episode was different from the one on the screen. <br /> <br /> The portrait of Frank Drebin by Leslie Nielsen was impassive, but very funny, and his role was in the narrative style of Dragnet's Jack Webb. Alan North is doing well and Peter Lupus, in one of his rare roles since Mission: Impossible, is not so bad as Norberg. But the character that stands out is Johnny the Shoeshine Boy, played by William Duell. After giving advice to Drebin, cameos from Dick Clark, Joyce Brothers, then Tommy LaSorda, director of Dodger. <br /> <br /> Even if Police Squad! After a short life on ABC, the Zucker Brothers did not give up the concept that proved to be even more successful in the Naked Gun movie franchise. I will end with a regular closing gag. Freeze the end here.
