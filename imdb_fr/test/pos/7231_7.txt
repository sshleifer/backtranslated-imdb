This weird Troma movie is actually a very good movie. This is their epic production, the best and the most rated. Their version of Shakespeare's play is extremely entertaining with the usual dose of Troma nudity and gore. Troma has made very good gore movies. One of my favorites is "Street Trash" and of course the movies of Toxic Avenger. I have a Troma movie, "Terror Firmer", which has the reputation of being their most gorul and naughty movie. I loved "Tromeo and Juliet" so much that I finally need to watch "Terror Firmer". This is a two-disc collector version with four comments and many features. "Tromeo and Juliet" is a real delirium and highly recommended.
