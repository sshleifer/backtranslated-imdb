This BBC version of a book by Agatha Christie shows the pitfalls to follow if you follow a book too closely. Christie's books tend to evolve at a gentle pace, sometimes even serene, and "Evans" certainly is. He also has a solid school of red herring to confuse the plot. This version is extremely faithful to the book, which translates into a very slow and complicated story. As a fan of Christie, I awarded him 7 stars, but it takes 3 hours to go through a relatively action-free story. I really appreciate the tightening of roles that the BBC has done for its subsequent Christie productions. <br /> <br /> In the end, this film is a carefree pleasure, underlined by the breathless Francesca Annis who brings a considerable charisma. to his role and plays James Warwick very well.
