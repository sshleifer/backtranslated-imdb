I thought it was a very bold portrayal of the old hokey 'Tarzan' concept made so popular by Hollywood, Weismuller, and others. <br /> <br /> Yes; there are many stupid things. But then, the idea is silly. It is almost unbelievable that a human baby can be raised to adulthood by chimpanzees. I am tempted to say that it is incredible, but that the concept has never been tried. And there is certainly a bit too much anthropomorphism for more comfort. Although, under the circumstances, I can see how difficult it would be to avoid. We also have a much deeper understanding of the problems of acculturation and know that a human raised from childhood without behavioral incentives will never learn it as an adult. <br /> <br /> However, if you manage to have your head Around this field, there is much to admire, both imaginative and daring. Lambert does the thing of the beast with a huge plumb. I am tempted to say that this is the most convincing and friendly role I have seen him play. There are many other excellent performances too. Sir Ralph Richardson and Ian Holm are not the least. <br /> <br /> The simian perception of the human being is particularly disturbing. We come almost to see ourselves from the point of view of the poor, dumb and helpless brutes over whom we control him so regularly. And it shows how much of the artificial "civilization" and "morality" with which we conceal and justify our conduct are nothing more than an expression of our own selfishness and arrogance. This may sometimes seem a little exaggerated, especially in the hideous dissection halls of the museum, but what we see is not just a truth about the Victorians; it's a truth about how we are today. This is a question that needs to be stated and can not be stated often enough. Holm's obsession with the "zor ray" as a symptom of civilization - as if possessing hair on his face was a primitive condition to be disregarded - is an excellent example. The primitive bearded readers take note of it. <br /> <br /> The story is depressing. In the end, it's a tragedy. Because even if he returns to the jungle and has freed himself from moral tyranny, which constitutes a real human "civilization"; we know he is doomed. Before the third millennium reaches the age of 50, wild simians will be extirpated as bushmeat and their environment will be developed for agriculture and mining to satisfy an insatiable human excess. <br /> <br /> In the end, it's a tale about us. The path of extinction that other simians tread must ultimately be followed by humans. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended for his ethics, despite difficult times.
