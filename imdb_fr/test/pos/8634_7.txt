Bud Abbott and Lou Costello have always had a good audience among children, but in their careers, I think it could be said that they have made only one film that can be designed for children. Jack and the Beanstalk was this one movie. <br /> <br /> It was part of a two-picture independent contract signed by Warner Brothers, the second film being Abbott and Costello Meet Captain Kidd. These are the only two films made by boys in color. <br /> <br /> The two of them, unemployed, take a job for the young David Stollery, very precocious and obnoxious, as a babysitter. Although Costello begins by wanting to read the child and Jack and the bean as a bedtime story, the boy ends up reading it at Costello. Lou falls asleep and, in his dreams, he imagines he is really the killer of Jack the giant. <br /> <br /> Buddy Baer who threatened the boys of Africa Screams plays the role of the giant and has a giant size, Dorothy Ford, as governess. Dorothy was a big girl, 6'2 ", and you can imagine that she had some difficulty getting started, except when her size was used as a joke.One of the only players who ever watched her was John Wayne. in Three Godfathers at 6 '4 ". Henry Fonda and James Stewart in On Our Merry Way also stood just above her, but again, her waist was part of a gag. <br /> <br /> Shaye Cogan and James Alexander were the princess and the prince of fantasy and they sang beautifully, but could not be worth anything. This was the last film of William Farnum. His career dates back to the beginnings of silent cinema and even at the turn of the last century. He played the father of Princess Shaye the King. <br /> <br /> Some not-so-memorable musical numbers came from Jack and the Beanstalk, except the title track. I remember very well that when I was a child, Bud and Lou had sung the song and recited the story. I was in my first few years at a single figure, but I became a long-time fan of their film and television series. <br /> <br /> Jack and Bean is always a good painting for kids, although I want to warn parents to warn their grandchildren not to imitate young master Stollery.
