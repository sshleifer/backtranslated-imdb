At a time when Hollywood thinks that stronger, faster and bloodier are better, Manna From Heaven is comical and touching. Something we would have thought: what would I do if a load of money fell from the sky? <BR /> <br /> Interestingly, it took the characters many years to realize that money had no impact on their lives. They all become what they were meant to be. Unfortunately, in most cases, what they became was unfortunate, despite their good fortune a long time ago. <br /> <br /> While Manna offers the well-known Hollywood narrative of Good vs. Evil, or in the case of Generosity vs. Greed, what sets this movie apart is that Good wins by converting Evil, not crushing it. <br /> <br /> I think the important message of this film is that you can change the world ... even if you do it one person at a time.
