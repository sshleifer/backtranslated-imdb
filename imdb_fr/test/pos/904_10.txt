Genius or total madness? It depends on your interpretation of this film. I answered at the level of a "police parody" aware of myself, and I sincerely hope that was the intention, because I do not see anyone take it seriously! Paul Rudd, for his part, seems to be gnawing the landscape and really getting into the spirit of things! Is this movie supposed to mark Rudd's departure from his antecedents in the comic genre? A kind of insane attempt to reinvent it as a star of action? I do not think so! <br /> <br /> With the nerdy and almost clumsy game, the effects of low budget budget and zany decorations, all this evokes for me this old TV series "Sledge Hammer"! HILARIOUS!!! :-) <br /> <br /> Of course, I may have totally misinterpreted the film. If it was actually a "straight" action movie attempt, it was certainly a fun failure! <br /> <br /> Look with a lot of alcohol and some friends !!! ;-)
