The Outsiders is without a doubt a classic Australian television series. Well-defined characters, tight scripts, varied and interesting places, big stars and a cinematic atmosphere have helped make this series a special series. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Andrew Keir is dead. does not seem (unfortunately) to have been successful in the small screen in his native country. The ABC has repeated the series several times, but a DVD release has not yet taken place. <br /> <br /> This series is timeless. It is likely that viewers today are meeting a chord with spectators today. Go ABC ... free the Outsiders on DVD !!!!!
