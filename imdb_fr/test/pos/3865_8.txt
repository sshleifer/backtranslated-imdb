No, I'm not kidding with this one. He was a guest reviewer for Entertainment Weekly and gave the film positive ratings. And who can blame him? It's a charming, upbeat and funny Disney movie. Who does not like kittens? The music in Ev'rybody wants to be a cat is jammer. It makes me want to snap my fingers or something else. Only a few years later, when Cats Do not Dance came out, I saw a film as amusing as it was musically. What is missing in Aristocats in terms of animation and history is the charm. Plus, everything happens at a relaxed pace, and even the villain is not so scary. It's perfect for the younger ones while not being so severe that adults can not like it. If Snoop was here, I'm sure he would say the same thing. Yeah. Dig those crazy cats, dude.
