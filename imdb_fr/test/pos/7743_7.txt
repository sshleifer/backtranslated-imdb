For many years, I figured I was the only person on the planet to have seen TEMPEST and I'm very happy to hear that I'm not the only one to have discovered this sleeper somewhere in their movies. TEMPEST follows an architect (the late John Cassavettes, in one of his best performances) bored by his work and his marriage in ruins (with the real-life husband Gene Rowlads), who decides to reject everything, says with his daughter (Molly Ringwald in her film debut) and new girlfriend Aretha (the luminous Susan Sarandon). Even if Paul Mazursky is credited as a director, Cassavettes has his hand on the whole film ... the long scenes filmed without cutting, the sense of improvisation in the dialogue ..., the style of narrative complacent, it is definitely his show from the beginning To finish, and if you're not a fan of his work, the film will seem painfully long and boring, but if you're a fan, you'll have rewards to have. Cassavettes is surrounded by a first-rate cast ... his scenes with Rowlands crackle with intensity and his surprising chemistry with Sarandon contrasts with his scenes with Rowlands. Ringwald shines in his film debut and the late Raul Julia plays Kalibanos, Cassavettes' servant on the island. Julia stops the show in a dance scene with a flock of sheep accompanied by Liza Minnelli singing "New York, New York". This film is sad and tragic, funny and intense. Yes, it's a bit long and disjointed and it works a bit too hard to be different (there is even a curtain call at the end of the film), but it never fails to catch the attention of those who love something different filmgoing.
