This movie is just amazing. Unfortunately, in Portugal, he does not even have the shadow of him. And I share the previous opinion, only fans of FF will give all the merit to the film ... but for the rest, I challenge you. to watch it. The story is excellent, and I thought the game ended the story, but the writers told us a nice story to the god of all rpg ... the most expensive, as usual, he came from the sky;) ehehe but the little details they gave us (to us fans of the game) are beautiful .. as the ringtone is the winning song of the game Battle, and even some moves are quite familiar, just to look at it is a good story, an excellent animation ... just a 10/10
