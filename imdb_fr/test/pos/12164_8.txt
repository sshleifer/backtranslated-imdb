I had never read much (or even seen pictures) of the British group The Crazy Gang, composed of six people, but my positive experiences with their contemporaries Will Hay and Arthur Askey - and in particular the praises of Graham Greene on THE FROZEN LIMITS ("The funniest English photo ever produced ... it can stand the comparison with SAFETY LAST and THE GENERAL") - made me take the leap with Network of this R2's refined DVDs and their subsequent movie, GASBAGS ( 1941, see below), which were published earlier this year without fanfare. <br /> <br /> A British-made western is a rarity, but a parody of it is even rarer (CARRY ON COWBOY [1965] was still in 25 years). Incidentally, to return to the classics of silence mentioned by Greene, the film seems to me more obviously indebted to THE GOLD RUSH (1925) and WAY OUT WEST (1937). In addition, he also plays as a variation of the fairy tale "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" (which has just been immortalized on screen via the animated masterpiece of Walt Disney) and where the seventh member is played by the former comic and frequent Will Hay leaf Moore Marriott; the band actually calls the pretty heroine Eileen Bell under that name, and there's even a fun sequence in which six of them get ready to go to bed and whistle the dwarf song of the Disney movie! <br /> <br /> Six comedians (three comic duet sets: Flanagan & Allen, Nervo & Knox and Naughton & Gold) are perhaps the most important group of this genre on the film - even if all their personalities do not stand out here: my favorites were: the great Bud Flanagan (who looks a bit like Jim Backus), the heterosexual Chesney Allen and Teddy Knox with the mustache and hoarse voice; However, Charlie Naughton, bald, often took the limelight, because it is the one on which the others always seemed to boast. Yet it's still Marriott who steals the film at its very first scene - where it manages to emulate every official in the dilapidated theater of a ghost town! a very young Bernard Lee is also remarkable as a villain of the play. <br /> <br /> The Mineron routine between Flanagan and Allen actually anticipates the famous movie "Who's On First?" from Abbott and Costello on many word games for his humor - which does not necessarily travel, especially at this stage). Nevertheless, there are several hilarious sequences, some of which have even made me cry: the opening scene where the gang are defrocked by an angry band of creditors; their dress in Indians once they hit the Yukon; the ruse of the gang to make everyone rich with the same gold coin; they all mimic the Marriott somnambulist to confuse the wicked (a gag that may be due to the hilarious sequence of Marx Bros.'s mirror in DUCK SOUP [1933]); the theatrical sketch that mocks whitewashed melodramas; the surreal moment when, pursued by the wicked, one of the gangs climbs a staircase which is part of the painted scenery of the theater; and especially towards the end, when a group of mounted police singers galloped very slowly to the rescue of the gang (although aroused by the increasingly impatient hero of the Rangers). <br /> <br /> The thin soundtrack and unbridled nature of the gags themselves sometimes prevented me from making all the jokes - subtitles would certainly have been welcome in this case. The Crazy Gang has only shot five films - the first two being well-viewed, OKAY FOR SOUND (1937) and ALF'S BUTTON AFLOAT (1938), and a much later meeting (though Allen pulled out due to ill and replaced by Eddie Gray) called LIFE IS A CIRCUS (1960), directed by Val Guest, who has co-authored the two Gang films I purchased as well as some of the aforementioned Hay and Askey vehicles!) .
