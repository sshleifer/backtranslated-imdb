I'm surprised that so many viewers did not find all the symbolism in the film ..... that's what made the movie an incredible work of art! The story deals with the saddest content a film can contain, but it's one of the best movies I've ever seen because of the need for your own imagination and the brilliance of the screenplay. <br /> <br /> If you pay attention, the message is there. The younger brother is killed by the father-in-law. The older brother invented the story of the theft of the wagon as a way to deal with the pain of his brother's death. There are those who would say why he would lie to his own children with the story. For me, the answer is because he does not want to share such ugliness with his own children, or that he blocked it and replaced his memory of the horrible event with the thought that his brother would flee to shelter. I read some critics who thought he was an only child and that he had created the younger brother to escape the abuse he had suffered. Although this is an interesting idea, I love the imagination. I do not think he would have lied to his own children about having a little brother. But, I find it plausible that he would have lied about the death of his little brother. However, I like this idea of ​​an end much better than the idea that the film has no symbolism. <br /> <br /> There are many different shots for the movie, but if you take the movie at face value ..... two brothers creating a wagon that flies to escape an abusive father-in-law - you have missed the brilliant. The fact that I could see the subtle messages in the script was what made the movie so amazing to me. This requires your own thought process and your own imagination to make it work ... dig deep when you look at it. You will be surprised by the genius contained in the film. The only other movie I've seen as close to this in symbolism and subtle messages is Pleasantville ..... but that's a comment for another movie!
