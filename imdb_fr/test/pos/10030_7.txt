I accuse myself of the "Birth of a Nation" - of having begun the long tradition of transvestites in Hollywood history, of which there can only be better examples than this one. In addition to spelling out the names of Custer and his 7th Cavalry, Crazy Horse and the Sioux and President Grant, the geography is accurate and the fact that Custer and his men were wiped out in front of a man, the rest did not that create a ridiculous hyperbole and invention limits. Play as Custer and his wife about the false "gold rush" to excuse the invasion of Sioux territory, Custer's testimony in front of the Congress pleading the rights of the Red Indians and at the top of the page. Custer burst into the president's office to pray to return to his post), honestly, there are still many identical things, some of these almost comical scenes in their corniness ... ... And yet, and yet, it is still a great actor with Flynn as frisky as ever, DeHavilland still attractive, the young Anthony Quinn making his mark in Crazy Horse and director Walsh also blurring forever in his description of crowd scenes and of course tumultuous action scenes . Ford taught us in "Liberty Valance" to believe the legend before the truth. Here, I think we are closer to the legend of the legend but hey, it's just a film and an impressive Hollywood movie and wonderfully enjoyable!
