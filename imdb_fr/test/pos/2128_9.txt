This movie was very cute and totally little girl appropriate. My nieces have watched it all the time since they had it, and I have seen it almost 4 times since the beginning. I can not get enough. CGI images are great to watch, the humor is good and the ballet performances are excellent. Although the screenplay has some holes, no girl will understand them, and as an adult, the movie is so charming that you do not even realize it. Do not forget that this is a Barbie movie and, although sometimes cheesy, it seems to me that this one is up to the high standard that other Barbie Princess movies have put together. I would recommend this to anyone who has a little girl who has always wanted to be a princess. He also teaches a good lesson. Everyone is special and different in their own way and everyone can make a difference.
