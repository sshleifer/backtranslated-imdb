After being fired from their last job and finding a rare job in the UK, the six members of the Wonder Boys, better known as The Crazy Gang, see an advertisement for a job in the city of Red Gulch, located in the Yukon Gold Region, where gold is found. According to a newspaper clipping and on the back, it is said that Chamberlain said that the country should be better prepared for war. They go to the Yukon and The Frozen Limits. <br /> <br /> By the way, this is the case of the lost chamberlains. The break is forty years old and refers to Joe Chamberlain and the Boer War rather than Neville in the current crisis. But that's typical of the way things are going for this crew. I can see Stan Laurel make the same mistake. <br /> <br /> Of course, when they go there, it's a ghost town inhabited only by the young Jean Kent and his grandfather Moore Marriott. He moves forward in the years and is a little touched by the head. Marriott has a gold mine that he has lost in a place where he goes to bed while he sleeps, that is to say when he is sleepwalking. The gang has an interest in helping him find mine or a pretty woman. Mrs. Kent will not marry Anthony Hulme, her faithful trapper, but the salon owner, Bernard Lee, a fate worse than death. <br /> <br /> It was my first experience with The Crazy Gang and I can understand both why they were acclaimed in the UK and why they never had an impact on the pond . The jokes are quick and furious and then a number of things that the Code in the United States simply did not allow. The jokes are also strictly British and would not make much sense here. <br /> <br /> The gags in plain sight are universal, the final scene is worthy of everything the Marx Brothers have done in America. My suggestion is that if you look at The Frozen Limits, save it if you know British history well and run it two or three times to make sure you understand everything. It will be worth it.
