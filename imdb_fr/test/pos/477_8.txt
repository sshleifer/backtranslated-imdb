The actors of this dark film are really credible and well interpreted. The quality of the camera work makes you feel as if you were there. The scenario is intense and does not go astray. The plot is one that makes you want to look at it a second time with the new perspective won by the end. We showed this film to a small group of clients at the Gadsden Center for Cultural Arts. After the movie, all the customers were eager to discuss the movie and someone called me the next day to tell them they were still "upset". Although we have a limit of 18 years old and over, I would watch the film with a group of young people because it is a very real portrait of an ugly situation and sets the stage for a good conversation. .
