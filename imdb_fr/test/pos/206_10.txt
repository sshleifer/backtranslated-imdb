The plot of this film takes place in the most terrible war in the history of humanity: the violent clashes between Germany Adolf Hitler and Soviet Russia from 1941 to 1945. <br /> <br /> With the western regions of their country devastated and 20-30 million Russians killed, the impact of this conflict is felt so far in Russia. And even less so in 1957, when the memories were still very fresh and painful. <br /> <br /> This very black frame contrasts strongly with the fine and coherent style of the beautiful shots of 'Letjat zhuravli'. His simple story deals with human behavior in wartime: bravery, love, patriotism, weakness, cowardice and corruption. All nicely tied together by a toy squirrel. <br /> <br /> Add to that the really beautiful game, and it's easy to understand why this movie is so famous. Really, one of the best ever made. <br /> <br />
