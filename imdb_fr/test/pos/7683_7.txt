I waited 30 years to see this movie. I played the album of the soundtrack as a teenager and in my 20s. Recently, I located a reasonably priced dvdr and watched it this morning. It was widescreen, probably even in 70 mm format, in stereo, the colors were pretty good, very little discolored, certainly not remastered but I am very very happy with this clean copy. <br /> <br /> Now, for the movie. It's pretty good. I would not say it's great, although there are some great scenes. Premminger may not have been the right director, but I will say this. For me, the centerpiece of the film was the hurricane scene. Wonderfully directed by Premminger. One of the best weather scenes of all time. <br /> <br /> In fact, I would go so far as to say that the game scenes are better than the music scenes, not that the musical sequences are bad. Not at all. They were missing ... something though. Perhaps it was due to the fact that there were no close-ups and very few medium shots. It was almost like watching a movie from a theatrical production. Maybe that was the feeling that Premminger was looking for. In the end, this may not have been the right choice, but it is the same. It's far from being a ruined movie. <br /> <br /> That said, not everyone likes the singers of the soundtrack. I still have. They are perfect for this movie. I like singing voices. The casting of the actors' lips is excellent for most. I just wish the songs were staged more imaginatively. The two figures of Sportin 'Life are going well, but the intimate numbers do not even feel intimate. They just feel ... very far away. Despite this, you can not deny the power of music. And in the end, that's what's going on loud and clear. Once again, Premminger may have tried to stay away from the incredible music he was working with. I think he had the right idea but maybe went too far in that direction. <br /> <br /> The acting is fantastic. Congratulations go to the great Brock Peters who plays and plays the role of Crown. He is the ultimate villain. We just want him to leave poor Bess alone, and he does not. As proud, arrogant and mean as it may be, Sammy Davis Jr's classic interpretation of Sportin 'Life is that of the skilled devil himself and the very charismatic one. We can say that it is the best film of Davis. Poor Bess just can not handle two bad guys. I'm glad Hermes Pan gave Davis a tap dance number. <br /> <br /> Dandridge and Poitier, who apparently would not have been impressed by the film, are really very nice together. I do not know about chemistry ... there was more chemistry between Dandridge and Peters than between Dandridge and Poitier. Nevertheless, it worked well for Dorothy and Sidney. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, I think they should both be proud of the work they have done on this film. They both managed to make me more than a tear. Their characterizations were very 3D and credible. Porgy of Sidney Poitier, however, seems almost irrelevant in the catfish line. I could not help but think he was Mr. Braithwaite in "To Sir with Love", very well educated and well mannered, and talked, fallen into hard times. He probably would not have been my first choice for Porgy's role, but hey, he was a huge star at the time, so why not? Dorothy Bess was as perfect as her Carmen Jones, actually even more vulnerable this time around. Carmen was probably the brightest part to do for her. <br /> <br /> A very very good movie, in fact, these are two sticks less than what I would call a classic. This just does not make the ultimate classic note. Yet, nothing explains why the Gershwin estate has decided to keep this film beautiful, even with all its faults, away from the public. Premminger may have made some strange choices as a director, but the film is not shameful and embarrassing for anyone involved. That's what it is and today there are much worse movies that are embarrassing on DVDs and in movie theaters. Porgy and Bess is not one of them.
