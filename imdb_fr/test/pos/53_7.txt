This movie was very good, not great but very good. It is based on a piece to a man from Ruben Santiago Hudson..yes he played most of the roles. On paper, it looks like a waterfall. Yes, let's gather all the blacks in Hollywood and put them together in one movie. Halle Berry even produced it. The only name I did not see was Oprah's, thank God it probably would have looked like a Hallmark movie. Instead, this movie was not a sentimental mess. It was moving but not wrong, the characters came and went with the exception of her husband, Pauline and the writer in question. The film revolved around Nanny's world, Mrs. Bill Crosby, and how she had raised the writer and welcomed people. Now, being a jaded New Yorker when he said that she had taken care of sick and elderly people, and then they were seen going to a mental institution to look for a man. Finding Jobs and Taking Medicare / Caid Checks But no, she explains to Lou Gosset that she only wants $ 25 a week and she does not want any money in advance. I think this part was put in the movie just for us, jaded New Yorkers, so we know she's not ripping off the poor people. and looking through the eyes of a little boy, I can see why. She is married to a young man who is 17 years younger and who does not care about her. Terrence Howard was born to play this type of role. He was good but I would like to see him play something different. Markerson who plays Nanny is also very good. But for some reason, the person who stood out from me was a small role played by Jeffery Wright. Where is this Oscar man? He has already won an Emmy and a Tony. He was in Shaft and he stole the movie. I did not even know who he was in this movie. It is a chameleon never the same. I have never seen him play a bad role yet. It was a 5 minute role and he managed to make me laugh and cry. I saw the scene several times ... once because I did not know who he was. His wife Carman Ejogo was excellent. I saw her in roles before most soft stuff. But she is so good here. In fact, I know people who act like her. So it was very real for me. Macy Gray, who owned one of the biggest games, was also very good. I was very happy they did not kill Nanny. I thought she was a goner at the beginning of the movie. BUT she was able to go home and start her old routine of taking care of people. There are women like that in most of our lives. People we know or live with. Thank God for them, I do not know how they do it all the time. I have a friend who has lost 2 children and has gone through a lot of things, but every time I feel selfishly sorry for myself, I call her and she always puts me in a good mood. This film is a tribute to all these people. I just want them to tell us what happened to some characters like the one who is armed, his boyfriend Paulines, played by one of my favorite actors on The Wire, Omar, the character of Rosie Perez, Richard the lesbian and Delroy Lindo man's arm, he hypnotized in another small role.
