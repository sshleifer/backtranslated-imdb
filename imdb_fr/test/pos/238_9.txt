A long time ago and far, they knew how to make a musical and "Cover Girl" did not escape the rule. <br /> <br /> The story of a dancer in a disco who becomes a cover girl and famous. The old adage applies here: happiness and celebrity do not always mix. <br /> <br /> The dance routines are wonderfully choreographed. What a dance and chemistry between Rita Hayworth and Gene Kelly. <br /> <br /> Otto Kruger is the former gentleman who discovers Hayworth, when he sees his picture that shows a strong resemblance to the woman who left him in the driveway - Hayworth grandmother Maribel. <br /> <br /> Kelly's jealous reaction drives Rusty (Hayworth) into the arms of Broadway producer Lee Bowman. <br /> <br /> The image is basically a story that repeats itself at the end. <To add to the glory of this beautiful film, there is Eve Arden, who still cracks, and the hilarious Phil Silvers, aptly named Genius in the film.
