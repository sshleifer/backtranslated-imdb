Really a very good movie ... I stumbled on it at the video store and rented it because Aaron Eckhart (In the company of men, your friends and your neighbors) was there too, as well as Paulina Porizcova. The charming old swimsuit model in SI Nue in the film, but this is just one of the many reasons to praise it ... It's very exciting, and the character development is fantastic ... Eckhart is one of the most underrated actors working, and steals this movie. ... It's very dark and violent, but I really enjoyed it ....
