Night of the Demons is an excellent film and a great example of the quality of a small budget. Of course, much of it is pretty predictable, but in a way, it's still a lot nicer than the shit we see these days pretending to be "Horror". I give the gore a solid 9, and the liners of the Demons are really fun. I'm still scared by "Stop looking at me!" The soundtrack is well done, I was surprised to hear "Stigmata Martyr" from Bauhaus! There are also very good T & A on the screen, as well as very good makeup effects. The second film in the series is also very good, but avoid the lower third. Night of the Demons may be dated, dark and low-rent, but still has a lot of potential. It's definitely worth renting at least. Give it a chance tonight, stay away from all the old makeup! (you'll understand when you see it!)
