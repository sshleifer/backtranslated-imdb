I do not know what movie or what version Jeff saw, but this whole movie was great, not just Poitier and Going. The story was captivating, suspenseful and appealing. And for the guy who complains about historical accuracy, become real. Yes, there were black assistant marshals in Indian territory, but they were not authorized to arrest whites outside Indian territory. As a general rule, they did not "patrol", but wielded warrants on criminals only. I found it strange that Corby does not seem to have any Indian "friends". I know that their numbers have decreased, but it always seems strange to me. Even though Corby has returned to his people, his Indian cohorts remain faceless and nameless.
