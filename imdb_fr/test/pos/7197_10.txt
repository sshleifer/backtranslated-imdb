I read all the adventures of Asterix and Obelix at least 5 times and I am also a fan of "Dummies" and "The Robins of Wood" and Jamel, so I was expecting a lot of this movie .... and I finally got satisfied. Unlike the first adaptation of Asterix on the big screen (Asterix and Obelix against Caesar) which has not been a great success in addition to the appearance of Laetitia Casta, it really captures the spirit of comics ( and we have the beautiful Monica Bellucci). In the first film, the director tried to be too realistic about when the story unfolds and killed all the spirit that made Asterix hilarious. In this one, all the clothes, the way of speaking and everything is identical to the work of Goscinny and Uderzo ... more, it really sticks to the original story with the disadvantage that we know just about everything that goes happen but Alain Chabat gave us some surprises in the end. I really enjoyed this movie and every time the first sign of trouble starts to appear, Jamel comes in and makes us laugh like crazy. This movie is a great mix of all the kind of humor I really like, and although it may be too much of a mix, I can not help but love it. So, if you love Asterix and the humor of all those young talents who started in "Nowhere Elsewhere", check out this movie.
