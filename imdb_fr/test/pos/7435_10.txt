I really like this movie !!! I have not played Final Fantasy VII yet, but I still loved the movie. It's really funny and I love the work done by dubbing comedians. The graphics are SO fantastic and all the lines are very well done. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that I have a pretty good imagination and that I have been able to fill most of the shortcomings of the film presented, and I suggest you look at it twice because a lot of things "suddenly "have a meaning. <br /> <br /> In addition, (it's pretty funny), you should watch it with the subtitles because what they say and what the submarines say are sometimes completely different. It's really funny, but sometimes it helps you understand what they say best. <br /> <br /> Look at him !!! to love Marnie
