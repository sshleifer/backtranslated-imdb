I do not think I've ever seen a better movie parody. Mel Brooks is crazy. Every time I look at it, I find something new and it makes it even more fun than before. Cary Elwes is perfect for the role of Robin Hood. It has a great and unexpected ending that makes you crack. Every character is great, from Little John and Will to Marian and Broomhilde. I laughed all along and I will never get tired of it. Look at her !! <br /> <br /> If you liked Cary Elwes in this movie, you absolutely must see The Princess Bride.
