This film has its detractors, and Courtney's "fey dresser" can shock some people (who, frankly, need a good head shot) - but the film is first-rate: engaging, poignant, relevant. Finney, of course, is bigger than life. Courtney makes an ideal sheet. I thought the performances were terribly strong in the two main roles, and the character of Courtney has a lot of dark humor. The period is well captured, the distribution of support well chosen. It is to be seen and savored as a good cordial. I only wish that it is already on DVD ... (* sigh *) ...
