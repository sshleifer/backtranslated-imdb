I know this is often said, but I bet you will not regret watching this movie. <br /> <br /> It's great from the beginning to the last second. The acting game (especially that of the mother - played by Judith Light) is so convincing that there are not many films I've seen that can be compared, and it seems impossible to feel nothing for them. characters of this drama. <There are many movies each year, but if you have to choose to see only a few in your life, make one.
