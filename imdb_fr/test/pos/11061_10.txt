I saw this movie for the first time in elementary school in the 1960s. Ingrid Bergman's character fascinated me and it was my introduction to the French Quarter of New Orleans. The first part of the film is the best, because she comes back to take revenge on her father's wife and father (her mother was chased out of favor). During this time, she meets the wonderful Clint Maroon, played by Gary Cooper. The chemistry between the two is great. The second half of the movie is in Saratoga, NY (the Saratoga title) and I never appreciate it as much as New Orleans, but it's still pretty good. I give this film a figure of ten - partly by nostalgia, but mostly because it is an extremely good movie and the characters, besides those of Bergman and Cooper, are just as wonderful (Flora Robson is about to steal the scenes at Bergman). Previously, it was broadcast periodically on television, but rarely, if ever. It would be a good thing that one of the classic movie channels could follow and integrate into its programming cycles.
