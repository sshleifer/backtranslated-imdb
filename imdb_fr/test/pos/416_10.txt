"Ahh ... I did not order any show of success" ..... "We'll have one" Hack is simply the biggest TV show ever made. A little bit of me died when I spun on the TV on a Friday night to catch some Hack and it was not lit. The show deepened the key social issues of our culture. I found this at the end of each episode I watched; I left after being both entertained and informed. I'm actually dumber now that Hack is gone. I no longer want to help the needy and the less fortunate. Since Hack left, I see them as a horror and an unnecessary strain on taxpayers. So, for God's sake, we have to bring back Hack!
