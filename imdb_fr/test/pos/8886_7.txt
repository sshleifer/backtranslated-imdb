Inspired by the concept of the alien Hitchcock, FOREIGN ON A TRAIN, which is to exchange murders between two men in exchange for the elimination of these two people who ruin their lives, THROW MOMMA FROM THE TRAIN is an original and very inventive comedy . Danny DeVito has the merit of having written and played in this jewel of the minor comedy. <br /> <br /> ANNE RAMSEY is the mother who inspired the title of the film and we understand why she puts herself under the skin of DANNY DeVITO. sharp tongue and belittling it relentlessly for any minor offense. BILLY CRYSTAL is the writer whose wife stole the idea from his book and who is now considered a great new author, even appearing on the Oprah show to feast on the adulation he should enjoy. Thus, DeVito has the idea to exchange murders to get rid of these annoying factors. <br /> <br /> Of course, anything can happen when the writer Carl Reiner lets his imagination wander with endless ideas about the development of the plot. And it's fun all along the course, providing lots of laughs and laughter along the way, as well as a lot of suspense. <br /> <br /> For fans of black comedy, this one will please.
