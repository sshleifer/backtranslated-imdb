"Bad dreams always come back as unwanted friends," says Marion Fairlie, who lives with her half-sister, Laura, in a vast Victorian winery. "And last night, I ended up in Limmeridge cemetery, normally the dead people are dead, just as it is usually the criminals who are locked up rather than the victims." But then, nothing happened to us has not happened to us. "And we leave for a story of first-class gothic madness, deception, and malice, based on Wilkie Collins' great novel about the Victorian mystery. It's a good idea to be very careful, because there are plots in the plots, but they're all centered on a cunning and ruthless system that involves, what, money, a lot of money. <br /> <br /> Marion Fairlie (Tara Fitzgerald) and her sister, Laura Fairlie (Justine Wadell) are dedicated. Marion is fierce and protective; Laura is sweeter and much more romantic. Marion does not have any money. Laura will inherit wealth when she comes of age. Marion has no marriage prospect we know; Some time ago, Laura devoted herself to Sir Percival Glyde (James Wilby), an aristocrat quite too charming. They are the protectors of their uncle, a meticulous hypochondriac, condescending, immensely egocentric (Ian Richardson). It all seems like a routine, but a young artist, Walter Hartright (Andrew Lincoln), is hired to teach them how to draw and appreciate art. And when he arrives at the local train station at night, there is no car, so he goes on foot to the estate. In the dark woods, he meets a strange woman dressed in white, wandering and talking about things that he does not understand, which then disappear. Are we worried? Yes, and the same goes for the sisters when they realize that the strange woman looks a lot like Laura. Later, is love born between Walter and Laura? Does a bud bloom? Is there a misunderstanding that sends Walter back and leads Laura to marry Sir Percival? Can a chancre gnaw? And the secrets are unfolding little by little about the relationship between Laura, Marian and the woman in white ... do we learn to be deeply suspicious of Sir Percival's intentions ... do we come to appreciate the style and the manners of the close friend of Sir Percival Count Fosco (Simon Callow) ... and finally we realize the filthy depths of depravity, as well as the power of honor and true love, of which humanity is able? Should we visit Victorian insane asylums, see the falls of high towers, dig open graves in the middle of the night, and watch the vengeance come amidst the flames of a locked church? <br /> <br /> Of course, and it's a great trip for us. <br /> <br /> This program of the BBC / Masterpiece Theater presents exceptional values ​​and exceptional production. In order to adapt Collins' more than 500-page novel to a television show of less than 120 minutes, a good deal had to be cut or abridged and some changes were likely to have a greater impact in the short time available. Nevertheless, in my opinion, the production of The Woman in White works very well as a dark, romantic and gloomy television tale. Tara Fitzgerald as Marion gives a remarkable performance as a determined woman to protect and save her sister. James Wilby, as Sir Percival, achieves the clever feat of slowly letting us see the depraved drool under the skin, which always has charm in the middle of the ugly. Ian Richardson, the uncle of the young woman, almost steals the show. He gives such an authoritative and pungent performance that he almost unbalances the story every time he appears. Simon Callow, as Count Fosco, is perhaps the weakest of the protagonists. The count is simply a monster, yet extremely civilized and charming. Collins described it as being of immense size. Callow does a good job, but for me, he misses a bit of the monstrosity of evil. <br /> <br /> At one point, Marian tells us: "My sister and I love the gothic novels so much that we sometimes act as if we were there." She did not know what was waiting for her and Laura.
