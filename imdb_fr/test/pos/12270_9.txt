It was a very good surprise. I got up late last night and could not fall asleep. I did not really think twice, I turned on my television and HBO was on, and this movie was just beginning. Fortunately, I have seen everything and I am very happy to have done so. Because this movie was very good. The actors were well chosen and they did a surprisingly good job. Kris Kristofferson delivered a solid performance, there was a lot of substance behind his lines. This film made me understand that he is a good actor. Brian Keith was great as a father, as well as Trey Wilson in the role of colonel (it was Trey Wilson's last role before his untimely death.) Too bad, he was a quality actor and looked like a nice boy). Jobeth Williams also did a good job as Kristofferson's American wife. Regarding direction, I did not know that Franklin J. Schaffner was the director before reading the review in Leonard Maltin's Movie Guide (this was the last film he made). Now, I understand why this movie was so good. Schaffner also directed Patton, a very good movie (I did not see his other movie, Papillon). As I watched "Welcome Home", I thought, "This director really knows what he's doing", without knowing that Schaffner realized it. There is a very beautiful scene in a shelter for Thai orphans, enough to make me cry. Not only was it sensitively directed, but it was also done in a very economical and tense way. Schaffner's efforts do not waste anything. The scenario was one of the reasons why this movie is so good. The author does not weigh down the actors with too many lines. It was written very simply but very effectively. This shows you that much can be said in a few words. This film also made me proud to be American, while showing how beautiful ALL people are.
