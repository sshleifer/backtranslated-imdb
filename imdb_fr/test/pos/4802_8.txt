you know I saw a lot of rotten hong kong movies in terms of production and they were good. But lack of time was excellent. <br /> <br /> I think what makes it so good is the fact that Andy Lau and Ching Wang have such chemistry. The film at the beginning is very fast but does not slow down enough to even notice what is also good, we do not want to make a heart attack, lol. Regarding the plot, there are enough activities going on for you to stay interested. Lau has a good time while using makeup to imitate people from the underworld. The film also has the best oriental support cast since "The House of Flying Daggers". <br /> <br /> The movie is awesome because it's so unpredictable and lets you marvel at every corner. Definitely a good rental with tons of comedy, action and thrills pact in a, 8 out of 10
