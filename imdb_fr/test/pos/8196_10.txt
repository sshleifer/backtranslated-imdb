After watching the movie several times, I found many subtle touches and emotions in the dialogue. Jing Ke, the assassin has become one of the favorite movie characters of all time. This handsome Chinese actor says more with his look and his economy of words and movements than any American big screen actor today. Qin, the emperor, is brilliant because he leads the public to believe in the kindness of his heart, only to trigger the most cruel acts against the people around him. The promises he makes with incredible passion and broken with a devilish fist. Gong Li, as in almost every film in which I have seen it, is just fantastic. His dominance on the screen is so graceful and emotionally charged. <br /> <br /> In case you do not know, I loved this movie. <br /> <br />
