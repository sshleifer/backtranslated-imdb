On the surface, TMHS seems to be another generic drama for high school; but surprisingly hidden below, there are immense amounts of depth, originality and eccentricities that will make it not only unforgettable to the viewer, but will also make it unquestionably one of the best anime that the media has produced these last years. <br /> <br /> We see the world through the eyes of Kyon who, on her first day of high school, met Haruhi Suzumiya, a girl who boldly asserts to the rest of the class that she has no interest in "normal human beings". Off randomly invites strangers, time travelers, sliders or espers to join her. Kyon looks in disbelief, wondering if he is not joking or if he has some screws in place. However, defying his instinct, he begins to talk to him. In doing so, it soon becomes clear that she is not an ordinary high school student. Shortly after, she creates her own school club called "SOS Brigade" and leads Kyon among the unfortunate to attend. <br /> <br /> Nothing in this anime is consistent with usual conventions, Kyon the protagonist is a pessimist too cynical, and contributes to a spiritual narrative to the series. A character far from the usual male main characters in 2D who tends to populate the support. The episodes themselves are not chronological and oblige the viewer to reflect on the events that unfold and their relationship with previous instances. It's a stroke of genius. the effect is like a puzzle, when a new piece is put, we have a better idea of ​​the situation as a whole. Whole new meanings are now given to previous scenes and their realization is deeply satisfying. This means, however, that he feels disarticulated (that's all but), a very skillfully written script has worked around this problem and made sure it flows smoothly from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> The story itself is surprisingly original. but I'm not going to go further than the simple nude plot that I gave earlier, because it will definitely spoil him. However, what I will mention is that the plot encompasses a wide range of genres, ranging from comedy to science fiction. The way they managed to accomplish that in fourteen episodes is beyond my abilities, which is definitely a feat in itself. <br /> <br /> TMHS is a real gem that has such diversity and depth that it will attract just about anyone interested in anime. Observe it, which is rather unusual, because it corresponds to the huge hype it has received - and even beyond.
