This is not really a criticism, but a testament proving that, once again, the Academy has rewarded money, not an artistic achievement. And I must say that I am saddened by the fact that this usually artistic and intelligent group of imbd members has left this group among the top 250. Boogie Nights is powerful, raw and daring through scripting, direction and actors. Very few films can claim this triple crown.
