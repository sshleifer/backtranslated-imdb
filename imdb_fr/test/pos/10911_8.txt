While amusing and entertaining for the gay public, Frank Oz's "In and Out" about a gay teacher locked up on national television by a former student was disinfected and deodorized to appeal to the larger, more profitable viewers who attended "The bird cage". While the audience may have been pleased to be tolerant and liberal enough to watch the film, it revolves around Howard Brackett, Kevin Kline, who is a grossly stereotypical homosexual. The film states that the tendency to dance to disco music, to enjoy Barbra Streisand's films and to dress well indicates his sexual orientation. As in "Queer Eye", the film actually has a slap against heterosexual men and stereotypes calling them "nonchalant", "quick-witted", lack of taste and culture. OK, so "In and Out" is just a comedy, but even comedies send messages that can hurt. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, at the center of the movie's humor is a somewhat pathetic character. Howard is a middle-aged man, deeply locked up or self-sacrificing, and obviously never had a sex life. A three-year engagement with a school teacher where he works is described as a series of sunsets, long discussions and viewing of "Funny Lady". Fortunately, Joan Cusack plays the role of Howard, Emily Montgomery, and she steals the show everywhere. Most of the funniest moments in the movie belong to him, although Kline's attempts to resist the dance in a band of instructions about macho behavior are hilarious. He is a talented physical performer, but the film only leaves him a few moments to shine. Matt Dillon also stands out by becoming an actor. The clip of his film about an Oscar-nominated gay soldier is hysterical. However, despite the film's gay theme, there is no boy-boy romance, and only one kiss between men, and this scribble is about as erotic as that between Michael and Fredo Corleone in "Godfather II". <br /> <br /> Although well intentioned, "In and Out" does not solve the injustices and prejudices it illustrates. Howard is dismissed from his teaching position despite his outstanding performance and skills, but little indignation is expressed. Most of the characters are more dissatisfied with the annulled marriage than with Howard's self-realization, which seems to be happening overnight, and his brutal and unfair dismissal. Unsurprisingly, Howard's parents, seductively interpreted by Debbie Reynolds and Wilford Brimley, and his students stand up to support him. However, the sweet finale is as embarrassing to the audience as it is to Howard Brackett in the film. The film would have been more refreshing if it had revolved around a homosexual man disguised as a football fan, taking a break, listening to country music and living in fast food restaurants. Despite good performances and fun situations, "In and Out" perpetuates stereotypes and, whether positive or negative, they must be thrown into the garbage of social history.
