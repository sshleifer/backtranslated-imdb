This film seems to have been set up in a few days, a bit like Plan 9 of outer space. Despite this, it remains a classic ranking among my favorite creature features. ************************** Counts Dracula and Larry Talbot; aka Wolfman, arrive at Dr. Edelman's lab looking for a cure for their nocturnal antisocial behaviors, such as the killing of people. Meanwhile, Dr. Edelman gently discovers the body of the monster Frankenstein. Becoming obsessed with bringing him back to life (a common trait of scientists, be it crazy or not), he goes against his judgment, causing chaos and madness monster. One of the last universal classics of his time (Abbot and Costello Meet Frankenstein followed 3 years later), he gets a 10 with this review. Onslow Steven steals the show as a good doctor who has gone bad after being infected with Dracula's blood and becoming a half-werewolf / vampire creature, which has come to a tragic end. At 1 hour 7 min. he's packing a punch. A valuable addition to my video collection. <br /> <br /> Rating: ***** out of *****
