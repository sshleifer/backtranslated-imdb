I absolutely fell in love with this girl. let me tell you something: I come from Romania and here is only the sixth series that runs on American TV every other day. I check the internet and download it from there. So I am in line with the rest of the world. I can not believe how deep I am in this show. I'm starting to know everything about them. I looked on the Internet what car is Rory's car, what are their names and things like that: Rory is also Leigh and Lorelay is Victoria. I can not understand why but my boyfriend does not like them and I try to make him see how wonderful they are but without success, but he understands me and allows me to stay with my "obsession" with the Gilmore Girls . I love them. I really hope that if someone sees that's what will try them: you will not regret it
