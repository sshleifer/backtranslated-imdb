"The Pharaoh's Army" challenges the formula. Instead of selling for clich√©s and big stars, he relies entirely on the excellent acting of the actors, on the strength of a well-written script and a fascinating and bitter history. The result is a raw and realistic film that advances quickly, with a strong emotional flow. One of the best I've ever seen about the American Civil War, and I think it can be well-known for the pleasure of being an independent film (if you like this movie, try to see the as brilliant and independent film "Wicked Spring" of Civil War "Pharaoh" simply tells the true story of a small team of Union men working in an expedition or fodder that goes to a Confederate farm to take provisions but gets stuck because of an accident one of the men.The tensions grilling and relationships are made and broken.Nothing happens as Hollywood would write.This movie comes from the mind of someone who cares the quality of the film and storytelling A superb presentation of dialogue and intrigue allows you to browse a film that looks very professional, but often does not feel like watching a movie, but rather to hear a story. <br /> <br /> The f ilm has an amazing performance by Chris Cooper that shows amazing versatility in exploring his role. It is transforming, but is always up to the credibility and is easy to relate emotionally. Patricia Clarkson is just as stellar and realistic in a role as many actresses would have collapsed. She shares an interesting chemistry with Cooper's character and, where she is the most severe character, is still easy to identify. The rest of the cast is quite capable and fulfills its roles well. <br /> <br /> The art and scenography are beautiful, and I personally like the cinematograph. All this gives the impression of a photograph of the era of the Civil War, the camera with shadows and strong contrasting colors and a tin-like metallic hue, while retaining the naturalistic appearance of the decor. rustic. They seem to have used natural lighting, but what they used works wonders. It seems that everything has its place where it is, it feels like a period, something that I find rare in American period films. The actors play the 19th century, not like the people of the 20th century dressed in old clothes. <br /> <br /> This film is above all very personal. I think that as an india he can afford it. The film is almost impeccable with an exceptional storyline that effortlessly creates and explores the relationships and personalities of these characters and allows them to grow up in a situation as bad as it is. It does not fail to convey the message, and it does so without the usual and overused techniques that are used in all war movies nowadays. It's courageous. It is based on characters, a fantastic scenario, human emotions and the fact that the American Civil War was not only CGI, big stars and hoop skirts.
