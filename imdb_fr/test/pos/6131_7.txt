It's a really amazing story and the most amazing part of it all is that it REALLY Happens! In case you have not noticed it, it is based on a true story. <br /> <br /> (Spoiler possible) <br /> <br /> Imagine the shock and the horror of discovering that your own father was once an SS. officer in the Second World War. <br /> <br /> It's a very intriguing story and I'm really surprised that the movie is rated at 5.3 ugly here on imdb.com. <br /> <br /> my score: 7
