This film is one of my best childhood memories. Seeing the Muppets (at the height of their popularity) heading to Hollywood, singing and dancing, with Miss Piggy closely watching her beloved Kermit, Fozzie Bear doing her best as manager of each, and a generous cast "Supplements" delivering a movie that was "okey dokey". <br /> <br /> Kermit's melancholic Ukulele "Rainbow Connection" was nominated for an Oscar that year, but was defeated by Norma Rae's "It Goes Like It Goes". I will choose the Kermit song every day! Get the kids and enjoy this timeless fantasy ... someday they will find it, the rainbow connections, the lovers, the dreamers and me!
