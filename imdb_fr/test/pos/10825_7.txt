Interesting set of stories, this little film manages to bring together characters and stories seemingly different, against the backdrop of the Second World War, and manages to bring them closer without losing the public. I was impressed by the depth illustrated by the different characters and by the real feeling of understanding them and understanding their motivations, even if the time devoted to the development of each character was very limited. The exceptional acting abilities of the people involved in this image are easily noticeable. A fun and stylish movie with a multitude of comic moments and a plethora of even more impressive acts. <br /> <br /> 7/10
