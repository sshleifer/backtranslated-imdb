One of the main aspects of "Malenkaya Vera" (called "Little Vera" in English) is that it is the first film of the Soviet Union presenting a scene of sex, even short. The title is important: Vera is the Russian word for "faith", identifying that the punk Vera (Natalya Negoda) has little confidence in the Soviet system. And as the movie shows, there is not much confidence in it. The opening scene shows the sad industrial city of Zhdanov, almost a hell on earth. When Sergei (Andrey Sokolov), Vera's lover, moves in with her family, unexpected events occur. <br /> <br /> As in many Russian films, the names of people describe their characters. For example, there is Viktor (remember that "winner" means winner). Overall, it's a good glimpse of the Soviet Union as it collapsed - and we can see why it collapsed. Very well.
