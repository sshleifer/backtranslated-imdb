The main advantage of this film is the combination of Chris Farley and David Spade. This was the first film in which this comedy duo showed their humor brand Laurel-and-Hardy-esque. Farley's obvious physical skills in physical comedy are perfectly complemented by Spade's sarcastic view of every situation in which they find themselves. <br /> <br /> This film differs from other comedy films. Tommy Boy classifies with Blues Brothers as a comic story whose scenes and individual elements are derived from the plot, rather than being used to break the storyline and give the film a sense of disconnection, as do so much other comic films. Thanks to Sagal's excellent staging, each scene is tight and foreshadows or immediately plays the story told. He deserves as much of the movie's hilarity as Farley and Spade. Actors from Dennehy, Lowe, Ackroyd and many others (see the gas station attendant 22 km from Davenport) reinforce the film. <br /> <br /> can be overshadowed by Farley / Spade. <br /> <br /> I think this movie is very well done and it's the funniest movie I've ever seen.
