I just saw this movie for the first time last night. Wow! What movie! This is the kind of movie everyone wants to see because it's so cool and interesting. <br /> <br /> I do not want to say a word of the plot, I think it would be better. for people to go cold. DO NOT READ THE SUMMARY OF THE FIELD before watching the movie! All I'm going to say is that Eastwood, Malkovich, Peterson and Jeff Maguire's script are top notch. I wish all thrillers were more like this one.
