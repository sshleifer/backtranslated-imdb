Black Scorpion is a fun movie about a female superheroine who wears leather tights and drives a car that can turn into her Scorpion armored mobile. She is fighting against the evil Breathtaker and all this is a great recipe for a good time in my humble opinion. I loved the fact that she had to say "Yo" for the car's computer to take over! Breathtaker is so mean that he wants to give asthma to the whole city! It's so exaggerated and it's the beauty of it! The scene where Black Scorpion "attacks" his partner steals the show. You will know it when you see it. This DVD also contains a fun interview with Joan Severance. It's a doll. Black Scorpion is a fun DVD. I loved!
