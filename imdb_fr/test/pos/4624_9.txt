2:37 is an intense and fascinating drama that has similarities in tone and subject with films like Bully, Elephant and Kids (although, in my opinion, 2:37 is a film superior to these three films) . film, my expectations were neutral, but I finally made a good impression thanks to the intelligent scenario, the perfect staging of Murali K. Thalluri and the excellent performances of a group of young actors. <br /> <br /> Sporadic instances of school violence around the world have inspired many films, television programs and books that claim to find and predict the external or internal reasons for these unbridled expressions of rebellion and discontent. ..and especially madness.Some will say that 2:37 arrives too late for this artistic movement; However, I do not think so, because this delay allowed the film to do a more artistic analysis, focusing on the situation with more subtlety and intelligence instead of the obvious reaction of cruelty and anxiety that imbued with other films of similar stories. /> <br /> On the characters from 2:37, there are some clich√©s of the juvenile cinema (from the film of the director and screenwriter John Hughes -RIP- to the horror movies for teenagers): the beautiful "princess", clumsy "nerd", unfriendly athletes, etc.It would have been very easy to make them become hollow caricatures defined by their function in the scenario; but it's something admirable that the script transcends stereotypes to make them real people with credible problems that, more or less, anyone can find on his way to maturity. <br /> <br /> 2:37 is an excellent film whose only failure is that the end feels a little affected, but that compensates for that with a lot of positive elements. It will be very interesting to see the next projects Thalluri, since he had a very good start with this film.
