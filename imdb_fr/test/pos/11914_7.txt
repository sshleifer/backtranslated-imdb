Toy Soldiers is a good action film, but what really stands out is the efforts the screenwriters and director have made to accurately portray US counterterrorism forces. Just look at the end credits - there are more than a dozen US officers and officers listed. The film accurately portrays the FBI as having control of the hostage-taking but the transferor to the US Army's Delta Force (which is not named in the film since the Pentagon still denies their existence at that time). there) once the President has overruled the US Posse Commitatus Act Code. The US Army forces at the end are properly dressed and armed for the time. And even using an Apache AH-64 for air support - which may seem a bit excessive - is not terribly unrealistic. Much more expensive and frankly better films have portrayed US counter-terrorism forces with much less precision.
