I decided to watch this free on FearNet on demand because I thought so, nothing else seemed nice. And it turned out to be a good little horror surprise! The film is an anthology of four urban legends told from the point of view of four teenagers whose car breaks down in the middle of nowhere. After deciding to camp in the woods, they begin to tell their spooky stories and movie transitions based on the stories told in the stories. <br /> <br /> The Honeymoon - a newlywed couple traveling through the bus Las Vegas is terrified when they park in a forested area by evil beings who hunt on a full moon. (I will not spoil it for you!) The Hook - Amy Smart and James Marsden (probably the most famous characters of the movie besides the beautiful Christine Taylor) play the young couple who is in front of a hooked maniac for a shot in this most recognizable short film. <br /> <br /> People can lick - this is probably the scariest and darkest story. A girl chats with another girl on the Internet, but it turns out that it's actually a man obsessed with it. He breaks into the house when she is alone. It was really scary. <br /> <br /> The Locket - It's also a beautiful story with Glen Quinn and Jacinda Barrett, who play the role of a motorcyclist and a beautiful dumb girl terrorized by the ghosts of the previous century in a mysterious farm house. It was good, but it was the weakest entry. <br /> <br /> The group around the campfire slowly develops its own terrifying experience in its segments between stories, and the end of this film is surprising and really great! Overall, it's not scary, but it's certainly a big guilty pleasure that horror lovers would certainly find helpful.
