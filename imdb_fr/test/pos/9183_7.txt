Exactly, a serious viewer should not expect much further from this title but, quite surprisingly, Smith, Mendes, James and Valletta managed to achieve a theatrical performance that could be metaphorically summed up in their rap dance routine at the end of the year. movie. : their characters have formed an effective combo that could make you laugh with this DVD of Sunday afternoon, provided that your appointment is not an exquisite, a Franco-Swedish director of the directors of the 60s. <br /> <br /> PS: The techniques for scoring are all TRUE, especially the "cocktail girl" routine!
