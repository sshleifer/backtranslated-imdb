It is quite an accomplishment that three stories filmed by three very different filmmakers can simultaneously be so instructive about the relationships between homosexuals and bisexuals and their difficulties! <br /> <br /> "Pool Days" deals with the clumsiness of adolescence and the mutual attraction between an older man and a younger man. A story about experience and vulnerability! <br /> <br /> "A Friend of Dorothy" describes a common dilemma that many gay and bisexual people experience at some point in their lives: the intense attraction of a heterosexual person. Sensitively examined, this story really left me moved! <br /> <br /> "The disco years" shows another version of a dead end: to get involved with someone who not only understands his sexual orientation, but also terrified of being exposed as another thing that right! A very exciting story for those of us who have experienced betrayal from a sexually confused and frightened person! <br /> <br /> If these three stories are of interest to everyone who is interested in others, they will give psychological power to those who consider themselves gay, bisexual or in search of sex. Each story is uplifting in its own way!
