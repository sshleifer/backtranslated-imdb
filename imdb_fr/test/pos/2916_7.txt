I'll start at the beginning saying "I like this movie". It's fast, it's great, it's catchy and it's fun. Sinhue, the doctor, sits in front of his little stone hut writing his memoirs. And what a story it is! Taken from a river and raised by an elderly couple who love him, he becomes a doctor for the poor. He befriends Horemheb who sees glory while Sinhue sees healing. And both come up against the future pharaoh Anknaten (forgive my spelling), who suffers an epileptic fit. <br /> <br /> And this Pharaoh has another "defect": he believes in a god instead of a pantheon of gods. At the time, it was totally revolutionary. Sinhue and Horemheb grow up. One night, Sinhue sees a woman who makes him lose his mind. He abandons his practice, sells his parents' house and even their tombs just to spend a night with her. Is he? I will not tell anything. Meanwhile, Merit, a maid in a tavern playing with simplicity and simplicity by Jean Simmons, falls in love with Sinhue. She falls under her spell and under the spell of belief in a god. <br /> <br /> Victor Mature exaggerates perfectly like Horemheb. Edmond Purdom is sincere as Sinhue the lost doctor (does he find redemption? Stay tuned). Even Bela Darvi, the woman who steals Sinhue's heart is not as bad as everyone has said. The fact that she is the mistress of Daryl F. Zanuck has nothing to do with casting - is it? Yeah, all right ... but she was not so bad _ I saw worse. I think she did better in "The Egyptian" than many young actresses today have done in anything. I already said it and I repeat it - I like this film. I recommand it. This makes you think despite some martial actions. Have fun with this movie. it's worth it.
