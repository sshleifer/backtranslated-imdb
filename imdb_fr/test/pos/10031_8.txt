Warner Brothers' second historical drama, which portrays the American Civil War and the Battle of Little Big Horn, General George Armstrong Custer, is even more precise; they died with their boots (Warner Brothers, 1941); especially when compared to SANTA FE TRAIL (Warner Brothers, 1940), who did not really set the bar very high. <br /> <br /> Although the two images are flagship vehicles for Errol Flynn, the cast changed the part of General Custer. While it was "Dutch", Ronald Reagan himself described the flamboyant and egomaniacal horseman in the previous picture, Mr. Flynn playing the role of Virginian and, later, the Confederate General Hero, J.E.B. (or Jeb) Stuart; Errol played the role of Custer for ILY DEATH OF YOUR BOOTS. <br /> <br /> Once again, the propensity of the Warner Brothers to use a large number of characters from reliable characters of the "Warner's Repertory Company" is used to give the film is a kind of authenticity, and all is really happening before our eyes. The main roles are played by more famous actors and actresses, such as: Elizabeth Bacon / Mrs. Custer (Olivia de Havilland), Ned Sharpe (Arthur Kennedy), Samuel Bacon (Gene Lockhart), Chief Crazy Horse (Anthony Quinn), "Californy" (Charlie Grapwin), Major Taipe (Stanley Ridges), General Phillip Sheridan (John Litel ), Callie (Bacon's maid, Hattie McDaniel). <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast is filled with uncredited but talented players such as: Joe Sawyer, Eleanor Parker, Watson Miner, Tod Andrews, Irving Bacon, Roy Barcroft, Chandler Lane, Spencer Charters, Frank Ferguson Francis Ford, William Forrest, George Eldridge, Russell Hicks, William Hopper, Hoppity Hooper, Eddie Keane, Fred Kelsey, Sam McDaniel, Patrick McVey, Frank Orth, Eddie Parker, Ray Teal, Addison Richards, Jim Thorpe (All-American) same), Minerva Urecal, Dick Wessel, Gig Young and many others. <br /> <br /> The film moves very fast, especially at the beginning; and then a kind of necessity slowdown as the story advances in the post-civil war years, Custer's assignment as a colonel in the 7th Cavalry and ultimate fate at Little Horn, Montana. Under the direction of Griffith Veteran director Raoul Walsh, the film provokes extremely varied emotions. exciting and exciting battle scenes and compelling historical scenes; looking as though they were Matthew Brady Civil War Photos. As in most of Mr. Walsh's films, he punctuates and finishes the end of many scenes with a little humor; but do not exaggerate and risk thus turning the film into a comedy (farce, in fact). <br /> <br /> As mentioned before, it's a lot more factual than its predecessor, SANTA FE TRAIL (last time I'll talk about it, honest Schultz, Scout's Honor!). However, this does not mean that it is not without some small licenses of artistic and literary license; as will be practically the case of all Biopic. It would be impossible to make a film of this type if all the facts and the most erroneous inclusion and the most obvious invocation of the literary license is perhaps the case that Custer would be accidentally promoted to the rank of brigadier general. . However, the "gag" helped advance the film, while highlighting the light and carefree feeling that reigned at the beginning of the film. <br /> <br /> The director Walsh and Mr. Flynn collaborated to give us what would appear to be a characterization of this legendary hero of the Civil War who was very close to the real man. And they did it in addition to the re-enactment of an incident, namely the massacre of Lakota Sioux, Custer's Cheyenne and Fukowi, and his 7th Little Horned Cavalry. At the time of his appearance on June 25, 1876, "Custer's Last Fight" was an incident as big and shocking to the American national psyche as the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor (December 7, 1941) or the atrocities perpetrated by the Islamic Fascists visit the twin commercial towers of New York and the headquarters of the United States Armed Forces at the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia on September 11, 2002. <br /> <br /> JUST in as many films from this period of the Second World War. (and previous years), there were so many incidents that were, if not intentionally, demonstrations of virtues that would be needed in another world conflict, as we were in the days when they were dead BOOTS ON completed its original theatrical release. <br /> <br /> POODLE SCHNITZ !!
