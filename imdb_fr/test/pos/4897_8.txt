I just saw 'The League of Gentlemen: Apocalypse' during a special screening in Manchester, in the presence of Mark Gatiss and Reece Shearsmith of the League. <br /> <br /> In the background was Peter Kay (who briefly filmed) heckling affectionately in the back during the Q & A session after the movie. <br /> <br /> The movie was complicated (in a good way) and very, very funny. He follows Geoff Tipps, Hilary Briss and Herr Lipp in their attempt to save Rosyton Vasey's fiction from the disinterest of their creators. <br /> <br /> The League plays a wide range of characters and themselves (or characters based on themselves)) and are ably supported by the cream of British actors of character and comedy such as Bernard Hill, Victoria Wood and David Warner. <br /> <br /> Warner is particularly remarkable, which reminds me of his sweet and punchy turn in 'Time Bandits'. <br /> <br /> The film comes in and out of various realities and gives the people of Rosyton Vasey a little space to develop beyond the usual limits of their shtick comedy. <br /> <br /> Herr Lipp, Steve Pemberton, has a great time in Brittany towards the end of the film and must make a decision about his purpose and meaning in life, which makes his throat feel dizzy. an unexpected moment and surprises you with his tender affection for the characters. <br /> <br /> It echoes something that Mark and Reece said in the After Question Period, we realize that the plot of the league that is tired of its famous characters is misleading and that the whole movie is really a love letter to them. <br /> <br /> For a format that started out as a radio-sketch character based show, these guys really evolved the idea up to support a film that takes you on a journey through fiction , "reality", comedy, tragedy and a pleasurable journey for two of the less obvious characters to bear a long story form drawn from their some 70 existing creations. <br /> <br /> The fans of the show will love it. It is worthwhile to devote attention and attention to detail to the uninitiated. The uninitiated may be a little lost, but the joy of the LoG has always been to be able to agree almost instantly on his characters extremely observed and to cross the stylistic jump in tribute to the prank and the expressionist film. <br /> <br /> There are many tributes in this one, including "The Shining" and "Beauty and the Beast", to name but two, which I noticed and which demonstrate Cleverly their love of cinema and history with a segment The England of the 1690s makes perfect sense when you are engaged in the film. <br /> <br /> What can I say? I am amazed, stunned, emotional and sneering from the beginning. They definitely did what many failed. A successful British television comedy for cinema translation. <br /> <br /> If you have already watched and enjoyed the "League of Gentlemen", go see it; you will enjoy. <br /> <br /> If this is not the case, rent / buy a DVD, then go see it. <br /> <br /> Congratulations guys and thank you for the lovely and fun Q & A.
