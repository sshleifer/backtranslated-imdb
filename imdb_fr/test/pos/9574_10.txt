It's the funniest movie I've ever seen. However, I laughed a lot watching a lot of movies. Indeed, the genius of Best In Show does not lie in the slapstick or the one-liners, but in a sophisticated and stratified spirit. The improvised dialogue is so fast that you end up not laughing at each joke, but only after several jokes are built, disarming your senses until the jokes reach their climax and you can not let yourself go . <br /> <br /> It's a well-shot film, but what makes it extraordinary is the acting game. I was impressed during my first viewing, but when I watched it after learning that almost every scene was improvised, I was amazed. It was really nice to see the comedians contradict each other, build jokes from scratch and immerse themselves completely in their characters. <br /> <br /> I guess the golden days of Second City were like that.
