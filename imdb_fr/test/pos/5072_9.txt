Some movies are only meant to entertain you, others to make you laugh, cry, or raise you; others, like this one, are meant to provoke, make you think, and make you angry. I was angry during this film, not against the film, but against the fact that it was true, that America, the free, tortured in the illogical view that it did it for the greater good. The torture scenes in this film were heartbreaking, the indifference of people was overwhelming, the film was convincing in its argument and showed how bad it was to torture people. Of course, that makes me a "bleeding liberal" label flouted by people who do not think about reality, but that should not happen. People who do not realize that, as the film has said, for every person tortured, it takes ten or a hundred people to get up to perform acts of revenge. You have a cycle of violence becoming more important. This film did not make me hate America, although I could see how it could do it, but it made me hate the way America reacted in its post-9/11 world. There is an important quote in the movie. Right after we learned that 19 people died and 75 people were injured at the bomb scene, the quote is "An American is dead" - that makes the difference. You can not kill an American, America can kill thousands of people, but you can not kill a single American, otherwise they will do whatever is necessary, including torture to do justice. It's the American way apparently. Call me a liberal, call me naive (even though I think people who believe that torture is good are naive) call me illusion, call me how you want, but this film is a shining example of what do not go to America and the West today. I wish this film to be shown to all students, at a minimum. This film will stay with me a long time, a part of me would like to forget it, because I wish that kind of thing never happens, but I know that it is the case, the other part of me that I do not would never forget, because we must remember these shameful events to prevent them from reproducing. Anyway, this film will be with me for a long time, and I will tell everyone I know to watch it, not for entertainment, but to be provoked, because sometimes we all have to be provoked.
