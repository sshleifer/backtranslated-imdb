In general, there are few things as discouraging as Hollywood's attempts to be brave. Mixing cautiousness and heaviness, the "message films" are clapping their backs for daring to tackle major problems. CROSSFIRE is not entirely free from this defilement; this includes a sermon on the nature of insensate hatred that is embarrassing, assuming a level of naivety in its audience that is depressing to contemplate. Until 1947, it was a big problem for a film to announce that anti-Semitism existed and that it was bad. (It was obviously unthinkable for Hollywood to deal with the true subject of the book on which the film was based - its victim was a homosexual.) Nevertheless, thanks to good writing and excellent acting, CROSSFIRE remains a persuasive examination of we would now call a hate crime. <br /> <br /> The post-war malaise was one of the major components of the film noir, and CROSSFIRE deals directly with it. The film takes place in Washington, DC, among soldiers still in uniform but inactive, spending their time playing poker and poking around bars. Joseph Samuels (Sam Levene), an intelligent and kind Jew, explains that the end of the war created a vacuum: all the energy used to hate and fight the enemy is now blurred and bottled. Samuels meets three soldiers in a bar: the sensitive Mitchell, who is on the verge of a nervous breakdown, the Floyd Bowers with lack of will and Montgomery, a big bold tyrant who badly belittles a young Tennessee soldier like a stupid mountain man. The three soldiers meet at Samuels's apartment, where Monty, the drunkard, becomes more and more violent and calls his host a "Jewish boy". Samuels is beaten to death and Mitchell disappears, becoming the main suspect of the murder. <br /> <br /> Deciphering the crime, detective Finlay (Robert Young), dry and ready for anything, as well as Sergeant Keeley (Robert Mitchum), a thoughtful and experienced friend who knows that Mitchell is incapable of murder. Ginny (Gloria Grahame), a nightclub hostess who met Mitchell and gave him the key to his apartment, and Floyd (Steve Brodie), a witness to the crime, are terrified in a shabby house. Although there is no real "whodunit" suspense, the story remains captivating and the tense trap for the killer is extremely intelligent. <br /> <br /> The strong black atmosphere prevents the film from feeling didactic or moralistic. Cinematography is a striking play of shadows, with dark reflections and subdued lighting, rooms often lit by a single lamp filtered by cigarette smoke. The lassitude of the world is as widespread as black lighting. "Nothing interests me," Finlay said softly. "For nothing", is Ginny's toast in the nightclub. Gloria Grahame, the paragon of black femininity, almost steals the film with her two scenes. Platinum blonde, pale and caustic, she is the quintessence of the girl B, poisoned by the "smelly gin mill" where she works ("for laughter", she says bitterly), her sweet face cajoling when Mitchell tells him that she reminds him of his wife. From time to time a nostalgic kindness crosses her defensive shell, as when she dances with Mitchell in a deserted courtyard, and then proposes to him to prepare spaghetti at his apartment. When he goes there, he meets a man with a dilapidated and crumpled face (Paul Kelly) who seems to be sponging Ginny and whose conversation is a thick layer of lies and false confessions. Gloria expels the screen of Mitchell's maid's wife in a scene where she is invited to give an alibi to Mitchell. Thin and frail in her bathrobe, with her gluteus daughter, she lets us see how many times Ginny has been insulted and rejected like a tramp. <br /> <br /> Robert Young is an indescribable actor and he has no chance against him. Mitchum's charisma, but he manages very well to keep his character as a pipe smoker, dedicated to conveying the serious message of the film, this aspect of the pump. Mitchum, meanwhile, has a cool dialogue, but not enough to do it; However, even if he does nothing but lie in a corner, you can not take his eyes off him. The third Robert, Ryan, paints a completely shadowed and frightfully convincing portrait of an ignorant and unstable bigot; we see his fake awesomeness, his intimidation, his resentment towards anyone with benefits, his "am I right or am I right?" sufficiency; how easily he stamps the labels on people and what satisfaction he feels in despising them. <br /> <br /> CROSSFIRE's message seems cautious and dated now, although not quite so similar to that of the same year. AT GENTLEMAN'S AGREEMENT. Finlay's speech on police fanaticism spread a hundred years ago in search of a white victim case, reminding us that Irish Catholics had already been persecuted; Then it could be people from Tennessee, he says, or men wearing striped ties. Or maybe blacks, Japanese, homosexuals or communists? The script seems to be afraid to mention real contemporary issues. He softens his message by making the Jewish victim holy, as if his innocence were not enough; and he takes care to exonerate the military, making a senior officer say that the army is ashamed of men like Montgomery, and pointing out that Samuels served honorably in the war. Nevertheless, it took a bit of courage to portray, immediately after the Second World War, an American who could have been happier in the Nazi army, and the basic premise of the film is still valid. If Monty was alive today, he would have been released on September 12, 2001, and reportedly beat up a Sikh.
