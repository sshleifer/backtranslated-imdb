Michael (portrayed by Steven Robertson) has cerebral palsy and leads a quiet and boring life at Carrigmore Residential Home. When a newcomer at home, Rory (McAvoy), befriends him, he decides to show Michael how to live beyond disability. Despite, or perhaps because of Rory's debilitating impairment (unable to move apart from his head and a few numbers on his hand), Rory is fiercely independent and extremely rebellious. His influence on Michael, the silencer and the reservist, is spectacular and the two men soon leave the retirement home to settle in the outside world, where they recruit the help of Siobhan (Romola Garai) as a care assistant. <br /> <br /> This film is one of the jewels of the year! A bit like last year, In the United States, the film goes from an extremely funny form to a painful, touching, moving and moving experience, without seeming to look sweet. Knowing exactly where to pull the strings from the heart, and where to just let the story, and the characters, do their work, O'Donnell has crafted a wonderful movie that tells us to look beyond the surface and see what there is inside. <Br /> <br /> The real assets of the film come from the main actors. Their characters are so convincing that you really believe they are disabled. To succeed in transmitting even more humor and sorrow beyond the already remarkable performances is incredible. The two men really seem to be close friends and, as their story unfolds, you hold them dear. <br /> <br /> This is one of the best examples of this year's movie, telling a very relevant story in a simple way. If this film fails to touch your heart, then you must contain pure ice inside.
