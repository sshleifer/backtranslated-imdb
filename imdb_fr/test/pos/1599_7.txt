I do not know where to start with that. In short, it was a disappointing movie. Having taught the news, I knew it would be a difficult story to turn into a movie. The film has some interesting lines (mainly between Alfred and Aschenbach), but it does not represent the debate on the art that basically shapes the news. <br /> <br /> On the one hand, I was expecting an older Aschenbach and a younger Tadzio. In the book, Tadzio is fourteen, but he is described as pure, ideal, innocent, while in the film he stinks of sexuality and is teasing. He is an accomplice of Aschenbach, he always looks at him, almost provocative. In the book, it is Aschenbach who steals glances at the boy. As for Aschenbach, I imagined something closer to the professor who had become a clown in The Blue Angel (based on a story by Thomas Mann's brother, Heinrich) than this forty-year-old man who had hardly gray hair. In all honesty, I think Dirk Bogarde did a good job, but someone else should have done it, or he should have looked older at first. <br /> <br /> I know that the discovery of homosexuality is important for the story, but the film minimizes the discourse on art and the duality between the Apollonian and Dionysian inspirations and focuses instead on the Tadzio's obsession with Aschenbach and does not justify it. I liked the fact that Mahler's music was used, because ultimately, it inspired Mann to write his story. I'm not sure that transforming Aschenbach into a musician was a particularly positive gesture. Or the creation of Alfred which I do not remember in the book. <br /> <br /> And one thing that really touched me was the sound and the fact that it does not match the actors' lips. I wondered if it was doubled because I expected it to be in Italian. But then I remembered that every Italian film I watched had this problem. It bothers me because these directors (Fellini is the other person I'm thinking of) are supposed to embody perfection in Italian cinema, and here are their characters laughing without sound, then you hear a sound that does not fit their face ( I think of scenes where Aschenbach almost collapses and starts to laugh, this scene could / should have been the loudest, but it was boring instead).
