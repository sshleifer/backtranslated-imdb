The adult version of Lewis Carroll's classic tale is much better than you might expect. Alice is a virgin librarian who falls into the rabbit's burrow and learns to love sex and her own image. Directed at the time when adult movies were creative projects with intrigue instead of a series of sex scenes, it's a pretty little movie that looks more like the low-budget movies of its time. Despite what you may think, this movie has a good storyline with funny jokes and good songs. It's a naughty little tale for adults. If you're wondering if my recommendation is good or not, consider that the movie was only available in its non-hardcore version for most of the last three decades, simply because the movie is sex-resistant, it's as well as I saw the movie for the first time a few years ago on cable TV. The relatively recent DVD release of the family video corrected sex (in horribly grainy inserted clips), which clearly shows that the removal of shots was the best choice. If you are an open-minded adult, I highly recommend this little movie.
