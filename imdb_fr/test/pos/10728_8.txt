I thought this movie was good enough and quite fun for an emotional movie. I agree with what another user has written about the fact that the script sympathizes with the three main characters. I think that's what made the film so good. It did not hurt Mr. or Mrs. Kramer and it was refreshing, I think, to see two people deal with it in depth and finally do the best thing for Billy. And although it was a little strange, I also liked the music of this movie. For some reason, the music seemed appropriate for the trip in which the three main characters engaged. This film was very well cast and did not scribble, as some emotionally heavy movies do. It was a serious situation but did not take itself too seriously. It simply told the story in a simple way and everything worked well.
