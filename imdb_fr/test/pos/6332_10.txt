I watched Buffy against the vampires and I really did not start to like the show until the beginning of season 4. This episode "Hush" was seen by me alone in the dark just after midnight with my windows open and the wind blowing furiously through a post-storm. The writers of this episode did a great job scare me. I was impressed by the whole episode I had just finished 2 minutes ago. Incredible does not touch the surface of what this episode accomplishes with almost no dialogue. If you have never thought much about this show, look at least this episode. If that does not impress you, then no episode will probably be. <br /> <br /> BTW My heart is still pounding ...
