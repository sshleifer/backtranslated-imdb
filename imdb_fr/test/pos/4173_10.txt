There are two ways to consider 'Head'. Either a dazzling and hallucinating collage of music, old movie clips, psychedelia and comedy in the V.V. sitcom, a less complicated scenario, a disjointed and pretentious mess. The truth probably lies somewhere in between. It's also one of the best movies of all time. <br /> <br /> "The Monkeys" - Davy Jones, Peter Tork, Mickey Dolenz and Mike Nesmith - had just finished their hit series and wanted to make a movie. In collaboration with writer Jack Nicholson and director Bob Rafelson, they directed "Head". <br /> <br /> It begins at a bridge opening ceremony in San Francisco, where the Monkees gate has been blocked. Mickey jumps over the safety rail and plunges hundreds of feet into the water. The sirens save him the accompaniment of the superb composition of Jerry Goffin & Carole King, entitled "The Porpoise Song", as well as visuals that make the final of Stargate "2001" dull in comparison. At this point, you will be either disconnected, disgusted, or completely captivated. <br /> <br /> Weird events are taking place; Mickey uses a tank to destroy a Coca-Cola machine in the middle of the desert; the whole Italian army surrenders to him; the group is engaged to play dandruff in Victor Mature's hair for a television commercial; an overweight waitress insults the group, describing them as "a gift from God to eight years"; a surprise birthday party for Mike goes bad; the group is sucked into a vacuum cleaner and, to top it off, is chased into a giant glass tank. <br /> <br /> You will hate it or love it. I found that it was a refreshing change from the silly pop musicals of the "Let's do the show here" variety. The songs are good too; "Daddy's Song" is superbly choreographed by Toni Basil (later to be featured in Rafelson's "Easy Rider") and features a beautiful montage, Davy's clothes changing color at the speed of lightning. 'As We Go Along' is a charming issue of Goffin & King whose accompanying images carry a powerful environmentalist message. <br /> <br /> Frank Zappa, Annette Funicello are just two of the stars invited to appear. Did Victor Mature read the script before agreeing to do it, one wonders? However, he is hilarious. <br /> <br /> So angry that you have to put a true genius on it, 'Head' is a 60's gem that deserves to be revisited time and time again. Too bad he did not find an audience at the time. If only "Spiceworld" had been like that!
