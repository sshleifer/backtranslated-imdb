In December 1945, a train leaves Stockholm Central Station for Berlin. There is not much left when it happens. No train and no passengers. <br /> <br /> This is a black comedy directed by Peter Dalle and who acted the same way they were playing in the 40s and who is photographed (in black and white) as she used to do. during this period. The actors must have had a lot of fun doing it. These are not really characters, as in the 40s, but the story is well told and everyone has the right timing. <br /> <br /> A deadly movie and a deadly funny movie. Look, if you did not think that Swedes were capable of humor.
