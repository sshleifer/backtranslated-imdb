Yes!! They finally managed to perfect it. What a great idea, a refreshing exploitation epic for Generation-X, whether they know it or not. After disasters like Sgt. Kabukiman NYPD, and getting fucked by Blockbuster, our hero, Lloyd Kaufman, has just decided to go down that road, stop serving distributors and let Troma be all he can be. Lloyd would make of it the most untrammeled Troma movie, as strange as possible. This time, Lloyd takes Shakespeare's love story, topples it, tromises it, and adds that long, lost entertainment value that was always lacking. Entertainment such as Lemmy Kilmister (the narrator), Debbie Rochon (the cook), Joe Fleishaker (the fat boy) and, of course, brutal mutilations and sensual humor. Tromeo And Juliet is the definitive edition of a rather dull story and the jewel of the Troma universe. <br /> <br /> Years ago, in Tromaville, NJ, business partners Monty Que and Cap Capulet created a film company called Silky Films, which would produce supposedly tasteful and soft-core films . Monty considers Cape as his friend, but Cap wants to get the poor sucker from him in the company. On paper and in books, it appears that Monty gave the work of his life for free. In the mid-90s, in Manhattan, we have two families who are extremely unhappy, to the point that they are simply looking for a reason to take a life, or preferably, a member. Monty has a son, Tromeo, nephew, Benny, and their friend Murray Martini, who is a little too excited by all the carnage, makes war on the incestuous Capulets, except Monty, he is too drunk to care. As in the original, the situation is confusing and leads Tromeo to fall for the Cape girl, whom he has never met, nor even known. Unfortunately, Cap is a sadistic pervert who, like Tromeo's father, has a soft spot for the bottle, which would, of course, lead to Daddy's little chowhaw melon being abused physically and emotionally, and kept in a Plexiglas cage. Cap and Cap also forces his vegetarian daughter to marry London Arbuckle, a billion-dollar butcher, who would make anyone uncomfortable with or without raisin bread. With all these annoyances, young lovers feel that it would be better to make the decision to flee, but how will this affect the big quarrel? It may or may not look like the original, but if you understand that it will not happen, you will never see it coming. <br /> <br /> "The one with Leo" is downright sleepy compared to Tromeo & Juliet, but if you're programmed to go, sweetened, too orderly, too big budget, Hollywood, Garbage is what you're for programmed, so go ahead. but if you're in the mood for something a little more colorful, something that really packs a punch, and does not follow the "normal" movie pattern, and if you have a rather abnormal sense of humor So you just might not hate this movie. Tromeo And Juliet gives the finger to everything that is mainstream. Total exploitation with as much petty humor as a young John Waters. Tromeo And Juliet displays, with some badass scenes, a thunderous score that includes the legendary Motorhead, not to mention the many contributions of James Gunn, who really reunited this one. For more impressionism from James Gunn, check out Lollilove, and for more excellence from Lloyd Kaufman, discover his next vision, Terror Firmer. Tromeo And Juliet is an incredibly priceless exploitation for the 90's that brings us the unique and unique king of B-movies. Thank you, Lloyd. 10/10
