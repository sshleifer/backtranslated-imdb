"Half Empty" is a hilarious musical about the eternal optimist - in this case, a writer who fends for herself alone who goes to Germany mistakenly thinking that he is popular there. Instead of an adoring public, he finds himself drifting into a world of tired misanthropists, including the woman who is supposed to be his publicist. His attempts to make friends - in largely improvised scenes - lead to one encounter after another when he is verbally abused by nihilist musicians, gruff gangsters, and so on. In the long run, he manages to convince his publicist of his heart and mind - but his own vision of the world is turned upside down when his hero, a much more popular writer who tries to help himself, is not quite what it seems. Several musical numbers punctuate the action. <br /> <br /> We saw it at the DeadCenter Film Festival in Oklahoma City and were blown away. It's a small-scale independent production that's really fun and inspired. You may have technical problems (like the lighting, which is a little dark), but the room is funny and inspired enough that you do not worry too much. If Voltaire wrote "Candide" today, the character would be an autonomous writer.
