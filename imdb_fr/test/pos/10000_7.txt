Actor turned director Bill Paxton continues his promising debut, the gothic novel "Frailty", with this family-friendly sport drama on the US Open of 1913 where a young American cadet gets up from his humble past to play against his idol British in what was called as "The greatest game ever played". I'm not a golf enthusiast, and these classy under-practiced movies are shoveled (once recently done wonderfully with "Miracle" and "Cinderella Man"), but some how captivating this film was all the same . <Br/> <br /> The film begins with a creative opening credits (imagine a Disneyfied version of HBO's animated opening credits of "Carnivale" and "Rome"), but slowly moves forward for its first hour in numbers. Once the action moves to the United States, things resume very well. Paxton does a good job and shows a talent for the effective frills of filmmakers (I loved the rain-soaked montage of action on the second day of filming) that propels the plot further or adds an unexpected psychological depth to the procedure. There is a certain development of character when the British Harry Vardon is haunted by images of aristocrats in black suits and top hats who destroyed his family cottage when he was a kid to make way for a golf course . It also does a good job of visual representation of what is happening in the heads of players under pressure. Golf, a painfully boring sport, is very alive here. We must also thank the set designers and the costume department for creating an engaging period atmosphere in London and Boston in the early 20th century. <br /> <br /> You know how it's going to end not only because it's based on a true story, but also because movies like this follow the same pattern, but Paxton offers a better show than the average and may indicate more talent behind the camera than he has ever had. Despite its stereotypical nature, it is a pleasant and easy-to-root film that deserves to be found.
