Rented the video for a slow Saturday night. The first time, I found it funny. It took a while to get used to American cartoons (here we are more sensitive to British grotesques) but very nice. <br /> <br /> I watched it again next night and I really warmed up. The characters seemed more human, adorable even. A film that you can watch several times and shoot more each time. However, my wife * hated * that. No accounting for tastes in humor, I suppose.
