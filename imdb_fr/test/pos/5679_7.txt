Like most people, I was thinking of "another movie about crocodiles". So far we have had Primeval and Snape in the last 12 months, what can they do again? Where these two films spoke of action and violence, he spoke of fear and tension. <br /> <br /> The performances are not worthy of an Oscar when nothing happens, but in times of distress or terror, these people suffer so much it's like torture. There are holes in the plot and maybe the fangs do not really behave as already pointed out, but the fear is so effective that it's enough to say that you'll enjoy this movie. It will leave you as uncomfortable as The Passion of Christ.
