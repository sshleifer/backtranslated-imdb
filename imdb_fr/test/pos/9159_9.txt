NBC produced a lot of good products when this series was released, but nothing attracted viewers. At least, according to their leaders, who have wisely canceled good series like Star Trek & My World and Welcome To It because of their low ranking. NBC advertisers benefited from a good deal thanks to his ignorance. <br /> <br /> This show is the only time James Garner was not enough to attract viewers. It's also great that this series has great support from Stuart Margolin (later Angel in the Rockford Archives), from Neva Patterson to Margot Kidder. Garner was playing a sheriff who did not want to use violence to do his duty. It was a small town, but it was excellent. Shortly after that, Jim Rockford brought Garner back to success, but for my money, this show was pretty good, it was just not at the right time, in the right place, or at the right time. <br /> <br /> The show was so good that most of the people who worked there also found jobs in Rockford.
