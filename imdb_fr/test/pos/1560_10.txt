This is probably the best image that not many people will see. He presented a culture in a very rude way. A must for anyone who loves Indie and for those who do not. I think this film will attract more in the independent scene. The acting game was great! Alice's character was so well portreyed. With perfect clumsiness. This film should be presented to the general public! I think it would be phenomenally! ALICE is the most real eye on an element of our culture that I have seen since GO ASK ALICE. A look that has not been touched by the Hollywood hand. Films like this show young people that these things are not glamorous, but real and compelling. If you liked PIECES D'APRIL, you'll love this one!
