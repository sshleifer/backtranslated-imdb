The movie was better than I expected. I was working on the set for a short time when Damien was filming this film. Better music would top this movie. Some music sounds like hippie days. Damien remembers that you have gang violence. Some gangsters or old hip hop would have done it. It was more realistic than losing one's blood. The cast was very well chosen. Sappectentertaint did a good job in this movie. The film brought back a lifestyle I had to live. But in the end, you do not always win. And in my story, that's what happened. I adapted to the movie the first time I watched it. Damien Congratulations on this movie.
