We are in 1913. A studio boy is spying on the actress who will become the next big Hollywood movie star and he will be the director. After inventing the throwing of the pie and the police keystone, his dream comes true. However, being completely engrossed in his job as a filmmaker, he does not realize that he is losing his main wife to another man. Several budget failures passed later, he is no longer known as the director who rejected Rin-tin-tin. Fortunately for him, the loyal and compassionate residents of Hollywood are not tainted by ambition or ego. He'll be fine as long as he still has his friends. <br /> <br /> This film begins with a comedy for the crazy headdress typical of the period and continues in the first scenes with the best of them. There is a lack of self-awareness that is sorely lacking in most comedies today. Shortly after, the film moves away from this mode of comedy and tries rather to entertain us by using the films it contains. They are silent comedies in slapstick, well done, but nothing extraordinary, and they last much longer than what is necessary for an audience that would have seen the originals. Upon his return, the film takes a dramatic turn. It's well written and the distribution does a great job of making the transition, but the movie really should have decided from the start what it was going to be. <br /> <br /> At the end of the film, he transformed once again - this time into a Hollywood glitter paean. The small city of Los Angeles has grown to become the city that makes movies that entertain the world. <br /> <br /> Despite its promising debut, this film has not aged well. Nevertheless, it presents strong scenes, a certain nostalgic attraction and an entertaining subtext on the people who made it and on the publics for which it was conceived.
