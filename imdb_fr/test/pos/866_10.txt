Honestly, I do not know what words the BDIM will allow me to use in this article; therefore, I have trouble describing these short films. Let's say there is a lot of gay sex, necrophilia, incest, a lot of masturbation and several artificial limbs. And I loved every minute. <br /> <br /> It's not raw humor. It's not. They deviate for the most part from wax pranks, with the exception of a sketch called "Pizza" in which they use very well one. "They" represent 3 / 11ths of the group of ephemeral skits that was broadcast on MTV and entitled The State, namely David Wain, Michael Showalter and Michael Ian Black. <br /> <br /> The trio embarks on adventures, usually playing themselves and meeting strange and unusual people, people who are often more normal than they actually are. The distribution is also fantastic. Paul Rudd, Julie Bowen, Bradley Cooper, Zach Galifianakis and Sam Rockwell all appear in various sketches. Joe Lo Truglio and Todd Holoubek also joined them. The musical selections are also very well placed. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed these skits again and again, but they are not for everyone because they are pretty vulgar most of the time. If you like intelligent humor that is not afraid to push the boundaries of good taste, I highly recommend it. If you liked Wet Hot American Summer (directed and written by Wain and Showalter) or The State, then you should really enjoy it. <br /> <br /> I think it can currently only be ordered online. Check out their website and share some pictures to get an idea if you want it first and then find out how to buy the DVD.
