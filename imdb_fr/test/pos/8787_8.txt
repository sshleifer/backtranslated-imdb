You can not help but marvel at the early work of Hitchcock. "Saboteur", for example, is so fast and fast that it's hard to believe he made this film more than 60 years ago. There are elements of propaganda, but they are so well woven into the mystery that the thing is played wonderfully well years later. You also get some glimpses of things that Hitchcock would do later - like using a national landmark as a backdrop. This time it's the statue of liberty. In "North by Northwest", of course, it's Mount. Rushmore. You will also recognize the items that appear later in "Rear Window" and "Vertigo" in "Saboteur", but do not disclose the show. Robert Cummings is excellent, as is the very charming Otto Kruger. Look for the Hitchcock mini-western in this one. It happens quickly so do not blink.
