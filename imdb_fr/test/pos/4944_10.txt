Soul Calibur has always been my favorite fighting game series of all time. And SCIII is my favorite of the series. <br /> <br /> The graphics are very well done. A much bigger improvement over unstable Soul Edge / Soul Blade polygons. The characters have facial expressions, hairs in the breeze and even flashes. <br /> <br /> Soul Calibur has always been known for his intrigues and interesting characters and SCIII is no exception. Each character has his story that is detailed and well done. My favorite character is Chai Xianghua. She's cute, she's funny and a strong female character. Yeah, I know she's wearing pink and has a boyfriend (who ends up saving BTW), but there seems to be more for her. Xianghua, like all other characters, has flaws and strengths in his personality, so no character is perfect, not even the good guys. <br /> <br /> The music is beautifully composed for a series of fighting games. It does not sound like kitchy (the Vampire series), nor like an old school porn movie (Mortal Kombat). The characters have their own themes and many are designed to match the culture of this part of the world. I do not think there is a song from this soundtrack that I do not like. <br /> <br /> Another good thing about this game is to create your own anime character (Create a Soul). You could give it a cute, sexy or even ugly look if you like. However, if you have found a customization that you like, consider taking notes, otherwise you will not remember how you created this character. I found myself very addicted to CaS. <br /> <br /> Overall, I think Soul Calibur is my number one number one fighting game of all time. He has everything I asked for. What more could I do?
