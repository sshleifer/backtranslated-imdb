Like most other critics seem to agree, this adaptation of "After The Funeral" is really very good. Always one of my favorite stories of Poirot, I was afraid she was "disturbed". Well, it was a bit, but ONLY a little bit and the end of the result was really entertaining. David Suchet continues to be almost irreproachable like Poirot and (as others have pointed out) the other star of this show is Monica Dolan, who surely could not be improved as Miss Gilchrist. I also loved Fiona Glasscott, who was the star of Rosamund Shane, but the cast was flawless! <br /> <br /> One point has been removed so that the adapters can not resist overlaying too many revelations in the last fifteen minutes. The will and property affairs were a bit useless although it did not matter how they tightened up the Abernethie family structure (in the book, the family tree is really very complicated). The last moments of the murderer's revelation, however, are incredibly successful and I have come to an end when they leave all of Enderby, very touching. It's really one of the best of the Poirot series to date.
