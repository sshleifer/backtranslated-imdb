A letter to the guys. I tried guys, I really tried! I tried so hard not to watch this movie. I left the room when she was on or jumped on the computer when the woman was looking at her. This is his second favorite movie, the godfather being the first (which I love). <br /> <br /> I ended up catching small pieces of this movie and finally, after maybe a year, I was really watching it. I can not believe I'm saying that, but I loved this movie. Dalton plays a great Rhett and his daring is at the rendezvous. Whalley plays a delicious Scarlett. Full of fire and sulfur and NOTHING will stop it. <br /> <br /> My favorite scene is when she is abroad (in Ireland?) And the government is going to demolish a farmer's house because he is late paying rent. Scarlett is completely angry at this and pays all of her debt, making herself a huge name in this small town. <br /> <br /> All I'm saying is that you might want to try this movie ... especially if you're a fan of Gone with the Wind. It takes a little time to get used to the new actors, but I think you'll find them refreshing.
