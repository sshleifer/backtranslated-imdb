SPOILER WARNING <br /> <br /> We have all heard the legend of the "boy who cried wolf". But what if the wolf was a person of the modern world? Well, it could be something like Big Fat Liar. 14-year-old Jason Sheperd (Frankie Muniz of "Malcolm in the Middle") always lies to keep himself from boredom. One day, he is pressured to write an essay in English, but it returns to the hands of shady filmmaker Marty Wolf (Paul Giamatti), who plans to turn Jason's story into a Hollywood blockbuster. Nobody believes Jason when, for once, he tells the truth and he ends up at summer school. However, Jason is determined to prove the truth to his parents and travels to Latin America with his friend Kaylee (Amanda Bynes). When Wolf refuses to admit that he has stolen his story, Jason plans to make his life hell. B.F.L. It's not a masterpiece, but it's a good way to spend 90 minutes of your time. I wish they could do it a little longer and that there are not many jokes although they are smart enough (I like the best pool dye). I might not have liked that as much as I did without Paul Giamatti. He's just hilarious in that. If you have 90 minutes to kill, try this. You could just enjoy it.
