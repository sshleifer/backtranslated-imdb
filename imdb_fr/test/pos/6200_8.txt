The sleeper cell is what should have been. 24 is a cartoon. (I'm looking at 24 people, but I feel deceived at every stupid episode, the four or five seasons so far - who can keep track of it since they're all identical, so ...) Sleeper Cell is really well done and is far superior. Unfortunately, they ruined everything with the end of season two. I can think of half a dozen better outcomes that would have worked better for the obvious goals of the writer and that would not have been so artificial. Shame on the writers for destroying what had been a very good series so far.
