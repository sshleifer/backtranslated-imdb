I saw this movie when it came out, then a few years later. I'm looking at it now 20 years later and it's still a very good story. Does it mean "movie network for life"? Yes, but alas, life did not even exist at the time, so it had to be broadcast. <br /> <br /> The distribution was excellent. The story was a bit schmaltzy; two women become close friends and one of the friends, without their knowledge, has an affair with her husband, another friend. She is invited home for a dinner where she discovers that her lover is the husband of her best friend. She is horrified and tries to break the affair. Shortly after, he is tragically killed in a car accident that wreaks havoc on both women. Of course, the woman accidentally discovers this case and wants Holly to disappear from her life, but their friendship can prevail because they need each other. large distribution and performance. I really enjoyed that.
