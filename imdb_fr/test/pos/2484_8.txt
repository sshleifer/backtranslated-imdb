I saw Peter Watkin's Culloden and The War Game a few months ago and I was very impressed. The technique is essentially the same, or at least very similar, in this movie detailing on one side a trial of dissidents in California in the (seemingly) near future, and on the other hand attempts by a group of "criminals" convicts Travel 50 miles of desert to gain their freedom in a government-run "punishment park" as an alternative to prison. Watkins films everything in a documentary style, which causes a little more discomfort or a strong suspension of disbelief. misery? And this is only the most obvious example. But apart from the dubious story, this story has punch; There is no doubt that you should be interested in making political films so that you can really get involved, but the film really does not look like anything from its time: it does not do anything, it does not offer simple solutions. Left-wing politicians may have faces that are sometimes broad, but they are not all alike; right-wing government officials seem a little more caricatured, but even they are allowed to show a little humanity. Overall, the film gives a lot to think and leaves an indelible taste ..... 8/10 DVD rental
