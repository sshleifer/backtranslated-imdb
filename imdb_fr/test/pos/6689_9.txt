Personally, I think Kevin Spacey is one of the biggest players of his generation, maybe the biggest. This in combination with another amazing actor named Jeff Bridges, that can not be bad. And that's exactly what this movie is! "K-PAX" is one of the most pleasant surprises of recent years. For starters, the film is a brilliantly written story. That's part of what makes the movie so great. The other aspect that contributes to the greatness of the film is the acting of the actors. The Spacey-Bridges suit really works. <br /> <br /> It was already the second time I saw the movie and I'm sure it would not be the last time. "K-PAX" has it all. There are extremely funny moments, scenes that evoke a true thriller and others that evoke a drama of high class. I think this film deserves a much higher rating and a lot more rewards. Super movie! <br /> <br /> 9/10
