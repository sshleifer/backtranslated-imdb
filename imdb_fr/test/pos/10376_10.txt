I was surprised that I liked this movie. But it reminded me of a 2004 version of the first Friday 13. There were a number of cheese items, but at the same time there were a lot of cool elements. The scenario was good - predictable if you've seen more than one or two horror movies, but plenty of liners to make it worth it. There are memorable scenes to watch. Some problems I had with the plot had to do with the continuity of the characters. For example, in the opening scene, the scarecrows (who were attached humans and whose blood had been drained to grow crops) seemed very real, but later in the film, they looked more like false scarecrows bearing blue masks. There were more than a few gaps in the plot, and the acting was mediocre, but at least it sounded like the way people talk, unlike Hollywood movies where the dialogue is really wrong when you think about it. The culmination of the last scene, when the main character says "I'm not a baker, I'm a Connell!" and cutting off the Scarecrow's head is satisfying, as his friends were mostly killed by these creatures at that time.
