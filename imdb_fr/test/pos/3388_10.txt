It's an excellent movie, all 3 were. The last one was not as good as the first two but it was made a long time later and he was shooting with straw. But you want to watch it because it tells the end of the story. It's just not what we might think. <br /> <br /> These films made me want to be there to face all the hardships, all the love, the tears and the laughs that the people of this film launched. It's one of the few movies that's good every time you watch it, no matter how many times. <br /> <br /> There are some parts of the film that little kids will not understand and the older ones may not be old enough to watch. but it's a good movie, covering more than 20 years.
