It's the best movie I've seen this year! Excellent details and scenario (to redo). <br /> <br /> It presents you with a hypothetical situation in which the island of Japan could totally disappear from this planet. A situation of life and death that makes you think, not to mention all life on earth (well in this Japan in particular). It's also a great and brilliant solution to this huge tragedy. <br /> <br /> Horror, action, suspense, science fiction, documentary, love story and all the stories of human interest that you can find, you will find everything here! But I warn you too that it's a real tearful! The actors, the actors and all are excellent, better than any Hollywood movie! <br /> <br /> The problem is ... it could really happen anywhere on the planet! Now, let me ask you this after seeing it ... "What would you do if you face this situation of life and death"?
