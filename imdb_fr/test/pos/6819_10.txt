A few moments ago, I viewed this website on the Sundance Film Festival website and I must say it is absolutely amazing. I was expecting it to be entertaining - like all Sundance shorts - but I was not prepared for such deep sadness and a sense of passion and beauty. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen any of the festival entries this year, I suggest you go to the site and look at these mini-masterpieces - I've seen them all and I can honestly say Youth In Us' is the one that has touched my heart the most. I am not the weakest member of the audience in romance in movies, but my eyes are so inundated that I am surprised to see the screen. <br /> <br /> I agree with 'addicted2you', that. It's truly a masterful directorial work, and cinematography will take your breath away. <br /> <br /> I do not see a better way to spend 12 minutes spare.
