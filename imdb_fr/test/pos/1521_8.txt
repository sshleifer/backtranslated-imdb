Closet Land is an incredible and terrifying movie. It only has two actors in one set, but never loses your attention. The scenography is imaginative and disturbing, the staging of scenes keeps your attention, while adding to your own sense of confusion and terror. The acting is remarkable, Alan Rickman and Madeleine Stowe being responsible for making each scene. <br /> <br /> I saw this film for the first time in 1991, shortly after its video release. He did not play in the theaters where I lived; no wonder, given its political content. You have to see, though. It presents a brilliant staging of the techniques of torture and interrogation used by repressive societies to instill fear and obedience among its citizens. The country is never named, which makes it even more striking. It could be anywhere; East, West, 3rd World, 1st World. This illustrates what happens when a small group of people decide what is best for everyone. when the government becomes the leader of the citizens, rather than the servant. <br /> <br /> Madeleine Stowe is a children's author who was dragged into bed at night and subjected to terror and torture. She finds herself in a room with Alan Rickman, an apparently nice official. At first, it seems a horrible mistake and she is free to leave. but fear makes it stay and terror intensifies. She is more and more subjected to physical and mental torture. The interrogator uses sensory deprivation, temporal manipulation, confusion, auditory manipulation, role play and twisted logic to break the author. She is humiliated and severe, forced to endure painful physical positions, deprived of food and water. <br /> <br /> Through all this, she refuses to give in; do what the interrogator asks. It is said that everything will end if it only signs confessions. A simple little act. She refuses. Through all this, she uses defense mechanisms that have developed since childhood. It is slowly revealed that she was sexually abused as a child. To survive, she developed fantastic worlds and characters that would keep her away from abuse. These mechanisms allow her to transcend her torture and reverse the situation of her interrogator. She begins to attack her own beliefs and her own profession, forcing her to examine her own life and motives. In the end, she is free because she maintains freedom of thought. The interrogator is the one who is trapped by the state. <br /> <br /> This film was shot during the height of the Cold War, apartheid and at a time when the crimes of many governments around the world were making headlines every day. This is even more opportune in a world where "enemy combatants" are detained and interrogated in secret prisons, deprived of their legal rights or advice. where "ethnic cleansing" devastates entire societies and where humanitarian aid is denied. This demonstrates that the individual can stand up to the state or another oppressor by refusing to yield to fear and terror.
