What I liked the most in this film is the landscape of Corfu. Being Greek, I love my country and I liked the point of view of the flattering director. Based on a true story in the years when Greece struggled to defend itself against war, Nazis and hardships. An Italian soldier and a Greek girl fall in love, but times are tough and they have a lot of sacrifices to make. Nicholas Cage, who looks great in a uniform, passionately tells this unfulfilled love (at first). I loved Christian Bale playing Mandras, the future husband of the heroine, he looks very good in Greek, his personality is at the height of that of the Greek patriot! A real fighter, or what! One of the movies I would like to buy and keep in my collection ... forever!
