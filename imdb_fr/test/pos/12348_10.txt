Judging by the other comments, it seems that many people have not understood the meaning of the film. It's not centered around zombies, in fact, they're not zombies at all, it's a device regenerated by the wizard to scare the girls to death, it's mostly focused on Meg Tilly, who wants to help finish. He died while doing his job, and what you get is a great movie with a great end, hard to find on video, but from time to time he appears on HBO or Cinamax, check it out, I gave him a 10 and highly recommend it.
