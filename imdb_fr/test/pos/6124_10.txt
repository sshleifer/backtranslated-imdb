You know the saying "Curiosity has killed the cat"? Well, I've heard so much about this film in a magazine that named it one of the most shocking movies of all time, my 1001 movies to see before I die, my sister who saw it at a film festival, and I love the show of the 70s on VH1. It was enough for me to see this movie since it was named the most rude movie of all time and, after watching this movie last night, I must say that it really corresponded to its title. My God, this movie was so weird! I thought I really saw everything with some of the sickest movies and TV shows I've seen. Some things, I guess, will always be a shock. <br /> <br /> Well, Babs Johnson, aka Divine, has been named the dirtiest person alive and a jealous couple named the Marbles is competing for this title. They want to go out Divine and be named the dirtiest couple by kidnapping women, raping them, impregnating them and selling their babies to lesbian couples. But it looks like Divine and her family well ... I do not know, seems to keep the title by sleeping with chickens, synchronizes her lips, eats dog feces, stuffed skirts, incest, and that does not matter that start bigger and bigger. <br /> <br /> Pink Flamingos is horribly played, horribly well done, and well, just horrible. The note 10 that I will give you is due to the fact that you can evaluate this film. I always notice, so I just understand what the heck? Through the rudeness of this movie, you have to give John Waters a credit, who the hell would he think of this movie more than 35 years later? For the casting and the team that worked on this film, you're just naughty! <br /> <br /> 10/10
