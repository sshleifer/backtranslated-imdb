THE NEXT KARATE KID, in my opinion, is an excellent martial arts film. I thought Eric (Chris Conrad) and Julie (Hilary Swank) looked great in their prom outfit. For me, Ned (Michael Cavalieri) was a real tyrant. It's because he got in trouble with Julie Wilkes (Eugene Boles). If you ask me, Colonel Dugan (Michael Ironside) was a pure ******! It was because he was a very hard man who did not tolerate mistakes. My favorite parts were the prom and the confrontation between Julie and the Alpha Elite. In conclusion, I highly recommend this great success to anyone who loves martial arts movies or who is a fan of Hilary Swank.
