Sleeper Cell tries to swim on both sides of the pool (Terrorists / Muslim Americans Patriots), but does not succeed very well. <br /> <br /> I had long waited to watch this show because I felt it would be too predictable, but after a year in my netflix queue, I finally moved it up . <br /> <br /> The show is about a Muslim man undercover working for the FBI in an attempt to infiltrate a terrorist cell operating in the United States. The agent infiltrated in the show is actually a Muslim, so we see his conflict / resolution between his patriotism and his religious beliefs. Personally, I would have preferred to watch a drama about an American Muslim family living in the United States, but it is doubtful whether an American television channel (cable or network) ever produces something that presents Muslims in a flattering light. . <br /> <I am not a Muslim, but I have many American Muslim friends and I can honestly say that none of them are terrorists and that they all love America. <br /> <br /> Sleeper Cell is about to burst stereotypes of Muslims, but it also focuses on the worst Muslim stereotypes. In the first episode, we see a "murder of honor", which is very bad for Islam, but in the third episode we see a highly respected moderate Muslim scholar teaching the viewer that the real jihad is actually a personal struggle which does not mean inciting violence towards others. <br /> <br /> If only the moderate Muslim scholar had been the main character of the show. <br /> <br /> Americans need to deepen their knowledge of Islam, Sleeper Cell helps a little, but it's a long way from giving the American public what they really need to know. <br /> <br /> That said, the acting in this show is superb and the drama is extremely captivating. If only they had made this show on Islam in America without terrorism, it was first class.
