"The Great Dictator" is without a doubt one of Charlie Chaplin's best-known films. He is notorious for his flagrant satire of Adolf Hitler and Nazism. Until I look at this, I only knew his fame. Now, I know how much the film deserves it. <br /> <br /> The film essentially shows the exploits of Adania's somewhat clumsy, ambitious, merged and impressive dictator, Adenoid Hynkel; and with him, his dear and dear staff: Field Marshall Herring and Herr Garbitsch. Moreover, it involves the exploits of an amnesiac, emotional and often clumsy Jewish barber, a veteran of the First World War. <br /> <br /> In stopping the plot, I would like to say that this film has various qualities that make it both unique and wonderful. While the comedy is decidedly both verbal and far-fetched and incidental, the whole film shows how seriously he takes Nazism or aggressive nationalism with various interludes. Chaplin's impeccable acting skills are very varied in the film, he continues to spin it until it explodes. Paulette Goddard's position as a future ambitious Jewish revolt and the presentation by Henry Daniell of calm nasal lines as a serious crisis like a heart attack make wonderful observations. <br /> <br /> In addition, One aspect of the film is what makes it so special: it does not fist. It is not "hidden", it has no hidden business. It is flagrant, flagrant, flagrant, flagrant, flagrant by Hitler and Nazism. <br /> <br /> To summarize briefly, watch it. Look at it, you will see it.
