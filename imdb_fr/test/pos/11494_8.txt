I loved this film! He has a big heart and big bones. I stumbled upon it and I could not remember, even at all, this movie of promos, critics or word of mouth. I remember reading many years ago a journalist who commented on the value of watching movies without having contaminated them with the prejudice of criticism or the pretense of promos. And this seems to be the most frequent source of the film's negative reaction to criticism: the film did not meet expectations, be it a comedy, a slice of life or a character. I did not expect this movie to be comical - but I laughed only once or twice - without being a comedy; it was about a person, but so eccentric that it was not a slice of life; It was a character, but the character was so cleverly optimistic and confident in his life instinct that it was not the sentimental melodrama aroused by the anguish that characterized the "serious" American film - as I did. I wrote - I realized that the writer / director Lisa Krueger managed to make fun of this American sentimentality in the husband! And very smart too! And Kreuger managed to keep the disgusting sentimental end of the screen, when the restive, not prodigal husband came back with the tailed tail between his legs. Congratulations Mrs. Krueger, congratulations! (Now, I'm going to watch this movie again, because it's getting better and better by reflecting.) <br /> <br /> Graham's performance as Joline is brilliant. I loved the fact that she was able to describe and convey an intelligent awareness of her firm commitment to respect her words and deeds - she knew that by keeping her word with a group, friends or a husband, she was preparing to make fun and / or disappointment in a world unable to honor her commitment as she was able to do. But even with this strength, she was fully connected to humanity and embraced with a fully engaged heart their fragility and failures. Joline's character was incredibly well played and I left the movie surprised not to remember nominations for rewards. Okay, not surprising, because the American awards tend to be awarded to women in "serious" roles, filled with anxiety and appropriate nudity, which this film did not have. Which has been much better, which has the heart in the discovery of this woman with the assistance of new friends and a shaman who depreciates himself. <br /> <br /> I admit to being a little sweet for the eccentric characters who manage their particularities while remaining honest and true to themselves as they advance through the minefield that includes societal behavior " appropriate "and" acceptable "interpersonal discourse. So if people have to conform to normalcy in your world, then this movie will not please you. And it was, it seems, one of the common points of criticism. <br /> <br /> And I'm always looking for a good word game that raises issues of human behavior and ethical / philosophical values. Until this film, I did not make the emotional connection between being engaged (for a cause or an honesty or something like that) and being committed (in an insane asylum). When does the commitment of a personal feeling of truth and action in life become a simple way to madness? It sounds like a simple question, or a question that can easily be called rhetoric. But is this? And yet, few critics - I think two perhaps - have commented directly or indirectly on this aspect of the film. <br /> <br /> A charming movie. 8/10. <br /> <br />
