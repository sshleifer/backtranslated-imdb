This is my fourth review of a Charlie Chan movie in chronological order of the series these consecutive days. It's also the first comment I've seen before, even though it's been about 24 years since I've seen a lot of it.

And "Son No. 2" Jimmy (Victor Sen Yung) is a little helpful when he identifies for the first time the poison causing some early murders, though, of course, he blundered a little later. Among the actors returning from Chan's latest film, Charlie Chan at the Wax Museum, are the blonde Joan Valerie as June Preston and Stanley Blystone, who is the brother of John G. and who directed the movie Chan Chan called Charlie Chan's, fingerprint expert. Nice plot especially with an exciting climax aboard a bomber plane. Oh, and watch a certain Stooge during a police queue ...
