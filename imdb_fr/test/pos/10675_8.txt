"Doppleganger" (or "Journey away from the sun", as it is more commonly known) was written (with the help of the late Donald James) and produced by Gerry and Sylvia Anderson, best known for their television "Supermarionation" programs like "Thunderbirds". <br /> <br /> The international space agency Eurosec discovers the existence of a mysterious planet on the other side of the sun and proposes to send him an inhabited flight. The committee balks at the exorbitant cost and puts the project aside. But when a security breach at the agency is discovered, fearing that the Russians will arrive first, the project gets the green light. <br /> <br /> US astronaut Glenn Ross (Roy Thinnes) teams up with British scientist John Kane (Ian Hendry). After weeks of grueling training, the Phoenix takes off, heading for the unknown. <br /> <br /> Three weeks later, their ship crashes into what appears to be a dark, mountainous landscape. Ross survives, but Kane is seriously injured. We see a light moving towards them ... <br /> <br /> I will leave the synopsis here. Until then, the film was captivating, with excellent special effects (by Derek Meddings) and music from Anderson's resident composer, Barry Gray (why it was not published on C.D. is a mystery). But when Ross and Kane crashed and we discovered the secret of the extraterrestrial world - it's a copy of our own world, everyone is the same, the only major difference is that things are reversed - it becomes less interesting and ends with a smashing anti-climax. I think cinema was the wrong place to make this idea, in fact, Gerry & Sylvia then did something similar for their show "Space: 1999". Ross risks (and ultimately loses) his life in order to return to Earth - his Earth. But why? The new Earth is so similar that it might not have been disturbed. <br /> <br /> Roy Thinnes recently shot the television series "The Invaders" and gave a competent performance (pity there were no other scenes like this where he row with his wife ). Ian Hendry is good as 'Kane', but disappears too early in the story. Several actors appeared in '' U.F.O. Andersons like Ed Bishop and George Sewell. Blink and Nicholas Courtney ("The Brigadier" from "Dr.Who" in a tiny role) will miss you. But the acting honors go to the late Patrick Wymark as "Jason Webb", director of Eurosec. The character is not far from "Sir John Wilder", the one he played in "The Power Game" by A.T.V. Webb is such a devious character that he is wonderful to watch. The contribution of Herbert Lom (as a spy with a camera hidden in a fake eye) is little more than a cameo. <br /> <br /> As I said, the special effects are wonderful, as are the sets. The film is therefore worth watching, but do not expect many things once the action moves on the mirror planet. With a stronger scenario, it could have been another "Planet of the Apes" or - if I dare say it - "2001: an odyssey of space". <br /> <br /> In Anderson's productions, he gave the impression that the future great place, an adventure playground where science was cool, everyone had stylish cars whose doors Vertical women were sexy, and there was nothing to suggest that something was wrong in the world. We are in the future now and people are still watching "Coronation Street" every other night. So disappointing. If a mirror Earth really exists somewhere, we hope it will be a better place than this one. If all women look like Lynn Loring or Loni von Friedl, I'll be on the next flight!
