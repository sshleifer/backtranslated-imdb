This little movie is hysterical, full of stereotypes about gays, heterosexuals, dwarves, tea and British pubs, the American gun culture, divorce and marriage; yet he manages to be sensitive to the problems that surround them. Kathy Bates is "astonishing" Grace Beasley and, as a staggering character actor, she uses her considerable comedy talent to found this film a little unusual, as she did in Fried Green Tomatos . With the help of other comic talents, like Dan Akroid, Max, her ex-husband, lawyer, and the background of downtown Chicago and rural England, the story is intriguing enough to be entertaining. Jonathan Price plays Victor Fox, a gay singer in the closet murdered by a crossbow killer in Chicago. His valet lover Dirk Simpson, played by the astonishing Rupert Everett, must defeat Victor's brothers and sisters, including Lynn Redgrave, who wants to turn their home into a tribute museum, and team up with Bates and her dwarf daughter-in-law, Maudy Beasley. to find the killer among the homeless in Chicago. <br /> <br /> The entire cast sings at different times of the chase and is excellent, especially the talented Price and Bates. This unlikely scenario, both funny and bizarre, is one of the most disconcerting movies. The cameos of Julie Andrews, Barry Manlow and Sally Jesse Raphael should tell you how awful this movie is. Strange, funny and decent, but with a good perspective on people with all kinds of differences.
