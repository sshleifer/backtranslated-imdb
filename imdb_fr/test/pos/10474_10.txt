A sweet story, alluding to fury, with a redemptive message and a glorious celebration. The photography is wonderfully well done. Cinematographers consider this type of film to perfect their art, not only for what the eye can do to improve a story, but so that the vocabulary of the camera can do to increase emotions. Nourishing the soul is by definition the subject of this film, but with an elegance and grace of delivery that simply does not happen again, at least with this degree of taste, restraint and finesse. If you care about the character's story and development, this is an excellent movie to see as an example of what simple lines and a correct presentation can do to completely complete a character's impression. Combine all this with a minimalist, perfectly designed movie soundtrack and you'll get that movie.
