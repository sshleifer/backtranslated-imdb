Jim Henson as Kermit, Dr. Teeth, Rowlf and Waldorf. <br /> <br /> Frank Oz as Fozzie, Piggy and Animal. <br /> <br /> Jerry Nelson as Floyd Pepper, Robin the Frog, Lew Zealand and Harry Crazy. <br /> <br /> Richard Hunt like Janice, Statler, Beaker and Scooter. <br /> <br /> Dave Goelz as Gonzo, Dr.Hunnydew and Zoot. <br /> <br /> Charles Durning and Mel Brooks. <br /> <br /> cameos from Steve Martin, Carol Kane, Orson Welles, Bob Hope, Richard Pryor and others. <br /> <br /> This is the first Muppet movie of the other billion who have come out and are also the best, by far! This is the Kermit frog making a trip to Hollywood and meeting the other characters along the way. This film, in addition to being already good, contains excellent songs performed by the Muppets, including Rainbow Connection, Can You Picture That ?, Moving Right Along and others. This film, unlike other Muppet films, has a strong sentimental value for me. It's such a beautiful movie. We also noted the number of cameos starring Steve Martin, Mel Brooks and a dozen others. <br /> <br /> my rating is an asset. 109 minutes noted G.
