This movie was really very well written and very entertaining. Luke Perry did a very convincing job. (as it always does) If you're looking for an event-rich movie, it should be at the top of your list. There is a mix of comedy, drama and action. You can literally feel what the actors are feeling at times. I was very impressed by this movie. The special effects were very well done. The whole movie was very convincing. This film is one of my favorites. What is happening is that North America could be torn apart and that Jack and his team must try to prevent an eruption by destroying North America. It was a very cool and creative idea. I loved this movie and I know you will like it too.
