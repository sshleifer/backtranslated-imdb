I love this movie as much as anyone loves to watch what he saw when he was young. it was one of those movies that Home Box Office showed every other day of my youth. this film is forever lodged in my brain. For someone who has not grown up around this movie, you could be spoiled by the ADD cycle in which we have been since the mid-90s and have more difficulty enjoying this gem. cool, because my sister was doped on "better dead" before seeing that (which I raped and loved) - and nobody, no one can deny the embrace of the clumsy humor of American cinema in the 80s - that gave birth to everything we found tiring in teen comedies ... because of the overuse of the slow-mo, the current soundtrack, the new technology. I wonder if cinema will come back to these roots ... THIS IS the comedy for teenagers ... YES!
