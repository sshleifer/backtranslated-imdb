Looking for a comedy drama with suspense and an ensemble cast? Well locate this little sleeper. John Lithgow and Billy Bob Thorton are excellent in this little tornado. Do not forget Jamie Lee Curtis cameo. A touch of the 60s, a touch of "prince and poor", and the touch of gold of this country are a little story.
