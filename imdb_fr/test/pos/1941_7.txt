I think it's a very good film, but one thing makes it VERY interesting for me. It becomes obvious as soon as you pay attention: the main characters of this film are the inspiration for the bullies of The Simpsons. Layne is Jimbo, John is Kearney and Tony Dolph. There's even an episode of The Simpsons where Jimbo uses the line "I pricked him with a stick." Kearney has his head shaved, unlike John, but is the big dumb head. The Tony-Dolph connection is pretty obvious with the long haircut and even the second level status.
