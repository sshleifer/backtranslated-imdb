This film, for what was planned, was successful. It's a short tragic film. Although my film choices are those that actually develop the characters and their relationships, this movie is designed to give you a taste, leaving you with the postman "what happens next". After watching it, I really wanted more, more characters in the story, what influences they had to turn them into people they were. I think that's what the producers wanted to make the public believe. The acting is incredible. There are not many lines in the movie, so their body language, facial expressions, and overall presence must be powerful enough to hold a scene. Franco and Miner both have this element and it shows. For them (especially Franco), taking the time to do this, obviously says that they believed in this film and wanted to be part of it. For that, I enjoyed the film for what it was. In addition, I'm happy to have it so I can share it with others who would never have known it existed.
