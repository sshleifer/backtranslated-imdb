I was very excited to see Rock Star because I am a big fan of Mark Wahlberg. I was surprised to have loved him more than I originally thought. The scenario was poor, but the film's performances offset it. There have been some moments when visions of Spinal Tap have come back, and I can not help but think that this film would have been even better as a documentary. But I am moving away from the subject. <br /> <br /> Wahlberg continues to demonstrate his talent by playing with credibility an ordinary guy whose biggest dream comes true. He does it with wonder and innocence that not only make you believe him, but also really worry about his character. <br /> <br /> Jennifer Aniston, who had not impressed me in the movies so far, is surprisingly good as a girlfriend / manager. She shows more real emotion than the one I saw in her latest films together. <br /> <br /> But it is especially the music of this film that really attracts you. Full of 80s melodies (let's face it - Bon Jovi would have 80s music fans in the chair), the movie is really rock with the original songs of Steel Dragon and their interpretation by Wahlberg. <br /> <br /> I plan to see this movie again, but first I'll rush to buy the soundtrack!
