if you go out with a girl who loves wicca! <br /> <br /> many parts of this movie were killer and the feeling that you get from this movie while watching it and just after is enough alone to sit there but a few things really bothered me in this movie that I can not really put my finger on ... <br /> <br /> I really think this movie is one that any student in art or photography should see as b / c of the camera style and grains that I've never seen, but it's just that ... it looks like an art student did it and intrigue it, if there is one, is so nervous that you really have to take a lot of medicine to get what's going on
