Hey now, I've never seen a comic manga, but apparently, this movie is based on it. Oh, that's the life. Anyway, it's a strange film, because things are literally escaping in a small Japanese town. People become obsessed with uzumaki (spiral) and this girl watches her friend's father film a snail on video tape, and later in the movie, people start to become snails? It also seems that this boy's father is so obsessed with suicide in a home appliance. There is a weird humor here that could be at home in a Tim Burton movie, but there is some nastiness & gore as only the Japanese can do with justice. As in many Japanese films, the end is the end and something has been solved? Well, not in my opinion, it was not. There are some clues as to why all this happens, but they are not explored and there is much left to be left to the imagination or it was not considered important. However, there are many things for the pleasure of the eyes and if you are not obsessed with anything that makes sense, then it's worth seeing, because it's so original and weird. My favorite was the father with the eyes turning, personally. 8 out of 10 stars.
