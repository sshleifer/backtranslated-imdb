Very tightly written, played and filmed. Violent, but not too much. Whoever edited this knew exactly what he wanted to portray. There is not a scene lost in this movie. "The Usual Suspects" was a beautiful set. It is a collection of exceptional individual performances. I rarely buy movies, but this one is worth buying.
