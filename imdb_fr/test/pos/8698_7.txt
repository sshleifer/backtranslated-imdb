A few years ago, when I rented movies, I came across Subspecies 4, I ended up watching it, and in fact I liked it a lot. But when I went back to the video store, they told me they had no other video of Subspecies. Unfortunately, the same thing happened for all the other video stores I visited. I gave up, until someone on youtube posted all the Subspecies movies and I could watch them all last night and I'm addicted. I am now a fan of the Full Moon Subspecies series. Because it was the type of horror movie I was looking for, I had been looking for a good fear of cheese for a long time and Subspecies was occupying this place. Radu is one of the coolest vampires on the screen and almost gives Nosferatu a run for his fangs! <br /> <br /> Radu is a devilish vampire who searches for his bloodstone, his birthright, a stone that contains absolutely incredible blood and gives it strength. Three American girls who study Romanian history and culture come up against a man, Stephan, who offers to help him. They stay at Radu Castle where we discover that Stephan is Radu's brother. Radu seduces and turns two of the girls, but Stephan cracks for one of the girls, Michelle, and will do anything to protect her. <br /> <br /> The subspecies is a fun series, despite the effects in some ways more sympathetic. Plus, Radu was a perfect villain, while Stephan was the perfect angel as a romantic vampire. The story is scary and I think it was a fun vampire movie. It was also the first in the series, the best part is that the suites are just as fun. I would recommend it for a scary movie night, look at it in the dark, Radu will surely send chills down your spine, or even in the neck ... OK, joke, I could not resist. > 7/10
