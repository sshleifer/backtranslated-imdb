It's one of the most touching films I've ever seen. No film affected me like this one. It's an excellent movie and you have to see for yourself. I'm normally impregnable with these bloody story movies but this one did it to me. I was in tears at the end. You will aspire to the friendship described in this film. If I can give this movie a billion stars, I could.
