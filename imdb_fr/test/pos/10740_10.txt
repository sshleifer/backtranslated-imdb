Dr. Seuess should have been congratulated for stealing the story of "Horton Hatches The Egg", but it was a good movie. It affected both the emotions and the intellect. Especially because of the incredible interpretation of Justin Henry, seven years, and a scenario sympathetic to each character (and the situation of each), the elements that cause the thought persist long after the end of jerks. Overall, the acting quality is excellent from a solid cast, an excellent staging and a very powerful scenario. The good touches of humor help to prevent a "heavy" subject from becoming boring or difficult to manage. Finally, this film stands the test of time and does not seem dated, decades after its release.
