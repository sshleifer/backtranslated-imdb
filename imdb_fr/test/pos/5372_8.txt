Ben (a good Charles Bateman), his young daughter K.T. (a pretty Geri Reischl) and her new girlfriend Nicky (the very attractive Ahna Capri) are on their way to a birthday party for K.T. They are surprised in a remote town in the south of the country, where no one can leave, and with the exception of Ben, K.T. and Nicky, nobody can get in there. To top it off, children are disappearing and adults are murdered at an alarming rate. Ben is helping some people - Sheriff Pete (LQ Jones), Tobey (Alvy Moore) and Jack (Charles Robinson), the local priest, are trying to solve the mystery. <br /> <br /> This devil of the early 70s - The thematic horror film is actually prior to "The Exorcist" and combines a plot of "Bad Day at Black Rock" type of a rural town with a big skeleton in his closet with elements of horror, for interesting results. In fact, it sent a shiver down the spine of this viewing, as it moves inexorably along its sinister path. The sombre and solemn atmosphere is established quickly and lasts the whole duration; the feeling of growing panic gives him a real kick. Some memorable settings include the bizarre opening of a tank of toys that turns into a real tank and crushing a car, not to mention the twisted nightmare Nickys, made alive and stylish by the director Bernard McEveety and his team. The music of Jaime Mendoza-Navas is subtly sinister and gives him an extra sense of serenity. <br /> <br /> The serious and professional actors do a remarkable job, especially Strother Martin, always engaging, as Doc Duncan affable, and the producers. / actors LQ Jones and Alvy Moore. <br /> <br /> The fact that all the plot takes place under the noses of our heroes makes the thing even more frightening. Jack the priest begins to guide them in the right direction, but will they be in time to put an end to things? It is a nice little cooler that deserves to be revisited; As an individual, I was able to appreciate it a lot more after giving it a second chance. I can now say yes, it is indeed underestimated, telling a good story in an interesting, unconventional and effective way. <br /> <br /> 8/10
