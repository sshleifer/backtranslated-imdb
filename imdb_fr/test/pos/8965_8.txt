... with one act. <br /> <br /> Charlie Wilson, Congressman, a real character. In the 90s, when communism over the USSR, the Berlin Wall and the war against the Afganan (with the Soviets) broke. He did it, one refusal of money, and everything dropped. We should remember him, so here he is. His memorial. <br /> <br /> Back to the movie. Funny, dramatic, snobby, political or just boring. Anyway, it's a smart movie about politics, about governing the world and especially about a lesson to give to the world. A lesson for every policy, a critical point of view referring to countries that support wars with money, weapons and words. <br /> <br /> Lesson learned - The world is not a good place to live
