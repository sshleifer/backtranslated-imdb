Colonel Chabert is one of the best adaptations of the novel on the screen that I saw in the movies. He combines the realism of French cinema with an excellent characterization, from Chabert lost in Depardieu to the proud lawyer of Fabrice Luchini to Fanny Ardant's widow complex. The film has a wonderful dimension, as you would expect from a great cinematographer like Yves Angelo. The characters keep this movie in gear and although a bit slow at first, it is gaining speed and is a good movie by the time it arrives at the finish.
