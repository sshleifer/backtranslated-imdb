It's a really hilarious film and I've seen it many times. Drew Barrymore is brilliant in the role of Josie Geller, as is David Arquette in the role of his brother. You are embarrassed at the thought of his return to high school, because the film recalls what was really high school! Her outfits are crazy and strange, and it reminds the memories of those who dressed a little differently! The gorgeous Michael Vartan was adorable as a teacher (I wish there were such teachers when I was in high school!) And Josie's boss is fantastic. It's a movie you can watch again and again, with a fabulous soundtrack! One for everyone who goes to school in the 90s!
