Trey's favorite of the first round of season 10 and one of my personal favorites, Manbearpig describes the adventure of Al Gore before global warming and before the movie, it was certainly a similar adventure, Al Gore was trying also to become aware of the world. About something that can change the Earth, something very dangerous, this time about something that is half man, half bear and half pig, Al Gore had only one thing in mind: to know everything the world to Manbearpig and kill him! Al Gore is more than hilarious here, everyone who sees him feel sorry for him and yes, he can be childish and make temper tantrums, no one believes him, but he's just a crazy bastard. Basically, four children are trapped in a cave because of Al Gore, but he certainly does not have that in mind, there is no room for another subject, it's just Manbearpig that concerns Al Gore. These four children are Cartman, Kenny, Kyle and Stan. In the end, Stan was sorry for AL Gore and the four boys were playing in Al Gore's game without ever imagining that Gore could almost kill them while he was trying to kill Manbearpig (hilarious scene- "these are just kids, damned Manbearpig "). So, in this part, we have on one side everything that concerns the rescue team who also regrets Al Gore, and on the other side, we have a small episode of Cartman, yet extremely hilarious, and he there are no surprises in Cartman's attitude after he has discovered a treasure inside the cave, all the contents of this treasure is fantastic and formidable because you will see a sick Cartman in both directions, it is really sick of boys and really sick of us. And in the end, Al Gore killed Manbearpig! This character is fantastic and I am a cereal! Fun terrifying in this episode, very viewable. 10 of 10
