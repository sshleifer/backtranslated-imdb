This is one of my favorite television series. A beautiful casting, a fantastic scenario and an outside plot. <br /> <br /> Observing the routine of the Kyle family guarantees great moments of humor and great performers of comedy. Let's see: - Damon Wayans: no comment. He is one of the best today. It has a perfect timing and always has the meaning of the joke. <br /> <br /> - Tisha Campbell: Her paranoid and sentimental Jay is beautiful to see. <br /> <br /> - George O. Gore II: perfect for paper. It's impossible to imagine anyone else like the adorable (and silly) Junior. <br /> <br /> - Jennifer Nicole Freeman: Claire, the egocentric, has found the ideal actress. Beautiful and talented. <br /> <br /> - Parker McKeena Posey: It's impossible not to fall in love with her. <br /> <br /> - Noah Gray-Cabey: this boy has a future, I'm sure of that. <br /> <br /> I'm very sad when it ends, but this show will stay in my memory forever. Michael, Jay, Claire, Junior, Kadie ... we love you!
