I saw Robin Hood: Men in Tights for the first time in 1994 at the movies. I went to see him because I always liked Robin Hood and I saw the trailer of this movie and I thought it was hilarious. After seeing the movie, I must say it was even better than I thought. Not only is it very funny, it is also a very well done film with beautiful scenery and costumes and a beautiful score of Hummie Mann. The role in the movie is also good, Cary Elwes is funny like Robin Hood but also Tracey Ullman, Richard Lewis, Mark Blankfield, David Chapel, Amy Yasbeck, Megan Cavanagh, Eric Allan Kramer, Matthew Porretta and Mel Brooks himself are funny . But the best role in the film is played by Roger Rees as the evil sheriff of Rottingham. It has the best scenes of the film and also the best dialogue ("Illegal forest to prevent wild destruction", which means "It is illegal to kill a wild pig in the forest of the king"). place all the words and pronounce a sentence that nobody understands. Robin Hood: Men in Tights is in my book one of the best films of Mel Brooks so far and I can not say that I laughed so much about a movie as this one. It's just laughing all the time.
