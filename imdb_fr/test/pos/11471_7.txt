I was given a DVD of Public Enemies and I was expecting it to be the 2009 version, but it was not - that was it! Of course, it was not the best movie I've ever seen - not by any means - but damn it was worth more than 2.8 out of 10! When I saw this abysmal note on IMDb, I wondered what I was going to get, but, as the disc was in the drive, I sat down to watch it. As other commentators have pointed out, Public Enemies is NOT a historical film, strictly speaking - and I noticed that, unlike the 2009 version (which I have not seen yet), IMDb does not not categorize as such. <br /> Go people! It's a story based on real people - that's it! If I wanted a history class, I'd sit in front of that computer and read Wikipedia or something. Ma Barker (Arizona - or Arrie - Barker) - has never been charged with any crime and, as other commentators have already pointed out, she probably never even participated in her son's activities. They sent her to the cinema when they "worked"! (I hope she was not as critical as some of those who watched this movie!) <br /> <br /> Theresa Russell had the never-easy task of portraying a 17-year-old woman through she died at the age of 52 - from a girl running from home to the hardened mother of four hoodlum sons. I think she did it very well. The cheeky little smile she used in more than one scene was classic! OK, I agree with some critics that the direction of this film was below average and I sympathize with the actors for that. Theresa should have told the director to forget topless photos - they did not contribute to the story. Perhaps great stars would have managed to put their own expertise to the service of the wrong direction while the sophomores were not so brave. Who knows? <br /> <br /> But even though it was definitely not a puzzle, it was worth more than 2.8 !! All my DVDs are stored in a personal database where I tagged them BEFORE viewing the IMDb score (although this sometimes affects slight changes later). I take what I receive on its own merits rather than hold a film against others of the same kind and this one, in my opinion, was fun enough to get 6.8. (Yes, I'm going to accept that such a practice tends to depend on my current mood, but is not that the case of those who vote for IMDb?) However, you can imagine my surprise by watching IMDb. and saw the pitiful score he got here. <br /> <br /> Given the surprise, I decided to read some of the other comments in the hope of understanding the low note and noticed that they were very polarized. I agreed with those who said the film was worth watching and I came to the conclusion that some people are hard to please. Well, since some were absolutely nuts, why did not they come over there to make better movies? I will look forward to the jewels they must be able to reveal! On the other hand, if they can not do that, then why do not they close?
