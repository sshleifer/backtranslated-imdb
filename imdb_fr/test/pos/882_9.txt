Jewel Thief is a rare species of film - completely black in its history but nothing black in its presentation. Devanand, a young man over 40 years old, plays marvelously well with a young man, Vinay, separated from his police officer, dad, and finds a job in a jewelery shop. Soon, random people approach him and call him Amar. Using only a few pithy moments, the presence of a "doppelganger" is established. Then, a Shalini woman (Vyjayantimala) introduces herself and claims to be betrothed to said doppelganger. She is accompanied by her loving brother (Ashok Kumar), who is so convinced that Vinay is actually Amar, he makes him take off his shoe and prove that he is not Aamr, the six-footer. Anju (Tanuja), the jeweler's super cute girl, is completely in love with Vinay. In the midst of all this confusion, a thief of jewels is on the run and he flies at will. Vinay's encounter with a nightclub singer (Helen!), Very hot, slowly teaches us that the thief is Amar, the doppelganger. Many beautiful women (Anju Mahendru, Faryal) are after the hero. Police forces, including Vinay's father, are completely confused. Vinay falls slowly for Shalini / Shalu and his brother seems to bless the union. The action moves to Sikkim because that's where the next Amar flight will take place. The rest is up to you to watch - the duplicate, the girls, the men who cling to every word of Vinay thinking he's their boss Amar, the brother sister sister duo - nothing seems quite right , and we must tell a story direction) Vijay Anand to conclude this story in a very entertaining way. The film contains many moments that you will be amazed until they merge into a grand finale during a dance in a Sikkim palace. <br /> <br /> I was not a big fan of Vyjayanthi, but she is very competent at her chubby. She can add to the confusion in the story in a subtle way, but she is better when she is sad or dancer. Tanuja is cute as a button and I loved her in this movie. I wanted so much that she gets the man. Dev was, well, Dev. If he did not walk like a man with a congenital shoulder defect (one shoulder always lower than the other), I would wonder who they found to imitate him! Yet his style, charm and charisma were flawless. In the song Yeh Dil Na Hota Bechara, only Dev could look cool carrying a fishing rod to which a big plastic fish was attached! Ashok Kumar was just great - Dada Moni did not fail to beat the whole movie and turned it into a book for history books. <br /> <br /> SD Burman spread magic with numbers like Baithe Hain blood red cock dancing on a bar), Aasman Ke Neeche, Rula Ke Gaya and Sapna Mera, and my favorite seductive number, Raat Akeli Hai Bujh Gaye Diye. <br /> <br /> If you fancy a great story, with more twists than a pretzel, eager to keep guessing, yet entertained and entertained - then go buy or rent Jewel Thief. It's better to buy it, so you can see it again with your friends. This one is a guardian.
