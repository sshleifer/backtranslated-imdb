"Purgatory Flats", presented on a cable recently, is a small film that packs a lot. Harris Done directs with style. The play by Mr. Done and Diane Fine is a good thriller. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen the movie, you may want to stop reading. <br /> <br /> The film is the story of a young Los Angeles doctor who made a mistake and pays the price. When he leaves prison, he wants to hide in a small town where he feels forgotten. Bad choice! What Thomas Reed finds at Purgatory Flats is hell in the desert. Immediately after landing a job as a bar attendant, Thomas meets a pretty young woman, Sunny, who must clearly stay away. The young doctor is called to help because Sunny's boyfriend, Randy, is shot dead by a drug dealer. <br /> <br /> We meet Randy's family. His uncle Dean seems to be fine, but his brother Owen is a loose cannon. Each member of the family is connected in different ways to the nubile Sunny. <br /> <br /> The performances are satisfactory. Vincent Ventresca is Thomas, the man who should have gone to his GP office instead of making a detour to the small town. Alexandra Holden is Sunny, a young woman who aims to escape her environment. Kevin Alejandro, Gregg Henry and Brian Austin play the men of the Mecklin family. Nicholas Turturro also makes a valuable contribution as a drug trafficker. <br /> <br /> The film shows a promising director who will go far to judge by this tightly constructed film.
