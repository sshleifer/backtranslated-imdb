Our America is multicultural, with so many subcultures. This film simply tells the story of a snapshot in one of these subcultures. It is essentially an objective look at a group of forgotten people who live unconsciously in the rest of the world. Generally, a good movie. He entertained, provoked thought and showed lives that would not be seen otherwise, in our own backyard. Should be seen by all. Having lived in the United States all my life, I did not know that there were citizens here who did not know citizens. This film helps to illustrate the diversity of our country by showing this small part of a southern state. The obvious conclusion: if it's really for real, then what else is there that we do not know?
