In fact, I first watched One Dark Night at the theater and wrote a review of the movie for my high school newspaper. I loved it then and I still love it. The scenario revolves around two people. First, a woman learns that her father has telekenisis after death. She then herself has feelings about the strange powers of her father, even in his death. The mauseleum in which he is buried hosts the other main person, a high school girl who does everything to enter with a group of girls who just want to torment her and challenge her to stay at the mauselee all night to join their group. They go back into the night to scare and frighten him. The cast is directed by Meg Tilly with supporting roles by Adam West and one of my personal favorites Elizabeth Daily aka E.G. Daily. Check out this one if you like 80s movies and horror movies, you will not be dissatisfied.
