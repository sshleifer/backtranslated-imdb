This young filmmaker has the talent to quickly capture his audience with unusual camera work and sparse but intense scenarios. The concept of combining animation and live footage is remarkably well executed and the soundtrack is excellent. <br /> <br /> The decision to publish the film in twelve parts online requires the director to make each episode fascinating. enough for the viewer to invest in the purchase of each upcoming episode. I only wish all films have this kind of commitment to keep their audience entertained throughout their stories. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
