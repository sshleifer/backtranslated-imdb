"The Honkers" is probably the best performance of all time for Slim Pickens. When we shot, everyone who was involved in the production thought that Slim was an Academy Award-winning material. Unfortunately, United Artists had published a photo of James Bond at the same time and did not pay much attention to "The Honkers". Personally, I feel that this film has been underestimated by most critics. Sam Peckinpaw's "Junior Bonner" was released at the same time and seemed to impress the critics more than our film. Cliff Robertson had also released a rodeo movie a few months before our release, which could have hurt us as well. The photo deserves to be watched, if only for the rodeo sequences - among the best ever filmed - filmed by James Crabbe. The director and my co-writer, Steve Ianat, died a few weeks after the release of the film, interrupting a promising career and leaving behind their charming wife Sally, his daughter Gaby and his newborn son, Stefan. Please give this movie a shot. I bet you'll say it was worth it. I thank everyone who took the time to read this. Stephen Lodge
