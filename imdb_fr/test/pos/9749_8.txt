My friend gives me these 3 huge boxes. "These are Flash Gordon series laser discs," he says. "I'm going to have giant mountains," I say. But not so. This series is great. (But I had to moan and moan almost everyone I knew to find a laser disc player for them.) <br /> <br /> There's really a little bit of everything in this soap opera: There are lions men, hawks, shark-men, men of the Earth, and I suppose you would call them Mongo-men. The sets and costumes combine, Greek, Roman, Oriental, Egyptian and there is even an armor like English knights. Impressive costumes. And some of them were a riot. These horrible tights with shorts on top worn by Zarkov are indescribable. And the guys in the furnace scene seem to be wearing underpants. <br /> <br /> It's also funny to see how they renamed octopus in octosack, orangutan in orangapoid and tiger in tiger. There is even a dragon (a Godzilla-like creature who threatens Flash several times before being killed). <br /> <br /> Do you like the invisible man? It covered you. Do you like sword fighting, fighting (animals and men), fighting in the fist? A lot for all tastes. We have an underwater city, a heavenly city, a mountain-top city and tons of secret passages and caves. <br /> <br /> Hokey effects? Massive quantities. The celestial city is supported by radium furnaces powered like old-fashioned steamers. Rockets are "powered" by fireworks and have constant fire returns and / or snoring. Many wires are visible holding objects (like food when Flash was invisible and of course spaceships). There are clouds in space, but none around the earth seen from Mongo. The "giant" lizards appear briefly. Fighting sea creatures allegedly threaten Flash & co. on the way to the underwater shark-men city. The "gadgets" in Dr. Zarkov's lab make me crack. And they seem to be the same regardless of which laboratory he is in (he worked in the Ming and Vultan labs). <br /> <br /> And yes, we have a love story. Everyone wants Dale; Ming, Vultan, Flash. But at least one person did not want Princess Aura (Prince Baron), but not the person she would have preferred. In fact, it seems that many sub-intrigues involve the plot on the part of Princess Aura to try to win Flash. <br /> <br /> I think the characters are great. King Vultan, that fat horse who laughs, was hilarious. How he handled these wings was purely artistic. And Ming! What can I say about Ming? He was perfect. They should have had it for the emperor in Starwars. Ming must be my favorite character in this series. Princess Aura was also a little character. And she came out nicely. I think she's a better actress than Dale Arden by a long shot. Even the devious high priest had a distinctive role. Zarkov was good, but not the strongest character - and he always stood in the background when fighting scenes with Dale. We now come to Flash: Flash, of course, was the strong point, the leader, the hero - and he did it well. Crabbe is a good actor and this role suits him perfectly. <br /> <br /> After watching this, I think I know where George Lucas got the main idea of ​​Starwars. Look at this, you'll see what I mean. <br /> <br /> If you've ever considered watching an old series (or any other series), this option should be your first choice. The only reason I did not give this one a 10 was because of a few story holes that could have been easily fixed, the way the giant lizards seemed to be stuck, and some characters weak (the king of the shark-men and king of the lion-men).
