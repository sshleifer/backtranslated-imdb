The effectiveness of this image has been better demonstrated to the target audience, namely adolescents. My 14 year old son became so engrossed in this film that I rank him much higher than his imitator "Mad City". This has sparked a debate within our household on issues such as peer pressure and loyalty, as opposed to the right thing to do. Just for that, I rate this movie at 10! Parents should look at it with their teenagers and discuss it later. <br /> <br /> I really liked the intelligent dialogue and the coherent game. I thought James Remar was adequate in his role, but the cast of teenagers really carried that picture. Other BDIM users have praised Corey Feldman's performance as a true inspiration. Overall, I highly recommend this picture. Go get this one!
