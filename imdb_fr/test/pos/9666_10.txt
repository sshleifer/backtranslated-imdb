In retrospect in 2002, the year of the creation of "Furia", we can easily recognize the singing songs of the new generation of today in Romania. <br /> <br /> The main qualities of "Furia" reside in a very solid writing, with a substantial dramatic core and a truly professional development, plus a cast of excellent actors. Dragos Bucur and Andy Vasluianu confirm that since then, Dorina Chiriac is one of the best performers of the moment, that Dorina Chiriac closely follows them, and Adrian Tuli, a professional, a director of cemetery!) Thrown on Gabonu, was a real revelation! <br /> <br /> In addition, the direction of Radu Muntean is skilful and expressive, creating in a very convincing style the feeling of a "fateful night" and an inevitable destiny. One can easily miss some awkward moments and even missed, since time had proved that it was only the uncertainties inherent in a first film, never repeated in his following films: "Hârtia va fi albasträ" and "Boogie".
