This French study of the late fifties on young dissatisfied (in the early twenties, in reality - "grown up", but not yet installed in the world of adults) probably missed the target in terms of accurate representation of youth French version of 1958 (River's Edge does not come to mind, it is rare to think of all the youth films made by adults, the ones that do not), but the director-writer Marcel Carne, of Fame Children of Paradise, too. an observer of humanity NOT to provide an insightful view of the essence of these characters. In one sense, the details are not important - you can change the details and edit this movie today and it would work just as well - but the loneliness and insecurity, the superficial passion and the evil anger of the characters are well captured . The young Pierre Brice and Jean-Paul Belmondo play secondary roles, but Jacques Charrier, Laurent Terzieff, Pascale Petit and Andrea Parisy play the roles with subtlety and depth. There is also a beautiful jazz score that you can get on the CD JAZZ IN PARIS - JAZZ & CINEMA VOL. 2. Unlike some who commented on the film, I do not really see director-writer Carne hanging on these characters - he seems to be an objective observer for me. Of course, these middle-class characters may seem like spoiled people who have no reason to complain to some of the film's working-class viewers, and I think Carne is certainly aware of that. For this American viewer (I watched a version of this movie called THE CHEATERS), the film offers an interesting window on France in the 1950s. It's also a conscious poetry (the scene on the ledge, saving the cat is an example) and intellectual aspirations as charming as only French films can cope - I can imagine the hard-to-sew. melodramatic, superficial, this kind of material would have been treated by an American production, as well as sensationalism, the moralist and suggestive. This kind of material would have been treated by American filmmakers of the drive-in / exploitation type. I think Marcel Carne captured the essence of this period between, say, high school graduation and the time when, in their early thirties, people got used to a routine whether. Those who are willing to watch the film with an open mind and not to attack the many easy targets it offers should find a serious and helpful study of people in their twenties. And even if you do not want to do that, you can go to the next room while the movie is in progress and just enjoy the soundtrack, with a great 1950s jazz and instrumental pop, including the wonderful original score from an American group "Jazz at". the "Philharmonic" group including Coleman Hawkins, Dizzy Gillespie, Stan Getz (spelled "goetz" in the credits), Roy Eldridge and Ray Brown.
