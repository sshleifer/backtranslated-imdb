I just watched this with my three kids - 12 (boy), 10 (boy) and 8 (girl) and this movie was a good old family action movie. Although intended for the children's market (I would say 5 to 13 years), it was quite visible and, as a parent, it's a pleasure to find a film that will appeal to a wide range of ages, all being able to be watched by the whole family. - especially the youngest children. <br /> <br /> The story revolves around Ricky, a bit nerdy with an overflowing imagination (it certainly shows in his waking dream sequences) that thwarts an abduction and a major art theft-board a flight for Washington for a school trip. Ricky's father is an airplane mechanic. Ricky is not only familiar with the structure of the aircraft, but also plays the role of top simulator on his flight simulator. This is convenient when the pilot and the co-pilot are cold in a series of mishaps and there is no one left to pilot the plane. I do not want to give more intrigue.
