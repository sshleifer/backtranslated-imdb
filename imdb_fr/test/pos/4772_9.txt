SPOILERS <br /> <br /> As you may know, I have been commenting on a lot of silent short films in recent months. Now, I do not know why I'm commenting Steamboat Willie, I guess I was just desperate to comment on anything, so I watched that, and now I'm commenting on it. This, of course, is one of the very first drawings, and I believe it is not the first drawing with sound. <br /> <br /> Here is the plot. Mickey Mouse drives a steamboat when Pete throws it and drives it. When they stopped for a load, Minnie Mouse tried to climb but failed miserably. Mickey lifts her by a crane. Then a goat eats his sheet of paper with the turkey in the straw on it. They use the goat to make the song. When I say that I mean they used the goat as Victrola. Mickey plays the animals on the steamboat for the instruments of the song. Then an angry Pete throws Mickey into a potato room and Mickey is forced to peel potatoes for the rest of the day. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's another groundbreaking and silent short film. I mean, this is the third Mickey Mouse cartoon. Yes, the third. In addition, this is not the first cartoon with sound. I think there were two more before this one. Anyway, this movie is really, really revolutionary. Mikcey was also more violent than he is shorn. I mean, he's throwing a potato at a bird and maybe brutally slaughtering it. <br /> <br /> 9/10 <br /> <br /> Recommended films: Plane Crazy.
