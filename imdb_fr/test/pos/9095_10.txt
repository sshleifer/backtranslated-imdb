Seriously, there was everything you could want in a movie, everything! See your scalawags who love Gone With The Winds and screw even more fans of the Titanic! Tenacious reins, forever and ever, amen! <br /> <br /> Climb on my trusty mount, then we'll go up, we'll smoke grass. Climb on my big horse, And go up, go up, go up. <br /> <br /> What's the name of the song, Explosivo! I do not know what it is, but it's good to go. What is the name of my girlfriend that I do not know, but she is built like the best And she is ready to go, go, she is ready to go, she is ready to leave. Yes, we are educated by Satan. Powered by Satan! Write these delicious riffs as fast as you can. Brought up by Satan! <br /> <br /> We were the inventors of the cosmic astrological code. We came to blow you, we came to blow your nose. We came to love at first sight, we came to blow the show. We have come to panic, you know it, you know it! <br /> <br /> What's the name of the song, Explosivo! I do not know what it is, but it's good to make an enigma-ah! <br /> <br /> I am not one of you. I come from an old age. I am known as the elf kicker. I am also known as The Angel Crusher! <br /> <br /> Explosivo.
