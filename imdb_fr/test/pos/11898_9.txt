I just want to say that this movie was excellent. <br /> <br /> I loved it from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> The acting game was great. The director did a fantastic job and I would like to see him again. <br /> <br /> Jennifer Tilly did a very good performance, The guy who played her father (Manny) was another great actor BUT I CAN NOT RECALL HIS NAME. <br /> <br /> I can not wait for El Padrino II. <br /> <br /> Damian Chapa looks so good and I think he is one of the most talented actors on the market. There is a plethora of Latin actors doing a great job as shown in this movie! <br /> <br /> Rent it !!! To rent !!! To rent !!!
