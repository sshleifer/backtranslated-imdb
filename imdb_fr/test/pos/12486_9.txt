H.G. Cluozot had difficulties working in France after making "Le Corbeau" in 1943, produced by the German company and then judged by the French as anti-French propaganda. Louis Jouvet, admirer of the work of Clouzot, invites him to perform a thriller "Quai des Orfèvres" where he plays an ambiguous police inspector who investigates a murder at the Music Hall in Paris. The seductive cabaret singer Jenny Lamoure (Suzy Delair) and her husband jaloux piano accompanist, Maurice, who is madly in love (Bertrand Blier, father of the director Bertrand Blier) try to hide themselves (without their knowledge). What do they believe to be their involvement in the murder? Between a tenacious policeman (Louis Jouvet) determined to discover the truth. Jouvet virtually stole the film with a wonderfully cynical and sentimental performance. "His character, his eagle profile and his unique way of talking made him an unforgettable memory." "Quai des Orfèvres", the spiritual and atmospheric observation of human weaknesses was the great return of H.G. Cluozot, the good director of "French Hitchcock".
