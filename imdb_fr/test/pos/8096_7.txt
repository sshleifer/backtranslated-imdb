A good movie, but not great, "The Great Dictator" is Chaplin's first talking movie. It's a good effort, and sometimes a remarkable satire on Hitler, but unfortunately, Chaplin's moments of brilliance here are left out by a tendency to use too much unnecessary dialogue. Yes, Chaplin, the silent screen master, uses too many words in this film, and his tendency to write long speeches and unnecessary dialogue passages would be reflected in his other films, such as (better) "Limelight". Despite everything, Chaplin has been extremely daring in the making of this film and his dual-role performance is certainly memorable. Paulette Goddard does not have the glow she had in "Modern Times" (her affair with Chaplin was getting colder then), but she's still worth seeing, and Jack Oakie just steals the show as a rival dictator. The famous creation of Chaplin, Hynkel.
