Two sisters, Su-mi (IM Soo-jung) and Su-yeon (MOON Geun-young) return home with their father (Kim Gap-soo). Eun-joo (YEOM Jeong-ah) greets them but Su-mi's ways are bitter for her. Su-mi hates Eun-joo because the father let her behave like the maid after the death of the sisters' mother. Seeing his attitude, Eun-joo begins to treat the sisters coldly and creates an atmosphere of tension among them. <br /> <br /> As if called by the atmosphere, a series of mysterious things take place in the house. When Su-mi hung her dress in her wardrobe, many dresses of the same pattern have already been suspended. When she puts her newspaper in a drawer, she finds another newspaper of the same kind. When she sleeps in bed with Su-yeon scared, a nightmare wakes her up and she finds a woman standing on her - and a hand swaying out of the woman's skirt! <br /> <br /> Mysterious things happen to other people too. On the evening of the next weekend, Eun-joo's brother and his wife visit the family and have dinner together. Eun-joo speaks enthusiastically about a crazy man she met when she was a child, but no one is interested in her conversation. She says the madman has upset the brother, but he says he knows nothing about the man. <br /> <br /> Listening to their conversation, the brother's wife panics. <br /> <br /> After dinner, the conflict between Eun-joo and the sisters gets worse. Eun-joo pulls Su-yeon into a cupboard and locks it. Su-mi rescues the crying sister and complains to her father of what Eun-joo did to her daughter. But his answer is unexpected. "Leave me alone." he said angrily, "Su-mi, please, do not tire me any more." <br /> <br /> And the following words come out of the father's mouth and are more shocking than what they saw at home. <br /> <br /> To tell you the truth, I hate horror movies. Although I sat at the theater because my intuition told me that the film was something different, I was sorry what my curiosity had made me play when it started to be shown. However, regret had become a joy of waiting ten minutes later. <br /> <br /> This film is a tragic mystery more than a horror - painful rather than horrible; beautiful more than sensational. This may have disappointed a horror movie fan, but for a mystery fan like me, this movie is a must see. (9 out of 10)
