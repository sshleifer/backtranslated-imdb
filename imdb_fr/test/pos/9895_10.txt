A wonderful story that should be seen by all families. The values ​​of history, role playing and production are all first class. I highly recommend "Checking Out!" <br /> <br /> Peter Falk is wonderful as an aging actor who wants to decide when he will die so that he can continue to know how things are going to end and not be a "member of the audience." His three children rush to New York to confront him and try to change his mind. There are, of course, unresolved family problems to be solved, and the script and actors treat them well and with great humor. <br /> <br /> The story is about a Jewish family, but it could easily be about another family. Well, maybe not a WASP family. The brothers and sisters have problems with each other and also with their father. I loved writing and directing, as well as acting. In short, a humorous and touching film.
