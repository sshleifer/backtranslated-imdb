I really liked this one. I know it unleashes clich√©s and we have too many, but it was very entertaining. <br /> <br /> In our quest for horror cheese from the 70s and 80s, we come across a lot of movies that are so bad they are good. We also have some who are so "good" that they are zero, then others who are so bad that they are just bad. It's so bad that it's good. <br /> <br /> Some teenagers who travel discover an "oasis" in the middle of nowhere, a forgotten slice of America by the roadside, and they decide to "check". They cross each line of inappropriate until it is absurd and they pay for it. They pay dearly. <br /> <br /> Normally, I would not give a 9 as a movie, but the girls of it are the type we miss in the 1970s: ditzy, lightly clothed and FIT. These are not the anorexic breadths of today's horrible horror; they look great in booty shorts. <br /> <br /> I give them a 9 out of 10, kids.
