Wow! My mother bought me this movie because it was on sale at a really cheap store in my city and she knows that I like horror movies. I first looked at the blanket and sighed, thinking it was a regular B movie that was trying to be scary. I was so wrong! I made the big mistake of looking at him alone, my parents and my brother were asleep and it was really late. After watching the movie, I was so scared that I was shaking ... I did not even dare to go up and release the video of the video recorder! I slept with the lights on ... <br /> <br /> The main story of this film is the story of teenagers who leave the road and have to spend the night in the woods, telling scary stories ... The first story is really scary, and it makes you very hard to squeeze into a pillow if you look at it alone .. The second story is scary too, but not the same way as the first. The third story (my favorite) is really scary. It scared me the most. This is a guy who drives his bike all over the country. One night, when there is a storm outside, he goes to the nearest house and knocks on the door .. A girl opens and she is silent .. I do not want to tell you more, but you'll have shivering looking could add that my heartbeat was really abnormal when I watched it). The main story of "Campfire Tales" has a really interesting and surprising ending. I know some guys said it was bad, but me, my boyfriend and my friends loved it, and it was a long time since we had this fear .. note: 10/10, oh by the way, it's not like Urban Legend at all, it's so scary.
