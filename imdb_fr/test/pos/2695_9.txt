"The King of Queens" could be divided into two epochs. <br /> <br /> The first epoch, made up of the first seasons, depicted the problems of daily life of a man and his wife who lived throughout the city. pay check by pay check. <br /> <br /> The second era broadened the scope of the show, addressing current popular culture and marital problems with a humorous twist. <br /> <br /> But next to all this .... <br /> <br /> This show was terribly hilarious. <br /> <br /> Kevin James, when he's not making shitty comedy movies with Adam Sandler, is a genius of laughter, and his chemistry with Leah Remini was second to none. to the television. <br /> <br /> Jerry Stiller, the living and psychotic stepfather, has added his own offbeat humor style, and Patton Oswalt, "the man-child" Spence Ulchin was amazing (he's a comedian too "The King of Queens" was the last sitcom of the 1990s to get out of the air, and that's a shame. All that's left to do is look at the foolish sitcoms filled with actors and actresses with no talent whose only attraction is their physical appearance. I like a lot of fans of really funny TV shows am now in a state of mourning
