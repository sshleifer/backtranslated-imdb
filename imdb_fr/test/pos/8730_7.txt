Much more vivid, less scenic, and less connected than the previous efforts of Gene Saks, Barefoot in the Park (67) and The Odd Couple (68), Cactus Flower is not a work of art, but most of the jokes that are exhausted. from 60's like The Apartment, how to murder his wife, goodbye Charlie, a guide for married man, divorce, American style, every Wednesday, Kiss Me Stupid, the evening between boys, it's a chef-d 'artwork. Director Saks and the writer I.A.L. Diamond has indeed "opened" Abe Burrows' success on Broadway, and the film benefits greatly from the filming in New York and the excellent performances of Ingrid Bergman and Goldie Hawn. Bergman is charming, looks great and demonstrates a talent for comedy. Hawn in his Oscar winning role has never been so beautiful and attractive. Matthau is fine, although it's hard to believe that Hawn's character would like him so much. And in retrospect, Hawn's suicide attempt at the beginning of the film is out of the ordinary and incredible. Nevertheless, the film has a plausible and plausible configuration and, once it is launched, it causes laughter. Rick Lenz, Jack Weston, Eve Bruce and Vito Scotti provide good support. The movie is nice and fun, and Hawn and Bergman help you.
