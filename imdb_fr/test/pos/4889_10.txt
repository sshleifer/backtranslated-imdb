I am an addict to the TV show, concerts and everything they do. And this is the last work they did on television / cinema as "The League of Gentlemen". <br /> <br /> If you like the show, you'll love the movie. It's a beautiful ending to their television series. <br /> <br /> It's smart and fun. <br /> <br /> Even if it does not focus on some of the most popular characters, it's always nice to see them all together and with the authors. Must see for all fans of League of Gentlemen. <br /> <br /> Look at it!
