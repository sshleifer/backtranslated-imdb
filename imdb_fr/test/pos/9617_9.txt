This film was first introduced to me in San Antonio, Texas. This film was the 2nd. in a double line. Unfortunately, the theater where I saw this was demolished. Anyway, Five Fingers of Death (aka: King Boxer) was released in 1972 and was introduced to the United States the following year. Like many other "movies" of Kung-Fu, released while they rolled on the "aisles" of Enter the Dragon, this film in particular was rather good. This is the story of a boy from the countryside who is sent to a martial arts institute to improve his skills and improve his fighting skills. Meanwhile, the "opposing" martial art school is planning to thwart our hero, using dirty tactics to try to put him out of action and prevent him from participating in the tournament. Surprisingly, I thought that since Warner Bros. had distributed this film in the United States, Warner Bros. was going to release a DVD. It never happened. As far as I know, this movie was released in English and Cantonese, with subtitles ..... the latter being a version "cleaner and clearer". Although the fight sequences are a little funny to watch (eg flying in the air and hitting, jumping on buildings, a fighter using his head ... literally ... to hit his opponent, etc.), nevertheless, it is classic kung-fu action wonderfully planned and executed. If you like Enter the Dragon, Five Fingers of Death would be a great addition to any movie collection ... if you can find it.
