Starring: Kelsey Grammar, Rob Schneider, Lauren Holly, Rip Torn This film is a favorite of the classic family. At least for most members of my family. One of us rolls his eyes at the mention of this film and says: "What a stupid movie." I am not that person though. I still find this movie very entertaining. I watched it again last night with someone who had never seen it before and I laughed as loud as the first time. It's always very funny for me. <br /> <br /> Captain Tom Dodge (Grammar) is a bit of a black sheep in the navy. He's the kind of guy who will play golf while he's on a submarine, splitting a ball on a golf course as he passes by. This is the kind of guy who will get drunk, faint and wake up with a hangover and a tattoo on his dongle. He's not the kind of guy everyone wants to order from a submarine. <br /> <br /> But Dodge is on the phone. He asked to be able to order his own submarine several times, and if he does not get a submarine this time, he goes to an office station, which means that's all for the naval life. The Admiralty decides to give him his own boat, but does not give him a new nuclear submarine. They give him a diesel submarine, an ancient relic of the Second World War. Her mission is to clean her and take her to the Atlantic for a war game. <br /> <br /> Dodge is obviously a little frustrated with being offered such a shitty boat as he worked so hard to get to where he is, so he'll talk to Admiral Winslow about it. (Torn). Winslow explains the purpose of the war game. Diesel submarines are still sold in the real world, to countries like Iran, Iraq and Libya, to name a few. Winslow wants to know what would happen if a renegade captain of a diesel submarine came to the United States and tried to smuggle a nuclear warhead into one of the bases. Would they do it? Dodge and most members of the Admiralty do not think so, but Winslow wants to know for sure, hence the reason he designed this war game. Dodge's mission is to take the Stingray at sea, then avoid the US Navy and blow up US naval bases. In a simulated battle, of course. <br /> <br /> So it's about as deep as the plot. This is not a plot-based movie. It's a stupid movie that's just a big gag. He makes fun of himself and you are not supposed to take him seriously. If you're looking for silly laughs on Friday night, I encourage you to take a look. <br /> <br /> Final result: 3 out of 4 (which is worth a look)
