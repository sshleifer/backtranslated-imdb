I was a sailor at Camp Pendleton when the D.I. came out (1st Marine Division, 11th Marine Regiment, 3rd Battalion, I-Battery). I still remember standing in line with a group of other Marines to see the movie at the "Star" Theater in Oceanside, California. <br /> <br /> We did not expect the film to portray everything we experienced at training camp. but we were all pleasantly surprised by the quality of the film. The idea of ​​using real Marines in the movie was a great idea (I think they were also real drill instructors). As a good actor as Jack Webb was, he just could not "call the pace" like a true Marine Drill instructor. <br /> <br /> We all laughed when the "problem" rookie's mother came to training camp to talk to the captain. It would never have happened in a million years, but it's Hollywood, and we have not let this episode prevent us from enjoying the movie. <br /> <br /> I attended a training camp at MCRD in San Diego during the summer. of 1956, and at that time, there was virtually no limit to what IDs could do to you. The Ribbon Creek event at Parris Island had not yet affected the training camp, at least not at the MCRD - San Diego. <br /> <br /> I agree with what many other commentators have commented on Sgt. Moore's "stiffness" around his girlfriend. I think it was just Webb's acting style, and although they could remove that part of the movie, it did not really hurt the production. <br /> <br /> A small note, the (uncredited) character of "Pvt. Rodriguez" was played by one of my drill instructors, Sgt. Peter J. O'Neill. Sgt. O'Neill used to tell us that one day he wanted to be an actor. We secretly laughed, but he surprised us all. He was an excellent exercise instructor, and I thought he was successful in his role. Besides, he really liked throwing knives. He has often shown us his talent this summer in training camp. I often wondered if he was still alive.
