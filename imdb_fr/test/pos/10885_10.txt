Since playing it for the first time in 1998, GoldenEye was one of my favorite video games. In fact, I recently bought an N64 only to be able to own it and play it more often! The game is almost perfect: the single-player mode does a fantastic job of diving into Bond's shoes, with varied mission goals, compelling weapons, and superior design. Even if the artificial intelligence of the enemy is quite fundamental compared to current standards, it only enhances the appeal of GoldenEye. The method to get tips (to finish the levels in a strict time) was also innovative at the time of the release of the title, and even to this day, I have not yet cracked a few! <br /> <br /> The game comes with a superb multiplayer mode can accommodate up to four players. Even if he is not as advanced as the combat simulator in the sequel of the game "Perfect Dark", it is still incredibly rewarding to blow up your opponents with a gun shot of RC-P90! ;-)
