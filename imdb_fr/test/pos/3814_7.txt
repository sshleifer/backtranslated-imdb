I saw it before 'bubba ho-tep' at the fantasia film festival in montreal. all there is to do is give a nod to (or tear off completely) Tim Burton. I nevertheless appreciated it, even though it is extremely derivative. What impressed me most was the quality of the visuals given the obvious budget of the string shoes. the scenography and props were inventive and original, although the scenario was definitely not.
