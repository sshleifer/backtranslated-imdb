Oz, was the first original TV show that HBO had aired on its channel (in 1 hour format) and remains to this day the best ... The story is simple ... Oz is a surrealistic look in the lives of prisoners at maximum security in Oswald, mainly on "Em City". Now, there's a lot to congratulate for this show, since the writing (which, in my opinion, was the best on TV when this show aired), the staging (top notch), the game actors (best of the best), and the characters ... This show was a critically acclaimed gem until the Sopranos bowed, after critics salivated this epic story of trust and family to notice this captivating drama ... Oz me is a better show than the sopranos in general and it's a shame that I never won an important Emmy's ... = / <br /> <br /> Congratulations to all those who participated in this magnificent heart-rending spectacle ... <br /> <KUDOS
