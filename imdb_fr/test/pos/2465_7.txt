Emilio Estevez did indeed make a good movie - who would have thought? I attended two previous films by Estevez - "Wisdom" (with his girlfriend Demi Moore) and "Men at Work" (with his brother Charlie Sheen). These are ugly movies - badly played, realized, stupid and offensive. Estevez is a good actor but ugly as a director. I lit it out of curiosity - the distribution is excellent and I had nothing to do. Cursed if it did not shoot me. <br /> <br /> This concerns Estevez who returns from Vietnam, definitely marked by what happened there. Her parents (Kathy Bates, Martin Sheen) and her sister (Kimberly Williams) are trying to reach him but can not. Something in Vietnam has deeply touched him ... and he is about to explode ... <br /> <br /> A little too long but still very good. Much of the material is familiar but the distribution is so good that it makes it look new. Estevez is good, Sheen is great (and Estevez's father in real life), Williams is moving and Bates is just amazing - she tries to keep the family together. All this leads to a powerful end that REALLY surprised me. <br /> <br /> It's worth catching. <br /> <br />
