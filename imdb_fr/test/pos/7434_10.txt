I still can not believe that computer graphics are capable of creating 3D images. As soon as my friends have heard him speak on a forum, I swear I'm going to be watched. <br /> <br /> I managed to watch some excerpts at another mall where they found many DVD Advent Children and showed it on some laptops for sale. Obviously, I was delighted but it was still not enough. Then I went to YouTube.com to search for the movie. All I was proposing was music video dedications. Until the fateful day ... I found it. I watched it despite all the distractions because I knew I had to watch it, otherwise I would be called a loser. <br /> <br /> Enough about me more in the movie. As if Final Fantasy VII was not enough, they made a movie! My favorite part was the end of Sephiroth's life. Cloud OmniSlash could not be better. But I will not spoil the whole show for you. You have to look for yourself !!! Get the DVD now!
