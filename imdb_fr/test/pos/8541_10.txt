You know those films that are obviously awful but you can not help but love them? Well, that's what Evil Ed is, maybe the best dread movie in the world. The sound is zero, the dubbing is crap, the scenario is nonsense and the special effects are pap. However, I can not help but love this film a lot and have recommended it to at least 50 people over the years. Sam Campbell (or the guy who plays it) should be in the Actor's Studio series because it is memorable. Maybe the biggest movie villain who does not call himself Tony Montana. Seriously, if you do not expect much, you will not be disappointed. Keep a light approach to watching this movie and you'll notice it soon ten.
