I still can not believe that Starevich shot this film in 1934. The animation is just perfect. What is amazing about this, with all the advanced technologies we have today, there are few animation studios capable of producing a gem like this. a. he has everything: a beautiful story, beautiful characters (although it is a morbid beauty in some cases), special effects ... well, it's certainly not a children's movie, but it's a must for those who are serious about animation.
