One of the great things about the best years of our lives is that, even though it's quite a bit in the aftermath of the Second World War, the problems we're talking about are as real today as they are in the V or VJ. 1945. The problem of how to assimilate returning veterans is as old as the written history of our planet. <br /> <br /> And even though we do not learn from history often, we can be grateful that, for once, the United States of America learn from what happened to its veterans after the previous world war. The GI Bill of Rights is mentioned in passing The best years of our lives may have been most of the social legislation of the last century. So many veterans have benefited, as have veterans like Fredric March, Dana Andrews and Harold Russell, whom you see here. <br /> <br /> The three of these actors played archetypes of veterans, characters that every corner of the United States could identify with. They all meet in a military transport plane serving their hometown, Boone City, Iowa. <br /> <br /> The war is a formidable leveler of class and distinction. March's employee, soda Andrews and US football star Russell would probably never meet, even in a small town like Boone City. But they meet and forge indestructible bonds that can never be broken. <br /> <br /> Mars is the eldest, a man with two children and the perfect Hollywood woman, Myrna Loy. He settles in the first and the best. He has some wonderful scenes, getting drunk with cockey on his return and, later, with some alcohol in him, tells the bank officials at a banquet in clear terms. <br /> <br /> I also like his scene where another veteran comes back, a sharecropper wants to get a bank loan for his own land. Watch March's expressions as he listens to the man's arguments for money. You can feel it read the soul of the man. This earned him his second Best Actor Oscar for this film. <br /> <br /> Harold Russell was a real veteran who had lost both hands while serving in the Pacific. He received a special Oscar for his performance. Because of this, it was probably unfair to name him in the supporting role in which he also won. Her performance, especially her scenes with Cathy O'Donnell, her lover who loves him with or without her hands, surpasses anything that could be described as acting. <br /> <br /> Dana Andrews is the only officer of the three men, a bomber in the Army Air Corps. Of them, maybe he should have stayed. He also comes from the poorest group of the group and was an officer and a gentleman in uniform. It was this uniform and these monthly allotment checks that convinced Virginia Mayo to marry her. The problem is that he is far less considered in his eyes as a civilian. <br /> <br /> While Mayo is having fun with Steve Cochran, Andrews is very lucky to see March's daughter, Teresa Wright, taking an interest in him. This is the main story of the film, Andrews adapts to civilian life and adapts to the fact that he married the wrong woman. GI Bill does not solve all the problems of veterans. <br /> <br /> Myrna Loy is hardly recognized for her best years. I guess it was because her role as a wife was too much like the stereotypical wife roles she had patented at MGM. Always as wife of March and mother of Wright, she is really the cement which unites all this family. <br /> <br /> The best years of our lives have been awarded the Best Film by Sam Goldwyn, Best Director by William Wyler and a few. others than the two acting Oscars he had. It was a critical and popular hit, probably the best Sam Goldwyn film ever produced. It remains to this day an endearing and durable classic and will remain for centuries. It lasts nearly three hours, but your interest will not falter once. <br /> <br /> The best tribute this film has received is that of Frank Capra, who had his own film in the Oscars this year in several categories. In his memoirs, he stated that he was disappointed at being an Oscar winner that year, but that his friend and colleague William Wyler had created such a masterpiece that he deserved all the prizes he could receive. <br /> <br /> By In fact, the film that Capra was hoping for was a wonderful life. The best years of our lives can not receive better praise than that.
