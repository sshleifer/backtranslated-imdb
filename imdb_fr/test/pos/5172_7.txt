Although I had never seen or heard of Georgetown, Colorado, it would be a pretty little movie. But my father was born and raised there, and it's my uncle's horses that you see pulling the sled! So this movie is very special for me. Much of the interiors are filmed in buildings and houses that I recognize and that are very realistic. The story is a little hokey, but Georgetown is that kind of magical place where such things could happen. John Denver was a better actor than many people attribute to him. Mary Wickes plays the kind of "common sense lady with a lot of cul-de-sac" that she has played so well in many other movies, including "White Christmas". Usually, I will not go in winter, so I like to see this movie at Christmas so I can get ready for my next trip!
