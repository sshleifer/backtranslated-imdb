.... but at the same time a part of you thinks: "Am I ready for what I'm going to see?" <br /> <br /> In the end, you are happy to have seen it. I was at least. Jackass Number Two has twice as much laughter and twice as much action. Some waterfalls will leave you breathless. Besides Little Miss Sunshine, I think it's the best movie I've seen this summer. Maybe even this year. <br /> <br /> The entire cast returns, except for a few like Chris Raab and Rake Yohn. I do not think any of the cast members had a boring time. Each waterfall was funny or dangerous or a combination of both; stupid. The beginning was as funny as the first and the end was oddly hilarious; the distribution performing a musical number. <br /> <br /> Jackass Number Two is the perfect movie to do with your friends. Stay during the credits, there are some fun times. One is about Luke Wilson.
