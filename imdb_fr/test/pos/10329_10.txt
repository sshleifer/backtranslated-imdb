Bug Juice has changed my life. I know it sounds strange, strange, strange. But that did it. I come from England, Bug Juice was never broadcast but five years ago, I went on vacation with my family and I saw it on the Disney channel. Once I saw this TV series, I became hooked, I wanted to go. It was necessary to convince my parents to allow me and my brother to go to Waziyatah. I have been there since the age of 12 and it was my fourth year this summer. If you are a teenager reading this in this camp, it changes your life. you make friends for life at Wazi.
