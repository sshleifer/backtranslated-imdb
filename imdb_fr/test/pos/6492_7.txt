In August Days / Dies d'Agost, Marc Recha presented us with a Catalan road movie saturated by the sun and which consists mainly of an improvised and sinuous meditation on fraternity and the recovery of the dead. The beautiful, sometimes large-scale, richly atmospheric 35 mm. Landscapes, soundtracks and storytelling in Catalan are a delight, if one is content with a trajectory that does not have much momentum and leads nowhere in particular. Filmmaker Marc Recha and his non-identical twin David are the stars and the story is told by their younger sister. Marc had studied the life of Ramon Barnils (1940-2001), a socialist publisher who was a friend of the family. He felt saturated with information and had to take a break. This film, which seeks to capture the atmosphere of interviews with Barnils' associates, reflections on the Spanish Civil War, the drought season they were passing through, the rugged landscape, the affection of the Recha brothers, swimming and tanned nakedness and whatever characters or stories they encountered while camping out of their van. This leads to the pursuit of a giant catfish and the temporary disappearance of one of the brothers. In the end, David has to go back to Barcelona to be with his daughter and Marc has to go back to his project, and he ends there. I found it fascinating to listen to a long narrative in Catalan mixing Spanish and French words (perhaps related to Provencal?). This is not a major film, but it attracts attention and makes sense as a film festival choice with its clear visual and auditory beauty, its way of playing with genres and combining autobiography with fiction and documentary in a new and stimulating way. <br /> <br /> Official selection of the 2006 New York Film Festival at the Lincoln Center.
