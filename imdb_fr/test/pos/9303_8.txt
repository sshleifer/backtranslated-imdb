I find it remarkable that the history of the atomic bomb was so little made and that it developed for decades after the completion of the Manhattan project. I suspect this was due to serious fears in the film and entertainment industry (from the 1950s to the 1970s) with "McCarthyism" and related national security phobias (including the Hollywood blacklist). There was a movie in the 1950s (with Robert Taylor) about Colonel Paul Tibbits who had flown Enola Gay during the Hiroshima bombing, but nothing else. One could look at a secondary tragedy (the sinking of the American city of Indianapolis shortly after the delivery of the bombs to Tinian) in Robert Shaw's description of shark attacks against JAWS survivors. But the trials and tribulations of Groves, Oppenheimer and their team were not considered filmable. <br /> <br /> And then, in 1989, two films appeared. I have already reviewed one (the first day) which, in my opinion, is the best of both when it comes to discussing the long-term technical, emotional and political issues of the Manhattan project. Brian Dennehy's roles as General Groves and David Strahairn as Oppenheimer were first class and perfectly balanced. Small vignettes on Szilard's crusade (Michael Tucker) help to tell the story. <br /> <br /> That's the problem. Paul Newman is a great actor (just like Mr. Dennehy), but Newman has approached Groves in a different way that, while not appalling, is less serious than Dennehy's intelligent, but soft military brass. Newman seems to have considered too much the possibility that this weapon is the biggest stick with which to confront the other boys of the after-school court. Yes, it certainly was, but the real Groves would have been more like Dennehy who did not think about this great toy of the future, but the creation of this beautiful toy. <br /> <br /> Dwight Schultz's performance as Oppeheimer helps keep the film production fundamentally interesting and interesting, aided by Bonnie Bedelia as his wife. But the most interesting aspect of this film resides in the revaluation of the two tragedies of Daghlian and Slotin, in particular of the latter, in the character of Merriman of John Cusack. Inevitably, in all technological advances, people are killed. It's just that these two tragedies (in addition to the tens of thousands that were lost in Hiroshima and Nagasaki) revealed the dangers of the new liberated power, even as part of a so-called controlled and peaceful experiment. The two tragedies (in particular Louis Slotin's slow and agonizing death by radiation poisoning) have shown how cautious the use of atomic energy should be - and how a very rare chance could still cause disaster. The only really different thing I saw in Cusack's performance (and in the scenario) and in the actual incident with Slotin is that Slotin did take some time after the crash to determine where all his colleagues were researchers when they were affected by radiation from the accident (he was able to show that only the accidental explosion was fully exploited, so that the other patients would only need a relatively minor treatment). The complete story of Slotin's actions may have been too technical for the screen, but given the tremendous pain he finally endured, he took time to think of others and shows how much he was really a man of the first order.
