It was an excellent movie! I saw him at the Karlovy Vary IFF in the Czech Republic, where he won a prize. This is the first film of Jan (the director) that I have ever seen and I was impressed. It's a beautiful story of love and family. The film presents a good balance between comedy, romance, drama and suspense. I will not reveal anything of the plot, but it is a film well done and I would see it again if I had the opportunity! The cinematography and editing are excellent, the film is simple and the characters are warm, and they are the kind with whom we can identify. I hope you can enjoy this movie as I did. If anyone knows where I can find this in the United States, or if it intends to publish it on DVD in the near future, thank you for letting me know !!
