I surfed IMDb one day, when I came across "The Curious Adventures of Mr. Wonderbird". Noticing how dark it was, I decided to go looking for him. Thanks to Digiview, it did not take me long and I bought it for a dollar. When I returned home, I watched it, although I must say that I was very impressed. <br /> <br /> Three of the paintings of a king's apartment, a shepherdess, a chimney sweep and a self-portrait of the king (as selfish and sadistic as the king himself) come alive one night while the king sleeps. The shepherdess and chimney sweeper escape, while the king's painting calls the police to capture the couple. Fortunately for the couple, Mr. Wonderbird comes to help them, often making fun of the police and the king. <br /> <br /> The back of the DVD case describes this film as "a surreal visual delight and an understated entry in the history of classical animation" I totally agree with that, since most of the sets look rather odd and many of the characters are strange, including depressed citizens of an underground city and hungry lions calmed by the music of a blind man (who looks like somehow to Andy Warhol), not to mention Mr. Wonderbird himself is somewhat eccentric. The film is very creative and especially fun to watch. His only fault is that he can be slow. But overall, this movie was very good and it is recommended by yours. <br /> <br /> Grade: B + (Awesome)
