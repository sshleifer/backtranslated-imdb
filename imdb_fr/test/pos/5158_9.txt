Roy Anderson's film 'You, the Living Man' includes a series of fifty sketches, snapshots and vignettes in a Swedish city. Some characters stay on screen for just a few seconds, while others appear in many scenes and are sometimes seen strolling in the background while another story unfolds. Many scenes are drawn from the dreams, nightmares and fantasies of the strange but credible characters that populate this world. It's a fascinating approach: each scene can be experienced alone, but together they form a powerful portrait of what it means to be human. <br /> <br /> For about half an hour, 'You, The Living' is gloriously funny. Much of the humor is centered on the members of a fanfare, whose musical practice infuriates the neighbors in their building. The highlight of the comic book, however, is provided by a completely hideous evening track. After this hilarious introduction, the atmosphere of the film darkens considerably. The dream of dinner becomes dark when the unfortunate protagonist is put to the test, which gives a tone mixed with absurdity and despair for the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> In the following scenes, the misfortune of the composition of the characters becomes more and more apparent. It's a world where people are unable to communicate with each other, where dreams, nightmares, and fantasies are prevalent, but where no one can be comforted, even when others are looking for them. help. The discouraged woman with the chorus "no one loves me" and the girl who passionately loves the rock guitarist Micke are archetypal characters. <br /> <br /> The world of "You, The Living" is also destroyed by selfishness. An elderly teacher receives the heat of a large banquet to answer a phone call from his impetuous son who is trying to search money. a thief steals the wallet of a ruthless executive; an arrogant and impatient businessman insults a Muslim barber and receives his congratulations. At the darkest moment of the film, a woman in a church tells the long list of human sins while her fellow parishioners go out at the closing. <br /> <br /> And yet, for all the dark moments of this film, the shared refrain of "tomorrow is another day" indicates the ability of people to continue to live despite many miseries. The soundtrack provided by Benny Anderson (ABBA fame) seems initially jovial, but makes sense when the film achieves this human ability to persevere. <br /> <br /> "You, The Living" has an extraordinary visual. style. The same faded colors and pale green are everywhere, and there is no shadow in sight; this gives the characters an unusually pale appearance and gives the impression that human life is being laid bare for examination. Almost every scene is captured in a static camera frame, as if it were photographs taken to life. The rare occasions when the camera moves are all the more extraordinary; the contrast between the life and the movement of the grand banquet forms a striking contrast with the dead scene of the cloakroom scene. In the most intense moments of nostalgia and despair, the characters pierce the viewer while facing the camera ?? they know that they are being examined and have a few moments to pour out on us, spectators. <br /> <br /> It's a wonderful and human film.
