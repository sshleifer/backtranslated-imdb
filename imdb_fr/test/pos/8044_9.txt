The Assignment is an exceptional thriller with several character-based twists rather than star twists, the need to stage special effects, mandatory romances, and endless car chases. However, there is a car chase here and a dandy. Aidan Quinn is great because the terrorist and the naval officer were "recruited" to eliminate him. It is rare for a second- or third-level actor, such as Quinn, to be given an important role like this in a movie. Usually, such a role is assigned to an actor with a draw at the box office, which probably explains why I have never heard of this film before having seen it. Donald Sutherland is excellent as a morally ambiguous, sometimes scary agent who recruits Quinn. Ben Kingsley is also good as an Israeli agent. The plot is very complex and there are several scenarios, which converge gradually towards the end, and not all at the same time as we are used to seeing it. The paranoia and claustrophobia of this type of thriller are captured and portrayed with moral ambiguity and frightening intensity. The pitches are convincing and effective. The soundtrack is nothing special, but we rarely get all the qualities mentioned above today, without stupid and / or meaningless developments; unconvincing star turns; noisy and annoying music video tapes; a bad guy who has fun; and several times, a cast, costumes, and a screenplay that are primarily aimed at an audience under 25 years of age. It's an exceptional thriller, which certainly did not have its due as soon as it was released. *** 1/2 out of 4 stars.
