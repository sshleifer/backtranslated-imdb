This film is excellent! Angel is beautiful and Scamp is adorable! His little screams are scared, and the funniest moments are when: Scamp is stuck under the curtain and when Angel and Scamp sing "I've never had this feeling before" I highly recommend this film, which will be released in special edition June 20th. The cover is adorned with a trash can and an Angel under the lid. <br /> <br /> I can not explain this film more than romantic, charming, hilarious The scenes of the case are funny, all the dogs of the case have something special. Too funny, I laughed, kids will love. Buy it when it comes out, it has new features!
