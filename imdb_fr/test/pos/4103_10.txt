I am surprised that the production companies are suing for duplicates that they will not provide. I have been looking for this movie on DVD for a while and on VHS for years. You can have all kinds of movies online ... old, new movies ... but it's all about a particular band. This film is very nostalgic for many. I do not know why I can not get a copy. Maybe if enough people write, the copyright holder will have a clue. It is time for this to happen. Yes, it's the date, but it's OZ's magician. It does not seem like it should be so difficult. So, for now, I will continue to see these illegal copies on search engines, like many others.
