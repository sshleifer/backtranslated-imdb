BLACK WATER is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limits (it's an independent film) by continually transforming its expectations into an intense experience. <br /> <br /> In the tradition of all the good animal-centered thrillers, such as Jaws, The Edge, the original Cat People band, the directors know that the restraint and what is not shown are the better ways to look good. The performances are real and captivating, the crocodile is extremely well done. Indeed, if we believe the Black Water website, it's because they used real fangs and that the situation in the marshes is fabulous. <br /> <br /> B-grade gore fest croc break forget Black Water, but if you want a clever and suspensive ride that will make you afraid of the water and ask you what the heck would I do if I raised this tree, it was a must.
