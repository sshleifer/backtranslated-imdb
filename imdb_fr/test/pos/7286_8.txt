It became extremely difficult to find a good horror movie, thinking that this movie was a good thriller. <br /> <br /> Could have a better production, but what made me hold is the suspense and the twists. I had real reservations before seeing this movie (because of the cover). I was afraid it was excessively bloody and bloody. I was wrong. <br /> <br /> Although there are many scary parts, there is also a lot of suspense and drama. <br /> <br /> The game in Dead Line was better than what you would expect from a micro-budget horror movie. The characters were credible <br /> <br /> The movie is really exciting and quite scary at times, so you can take your seat until the last generic <br /> <br /> Because of its values of production (the sound is not very good for example) 8/10.
