I'm not sure if I like this movie or not. I think it's scary and completely strange. Crispin Glover has always given an excellent performance as Layne. I think his performance was really good and one of his best, but I do not like the character at all. Keanu Reeves' performance was really good and I really felt for her character. Overall, I think that all the actors have achieved great performances, as if the characters were real. I hated some, but I felt really sorry for others (Keanu Reeves). I would like to know if it was the original ending that the movie was supposed to have because it did not end as planned. I was disappointed with the end and I do not think that did justice to the rest of the film. If you like scary, strange and really different movies, go for this one. If you like normal things, stay away.
