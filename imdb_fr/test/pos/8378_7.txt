"Third Man" looks like the dark, black-and-white photograph of STOLEN IDENTITY, a thriller produced by Turhan Bey, a former Universal Pictures star in the 1940s. It's a jealousy tale filmed by an expert who leads assassination when a famous pianist (FRANCIS LEDERER) becomes too possessive towards his wife (JOAN CAMDEN) and is soon determined to implement a project of assassination of a man with whom she has an affair. /> <br /> A taxi driver (DONALD BUKA) takes the woman's lover to the hotel on his way to the hotel when he goes out for a moment to chat with a worker digging the street. Lederer uses the sound of the drill to stifle the sound of the ball he puts in the passenger's head from outside the rear of the car. When Buka returns to his taxi, he finds a dead man in the passenger seat. <br /> <br /> On the way to report the murder to the police, he changes his mind and decides to change his identity with the dead man who has a US passport which means that Buka could realize his ambition to return to the United States. The stolen identity plot thickens when the man's girlfriend (Lederer's wife) arrives at the hotel to accuse Buka of pretending to be the deceased. <br /> <br /> This is the kind of plot that spectators have probably seen countless times, but it's good to practice here, with many tense scenes while Lederer and Buka's wife plan to flee from the authorities until the final confrontation with the murderer and the police. <br /> <br /> It is extremely absorbing, bravo and keeps the interest throughout some excellent atmospheric photographs of Vienna which will remind to most of the film-lovers the "Third man". <br /> <br /> It is worth watching.
