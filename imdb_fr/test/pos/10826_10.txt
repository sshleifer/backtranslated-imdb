When I went to see Bon voyage, I was expecting a good multidisciplinary drama on the orders of the Grand Hotel (1932) and the Children of Paradise (1944). It was better than that. With few exceptions, none of the characters were totally good or totally bad - as in real life. The acting was wonderful, especially those who played Frederic, Raoul and Camille. The photography was incredible because it recreated the period perfectly and managed to be shot in Bordeaux / around Bordeaux at the time of new public works while managing the "look" of June 1940. The costumes and make-up were precise. There are so many things in this film that it's worth watching a second time. It's exciting, fun and ultimately touching. N.B .-- Make sure to see him in a theater with a good quality projection. It's in widescreen, and in the theater where I saw it (the Clairmont in Montclair), subtitles in the background were in the foreground, but the faces of the actors were slightly fuzzy! This was finally corrected, but detracted from the pleasure of the film.
