One of the best known obscure horror movies of the seventies. It's crispy, exciting, scary, surreal here and there, and at times very smart, which can not be said of many movies like this. I can not help but see some stinging symbolic and metaphorical points about the society and the generation of the 70s, at the time of the filming of this film. The screenwriter has obviously cooked while also offering good scenes like "crypt". With a job well done by a creative director, the result is entertaining and provocative. The simple but effective end shows especially how these things are handled correctly by those who can. <br /> <br /> The excellent distribution is unknown to most, with the exception of LQ Jones as a humorous but funny sheriff and Strother Martin as a city doctor. Unsurprisingly, Martin always ends up stealing the film. With that voice and skill, he's one of the best movie loonies, for me anyway. What actor! <br /> <br /> It's a mystery to me why this movie has not gained greater recognition. I think it deserves an almost equal place in the occult horror canon alongside Rosemary's Baby and The Exorcist. A movie of hell!
