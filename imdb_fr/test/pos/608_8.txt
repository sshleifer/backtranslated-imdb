Naruse is generally considered one of the three main founders of the Japanese film, the other two being Ozu and Mizoguchi. It's an interesting and honest movie about the life of retired geisha. Whatever happens, when such a woman ages and loses her charm and mystique? Well, for those who are interested, watch this movie. One: Okin succeeds as a money lender, but the other two must borrow from her and are full of resentment. Okin does not have children, but the others have them. Okin discovers that his old love comes to visit him and is enthusiastic. Naruse is a master in the subtle studies of the characters of his female protagonists. Bangiku ultimately drives the viewer into the study of the questions of his happiness and his value for life. Very good movie indeed.
