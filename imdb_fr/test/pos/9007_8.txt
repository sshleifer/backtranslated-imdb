New voices scare me! Kuzco does not have to go through a frickkin academy to become emperor again! It's the same thing again and again, is not it? It's a children's show, right? Yzma turns Kuzco into something stupid, like an animal. He is learning a lesson. EVERYTHING IS THE SAME!!!!! David Spade and John Goodman never came back ... * sniffles *! Nothing changes because Disney will not do anything. It's probably one of the most delayed shows of all time! The first movie was so much better! Malina is probably the only person I like. Kuzco is such a crybaby! Kronk is delayed! And Yzma's retarded-ER (if that's even a word)! What I meant was ... How could you, Disney ... why?
