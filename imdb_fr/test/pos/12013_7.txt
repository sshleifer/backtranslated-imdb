A real surprise. It's not really a "Disney" family entertainment. A little violence, many moments of tension and a beautiful story, based on facts. The theme of "Night Crossing" is, determination wins. Never losing sight of their goal, two East German families risk everything in their bold flight to freedom. The story is both poignant and comforting. Time is not on their side. The East German police are getting closer and the outcome is far from certain, until the end. If you are looking for a good evening entertainment without any nudity and with limited violence, I highly recommend "Night Crossing". It's pure entertainment. - MERK
