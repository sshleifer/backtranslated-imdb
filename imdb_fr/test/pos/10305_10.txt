A very moving and stimulating film that raises issues of mental health, terminal illness and euthanasia. Sounds a little too heavy? It's a bit, but all of that is realistically covered in a narrative of the changes that are happening in the family that has to deal with these things. This is a positive story of confrontation with life and responsibility that is not overwhelmed by the subject. <br /> <br /> Afterlife is a beautifully shot film, designed in modern times and dealing with modern issues. It's an exciting, character-driven movie, with a solid cast and very good performances. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this is not the kind of film that always behaves well at the box office, so hang in there as much as you can.
