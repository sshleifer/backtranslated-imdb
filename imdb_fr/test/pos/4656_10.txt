What can I say about this movie that has not been said hundreds of times before? It's an American classic. He generated dozens of imitators. Or none. Midnight Madness is one of a kind. Ridiculous editing / opening music at the Bonaventure Hotel, I became addicted. Leon made us all feel so young and carefree. One question though, how did he get these two hot prostitutes with him all the time? And how did you get the time and money to organize such an event? The cast is top. David Naughton is at his best here. His tight yellow sweatshirt is disturbing. His little brother, Michael J Fox (in his first role), is a real kid. There is also the love and love of Naughton, a dork and the obligatory black guy in the yellow team fisherman hat. Michael J Fox does bad things, like trying to steal cups of beer from the Pabst Blue Ribbon Brewery and running away from Flounder's van. The Flounder team offers us the most comedy. What's the problem with the blond of this team? Does she go out with Flounder? Or Melio? Or blade? Yes, the name of the Mexican gentleman is blade. The other member of the Flounder team has the best lines of the movie, I will not pump them here. The Meat Machine team is made up of drunkards. My favorite is Armpit. But the silent black man is awesome too. The other two teams are 4 nerds and 4 lesbians (including two 450-lb twins). <br /> <br /> You know the end from the beginning. But it does not matter. This is the me-genre of the 80's at its best. Do not rent this one, buy it. and buy it now.
