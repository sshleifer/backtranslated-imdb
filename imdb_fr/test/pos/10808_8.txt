If it is true that Gérard Depardieu, an actor with a physically fleshy and imposing physique, was born as a Frenchman, it is indeed Cyrano de Bergerac and the orator Georges Danton. Here, he dominates the film as much by the width of his shoulders as by the power of his voice. his charisma carries the game despite the fact that it is clear that the character has as much blood on his hands as any of the others. Danton enjoys while Parisians starve ... but it is the man who can challenge the tyranny imposed by the dreaded Public Security Committee in the name of "freedom" and is presented as the hero of the film - Despite the fact that the source game almost idolizes his opponent Robespierre! <br /> <br /> For those who know the characters of the story, there is an interest in identifying the minor pieces: the Tallien with the frog's head, Couthon the The public prosecutor, Fouquier-Tinville, crippled, the dashing fop St-Just, the epic painter David. But the script does not leave much room for this; names are often slow to come if minor characters are identified, and there is no cliché info to Hollywood to ensure that the public can place the events in their historical context. The film assumes that you know what happened before and what will happen next. Sometimes, it takes too much for granted, because it relies on a thorough knowledge of dates to give full measure to the fact that Robespierre briefly followed Danton to the scaffold. <br /> <br /> Regarded as a film, it is not entirely satisfactory as it fades towards the end. The structure of the story leads to a great confrontation between the protagonists in the courtroom or at a dramatic climax of the lawsuit that, thanks to the story, never really happens. Things are badly summarized: there is no revolt, there is no overthrow of tyranny, there is no takeover of the victor, there is no triumph from and other. This may be historically accurate, but it's not quite satisfying as a result of a screenplay - it seems like a strange place to stop. As others have pointed out, it might have been more logical to postpone the events until the end of the Terror and to show in apposition the fall of Robespierre.
