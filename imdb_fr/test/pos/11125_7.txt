This film was well done, but it also made me feel very depressed sometimes. For all those who are considering show business, this is a must because it shows the essence of what is happening for these workers in difficulty. The soundtrack was really cool and the acting and dancing complimented. Some of the student's attitudes may have been a little far-fetched like those of Leroy, especially because I'm sure someone like that would have been immediately fired for refusing to read and so on. it was the real High School For Performing Arts. The Coco test is difficult to monitor for people with weak stomachs. Please consider my warning. Although it's very difficult, I know it's the truth about what's going on, in this respect the movie is just right. All in all, it's fun and even if some parties hang around, most go very fast. <br /> <br /> Final grouping: <br /> <br /> Films: would probably have jumped this one. <br /> <br /> DVD Purchase: This is not something I would need to see again and again. <br /> <br /> Location: The rental is worth renting at least once in your life!
