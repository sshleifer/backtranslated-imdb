This film is engaging, from beginning to end, with excellent performances, an excellent soundtrack with the original music of Douglas Brown, and a well-paced scenario, full of surprises. <br /> <br /> Many new faces not so new, this film presents promising talents, especially in the case of Craig Morris, who plays the main character Eddie Monroe. Morris, who also co-wrote the screenplay, displays quiet strength combined with strong emotional performance as he creates a credible character on the screen. A poignant presentation by Paul Vario, who plays Uncle Benny with sincere warmth, was so convincing that he made me hungry by lovingly preparing his Italian sauce. <br /> <br /> good new story - what more? This movie is highly recommended!
