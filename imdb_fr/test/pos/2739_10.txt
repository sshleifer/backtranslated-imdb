MCBOING BOING is one of the caricatures that has been engraved on my mind over the years and has finally decided to examine the issue satisfactorily, both pleasantly surprised and surprised by the people involved in the production. If I remember correctly, we had to watch it on a UHF station, which meant using a converter at the time. UHF was not part of the regular television to tune into the local station to watch the cartoon at the time, which made the show even more mysterious. I remember all the sound effects that Gerald was talking about. A very good memory of more than 50 years ago. I will have to see what other memories might be hiding on the web. By the way, I'm trying to do computer animation, that's where johnl3d comes in.
