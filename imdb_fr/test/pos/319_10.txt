My favorite movie of all time. Coppola was an imperfect work and seeing the documentary "Heart of Darkness" made it even more convincing. Coppola was at that time King of Hollywood after doing "The Godfather" and "The Godfather II" and had developed the necessary ego to even dare to try to make a movie like "Apocalypse Now". Out of sheer arrogance, he went to the Philippines with a partial scenario and thought he would know what he would do once there. Just as Captain Willard thought he would know what to do when he arrived in Colonel Kurtz's compound. And just like Willard, he did not know what he would do once there. It is such a masterpiece of American cinema, beautifully photographed and the river is a perfect metaphor and background for history. What I like most about 'Apocalypse Now' is that it offers no answer or conclusion. Therefore, because of this openness, it outrages some viewers who like their movies to be much more obvious. <br /> <br /> This film defies categorization. Some call it a war movie, but it's not at all a personal study of man. The best picture of Vietnam is "Platoon" in my opinion and if a viewer wants to relive the Vietnam War, go first to get answers. <br /> <br /> Coppola must be congratulated for his interpretation of the war bureaucracy, which he testified fairly effectively at the meeting with General Corman and Lucas (Harrison Ford) and Playmate magazine. The sheer audacity of Kilgore makes him an unforgettable character and the dawn attack will always be a Hollywood classic. <br /> <br /> This is an almost psychedelic cruise with a very surreal end that makes it a film inaccessible to everyone. Very difficult to watch but rewarding too. I could offer my explanations on each scene, but it would be totally useless. This film is intended for interpretation and contemplation, as opposed to immediate gratification. <br /> <br /> A little footnote, if you look for the first time Apocalypse Now, look at the original version first, the 'Redux' version is, I think, more aimed at the hardcore fan and is more a curiosity than a "new and improved" version of the film
