Chop Shop. Written and directed by Ramin Bahrani (Man Push Cart). Bahrani specializes in character-oriented studies in naturalist-style films about the kind of little people who meet each other every day, without anyone realizing their presence in New York. <br /> <br /> These are people who have been pushed out of society. They exist in a sort of gray world, many of whom are migrants whose legal status in America seems somewhat doubtful. Where do they come from ? How did they get there? How are they coping? Where will they end? These are not good stories as such, but stories about survival at the lowest level, day-to-day. <br /> <br /> Ale is one of those street kids. Anyway, he has no education and tries to save money, he is not far from tackling the small flight. Above all, he is eager to find his older sister. We see it in the first scenes echoing in a shelter looking for her, but without much success. A young friend, Carlos finds him a job in a cutting workshop, in the shadow of the ballpark Shea. His older sister eventually comes to live with him, but he is jealous of the motives of his friends and is wary of how she earns money. He dreams of buying a food van and creating a sales business with his older sister. <br /> <br /> Bahrani turns all his films on the spot. There is nothing glossy or icy about them. It is life such that these people must live in a raw state. It is not beautiful, although it is never threatening, and the air a little desperate that hangs over a large part of the film is the same that hangs over the daily life of these peoples. <br /> <br /> The scenario is also very natural and the characters have a lot of room for maneuver and space to work. Polanco is outstanding in the lead role and Gonzalez provides strong support as an older sister.
