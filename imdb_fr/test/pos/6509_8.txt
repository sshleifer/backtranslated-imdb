-It's pretty much the whole soundtrack of this movie. I just saw this baby at the Munich Film Festival and it rocked the house. Director Doug Pray was never seen in this documentary, I even think he was not even heard, but he took a very intimate look at the life and story of the "mixer". He has segmented his film into about eight chapters, then his group of enthusiastic and disparate interviews will be spiced up according to what they are talking about. I have never had a lot of interest in "scratching", but the film does a remarkable job of keeping a basic level for those who know little and infusing jokes for those who are experts in the field. Mix Master Mike of the Beastie Boys is in this movie, but it's only after the film that I was able to name several big hitters in the industry (DJ Shadow, Q-Bert, etc.). The extreme fascination exercised by these talented and original DJs on the decks turns out well in their explanations of what their music means to them. The film also throws a rewarding light on these guys (and a woman) who must be classified as musicians. Pray do not let her film idle and if there is a slow scene, she is soon reactivated by music almost never stopped. If nothing else, this movie will increase your slang vocabulary. I have to go back to "digging", so I will put an end to this criticism. See, it'll be interesting. Good thing, man. Good product.
