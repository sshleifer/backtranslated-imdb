"Gypsy" is perhaps the greatest musical comedy ever written, so it's a pity that its movie version was such a disappointment. To make up for that, we have this redesign that, if not flawless, is a nice and well done adaptation of the musical. The script is quite accurate, all the songs included, and the staging remains close to Jerome Robbins' original staging. Bette Midler is a wise choice for Rose, her singing and Merman-esquire personality, and her splendid acting. Peter Reigert is a good Herby, if not a great singer, and Cynthia Gibb is a simple and natural, Louise. In truth, the recording on Tyne Daly of the 1989 revival might be a better idea, if only because "Gypsy" is simply more exciting on stage, but this film is a beautiful translation of a great musical.
