Years ago, I read the book 'A Máquina' (The Machine). Re-reading this little book again and again, I could not help but become more and more fascinated by the writer's imagination and the richness of Brazilian culture. <br /> <br /> When I first heard about the movie, I was really scared that someone was spoiling one of my favorite books! Fortunately, my fears were unjustified and the film is such a wonderful and delicate work of art. <br /> <br /> I do not remember any other film that makes me cry because of the beauty of the text itself. Moreover, I do not remember a performance as powerful as that of Gustavo Falcão. <br /> <br /> You can see and feel how much her love for Karina is colossal. You can realize that he will move mountains and do everything for this love. <br /> <br /> Go see this film, look at it through the eyes of the kid who lives in you, enchant you!
