The horror genius Dario Argento is one of my favorite directors, and his films "Suspiria", "Phenomena" and "Profondo Rosso" feature prominently on my favorites list. "Opera" from 1987 is yet another seductive and brilliant film that no Horror lover can afford to miss and that will keep you on the edge of your chair from start to finish. This superb and extremely violent Giallo could very well be described as the most nasty movie of the master, which is quite surprising given that Argento's films are not known for the leniency of their violence. The violence is extreme and highly stylized in a brilliant way that makes Opera the nightmare of censorship of a film. <br /> <br /> - Attention! SPOILERS in front of you! - <br /> <br /> Just as Betty (Christina Marsillach), a young opera singer, is a great success, a murderous and incredibly sadistic psychopath begins to harass her ... The murders are really brutal and of a particularly sadistic nature. The killer attaches needles to Betty's attached eyelids. She must therefore keep them open and watch them while brutally murdering people close to her in an abominable way. Once the massacre is over, the killer releases Betty and leaves, just to come back for his friends ... <br /> <br /> As usual in the Argento films, the violence is extremely graphic and very stylized. "Opera" is really a brutal film, and what a stylish and atmospheric film. This film is absolutely tempting and suspended from beginning to end. The performances are quite good, especially as Christina Marsillach is brilliant in the lead. Beautiful beauty and great actress, Marsillach fits perfectly into her role as a talented singer, whose fear and horrific experiences make her little by little crazy. Other notable performances include Ian Charleston as a horror film director who directs an opera, and Argento director Daria Nicolodi's girlfriend, who plays a role in several of his films. The work of the camera is excellent, as in all Argento films, and the huge opera is an exceptional setting that contributes a lot to the beauty of the film and its always scary atmosphere. The score, composed of both classical music and heavy metal, is also excellent, although I missed the brilliant Goblin progressive rock music, which is a distinctive feature of most other Argento films. . "Opera" is truly a terrifying Giallo experience and absolutely breathtaking. This is a must for all lovers of Horror, and I highly recommend it to all moviegoers who are not too sensitive to extreme violence. Excellent and absolutely enticing!
