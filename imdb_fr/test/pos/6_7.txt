I had the chance to see this film in preview last night and, even if I did not expect it, he really enjoyed the film. The rescues and the effects on the sea have been fantastic to look at and have certainly helped to relieve the tense moments of the seats, probably all the more so because they know there are guys doing this in life. The weaker parts of the film revolve around the use of stereotypical scenes. I'm not going to ruin the movie, but it really looks like an officer and a gentleman and those moments give it a cheese aftertaste. <br /> <br /> As I said throughout this movie is pretty good and worth checking out as long as you can go beyond the clich√©s.
