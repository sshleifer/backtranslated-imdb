"Mr. Bug Goes To Town" was the last major achievement of Fleischer Studios. The quality of the Superman series produced at the same time is evident in this extraordinary film. <br /> <br /> The music and lyrics of Frank Loesser and Hoagy Carmichael (assisted by Flieshcer veteran, Sammy Timberg, are pretty good, but as much as the score of Leigh Harline's image which also scored Snow White for Disney, Harline's "atmospheric music" is superb and a feast for the ears. <br /> <br /> The layout and staging of the image was for years to come, and one Once again, Fleischer's in-depth artists have outdone themselves: the technical beauty of the film is undeniable, and if Hoppity, the grasshopper is the star, the characters of Swat the Fly and Smack the Mosquito steal the image. Mercer (Popeye) is priceless, Kenny Gardner (brother-in-law) of Guy Lombardo ... and a leading singer in his band ... doing his job as well as Dick Dickinsen. The film was criticized for all the bad reas. s animation experts par excellence and this is very clearly seen in the finished product. The film is melodic, the story is great for all ages and the final scenes of the bugs that fight for their lives on a rising skyscraper are among the best staging and animations of all past animated movies and present. <br /> <br /> Do not miss this wonderfully hand-drawn film. Also, be sure to enjoy the title sequence with the most elaborate example of Max Fleischer's remarkable 3D stereoscopic process, which took four months to build and use 16,000 tiny windows in Manhattan's "electrified" buildings. <br /> <br /> Do not miss Mr. Bug Goes To Town ... aka Hoppity Goes To Town. I bet you'll have your eyes on the results!
