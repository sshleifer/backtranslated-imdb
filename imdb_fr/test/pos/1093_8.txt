This is by far the most definitive movie about the police I've seen. Although not directed by Ram Gopal Varma, it contains all the elements of a RGV movie. Dead end dialogues, a direct treatment of the subject, brilliant direction and superb performances (even those who have little work to do in the film). The chemistry between Nana and the Don, even if they are professional rivals, is incredible. The same goes for small events such as an insider who does not give information to Imtiaz even when he gets beaten in the locker, but only to Nana when he is absent. The change of working conditions with the change of the elder is treated wonderfully. The first part is completely captivating, like a documentary where Nana plays the role of Jatin's mentor and explains the subtleties and philosophy of work. <br /> <br /> One of the most brilliant movies about cops in India cinema. Do not miss.
