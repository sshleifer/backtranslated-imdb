"Sir" has played Lear more than 200 times, but tonight he does not remember his first lines. Sitting in front of the mirror, his eyes reflect the madness of the king. His dresser guides him gently, hearing the words. There is an air of despair in these two men. The great actor knowing that his powers are losing power, his valet cum major domo cum conscience woman surrogate, aware of the fall of his boss in the madness and knowing that he is powerless to do more than facilitate his death. "The Dresser" is really a love story between the two. Over the years, they have become mutually dependent on each other, so much so that neither can conceive of a future without the other. Set during the Second World War, it concerns the fortunes of a second - rate Shakespearean touring company composed of an equal number of Asians and aspirants led by "Sir", a theatrical knight who could call "the old school". Whatever role he plays, he gets to the center of the stage and blows on the ramp, intimidating his audience with applause. But somewhere in him, buried most of the time at the bottom of the ham he passes. regularly, there are still some occasional gleams. It is to glimpse that that its public hopes ardently. MAFinney focuses very cleverly on ham, often to the point of caricature, and by the time you're ready to dismiss his performance as a mere hyperbole and braggart, he'll produce a moment of exquisite subtlety and vulnerability that will make you take aware that a great actor plays a great actor. The same is true of Mr. T. Courtenay. It's easy to write his portrait of Norman as an exercise in stereotyping. Here, we have an effeminate middle-aged garment rather than a theatrical camper who goes through life, enjoying the company of "The Girls" and loving the bad guys. Insider buffs in "The Theater". There was - and I strongly suspect it still exists - many men like Norman in The Profession.Infinitely kind and patient, find out more about the they play behind the scenes with wisdom and affection. I think the vast majority of them would laugh approvingly at Mr. Courtenay's portrait. I saw "The Dresser" on the London stage where, against the alleged wisdom, Mr. Courtenay's "Norman" was a little more moderate than in the film. "Sir" was played by the great Mr. Freddie Jones, acclaimed by the audience. It was a memorable performance that eclipsed that of Mr. Courtenay, reducing it to an "as-run" as opposed to a level actor - billing. The idea that "Sir" and "Norman" could be almost incomplete without the window. "Norman" was reduced to being his puppet, which I did not know exactly what Ronald Harwood wanted, but for a breathtaking theater. Finney and Courtenay correct the balance in the film, restoring equality in the relationship. The two men have come a long way since their first appearances in the British "New Wave" images when they became the darlings of the vaguely leftist, "bourgeois and shameful" movement. When the British cinema practically engaged Hari - kiri in the 1970s, they quietly focused on the theater, apart from a few roles to prevent the wolf from returning. With the rebirth of more substantial films, they reappeared, flashing in the unusual light. <br /> ". <br />" The Dresser "marked his return, still sparkling with energy and talent, shouting to the whole world" We're still here. "It's not a big movie but it's is definitely an excellent movie.
