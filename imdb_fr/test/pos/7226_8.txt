Who else but Troma can take classic tragedy and change it to the current standards ???? Nobody ... in my opinion, that of Leonardo DiCaprio was bad. Tromeon & Juliet is an extension of Shakesperan's tragedy, but it holds up well. It's sick, insane, crooked, but incredibly funny and fulfilling. For the most part, it follows the true story of Romeo and Juliet, but many Troma elements are added. Will Keenan gives an excellent performance as Tromeo. The acting is solid and the story is great. Many people look beyond these films, not just those of Kaufman Troma, but of all those they distribute. Of course, Troma movies are an acquired taste, but you have to see some of them. It's the best renegade filmmakers.
