Written by Gerry and Sylvia Anderson, veterans of science fiction. This spatial fantasy is judiciously directed by Robert Parrish. Colonel Glenn Ross (Roy Thinnes), an experienced American astronaut, accepts a flight in the sun. The mission will be led by Jason Webb (Patrick Wymark) and his scientist, John Kane (Ian Hendry), of the European Space Agency Euro Sec, will accompany Ross. Both will explore a newly discovered planet that is in the same orbit as the Earth ... except that it is still hidden on the other side of the sun. Ross is the only one to come back to earth and has a very incredible story to tell. Special effects can be better than the story. Nevertheless fun to watch. The cast also includes Lynn Loring, Loni von Friedl, George Sewell and Herbert Lom.
