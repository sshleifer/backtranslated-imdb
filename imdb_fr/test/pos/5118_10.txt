If I had to choose Ernest's best film and not act as if that kind of thing did not happen all the time, it would be this one. <br /> <br /> All of Ernest's films are entertaining. but the best are the ones who have Jim Varney doing a number of different characters. In addition, I am known to appreciate the comic styles of Bill Byrge and Gailard Sartain as brothers Chuck and Bobby Tulip. "Ernest goes to prison" contains all these elements, as well as a fun scenario and a cast accompanied by several actors of beloved characters. <br /> <br /> That's why I chose "Ernest goes to prison" as the king of all Ernest's films. Disagree with me if you must, but deep down, you know I'm right.
