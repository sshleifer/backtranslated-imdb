Stan as a bullfighter, and a good one, is a surprise. This silent short film allows him to take the lead. <br /> <br /> We can only conclude that his character "Rhubarb Vaselino" was a parody of the many films of Rudolph Valentino. of this time. <br /> <br /> Get ready to make fun of some dialogue and keep an eye on the special effects. <br /> <br /> I saw it on DVD in a flight. 1 & 2 collection.
