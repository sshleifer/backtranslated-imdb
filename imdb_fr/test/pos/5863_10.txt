This film is perhaps one of the most creative horror works of all time. It contains everything you can wish for ... suspense, drama, comedy, puzzling secondary intrigue, Native American, brain-eater ... If you're looking for the best brain movies, look no further. The story of a man determined to take revenge. And how better to get it? "I know, I'll suck their brains!" With great sound effects and impressive special effects, I can not recommend this film too much.
