It is in this movie that the Batman franchise should have stopped. Although I concede that the ideas behind "Batman Forever" were excellent and could have been easily implemented by a competent director, as it turned out that was not the case. <br /> <br /> Apparently Warner Brothers executives were disappointed with the darkness of Tim Burton's second Batman movie. Apart from the idiocy of waiting for anything from Burton and the conservative cowardice of their subsequent decision to turn the franchise into a tribute to the Sixties television series, I do not understand how "Batman Returns" can be considered as disappointing. <BR/> <br /> Of course, it's not quite equal to the first movie - although it repairs all the minor style gaps found in "Batman", a weaker scenario that divides the movie. antagonism between not two but three characters invites not flatter comparisons with the masterful combination of Keaton and Jack Nicholson as a Joker in the first film. However, despite everything, it remains a sumptuously dark film, faithful to the way the Batman was always supposed to be, and which is very satisfying. <br /> <br /> Michael Keaton is back in the role of Batman and his alter ego, Bruce Wayne, getting confused with the new rich Max Schreck (Christopher Walken, named in honor of the silent actor 1920s German), his criminal accomplice Oswald Cobblepot, the Penguin (Danny DeVito in a shiny makeup reminiscent of "Richard III" by Laurence Olivier), and Selina Kyle, the Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer), whom Wayne describes at the same time like himself and like Batman. All four directors perform well, particularly Walken and DeVito, while Keaton and Pfeiffer explore the darker side of dual identities. <br /> <br /> This film contains fascinating concepts. The only weakness I can really point out is some flexibility in the scenario in some places, which I think is mainly due to the way this film is a four-corner fight. There is simply not enough time to properly explore what is happening. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, it's a pretty good movie. I highly recommend looking at this in conjunction with the first, then crying about the quality of the show if it continued under Burton and Keaton.
