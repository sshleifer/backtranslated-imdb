It is a very good film, to have absolutely. I really liked every aspect, from sword fighting to romanticism to costumes, they were really well done and put in place. The landscape is absolutely beautiful. I also loved the mystery and the magic. The message of the power of love, love is the greatest power that exists. I really love the king's heart in the sense that he wants peace instead of bloodshed and hatred. I wish I could live in a world like this with flying ships, castles in the sky. I also think it was really nice to see how they brought the animals into the movie. I also thought that the cook was really funny. I watched it a few times in a day and I still do not get tired of it. We hope they report it on a DVD.
