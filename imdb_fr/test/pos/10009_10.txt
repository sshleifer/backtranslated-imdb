I love this movie from beginning to end. I'm a musician and I let the drugs bother me in what I used to love (skateboard, drawing) but my friends were always there for me. The music was like a detox. , life support, and my drug.He changed my life.I can totally relate to this movie and I would like there was more that I could say.This film left me speechless to be honest.I just have it seen on the Ifc channel. I usually hate having a satellite, but it's a plus to own a satellite. The ifc channel shows very good movies and without that, I would never have found this movie. I'm not a big fan of international movies because I think a lot of I mean that the obvious language barrier lets you think that's what they say, but it's not that bad, I suppose . I almost never had the chance to see this AMAZING movie. stayed in place instead of going to bed..well sooner than usual.lol.I hope you enjoy the hell of this movie e and I love this movie just as much as I did I'd like to be able to type this all in capital letters but that's the rule again, I guess it's screaming but that would really show my enthusiasm for the movie. I give it three thumbs up! <br /> This movie blew me!
