I still love watching this caricature, Sylvester trying to catch Tweety in a train rather than at his grandmother's. It's actually a standard fare, but fun, especially when Tweety pulls the emergency stop cord. One of my complaints about this is how much the animators were neglected with the train. When you look at it over and over again, like my little boy (who loves trains, which is why he loves him so much), you start to notice things. <br /> <br /> Throughout this short film, the position of the baggage car changes in the train, be it in 3rd, 4th or 5th and not at all in long shot. The engine has the number 651 or 814, or none. The supply of coal is either No. 99 or the letters "S.P. & Q.R." above, or no figures or letters at all. Coaches wear the "S.P.Q.R." without the "&" in the long shots, then in the close-ups, the words "SouthEast and Western." in very carefully. <br /> <br /> This caricature is still part of my favorites with Sylvester and Tweety.
