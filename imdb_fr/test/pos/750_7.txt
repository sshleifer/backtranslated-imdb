Personally, I have a weakness for horror films that take place in hospitals and asylums, so I had a good feeling to watch this movie "Do not look in the basement", even if its reputation is doubtful. Well, I was right! It's an excellent trashy entertainment with some effective shocks and deliciously absurd characters. You must of course look beyond the values ​​of mediocre productions and the conspiracy completely illogical, but if you succeed to do it (and if you are a fan of this type of horror, it is an essential quality), you will be rewarded by a scandalous "video-villain" in which blood and madness are the main elements. The pretty and pretty nurse Charlotte arrives in a remote sanatorium where she is supposed to start her new job. She discovers that the doctor who hired her has been murdered by a patient and that the Acting Surgeon General, Masters, seems reluctant to accept this new arrival. The life inside the sanatorium is quite special, patients move freely and all doors are locked. After a series of bizarre events, Charlotte discovers the terrible secrets that the institution hides ... The first 10 minutes (pre-credits) are excellent, as well as the climax completely disturbed. Everything in between is pretty much no surprise or tension, but you wait patiently because you feel that the finale will be a crazy pleasure. The patients in the asylum are insane, but I love them anyway. Some of my favorites include the former judge (who still speaks exclusively in legal terms), the suspicious Sargeant army, and the delirious old lady. "Do not look in the basement" is a fun game, especially recommended for lovers of 70s trash movies, sick puppies and other types of scum. The fools have taken refuge, yes!
