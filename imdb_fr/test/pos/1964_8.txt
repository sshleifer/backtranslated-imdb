This film is one of the best of 1986 with the frightening but intriguing performances of Crispin Glover and Dennis Hopper! The Reagan years were pretty dark for a lot of people, not just for teens, but this movie really captured despair and despair. Well run with a good script (apparently based on a true story), I do not really see any weakness in that. The kickoff was brilliant. <br /> <br /> Keanu Reeves was decent, but Miss Skye was right. Hopper had three other great performances the same year (Blue Velvet, Texas Chainsaw II and Hoosiers). I imagine that it has a cult and I wonder how this picture would be worn if it was reissued. Great thing!
