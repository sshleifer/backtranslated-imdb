The incomparable Laura Gemser appeared briefly in an erotic scene of the French "Emmanuelle 2". This amazing woman did not go unnoticed and was quickly chosen to play the lead role in this brand new Italian series, where she is the centerpiece. a beautiful photojournalist who travels the world experiencing all the mysterious eroticism that the world has to offer. In this first installment, Mae Jordan / Emanuelle is sent to Africa to photograph the inhabitants, as well as beautiful landscapes and wild exotic animals. Like the character of Sylvia Kristels, Emanuelle has not yet been able to stand out when it comes to being open and comfortable with her own sexuality. This first film tells roughly how it becomes the Emanuelle that most movie fans know. Filled with a superb photograph, beautiful people and an intoxicating score of the 70s legendary Nico Fidenco, it will not fail to please. Those who like the more narrative style of the French original "Emmanuelle" should also like that. The main story here is an interesting cat and mouse story about a womanizing playboy who just realized that he fell in love with a woman who is the female version! Sexy, fun and totally entertaining; a soap opera, but with enough skin and candy for the eyes to entertain the audience. For some reason, this is the hardest part of the series to find on DVD. there has never been a legitimate DVD for this, which is very strange. The bootlegs that sometimes appear online will have to do it until someone distributes that diamond from a movie.
