I have always loved listening to Buddy Holly and I felt really lost when he was killed very young in a plane crash. He was not in the old rock-roll class of Chuck Berry or Jerry Lee Lewis, for example, but he was not far behind. Who knows how great his legacy would have been if he had sung for decades. Almost every single he released was a success. <br /> <br /> That's why I was very pleasantly surprised by the quality of the work that Gary Busey has done to play it and to imitate his singing voice. He is proud of Buddy, as are the actors (Don Stroud and Charles Martin Smith) who performed Holly's backup group, "The Crickets". <br /> <br /> Musically, there are some of Holly's best known songs in the beginning of the film and her very good ending with a solid finish in the end since Holly and the boys are shown in Iowa during their last concert. Busey does not just sing like Holly, he's a look-alike for him in the looks department. Something was the best performance of the actor of all time, and you do not argue. <br /> <br /> I'm also happy that they finished the film on an upbeat note with this Iowa concert, instead of lingering over his tragic accident. The end could have been a real bad thing, but they did not let it.
