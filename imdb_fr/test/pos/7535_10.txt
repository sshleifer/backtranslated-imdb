I think this film is underestimated. For me, it was like a breath of fresh air. Some people complain about the inviolability of the plot, the excessive number of sequences and the lack of sexuality (the latter being, in my opinion, the main reason for "inviolability", but it is simply not their thing, and good for them if they can not relate to the story.The performances are superb.I would really like to see more actors in other films.The emotions are authentic.The whole of the Unrequited love is presented with subtle subtlety, and it gives you the tingle you expect from a good movie.
