Overall, I enjoyed the Scarlett movie. I am a big fan of Gone with the Wind. I read the book and saw the classic movie several times. I even have a small collection of Scarlett O'Hara ornaments and other things. I must admit that Gone with the Wind is my favorite book and movie of all time. Vivian Leigh and Clark Gable are outstanding actors and two of my favorites. Unfortunately, I could not read the book Scarlett, but I was impatient to see the film. In fact, the film is not up to the caliber of Gone with the Wind and the actors either. However, Joan Whalley Kilmer and Timothy Dalton were pleasant actors in the roles and Joan often resembled Vivian Leigh in her performance of Scarlett. Dalton also described Rhett well sometimes. It took a while to get used to the different actors, but overall, I really enjoyed the fact that I'm the fan of Gone with the Wind. One of the big disappointments was that Joan did not have green eyes, unlike Scarlett O'Hara and Vivian Leigh. I also found Lord Fenton absolutely horrendous and I did not like his character. If you are a fan of Gone with the Wind and / or like romantic stories, see the movie Scarlett. However, do not expect it to be remarkable, like Going with the wind It's not the same if it's interesting with the new characters and so on. I'm glad it was not a remake and some of the events in this story were what I imagined to be the continuation of the love story of Scarlett O'Hara and Rhett Butler. If you have not seen it today, get it the next day, the day after tomorrow, tomorrow is another day. :)
