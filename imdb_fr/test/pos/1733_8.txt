As a child, I have never been in a situation where I could be introduced to Dr. Who and, even though I had heard about the series by the way, I had never really realized exactly what it was. 'was. So it was with some hesitation that I sat down to watch the ninth Doctor and his antics telling him that he looked like Arthur Dent (from the Galaxy Hitchhiker's Guide) but colder. I can not believe what I missed, seriously, why did not anyone tell me about it before? My entire childhood has been deprived of the adventures of Doctor Who; I am a big fan of most fantastic adventures and science fiction. Honestly, I feasted and I look forward to the next episodes. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that at first I did not know if Billie Piper would be the best actress, but I'm happy to say that She was very successful, I thought, and added a very realistic touch to the series. In fact, I think it was one of my favorite aspects of the series; the contrast between the scenes of great alien conflicts contrasts with the exasperating normality of life in the South London Council Estate. I am always interested in cases where people's ideas about the world are radically challenged and how people can take any situation and modify it in their minds in order to adapt it to their mundane life. I also liked Christopher Eccleston. I did not see many of his films and I never saw another actor like Dr. Who, but I thought his performance of the Doctor was brilliant, immensely friendly and yet dark enough to amaze you. I find that many other characters with their kind of character story tend to be a bit two-dimensional; they have all the good emotions and actions, but they always seem slightly superficial. This doctor, on the contrary, has gained my loyalty with his stratified personality. I agree with some of the other comments that a higher budget for special effects, extraterrestrial and other, could have been a little more effective. but again, it's not about special effects (although they help) from what I've read and heard from Dr. Who's longtime fans; it's the spirit of everything that really matters. And I do not think they did a bad job with what they had. I liked all the extraterrestrials but my favorite was the Daleks; if I ever knew anything about Dr. Who before watching the series, it was because there were objects that looked like spilled garbage bins. Before I looked, I was skeptical about these peppers threatening the existence of humanity, but some of them were pretty scary! What I liked of course. <br /> <br /> Overall, a good show. I look forward to the next episodes. The doctor has a new fan.
