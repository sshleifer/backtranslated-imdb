In the 1970s in Afghanistan, Amir (Zekeria Ebrahimi), a Pashtun boy, and Hassan (Ahmad Khan Mahmoodzada), of Hazara, are his faithful friend and the son of their servant Ali (Nabi Tanha), a Hazar father, to play and playing in the streets of a peaceful Kabul. Amir thinks that his wise and good father Baba (Homayoun Ershadi) blames him for the death of his mother during childbirth and that his father loves and prefers Hassam to him. In return, Amir has great respect for his father's best friend, Rahim Khan (Shaun Toub), who supports his intention to become a writer. After Amir won a kitting contest, Hassam ran for a kite to Amir, but he was beaten and raped by the brutal Assef (Elham Ehsas) in a deserted street to protect Amir's kite. the coward Amir witnesses the assault but does not help the loyal Hassam. The day after his birthday party, Amir hides his new watch in Hassam's bed to incarnate the boy as a thief and force his father to fire Ali, freeing his conscience from his reminder of cowardice and treason. In 1979, the Russians invaded Afghanistan and Baba and Amir escaped to Pakistan. In 1988, they had a simple life in Fremont, California, when Amir graduated from public college for Baba's pride and joy. Later, Amir meets his peasant Soraya (Atossa Leoni) and they get married. In 2000, after Baba's death, Amir is a famous novelist. He receives a call from the terminal, Rahim Khan, who reveals secrets about his family, forcing Amir to return to Peshawar, Pakistan, on a journey of redemption. <Br /> <br /> I do not know Afghan culture well and I did not read this novel, despite my daughter's recommendations, and I decided yesterday to watch this movie on DVD. I found a good story of loyalty, cowardice, betrayal and redemption, with a brief overview of Afghanistan's recent history of a period of peace from the 1970s to the present day with the Taliban. Actors and actresses have great performances, giving credibility to the realistic story. The drylands in China are reminiscent of the images we see on television in Afghanistan. Finally, I found "The Kite Runner" a good movie. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "O Ca√ßador de Pipa" ("The kite hunter")
