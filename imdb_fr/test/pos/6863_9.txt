I was shocked by the quality of this German version of films such as Scream. Exceed all modern American efforts in slasher. <br /> <br /> That's what all these movies do not do. Friendly characters, true mystery, suspense, graphic murders and brilliant soundtrack. <br /> <br /> This stylish horror movie is one of the best of its kind to appear in years. German cinema is getting stronger more and more recently. It's a pity that more people will not see such films because they have missed out. It is easily available on DVD, so even if you hate subtitles, you should see it. This will be one of the best horror movies you'll see all year.
