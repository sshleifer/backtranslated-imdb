It was one of my favorites as a child. My family had the 8 track tape soundtrack !! It took us years (until the age of 20) to get a video of the movie (my father recorded it from HBO or something like that). Every summer, when we go to the beach (my mother, my brother, my sister and I), we lie on the beach and sing all the songs of this movie! I loved !!!
