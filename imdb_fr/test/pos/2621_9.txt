Prue and Piper bring Dr. Griffiths home to save him from the Shax Sauce assassin. While Phoebe searches in the Book of Shadow how to defeat the demon, Prue and Piper fight and chase Shax through the streets to destroy him. However, they are filmed and exposed live on television newscasts as wizards. They make a sensation with a crowd in front of their house. Phoebe trusts Cole and goes to the underworld with Leo to ask him to summon Tempus and restore the time, while a fanatical woman shoots Piper, who dies. The source offers Phoebe to stay with him and, in return, he will save his sister. Phoebe agrees and the time is up when Shax attacks Prue, Piper and Dr. Griffits. <br /> <br /> "All Hell Breaks Loose" is a good episode but incoherent. With Piper dead and The Power of Three destroyed, why should The Source come back on time to save it? But this dramatic show is certainly one of the best of the third season and lets viewers look forward to the next episode. My vote is new. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Voltando no Tempo" ("Back in time")
