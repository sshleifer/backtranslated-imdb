After reading the other comment about this great televised drama, I felt compelled to balance things up a bit. If you love murders, whether you are signing and drama, the cops are British and shout a lot, and the gore is bloody and religious, it strikes every button. Not quite enough to put the cry in the rarified heights of Sweeney, but otherwise very well rated. Ken Stott is excellent as a "cop on the edge" and guest stars, including Edward Woodward and Art Malik. Recommended. (In response to previous comments, although I accept that "Red" would not be driving "normally" at once, he had just witnessed his brother's arrest for murder and I am pretty much sure he does not see the boy moving ...)
