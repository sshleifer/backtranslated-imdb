This documentary traces the origins and life of Zephyr's skateboarding team, using an original film shot in the 1970s (mostly by Craig Stecyk), paired with interviews with team members and other influential personalities today. <br /> <br /> The first part of the film describes how the "Dogtown" section of Venice, California, was created from the turn of the century, when the city was created to become a European city to image of Italy. In the 1970s, the remaining local attraction, the Pacific Ocean Park, had been abandoned, leaving a beach with many exposed jetties and other hazards. The poor children living in the area had nothing better to do than surfing and they excelled despite (or perhaps because of) their environment. Because the waves dissipated in the afternoon, they began to skate to occupy their time and the empty pools caused by the drought during those years, as well as their surfing history, led them to create the traditional vertical skate style. <br /> <br /> I discovered that the film covered a lot more things about surfing than I thought, which seemed like a bonus since I did not really know much about surfing or skateboarding before watching the film. The soundtrack, unsurprisingly, was also good. I also liked how these kids just followed their passion and generally ended up better by experience. The parts that did not work so well for me are the drama they tried to create, which seemed a bit forced, and the somewhat exaggerated feeling of the importance of the team (although it is probably a remaining street attitude from which they grew up). This is not to say that they did not have significant influence, only that it seems extremely likely that there were other factors. <br /> <br /> A note: my wife is more affected than most people by nausea when movies use what we call "SpastiCam" (shaky camera movements). This film is often guilty, so if you are distressed, be warned. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this film to anyone, but especially to all those who practice skateboarding and / or surfing in their history. <br /> <br /> Given the 5/11/2002.
