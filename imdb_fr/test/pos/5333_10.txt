After the resounding success of Nick Park and the Aardman team with the short animations of Wallace and Gromit, we now have the first feature (hopefully of much) with the plasticine characters that so many people love. The DVD of the film proved to be the most durable and best used of the many Christmas presents of my two children, by far. The plot of the movie is pretty simple but the beauty of W & G movies for me is the background gags. There are a lot of gags on the front and slapstick for kids and adults but the bottom is the killer for me. All in an elegant addition to an already elegant filmography for Nick Park etal and I would often recommend to fans and new observers to see this film ... often.
