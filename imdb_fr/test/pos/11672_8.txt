This is one of the best movies made on the 80's punk scene. I saw it a few years ago on a bootleg copy and was amazed. Very few kids today know the true roots of punk and this movie features some 80s punk legends such as The Germs and shows how it was back then. Nowadays, a lot of punk has become popular with MTV and radio, and it's nice to see the real underground rebel movement of the original scene. Darby Crash (from The Germs) is one of my heroes and this film shows why. A must for all "punks" and all those curious about the 80s punk scene
