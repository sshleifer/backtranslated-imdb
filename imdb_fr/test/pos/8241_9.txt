A very good Australian film. Beautifully recreates the look of Sydney in the 50s. This movie impressed me a lot when I saw it for the first time during its initial release at the cinema and it still resists very well. Phil Noyce's beautiful staging work, extraordinary camera work, thoughtful lighting and outstanding performances in all fields. An absolute "to see" for all Australian film students of the 70s. One out of the box!
