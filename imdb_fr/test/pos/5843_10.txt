Oz was a fantastic show, as long as frequent male nudity did not dissuade you. There was WAY too much frontal male nudity in this show, more than any other show you would see on a porn channel. Minus that was the best show on TV, and a previous speaker said "better than the First Suspect". The main suspect is Tom and Jerry vs. The Simpsons. No competition. If you have DirecTv, they re-run it from the beginning on Channel 101, they are now in episode 3. Highly recommended. Creator Tom Fontana also did Homicide, which was an AWESOME show. But why all the male nudity? We all know it happens in prison, but do they really need to show it so often? It was the only thing that made me leave the show. If I want to see naked men, guys being raped, I will kill someone myself and testify first hand. Otherwise, I like my TV shows without black penis every five minutes.
