If (as I just said in THE GOAT) Keaton follows the tradition of comics that are in contradiction with the law, this Langdon short film (the last one released before TRAMP, TRAMP, TRAMP) was based on another cartoon stratagem - be married to a clever spouse and try to escape for a secret dating at two times. Laurel & Hardy did it in several movies, as did Fields and Chaplin. <br /> <br /> This is a problem for me - why do these characters always marry such wicked women? And there is an interesting secondary sociological problem - why do not you find comics married to male counterparts of these shrews? I do not remember, except in a sketch by Carol Burnett, where the two meanest members of two couples discovered that they preferred someone to make them perfect (a kind of mutual sado-masochism, but also reassuring not married to a namby-pamby guy). As for the fact that comics espouse shrews, I suppose we can imagine that they get what they deserve. Or do they do it? Does Ollie really deserve a woman who throws pots and pans at him? Yes, he went to this convention in SONS OF THE DESERT who ruined his plans, but he wanted to have some private time - nothing suggests that he and Stan had cheated on their wife. In fact, Mae Busch crushed him because he lied to her while Stan collapsed and told the truth to his wife. <br /> <br /> Harry's wife (Alice Ward) is shown at first talking to her mother about how she keeps him under strict control. We see Harry at work (it's Saturday morning and work ends at noon for the rest of the weekend - it was before the idea of ​​working in the industry five days a week, 40 hours a week ). He's working in a foundry where he's shaping a hot metal (a beginning joke about Langdon - he's a light little man, not the muscular guy to rock a mass). He misses his streetcar trying to light a man. He calls home to explain things and the missus tells him she is two minutes late. <br /> <br /> On the way back, Harry meets his friend Steve (Vernon Dent) who has met two lovely little girls who would like to have a date. Harry hesitates but accepts after talking to the girl (he agrees to pay the hotdogs for the quartet - he has a half-dollar in 1926 in his pocket). But his plans seem derailed when his wife discovers his "cache" of hidden coins. He hides it under the living room carpet and finds it while walking along the carpet. But his wife spies on him and confiscates her completely. Later, she hears him talking to himself and reprimanding her. In scorn, she gives him a dime and says he can treat his appointment with a soda. <br /> <br /> But Harry has a second cache of coins and disguises himself for the date - and turns off. Apparently, he and Dent are late, and Dent blames Harry, but Harry tries to catch him: he produces two prostitutes. They argue when Dent (wisely) says they are not the kind of girls he would call "nice". Finally, the girls introduce themselves and the date begins. But soon, Harry hides in the deafened seat, while his wife passes in his roadster and that the friends of the girls appear, angry against their two rivals. <br /> <br /> The short film works well and is fun, and gives a better idea of ​​the character that Harry Langdon has developed into his brief celebrity as a master of comics. He is constantly attacked by others. He misses his tram because a stranger constantly asks for a cigarette and a light, and finally, the stranger takes his. The nice girl who goes out with Harry has a little dog chasing him. He sits between two cars, both of which start and end up wrapping around a pole. It certainly shows that Langdon had his personality on the screen when he made his features. If only he had been able to keep the complex as a whole beyond these first three features.
