This film tries to escape to the typical 'I fight because I am obliged to defend the homeland. The NAZI are all bad guys, I'm against "(typical of German war movies). How? By not talking about it too much and just talking about war and prisoners of war. Nevertheless, I would like to see a German film that would be something between the end of Come And See and Das Boot of the "bad NAZI". I say that because, apart from that, the German films are the best representing the 2nd World War and the German part. You can easily see some of the German hierarchical relations, very different from those of the US military. <br /> <br /> It's a movie that seeks to have a real view of what was Stalingrad and I was not there, and I doubt that most people are here now, but if I chose a film describing this battle, it certainly would not be the whole American Enemy At The Gates. Why do I say that? Because even the best soldiers are not heroes, and given the conditions, they might consider their own life rather than the homeland. This applies to all ranks and at the end you will see the example of von Paulus.
