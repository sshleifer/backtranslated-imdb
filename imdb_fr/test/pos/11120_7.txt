The film follows a group of students from the High School of Performing Arts in New York. There is Coco (Irene Cara), a black singer who will manage to reach the top anyway. She is helped by Bruno (Lee Curren), a white musician. Then there's Doris (Maureen Teefy) who wants to be an actress - but she's shy and scared. She befriends Motgomery (Paul McCrane) - supposedly the only gay student in the school and is romanced by Raul (Barry Miller). Then there is Leroy (Gene Anthony Ray - who died sadly in 2003) who is homeless and who is an excellent dancer - but who can not read. Then, various teachers (Albert Hague and Anne Meara stand out) try to teach children. <br /> <br /> The songs are GREAT (the title song and "Out Here On My Own" were nominated for the best song-- "Fame" won), the dances are energetic and the young cast shows a lot ambition and talent. BUT this film misses the boat in the theater department. Many lines of the plot are displayed and are left completely open at the end of the movie. Why did Coco make a porn? Did Doris and Raul stay together after? Did he succeed And Montgomery, what happened to him? And has Leroy ever graduated - and how? There are too many long speeches (Raul has two) and moments that lead to nothing. I guess there have been cuts in the script - I can not believe the movie leaves it all open. <br /> <br /> Still, it's worth visiting for acting and, again, for music. There is basically no one song and the dances are moving forward (and at some point, stop the traffic - literally!). My favorite songs are "Fame", "Out Here ..." and "I Sing the Body Electric", an excellent closing song. I recommend it, but I can only give him a 7 - the script really needs to tie what he did - and he did not do it. <br /> <br /> Anecdote: They wanted to shoot this movie at the current school. for the performing arts but could not get permission. The dean of the school read the script and said there were too many swear words in the movie. That's right - there is MUCH of foul language, but that's how high school students talk. Avoid the TV version that adds lamentably.
