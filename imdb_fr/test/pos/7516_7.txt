George Scott gave the show of a lifetime in Paddy Chayefsky's THE HOSPITAL, a very grim drama about an aging urban hospital and a middle-aged doctor about to commit suicide. Next is Diana Rigg as a free spirit determined to save him from himself. Their dialogue cracks, and it is clear that they are made for each other from the start. But will she save him? Their sexual scene is both graphic and memorable for his passion and fury. Meanwhile, the hospital is besieged by a group of agitators who do not want to turn a condemned building into a cancer center. And a serial killer is on the run at the hospital, specializing in doctors and nurses. Much of the film, however, is clearly centered on Scott. As it should be. What a difference a few years have made when this film was made. 1962 had given us THE INTERNS, a hokey at the old-fashioned retouching of DR. KILDARE with a terrible acting game and a cardboard script. Then came 1971 and THE HOSPITAL. Less than 10 years later. Hollywood did something good to change. Watching THE HOSPITAL today reminds us of how many medical series like ST. Elsewhere and SCRUBS owe this durable classic. And if the Hospital reminds you of NETWORK, it should. Same writer.
