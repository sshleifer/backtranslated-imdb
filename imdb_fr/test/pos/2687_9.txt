King of Queens is a very original, unique and surprisingly fun alternation. In the last ten years or more, the whole world is flooded with so-called sitcoms (very few deserve this title because they are so predictable). This is the daily life of a delivery man and his wife working as law clerks in Manhattan, Queens, New York. With them, Arthur, the father of Carrie, an extrovert of picture book, interpreted by the fantastic Jerry Stiller, steals the show to all other spectators. Deacon and Kelly, a married couple, and their other friend, Spence, who is almost 30 years old and still lives with his mother, are also among the most important personalities. What makes this show so unique and fun is, first and foremost, that each character seems so real and that Carrie's cynical and sarcastic attitude is the complete opposite of Doug's somewhat dumb and natural optimism. And Arthur, who makes it absolutely unpredictable his strange ideas and habits. He often has problems and Doug and Carrie have to get him out of the mud. Although, in my opinion, the quality of the show has decreased somewhat in recent years, it remains one of the best daily sitcoms ever made. It takes a little time to get into the characters and understand them, but after that you get unstoppable laughter. Although I think I could not survive one day with Arthur in a closed room without knocking him, I really love him in this show. Look and have fun, I give it a 9 out of 10.
