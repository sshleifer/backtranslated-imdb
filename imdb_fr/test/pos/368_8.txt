Has aged very well - still thrilling and suspensive today. Certainly one of the best Hitch movies. Beautifully shot, with a great premise for the suspense, sex appeal provided by the beautiful Ruth Roman. Because of the great premise, you feel obliged to look to the end. If you lose confidence in Hitch and you doubt his title Master suspense, I recommend this pretty little film as an antidote. 5 out of 5
