Lackawanna Blues is a moving story that tells the story of a boy raised in a house by rather unusual people. <br /> <br /> The edition and the soundtrack really get you into the story and let you live the movie the way the writer really wanted it. <br /> <br /> The music is really linked to the story that brought the characters to life. The editing made the story more progressive and captivating. <br /> <br /> I was also surprised by some of the performances of the cast, notably those of S. Epatha Merkerson. <br /> <br /> I can not wait to see the one man show starring this film writer, Ruben Santiago-Hudson.
