This caricature documents the second encounter between Wile E. Coyote and the Roadrunner and is certainly better than their first encounter in Fast and Furry-ou (1949). <br /> <br /> If measured according to its aesthetic value, this caricature would not appear in the top 5 or 6 of the year 1952. Anyway, this is a very entertaining short film. Coyote (Carnivores Vulgaris) continues the Roadrunner (Accelerati Incredibilus) along the road and is completely tired. The ingenious "Latin" scientific names of the characters are very original and have been imitated before in other unrelated caricatures. The coyote collapses and takes a wonderful expression of - I do not know - freedom. Such Jonesesque expressions make this caricature more than just a laugh in seven minutes. Then he has an idea and another laughable expression is carried. The slapstick jokes are all hilarious and hide the fact that it is really diabolical to inflict such pain on a poor helpless GENIUS coyote. Everyone knows, but who cares? <br /> <br /> The old rocket gag is also present. Coyote attaches to a rocket, which should allow him to catch Roadrunner and catch him. Instead, the rocket goes up in the air and becomes a firework in the distance: Eat at Joe's. This classic gag comes from this cartoon; Although this is obvious, it always makes people laugh. <br /> <br /> The highlight is really mine hunting. Both wear helmet lights and we see the tunnel in which they pass, with only visible lights. Here, the comedy reaches its peak. A must see sequence, maybe even the best start of Roadrunner. The finishing touch is provided by Michael Maltese's writing, while Coyote's light goes out and he unknowingly lights a match in a room full of explosives, the surface is shown on which a group of cacti jump and spell the letters "YIPE!" after the explosion. Such little things make you laugh for just seven minutes and as soon as it starts, the party is over. Rockets are another good idea, as is the free drink with water and the anvil on the tightrope (a sequence that appears in Space Jam [1996]). To give the results of those would be useless. The free drink turns out to be a problem for Wile E. at the end of the penultimate sequence: namely the skating rocket. <br /> <br /> This classic drawing is dotted with beautiful animation, except for the characters. Although they are very well animated, the two characters are very primitive; which could be a euphemism. It may seem strange at first, but the humor of the sequences that follow makes you forget. <br /> <br /> If you like vintage Jones, look at it. If you like Roadrunner, watch this video. Excellent entertainment (Note: 8/10).
