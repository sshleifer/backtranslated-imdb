A very intelligent and exciting thriller that does not rely on action but on the situation, which is rare today. I would compare this film to Jackal's Day, another film about the prosecution of a dangerous international criminal. The role played by all is superlative - Aidan Quinn plays a delicate double role as a vicious terrorist Carlos and as a marine man who imitates him. Donald Sutherland plays the CIA amoral agent who hires him. Ben Kingsley plays the Israeli officer who participates in the plan. It is a very tense and effective film, and it is remarkable considering the little action that there is in this film. The first half of the film is fully prepared, while the Navy Man is preparing to imitate Carlos. The second half is a breathless actor, the outgoing action of the characters and their situations, thus making it more attractive. A really tight movie that should not be overlooked.
