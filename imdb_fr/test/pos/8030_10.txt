I'm a big fan of the spy genre and it's one of the best of these movies. The Assignment is based on a true story, which has been somewhat embellished for the big screen, and really takes you on a fun adventure. The film has an excellent cast, with Aidan Quinn, Donald Sutherland and Ben Kingsley. <br /> <br /> Naval officer Quinn is reluctantly recruited by Sutherland after a chance encounter with Kingsley, who believes Quinn is the famous terrorist Carlos Chacal. Because Quinn looks so much like Carlos, Sutherland will stop at nothing to recruit him because Sutherland is obsessed with the capture or death of the terrorist. <br /> <br /> The training sequences are impressive. Quinn is really being tested by Kingsley and Sutherland, who have to resist the attacks of remote-controlled snowmobiles, from eating the same food every day to taking a hallucinogen-containing drug. He must even learn to make love to a woman like Carlos would. <br /> <br /> The film features great action scenes in which Quinn escapes his allies, believing he is Carlos and is on his last mission when he is. kill the jackal. Throughout the film, Quinn must fight against the new personality he has acquired compared to his own. Will he remain as pitiless and free as Carlos or will he come back again in the life of a good husband and a good father? <br /> <br /> If you like the spy genre, it's a must. The action is only used to propel the story of this thriller forward; no free explosions or fight scenes. Rating 10 out of 10 stars.
