I really loved seeing this movie. I think it's a brilliant and underrated film by Alfred Hitchcock. Everyone knows the famous scene of the Statue of Liberty, but there is a very good movie before that. Robert Cummings is excellent in what I consider to be his biggest role and the beautiful Priscilla Lane shows that she also has a lot of talent. But I think Norman Lloyd gives the best performance. His character, Fry, is so perverse and devious. Even if he does not stay long, the film would not be the same without him. <br /> <br /> "Saboteur" is a very good movie that all fans of Hitchcock should see. I give him a 10 out of 10 !!
