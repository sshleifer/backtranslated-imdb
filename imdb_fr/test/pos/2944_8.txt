This film was both entertaining and stimulating. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to be moved and challenged. Excellent interpretation, staging - and it's Canadian! It's a film that families can enjoy and serious moviegoers. Places in Ontario have created such a sense of nostalgia for that time. With so much superficial waste and superficial hype these days, it's good to see that someone can support an independent film. For all families who have risen to overcome a challenge or obstacle - financial or illness - this film resonates! He approaches the idea of ​​the Beyond in a contemporary way - without capitalizing cheaply on all the "gohst" and supernatural themes that have become essential in Hollywood and television networks.
