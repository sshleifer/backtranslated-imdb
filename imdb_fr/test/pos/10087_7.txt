Another Asian horror movie filled with intense and frightening moments. Another hallmark of Asian horror is the complexity of the plot, which is here too. WARNING MAJOR SPOILER! <br /> <br /> The film begins quite simply: two sisters go to live with their father and their mother-in-law after being placed in a psychiatric facility after their mother has hanged herself. The sisters seem very hostile towards their mother - especially the oldest - and seem to ignore their father. Everything goes well until the mother locks the younger sister in the closet and the older sister tells her father. Then he hits you, "your sister has been dead for years now" It turns out that the older sister is still not found after the death of her mother and what we did not know is that the wardrobe in which the mother was hanged fell on the As to the mother-in-law, she is the alter ego of the older sister. She was revealed when the mother-in-law (actually the sister's alter ego) sits on a couch when the real mother-in-law comes in! I hope this has been clarified for confused Asian horror fans. <br /> <br /> Finally, my favorite scene is the scene where the father invites friends to dinner and where one of the friends begins to choke. a panic attack. Very scary! 7 out of 10
