This is undoubtedly one of the best pieces of Neil Simon. It's full of great characters and memorable dialogues. Johnathan Silverman creates a big-screen version of young Eugene (he was played by Matthew Broderick on stage). This is the first of Simon's autobiographical trilogy, followed by the film "Biloxi Blues", and ends with the TV movie "Broadway Bound". . If I had to say that the film has flaws, it might be that the characters sometimes speak generally in an obvious dialogue, but that's good because it's a great dialogue. Rent this little gem, you will not regret it!
