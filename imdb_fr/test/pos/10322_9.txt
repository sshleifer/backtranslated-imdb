The Stooges are back and funnier than ever. "Brideless Groom" was in my opinion probably the best film of Shemp. <br /> <br /> Shemp has the opportunity to inherit $ 500,000 (probably more than a million dollars from today) from his dead uncle. BUT! There is a catch. He has to marry someone that day at 6 o'clock. Shemp is single and does not have too many admirers, except one of his students, an annoying and aggressive singer. But he does not want her, he wants someone a little more about Victoria's Secret model woman. But obviously, he has no choice since it is not Collin Ferrel. But when it is written in the newspapers that he must inherit all that money if he is married, his ex-girlfriends are on the attack "I want my man"! <br /> <br /> What a beautiful movie of slippers! It's up there with the winners of all Stooge movies! <br /> <br /> 9/10
