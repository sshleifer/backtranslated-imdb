The flatliners left a noticeable impression in my head. The story follows a fast pace and leaves you constantly absorbed and sometimes very tense. He has about five outstanding medical students (including Julia Roberts and Kevin Bacon), among whom one of them has developed the mechanism of staying dead (or not talking about anything) for a few seconds, then to come back to life. <br /> <The procedure is quite "complex" and involves a multitude of medical trinkets - injections, warming blankets, oxygen masks and a variety of esoteric medical terms. I strongly suspect the doctors of having invented all these words so that they never need to be fired. But they follow the KISS philosophy (Original version for engineers: Keep It Simple, stupid) (Extended version for doctors: Keep it Stupid, Simple). Let me continue, at the risk of being euthanized by a doctor-reader taking his revenge, <br /> <br /> The first type who is virulent hopes to find answers to life to which philosophy and religion can not answer convincingly. He hopes to get an answer (and become famous) through applied science. He stays flat for about two minutes, then returns to our world, completely shaken. When he died, he had the vision of an incident that occurred while he was young, leaving the strongest impression on his life. He killed another boy when he was a child, by accident, and he still feels responsible. <br /> <br /> With the success of the first flat line, the others follow suit and extend their front line. time further and further to test the limits of how long one can stay dead and experience life after death. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, the monsters of the past and the future come back to haunt them after their flat line experience. The first ship is haunted by a young boy who tortures him when he is alone. The second, who has filmed all the women he has shot, sees televisions everywhere that play his videos. The third is haunted by a girl he teased at school. The fourth is haunted by her father who died of suicide, for which she feels responsible. <br /> <br /> All are driven crazy by these obsessions and haunts and think that the past seems to want to take revenge on them. The main objective is to make sure that all your life passes through your eyes, at the moment of death, whatever the stage, and that you keep especially the strongest impressions of life in your mind. Since they have not died, these strong impressions have resurfaced and become the center of their lives. <br /> <br /> All manage to reconcile (and extinguish) their past demons. All except the first one who realizes that the only way for him to move on to something else in life is to become flat again. During this flat session, he sees himself becoming flat for the first time and also sees the boy he killed while trying to kill him this time. The boy kills him this time for a few minutes and, in doing so, has sought revenge. For a few minutes in the film, one wonders if he should come back. Fortunately (because most of us love happy ends), the boy absolves him of his past and he comes back to life.
