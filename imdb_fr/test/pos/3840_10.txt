It's one of my favorite movies, ever. The story is so fantastic and the characters so good. Unlike other Disney films of the time, this film never bores the public. 101 Dalmations, Peter Pan, Robin Hood, they were all good, but they lack what we have here. It's funny, creative and always focused. This movie just has something extra that you can not learn from books. However, it's not the best animated film ever made. This title belongs to the BRILLIANT Toy Story. But it's a respectable second, followed immediately by The Lady and the Tramp. Just see it and appreciate what is one of the greatest achievements of cinema. And by the way, I'm not a little kid, it's for the older audience who wants to regain their childhood. An absolute must!
