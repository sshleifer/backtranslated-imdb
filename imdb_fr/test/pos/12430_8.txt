It was at Showtime the other night, and I thought it would be another shitty video festival, like "Earth vs. the Spider" or any of those HBO horror shorts. Instead, I found a classic comedy / gore. It was legitimately funny and, surprisingly, the acting was pretty good. Even my wife, a global hate of horror, accepted and mocked the parties. In addition, the effects were of high quality. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie looked like a parody of Joy Ride / Jeepers Creepers, and the 2 main characters reminded me of the Shaun of the Dead couple. You really have to watch, but do not take it seriously. <br /> <br /> The end.
