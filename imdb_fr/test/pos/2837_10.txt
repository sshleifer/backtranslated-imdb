"Nurse Betty" is the kind of movie you can not describe on a poster, in a trailer or in a trailer. This is the kind of movie in which you expect a more mature "Dumb and Dumber", but with a temporarily insane waitress who goes on an adventure while avoiding the crooks who try to kill her. This film is a wonderful and comforting story of two people chasing their dreams. The best part of "Betty Nurse" is her unpredictability. Director Neil LaBute uses brutal violence to separate dreams from reality. Along with touching drama and hilarious comedy, you can never predict what will happen next.
