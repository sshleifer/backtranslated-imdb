I love that movie. and Disney Channel is ridiculous not to play it anymore. I think they should definitely put Susie Q on the air at least one night so we can record it !!! but if no one knows where I can find it ?? my email is cristin6891@aim.com please email me if you know where i can find this movie. Online or anywhere. I talked about this movie to my kids and I think they deserve to see it too. All these Disney movies coming out now are fake and boring. I need back Susie Q !! It was a good movie and there were some great actors and I do not see why it was removed from the air. If everyone loves this movie so much, why was it removed from the air? Please take my comment into consideration and with all the other comments made to this movie. Thanks, have a good day.
