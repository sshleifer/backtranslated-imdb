Following the collapse of Yesilcam (the Turkish response to Hollywood) in the mid-90s, few observers, but the most cautious, could have predicted a dive as recent in the Turkish film industry, probably based on the work ex-photographer Nuri Bilge Ceylan. Uzak is the director's third feature film and forms a sort of trilogy with his two previous images (Kasaba and Nuages ​​de mai), based on similar themes and techniques. The film finds Mahmoud, a commercial photographer, living alone in a small apartment in Istanbul, visited only from time to time by his brusque and married lover. Yusuf, his nephew, left the home of his village after the closure of a factory and the loss of his job. The young man stays with Mahmoud while he searches for work in town, drinks in coffee shops and nervously observes young women he never approaches. <br /> <br /> The title of the film is translated as "Distant", and the film perfectly illustrates all the possible connotations of the word; Yusuf's physical distance from home, Mahmoud's emotional distance from the world around him, and the generational distance separating the two men. <br /> <br /> Ceylon films rarely contain an exaggerated dramaturgy, which allows rich and rich characters to develop from within. Static shots well framed. He acts as a director, producer, writer, director of photography and co-editor. He embodies friends and family in many roles. One might expect that this isolated and confined approach to filmmaking would lead to films that are difficult to infiltrate and connect to most viewers, making Uzak's undeniable humanity even more impressive. <br /> Ceylon, however, is a better cinematographic formist than playwright, taking the reins of former masters of cinematographic language such as Ozu and Tarkovsky. After watching Uzak, I can think of a few better suited to the task.
