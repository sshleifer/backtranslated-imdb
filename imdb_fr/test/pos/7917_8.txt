"Alexander Nevsky" marks the return of director Sergei Eisenstein to the cinema after a period of exile. What he produced is a bald propaganda film proclaiming Russia's superiority over Germany. <br /> <br /> Little conspiracy: the Russians unite to fight the Germans; Russia wins. The film is actually an extensive montage of battle scenes, mixed with moments of German brutality (like a rather shocking scene in which German soldiers throw Russian children on a devastating fire). It was Eisenstein's first sound movie, and it's clear he did not know what to do with the medium. Indeed, this film is more like a silent movie to which are added some sounds. There are some dialogue scenes, but they remain quite lifeless on the screen, and the rhythm is stopped, as if the actors were not together on the set at the same time they were filming them. Eisenstein mainly uses sound as an excuse to superimpose Prokofiev's catchy score, and it's actually one of the biggest assets of the film. <br /> <br /> Say what you want about the ability (or not) of actors Eisenstein or tell his film in a more narrative format, he certainly knows how to edit images and music together for maximum effect , and "Alexander Nevsky" shines by all its faults. <br /> <br /> Grade: A
