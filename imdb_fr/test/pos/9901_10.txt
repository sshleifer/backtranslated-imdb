"Checking Out" is an extraordinary film that goes beyond most film productions. His refreshing and witty humor is never an excuse to stay superficial. On the contrary, the film explores many facets of the human mind and human relationships. His warm approach promotes tolerance and acceptance of diversity and recognition of what unites all peoples. The characters are charming and fun, reflecting these idiosyncrasies that we can all laugh at ourselves. The quick dialogue and witty jokes will keep you on your guard, and you may find yourself trying to contain your own laughter because you will not want to miss a sentence! You will probably want to see it in the cinema, then again (several times) in video and you will discover something new every time. After each viewing, you are sure to feel warm and elevated.
