"Five Fingers of Death" launched the craze for the American kung-fu movie, but I remember seeing it for the first time as "King Boxer" in Chinatown, New York, without dubbing and some Americans. I also had the chance to see the American premiere of "Five Fingers Of Death" in Times Square, New York. What a contrast it turned out to be ... the same film but different audiences. <br /> <br /> In Chinatown, this film took a more serious tone for viewers. It is thanks to the hearing of the real voice of the actors (in Chinese) that made this film more credible. The Chinatown theaters had been broadcasting kung fu movies for many years ("Boxer From Shantung" beat them all), so action choreography and history were the main attraction. The rival school plots were not yet used too much, so the plot seemed new. Every great kung-fu movie had wonderful bad guys that you wanted to get their success and FFoD had them too. The star, Lieh Lo, was a known actor in Chinese theaters. The audience, mostly Chinese, enjoyed this film immensely. The audience buzzes when leaving this film gives me the final satisfaction. <br /> <br /> In Times Square, this movie was an action comedy ... probably involuntary. I enjoyed it here too but for different reasons. The crowd was ethnic and quite energetic. From the beginning, the movie made you laugh. As soon as the audience heard these strange British accents emanating from these Chinese actors, the film turned into a violent and bloody cartoon. Most American viewers have seen this kind of gore in a horror movie and not in an action movie. The action sequences have blown the audience. Unfortunately, the movie studios saw that they had so much appreciated dubbing and unnecessary acts of violence that they had become a formula of the kung fu movie. <br /> <br /> I had fun watching this movie with an American audience, but I enjoyed it a lot more Chinatown. Some movies can pass the test of time, but the dubbed version of FFoD can not. The original "King Boxer" is still nice ... a classic!
