First of all, it is interesting to note that one of the users here commented on this film (from Belgium) had to add that Lumumba was "communist". If this user actually viewed the film, the message was that he was not a Communist, but classified as a leader (by none other than Belgium, the United States, the United Nations, etc.) as a leader. "communist" for other individuals, societies and countries. political and economic gains. Even if one decided to accept that the film participates in the "revisionist history", it would be na√Øve to presume that Lumumba was a communist, especially from the country that "granted" Congo's independence, and since Lumumba was elected democratically at its seat. Minister. <br /> <br /> On the movie ... <br /> <br /> This is one of the most important and powerful films I've seen in a while. Describing the struggles of the African freedom fighter, and the struggles of the elected prime minister, Mr. Peck, does a commendable job of putting all the pieces together in one job. And that must have been a difficult task. Because most people living outside the Congo and Belgium probably do not know the history of Lumumba and Congo, apart from a light cover of African imperialism (hopefully) in the world. one of their colleges (or maybe at the university) / history class, he had some work to do. <br /> <br /> And to think that Oliver Stone's "JFK" had taken more than 3 hours, "Lumumba" lasts less than 2 hours. And 115 minutes very engaging, because we find that his desire not to compromise with the Western powers (which he holds responsible for the atrocities committed against his people, especially Belgium), while trying to cope with the power struggles within its own borders, it seems. even with some of his friends, it is amazing to see that man has lived as long as he has lived. <br /> <br /> This is a must for anyone interested in equality, justice, humanity, history, politics and true freedom. . You will not be disappointed.
