Fun bad movie that should amuse. One of the last performances of Joan Crawford as a successful editor opposed to all these young beautiful enthusiastic beavers from the elite Seven Sister College. Great atmosphere of the 50s of New York. Vintage costumes and hairstyles. Great artistic direction. History banal, but heartbreaking. Interesting Cameo of Robert Evans as Rich Cad.
