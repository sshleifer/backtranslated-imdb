We can not help admiring Mike Judge for his practical approach "I have already experienced that". With "Office Space", almost anyone who works can associate with the characters. "Idiocracy" has exactly the same meaning. We can easily appreciate the experiences of our heroes 505 years later, because again, the director has tried to put things on a very human level. A bit similar to Woody Allen's "Sleeper", this movie is very funny. Do not miss the erased scenes, because the "Museum Of Fart" is a classic. Imaginative comedy is a rarity, and "Idiocracy" is extremely imaginative, extremely funny and a solid 8.0 cinema experience. - MERK
