More and more French films show that it's the only one that can cope with Hollywood and spend a lot of money in their movies. If Bon Voyage had been made in the United States, no one would be surprised. Perfectly located in France, in the 40s, during the Nazi invasion, technically irreproachable, and with some of the most international French actors (Depardieu, Adjani, Ledoyen ...). Bon Voyage is centered on two parallel stories: a scientist and his disciple (Ledoyen) who tries to hide one of his discoveries (a kind of water that can serve as an atomic bomb) to the Nazis; and a poor guy in love with a well-known actress (Adjani), who ends up in prison and is charged with a crime he did not commit to protect her. <br /> <br /> Bon Voyage seems to have been done in the old fashion, without unnecessary movements or camera effects. Without big turning points in the plot. As I said earlier, as far as the production itself is concerned, they have done an excellent job. But the main problem of this film is the script. Is it a spy movie? A romantic comedy? A spy comedy? A comedy of intrigue? It's not clear. This makes Bon Voyage a bit unbalanced. When you think of watching a comedy, suddenly change the scenario into a more dramatic, slower scenario ... I think they should have focused on one of the arguments (the one about the spying plot). and leave the romantic parts in the background. <br /> <br /> My rate: 6.5 / 10
