I was 19 years old when I first saw this movie at the theater. I have a living memory of a different end. Not completely different but significantly. I just watched the movie last night and I was wrong. I guess the following can not be called a spoiler, because it never happened. The end I remember is that the boy was hiding completely naked in the house. Frances Austen found it quite easily and after confronting it, she slowly dropped to her knees and fell on top of him in front of the camera. Only his face was in the frame and it was pretty obvious that he let it go, though against his will. But nothing like this has been shown in the film. When Michael made this film, Sandy Dennis was 32 years old. In the film, he complains to his sister that Frances places too much emphasis on sexuality. Yeah? So go to bed with her boyfriend and finish. WTF?
