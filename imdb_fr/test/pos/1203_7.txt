(May contain spoilers) I am disappointed with critics of this movie. Although it's certainly not perfect, it's better than it deserves. The acting and photography are excellent. Some of the musical numbers are great; including the title number, "Where should I go?", "Easy to be hard" and "Black Boys / White Boys". Although I have not seen the musical on stage, I think it blurs the judgment of many. This is not the musical you see in theaters. Do not try to compare them. The theatrical musical could have been sensational to watch, but it would never have had the same effect on the film, so we had to add a plot. And the end that has been added is simply incredible. The film left me with the feeling of having watched something important, unlike most of today's movies, which only satisfy one level.
