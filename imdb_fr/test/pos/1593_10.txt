Death in Venice is a film that I have to see every ten years. It's always different, because I'm still at a different stage of life. <br /> <br /> The film is about art, beauty, nostalgia, death. Some scenes are painfully slow, others are just boring to watch, especially if you've watched them before. Still, I would not want to miss a single image. The music is repetitive, the main theme of Mahler's fifth adagietto is used again and again. Still, I would not want to miss a single note. When the last image fades, the last note is dead, I am numb and exhausted. <br /> <br /> This film is a monument to filmmaking. As with most very good movies, the Saturday night crowd should stay away. And it's simply the best movie of all time.
