Yes. Watch this movie if you like brave movies. It is perhaps the best Mexican image since Midaq Alley for the quality of its casting, its scandalous direction and its sublime soundtrack. Many people do not like 'Cronica', they think it's very aggressive, but they do not understand that it's just a hyper-realistic representation of Mexican society but so similar to all third world families. I hope that Benjamin Cann and Bruno Bichir (who in this film gives another example of his greatness as an actor) find themselves soon for a new film. Remember how Los Olvidados (Luis Bu√±uel) was misunderstood when it was released, but we now consider one of the best movies of all time. Please, get ready and watch this movie.
