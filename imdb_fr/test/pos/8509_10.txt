Many have denigrated Never Say Never Again because it's not an official Bond movie. Nevertheless, it is clear that producers have adhered to Bond's fertile formula. Although the film does not have a pre-credit sequence, it is clear that the training exercise at the beginning of the film is supposed to be the introductory scene. It would have been impossible for EON to prevent producers from including a sequence of pre-credits and titles, although the introduction of the cannon does not occur. <br /> <br /> Sean Connery is in shape as an immortal secret agent and this film is certainly better than Dr. No, Thunderball, we live only twice and the diamonds are eternal. Although the NSNA is supposed to be a remake of Thunderball, this is a significant improvement. 007 spends more time on dry land and a more diverse range of exotic locales is included in the film. <br /> <br /> There are resplendent acts in this film. Barbara Carrera is impeccable as the strange Fatima Blush. One of the best scenes of the film is the coup de grace between Bond and Fatima in Nice, preceded by a dynamic motorcycle chase across the city. Klaus Maria Brandauer plays the psychotic Largo and Max Von Sydow does not know the melodrama performed by other Blofeld actors. <br /> <br /> The NSNA tends to focus on Connery rather than the character of Bond. At first, Bond is reported to be aging and out of action. This seems to refer to the 12-year break in Bond's portrayal by Connery. Bond promises never to work in the secret service. an allusion to Bond's portrait by Connery. It seems that the producers have tried to harm Bond's official franchise. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, this film certainly deserves to be viewed. This is the last time Sean Connery has played James Bond, but his performance convinced me that he might not have said "never again".
