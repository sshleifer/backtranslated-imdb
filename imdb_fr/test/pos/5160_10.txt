I really did not see this one coming. Roy Andersson got me spotted, I'm the perfect miller for a static camera (long live King Borowczyk!) And I hysterically laughed for the first fifteen minutes of the movie, he hit me straight between the eyes. You must be a brilliant man to make your self-pity hilarious. Andersson reminds me of Pequod's third mate in Moby Dick, Flask, a man who has taken all his life to be a concrete joke that the good lord himself is playing on us. And the web of selfishness in this film is really hilarious. <br /> <br /> The level of satire is at its height, you have a dreamer scared and deceived about the cruelty of the world and ignore completely spiritual self-reflection screaming in agony. The very depths of egotism are plumbed. I never really thought it was possible to go beyond Bergman's "The Silence" in this regard. However, the grotesque self-esteem and self-esteem of each of the characters in this film is stunning. We are shown an existence where the unskilled and idle oppose a world they believe to be unfair to them, they are truly legends in their own salons. The human beings in this film make self-illusion and self-illusion a great art form! <br /> <br /> Only one woman in the movie seems to have any understanding of what's going on. An old woman who refuses to leave a chapel, kneeling to pray for the forgiveness of all humanity, her speech is the most electrifying condemnation of the modern world I have ever heard. Through her prayers, she reveals that what is wrong in the world should not be corrected by simple do-it-yourself work, there are not a few mistakes, there is an abyss of corruption that can only be repaired by an immolation and a judgment. Watching this film puts me in the mind of a naked monk, in the middle of a cold river, at midnight, shouting to the thousands of Kyrie of the sins of humanity. Another great pleasure is that it is clear that her prayers are futile and that she prevents everyone from going home at closing time. <br /> <br /> This is not a film for those who are enough, no one is spared, no idol is left on the altar, no group of humans is harangued to the glory of another group. There has never been a more transcendent and more surprisingly beautiful summary of our sins. It's a film for the end of the world, it's the big joke, the big ugly joke of human life! <br /> <br /> In the catalog of images, it is too difficult to choose a favorite. I hit my thigh and almost fell off my chair at the movies, screaming with laughter as a man tried to pull the tablecloth from under a fixed service. I'm not going to ruin what's going on, but the suspense builds up and something really unexpected happens. It's probably the funniest thing I've ever seen in a movie theater. I am quite reserved and I just can not control myself: it is the measure of the size of this film. <br /> <br /> The filming of "You, the Living" is impeccably formalistic. We are shown the palette of an artist, dark browns, yellows, grays and celestial blues animated by the shock of bright brass textures. There is never a displaced tone, it's like an hour and a half of Whistlerian symphonic melting. The obsession that must have gone into the implementation of this palette of colors is extraordinary. And no shot is wasted, as in all the big movies, there is not an inch of celluloid in reserve. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the best movie I have ever seen.
