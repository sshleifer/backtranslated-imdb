I was very disappointed when this show was canceled. Although I can not vote. I live on the island of Aruba. I sat down to see the show on Tuesday. And I was very surprised that it was not broadcast. The next day, I read on the Internet that it had been canceled. <br /> <br /> It is true that everyone did not have as much talent as the other. But there were very talented people singing. <br /> <br /> I find that very sad for them. <br /> <br /> They worked so hard and their dreams collapsed. <br /> <br /> It's a shame <br /> <br /> Ariette Croes
