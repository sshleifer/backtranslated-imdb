There are many things to admire about this film, but what has placed me above all else is the role of an eccentric recluse, the kind of role Hollywood loves & romance but who here is absolutely convincing & different from all the characters I met in the movie or in life. Also a very convincing and disturbing description of Tourete's syndrome
