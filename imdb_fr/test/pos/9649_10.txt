It's a very long film, indeed. But it's pretty good and it's a good example to show why cinema can be considered an art. One can not expect an easy story in The Regular Lovers, but each scene, each silence tells more than a hundred dialogues. Touching, different, perfect in his images and his soundtrack, showing why the closure brought by the cinema as one of its main characteristics has become the greatest innovation of any dramatic representation. Someone who is used to this kind of film where everything is told and where the action takes place all the time, will find it tiring. But it's worth looking at to discover other possibilities to feel a story.
