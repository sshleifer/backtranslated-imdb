It is very true that this film defies convention by not stating the plot for the viewer. While some may have difficulty solving it by themselves, I kiss "Uzumaki" for his irreverence. There is a plot, it's just that it can not be immediately accessible to a lazy spectator. It's a film that calls for many interpretations, like all the great arts - but this film is also very entertaining, making it a rare cinematic experience. It's both challenging and fun.
