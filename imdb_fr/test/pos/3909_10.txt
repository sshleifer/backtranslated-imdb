I thought this movie was very good! OK, so maybe he had some scenes that might be reminiscent of other horror movies, but I've seen a lot more pathetic movies that have had much higher ratings than this one! Nowadays, many movies are redone in a more modern version and there is nothing wrong with that, it keeps the story alive. I do not think this movie is pathetic at all and I'm not saying it just because I'm a big fan of Chad Michael Murray, but because I enjoyed it. I was on the edge of my seat for most of the movie and my friends and I enjoyed the game and we talked about it all the way! I would tell my other friends to watch this movie. I'm not saying it's the best movie ever presented at the box office, but it's way better than some people describe it. Everyone has their own opinions, so if you really want to know if it's good or bad, look at it and decide then.
