George Barry's "The Eating Bed" is, at the base, a dark fairy tale told via a horror movie frame. This is, in my opinion, one of the best movies of the 1970s and it is quite criminal that the photo was stolen and distributed without the knowledge of Barry (the authors of this flight should be delivered to bed, as soon as possible). If you are looking for a flagrant or enraged action, "The bed of death: the bed that eats" is not what you are looking for. "Deathbed" is a softer and stranger car image; he plays like a dream quite strange, half forgotten. I would recommend reading Stephen Thrower's summary of "Death Bed" in Thrower's FAB Press book, "Nightmare USA" (it perfectly describes the mood of the film). Whether intentional or not, I noticed shades of "death bed" in everything from "Phantasm" movies to "Michele Soavi's Graveyard" to the magic / realism fiction of authors such as Kelly Link. Barry is an original and in a fair world, I'm sure he would have followed "Death Bed" with a number of incredibly weird movies.
