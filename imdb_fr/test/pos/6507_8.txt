The omission of Jazzy Jeff, the creator of the tweet and scratch of the transformer, raised a few eyebrows, but it is good to see that he finally succeeded in the extras of the DVD. With SCRATCH, Doug Pray, who has already described the grunge phenomenon of the 90s in HYPE (1996), has made an excellent documentary on the world of hip-hop DJs and the evolution of turntablism. His latest documentary, INFAMY (2005), explores the American culture of graffiti. After a few screenings four years ago, my DVD was covered with dust, but recently I watched it again. In addition to the subject treated, I was surprised at the quality of the shooting and editing of this documentary. An immensely enjoyable soundtrack as well, not just talking heads, but a lot of music, old school pictures, parties, break dance, and so on. One of the best things about the film is that it mainly examines the art of turntablism (in 2001), without neglecting the pioneers of course. Good material. <br /> <br /> Camera Obscura --- 8/10
