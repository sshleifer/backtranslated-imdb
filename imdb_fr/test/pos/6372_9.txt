A great show. <br /> <br /> First of all, for people who do not like it..You do not like it, so DO NOT LOOK AT IT ... <br /> <br /> It's (was) a great show. Better than Jim (one of my favorites). This shows a TRUE family household (as opposed to 8 simple rules, etc., where everything goes well with fishing). <br /> <br /> They are noisy, they are messy .... I can sympathize with them dragging all the garbage in the kitchen. This happens in real life. A kind of "Portal to Hell", and everyone grunts like a dog over fast food boxes. <br /> <br /> It's a show "Summer there" coming, but fun to watch, because YOU have already been there. <br /> <br /> A good cast, they work very well together, a show admirable enough to justify a release on DVD. Mel Gibsons "Safety Videos" was also a highlight of the series. <br /> <br /> Opinion? Good show, REALLY deserving a DVD release (deserving not to be canceled too).
