I did not realize how much this episode was from The Enemy Below until I finally saw the movie (it has since become my favorite war movie). Some elements have also been raised in Run Silent Run Deep. Nothing wrong with stealing ideas, as long as you do something cool with them. And Roddenberry and his company have done something cool with this one. <br /> <br /> The story begins when the Romulans violate a 100-year-old treaty, cross the neutral zone and destroy a series of Federation outposts along the area. apparently to test their superior armament and invisibility screen (and the subsequent shift in power balance between the Romulans and the Federation, in their view) as a prelude to total invasion. Kirk must decide whether it is worth risking the war to try to stop the Romulan ship, or whether the biggest risk lies in letting the invaders go after they destroyed 4 before military posts. Kirk chooses wisely. <br /> <br /> This is our first look at an enemy of the Federation, the Romulans, a warlike race, but in their own way an honorable race, who are distant relatives of the Vulcans. However, unlike their peaceful cousins, the Romulans did not give up their emotions and their violent and imperialist means, even if they progressed technologically. <br /> <br /> It does not matter to Mr. Stiles, the ship's navigator and leader of this episode. antagonist aboard the company (the Romulan commander has his own problems with a junior officer gung-ho). All that matters to him is that he hates the Romulans and that Spock looks like that .. until the end when Spock saves his life (of course). This contrasts sharply with Captain Kirk and the Romulan commander, who have no personal dissatisfaction with the other. The two men are simply doing their duty. In fact, there is mutual respect. This is the first episode of Trek that deals directly with prejudices, and it does it deftly (unlike the "not so subtle season 3 of season 3). <br /> <br /> Like the enemy Below, we have a classic chess match between two ship's commanders who are very similar to each other, and you can see right away that these two captains are good ... If you went to battle, you'd like one of them These two men are honorable and honest men who are duty bound, yet even if the Romulan commander is duty-bound to his home world, he still wants to be destroyed before he can go home. rather than start a new interstellar war, yet he does everything he can to get home, just as Kirk does everything to stop him. <br /> <br /> It's, in my opinion, one of Trek's top 5. He has everything: lots of action, suspense, good dialogue, b Water acting (I still maintain that the Romulan Commander was Mark Lenard's best role in Trek), and he manages to make his social comment without being too preachy. Too bad Roddenberry forgot the last part of his career with TNG. <br /> <br /> Watch this episode, then watch The Enemy Below.
