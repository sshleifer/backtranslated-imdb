I like this film. This was done just before the Los Angeles punk scene got worse. It perfectly preserves the atmosphere and the attitude of this place and this time. I feel really lucky to have watched four of the groups at Fleetwood shoot that night. The only sections dealing with Catholic discipline and their socio-political comments are the least well adapted. I did not see many people who were in the same. The rest of the film shows attitudes that I have observed a lot; people struggling with difficult lives, or making a leap into the music industry and / or lousy hippies. I do not think I have seen a documentary that captures the subject matter so authentically and personally.
