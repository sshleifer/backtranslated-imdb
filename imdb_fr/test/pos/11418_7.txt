Having seen the original when I was 13 (and yes, I was stupid enough to watch it while I was babysitting!), I was excited to see this remake. <br /> <br /> Camilla Bell did a great job with Jill Johnson. And the fact that a horror movie for teens can be shot in 2006 without a huge vulgarity and gore has made it even stronger. I had fun trying not to bite my nails! <br /> <br /> This movie will not win any Oscar, but it is entertaining and deserves the morning prize I bought to see it. I think girls around the world should watch the original and the remake ... and then decide never to babysit again. <br /> <br /> All I can say is that I'm happy to be too old to babysit! There is just something about being in a dark and scary house with sleeping children that makes this movie classic. No blood, no gore ... just good fun! WINNER!
