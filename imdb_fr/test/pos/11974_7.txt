I consider myself a fan of Dean Koontz; after reading a number of his novels and having loved them all, but unfortunately, I never had time to read Watchers and so I have no choice but to rate this film on its merits rather than to compare it to the book I did not read. I started looking for something horrible and, although I did not have a brilliant horror movie; I am led to believe that it is the book's followers who criticize it because Watchers is a horror film that is both entertaining and original. The plot obviously draws from the influence of Predator and begins with an explosion in a research laboratory. Shortly after, a breeder is killed by a strange beast and the boyfriend of the deceased's daughter has recovered an ultra-intelligent dog on the run. A secret government agency is soon on the case, while murders continue. The boy continues to be fascinated by the dog's intelligence, but the dog is in some way related to the murders and the agency is soon on his heels. <br /> <br /> The script of this film was originally written by Paul Haggis, later disavowed. I do not know why ?? the writing here is far from being as ridiculous as its 2004 hit, Crash! Anyway, the main reason this movie works is undoubtedly the dog, who besides being pretty cute, is also the best actor in the movie. Corey Haim, who comes from the success of The Lost Boys, is the main human role and has a pretty good chemistry with the dog, although it's a bit ridiculous to see him talking to him almost throughout the movie. The plot is rather complicated and, as such, the film is more than a little complicated; but the ridiculousness of all this makes him pass through the most difficult moments. Michael Ironside also appears in the film and plays the role of "bad cop" of government agents. The monster is, of course, one of the most interesting aspects of the film and its way of killing people is always fun and bloody; although unfortunately, we did not see many of them and when we finished, it was rather disappointing - obviously, the filmmakers had seen Bigfoot and the Hendersons! Nevertheless, this is the kind of movie that can be easily appreciated despite the many problems and that I would recommend to any unsuspecting spectator of horror of the eighties.
