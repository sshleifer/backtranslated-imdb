The film had NO promotional help: if there was promotional advertising on TV or radio, I did not see it and did not hear it. The only newspaper advertisement I saw was during his opening weekend: a muddy black-and-white photograph of Andy in Val-Com, behind bars of the prison, with the title: " WANTED! Runaway Robot! " (which was also the poster in front of the 3 cinemas where I saw it - NOT the pretty little color poster on this site, with portraits of all the actors, and the cartoon of Crimebuster - which was really not so they would like to have used an action scene taken from the movie itself - did not they have a beginning photographer? A poster is supposed to help a potential audience decide whether they want or not SEE the movie - so many people could not 'have not made a choice, and wanted to know what Heartbeeps looked like - and this poster did not help! This dark picture and the only other photos provided to the papers were so indistinguishable in N & W they were No trailer for the film: there was only one slide in a room, consisting of the word "Heartbeeps" inside a heart shape, topped with a Cupid's arrow and a totally black photo: Andy and just Bernadette's voice saying "Val-Com! M we center of pleasure works badly! "" Then is mine; do you think we should inform our owners? "THIS is no help for people who were not aware of the film. <br /> <br /> During the filming, Andy told reporters that he could not eat, once his plastic lips applied, he would "load on breakfast, and fast" during the filming of the day I do not know WHAT Bernadette had done: but at the time , I wondered why they did not drink protein shakes with long straws or did not eat mashed food in the manner of an astronaut? <br /> <br /> Phil-Co, the baby robot, seemed to have was the precursor of Short Circuit's Johnny-Five movie, with the same eyes and face, I tried to find out if they had the same designer, but no help, I have vintage magazine articles about the movie , and the design team was extremely proud of their work and was aiming for a special price for them r innovative device to create an odorless "smoke" for Catskill cigars. Shortly after, LucasFilm did not use this device, although they offered themselves for the scenes of Return of the Jedi with Jabba the Hut: a man created "steam" around Jabba, in blowing cigar smoke into a tube, jokingly was a glass of cognac, and he would be a happy man. I thought LucasFilm's use of real tobacco products was insensitive to people who were upset by smoke. <br /> <br /> John Williams, who had just succeeded the late and great Arthur Fielder as Maestro of the Boston Pops (who was THEN a hit, but never recovered from Fielder's death, is now a shadow of his former glory), used the show to promote the films with which he provided the music. He had created the score "The Empire Strikes Back"; and you would think he would have helped Heartbeeps play some numbers here? The only thing the critics liked about this movie was Williams' score - yet it was NOT available for sale! In 1982, I saw a vinyl album with half Heartbeeps, another movie, but it disappeared. Tonight, I just saw the CD listed on this site and ordered it. If I can get a scanner and the time to type the articles, I would like to create a tribute website to Heartbeeps. I liked the movie and I do not care what the dissidents say! <br /> <br /> The only problem with the movie is that in the end, it made sense, the robots escaped: the robots fled the factory to have the freedom to decide of their own destiny, to make their own choices; yet, when the owners of the case tell them that Phil must go to the factory, have a "purpose" programmed into him, they do not even question him; they look at each other with meaning, and they go away. On the way, each adult loses his battery and "dies". They are not REALLY dead, because they are robots and need only new batteries. Yet this is treated as a "death", with little Phil crying on it and wrapping himself up. So what was the POINT of this? Phil never returns to the factory and gets "a goal!" And of course, Junkyard owners MAY drive them or give them all the battery recharges, along with backup batteries; but the real problem was having this poignant scene, where the robots were all wearing up, and letting Phil cry. <br /> <br /> In the end, Val-Com is a golf instructor and Aqua-Com is - I do not know what. Catskill is an ENTERTAINER - what is he supposed to be? I'm not sure they were clear. The owners of Junkyard seem to relax, lying on deck chairs, drinking lemonade from Phil, their "bartender". The new "girl" of Val and Aqua, Philsia - I think her name - maybe it's Sylvania - does not seem to be much more than a table lamp. <br /> <br /> Missing images, which is sad. From the photos, I guess the missing elements include a captivating scene, where Phil spends a Christmas, with Val offering him the steering wheel of a car; Aqua provides a horn; Catskill took the fire helmet to give to Phil, as we have seen; and they have Christmas trees. I do not know if the missing sequences provide a better logic or if the writers simply could not think of a better crisis / resolution. The film was cut at 72-75 minutes, to couple it with other failing films. No other reason than that. For a DVD, I would love to participate in the creation, because I want to see interviews with the actors and the technical team and John Williams, as well as the interview with Merv Griffin. The making-of images; and republish and restore the missing images to improve them.
