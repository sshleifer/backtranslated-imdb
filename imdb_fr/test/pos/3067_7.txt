Mel Brooks is a great writer, director and actor, but from time to time even he can have a klinker. Cary Elwes is a charming and talented man, but he can not do comedy. His expressions in the camera show that he can not even believe the inanities of the screenplay. Richard Lewis looks bored and distracted from the beginning, with little to do, and Amy Yasbeck is stuck in the role of actress in high school. Dave Chapelle shows an excellent range of comedies mugging and harming for the camera and Mark Blankfield is mostly smothered by the role of the blind, but he still manages to show an excellent range of comedies. Eric Allen Kramer does not have much to do, but his few scenes are compelling. The best roles are Roger Rees, Tracy Ullman, Megan Cavanaugh and Brooks when he appears. Dom DeLuise has a funny trick as a Mafia Don employing a Clint Eastwood look-alike, but on the minus side, some jokes are not very funny, while some very funny ones seem stolen from Mel's other films.
