OK, I admit, I'm 40 years old and I still have a tear every time I look at Johnny recalling his robot at the end. <br /> <br /> "Robot, stop now! Do not do it, stop the attack ... Robot, what are you doing, Robot ... Robot, where are you going? Robot, come back! Robot. .. Robot please! Do not do it, you're going to die ... Robot ... Robot, please come back! I need you here ... Giant Robot ... Robot! Giant ?? "-Johnny Sokko, The Last Guillotine of the Emperor <br /> <br /> Of all Tokusatsu present, the Giant robot occupies a special place in my heart and will always remain so. I attach a lot of importance to what I find in science fiction and animate it when I was a child. <br /> <br /> LIVE ON GR!
