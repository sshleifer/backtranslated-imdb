This film is about as good as the first Jackass, but with slightly more disgusting sketches. I would not say it was as good as the first, but it was very close. Jackass fans will not be disappointed, but if you do not like the first movie, you'll hate this one. There are scenes that will be seen as Jackass classics (old-fashioned costumes with "additions", "taxi ride" and many more), and ones you'll never want to look at (eat from shit, drink sperm, etc.)) Overall, this movie was a good watch and I'm glad I could see it. I'm sure this movie will not get the best rating because of the reviews that evaluated it (I was sitting in the press section and most viewers seemed disgusted), but that does not stop you from enjoying it .
