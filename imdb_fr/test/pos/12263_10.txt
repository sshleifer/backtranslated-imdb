I say sadly because if you see this movie now, you realize how much our media has been sinking - all the warning signs are in this movie. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie, I think of James Brooks' last big film, but others may not agree. He has rich characters (who are also believable), fantastic acting, excellent writing and, although the music is a little old-fashioned, I even liked it. <br /> <br /> William Hurt has never been better. Holly Hunter is beautiful. And Albert Brooks leaves with every scene in which this triangle of people is beautifully drawn and convincing and makes the entire film rise above its vital and important subject, and the slowness with which it is compromised in our country. <br /> <br /> Look at this with NETWORK for a really fun and scary evening.
