This film talks about three teenagers who have long been the best friends in the world and who leave for the most messy journey of their lives. When Heroine becomes the drug of choice in their city, these three teenagers find themselves in the thick of things. This film portrays heroin addiction very well and you can not stop looking at it. MTV has never been the best for TV movies, but this one has too much good content to not watch it. I enjoyed this movie. At first, I thought it would be the worst film I've seen, but it has improved over the years and I could not turn away anymore.
