The title refers to the destruction of the remains of a crop, such as rice husks, by farmers who burn them by creating fires on the plains. This is a dark tale about the destruction of the Japanese soldier. <br /> <br /> The story unfolds in the last days of the campaign in the Philippines as a TB patient who returns from the hospital because, since he can walk, has no place for him. His senior officers do not want him because he's really too sick to work or fight. Abused by his officer, he is sent back to hospital with the order to be admitted or to kill himself. They still do not take it and he is soon wandering the war-torn landscape trying to find help, a place to stay or even food. It is a dark journey without hope and with only the death and inhumanity of man towards man at every turn. <br /> <br /> Declared as a heartbreaking journey into the dark heart of man and war, it is also a very entertaining film. That does not mean it's not horrible, it's sometimes, but it's also very comical. How could it be otherwise? Here is a film where madness and madness rage, people are constantly trying to shake the tobacco leaves for food, trying to get a slightly better pair of shoes, trying to stay a Japanese soldier despite the absurdity while walking without ever anywhere and you can not help but laugh. For things to get darker, it becomes clear that cannibalism may be, literally and figuratively, the only way to survive, but at the same time, there is something terribly funny about human comedy. <br /> <br /> Hailed as a great anti-war film, his striking photographic style highlights the folly of war while dazzling our eyes with its beauty. Here we see landscapes full of bodies including the soldier and the civilian. Located in the middle of fields, forests and trees that would otherwise be, and are still to some extent, pretty beautiful. It's a shocking sensation. <br /> <br /> What is intriguing is that I read that this is based on a novel about the redemptive power of Christianity. The director has removed all religious references to hope and salvation and used it to show that life stinks, war stinks and there is ultimately no hope. <br /> <br /> Intellectually, I emotionally admire the movie. I do not. Part of it is a strident downbeat score that, for me, highlights what we see on the screen. It is almost the gilding of the lily since the images are so strong that it is not necessary that the music forces you to feel in one way or another. <br /> <br /> Is it a good movie, it's up to you. For some, this film is unlike any other war movie: bloody, horrible and real as claimed by big budget movies, but never. It is not for the opponents of blood and blood, because it is here with the shovel. <br /> <br /> It is definitely worth a visit.
