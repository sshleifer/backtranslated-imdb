Alice enters a world of wonder ... but not the kind of wonder you remember when you were a kid. The Mad Hatter, the White Rabbit, the Queen and others (even Tweedledee and Tweedledum) show Alice some things about her body - and the bodies of others - that could be quite wonderful. A story of love and lust like you've never seen it before. <br /> <br /> Kristine DeBell appears as Alice. I must say that, by the standards of the 1970s, this is perhaps the most seductive adult actress of her time. I think it's her only film before going to the mainstream, but it's pretty much the best movie she could have chosen (my love for Alice is no secret). Even better than "Fairy Tales" (which is not really pornography, so a lot). <br /> <br /> The songs are corny, but correspond to the theme of the film. A song, "What does a girl like you do on a knight like that?" was pretty funny, and the others had similar themes. The trial towards the end was well written and fits perfectly into Alice's world. Logic and humor were definitely taken into account. <br /> <br /> What else can you say about a movie like this? All I know is that, for the regulars of adult movies where sex is only a 30-second introduction, it will overload you with conspiracy and music. But, personally, I think this movie has something very special and I hope it will get a nice DVD release with special touch-ups and features (if it's even possible). I can see it's a cult movie.
