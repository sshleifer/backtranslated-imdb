As an avid reader of Clive Barker, I really anticipated this movie before it was released ... I was not let down. "Nightbreed" is a horse of a different color. Rich in the underlying degradation of Western civilization and imbued with alternative existence as never before. Barker is at his best when he allows us to take a look into his world of unprecedented horror, while showing us the flip side. Here, "monsters" are beings of awful beauty, while humans are falsely ugly creatures of self-indulgence. We quickly learn that we have been wrong since the beginning. By far my favorite performance of Craig Sheffer, often underused, and the extra bonus of David Cronenberg as "Decker" is a better seen then raw casting. The "monsters" are perfectly portrayed by a host of English creature masters, many of whom have also brought to life "Cenobites" in "Hellraiser", including "Pinhead" himself, Doug Bradley. "Nightbreed" is a must for all fans of the horror genre and for all those who just need a little more (something) of their horror story. It's Clive Barker at his best.
