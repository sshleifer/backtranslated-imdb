What is the problem with you people? John Dahl? From "Rounders" and "Unforgettable"? TOO bizarre? Hitting emma Thompson and Alan Rickman for having fun playing against guy? And someone loved the gingerbread man? <br /> <br /> I rented it without knowing anything about it and I found it with the best chance of finding a video. Never insulting, well thought out, funny, scary. I disagree with the opponents, clearly. I thought that the story itself was not remarkable, but the big cast, which probably means that the director was attentive, raised her to super cool status. Good sound design also (much more appreciated in surround sound, but I do not boast). And yes, I'm a girl, so there may be a slight feminine tendency (gang guys are worth it). Overall, a 9 and a hearty recommend.
