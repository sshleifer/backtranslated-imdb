I finally saw this on video, after years of hearing about it. It's certainly not a perfect movie, but it's strangely hypnotic - one of those rare specials that creates its own world. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS *** First, the bad things. The scenes in Burkewaite's class are atrocious. Even if it's social studies, this guy is really exaggerated. His speeches are so overwhelmed that they are laughable. And no teacher I ever had would grill their students this way and say to those who were protesting "Shut up!" These scenes are brief, but they break the mood and drag the viewer out of the story. Then how did Layne come out of the police station towards the end? Moreover, what happened to Samson's car after the first scene of his coming to town? He spends the rest of the movie being ravaged by Layne or Feck. *** FIN SPOILERS *** <br /> <br /> Ahhh, Feck ... this guy is awesome. Dennis Hopper steals the movie effortlessly. "The check is in the mail", "I like the company", "you are my friend" - every line is a classic. It gives Feck an internal logic that makes the story work. Incredibly, he makes the audience feel empathy for this guy, especially when Samson talks about his future. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, Crispin Glover is hard to take sometimes. Still, the scenes of her behavior in the Ladybug are perfect - kids who have a car in high school always have something to do and buddies with whom to do it. Matt's discreet attitude is a good failure for Layne - their friendship is credible. Glover's mannerisms are a bit much, but it is consistent throughout. He directs the plot and gives off a sense of urgency that no one else does - just try to imagine this movie if Layne was as zombie as Matt or Samson - snoozefest! <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS *** What makes "River's Edge" disturbing is the fact that Samson is not really perverse, in the usual sense. It's a boring guy who's tired of being taken for granted - in other words, he looks like thousands of other boring guys. After killing Jamie, he begins to undo, creating suspense as we wait to see when he returns. *** *** * *** <br /> <br /> Part of the attraction of this film lies in the way the action remains focused on teenagers and their point of view. The parents are comical - Clarissa's mother, Tony's father - or overwhelmed - Matt's mother. This highlights how children stand together for the attention that no one gives them. He maintains the story centered on relationships within the clique and points out that the only adult they can relate to is Feck. "River's Edge" is a manual on alienation. It shows how clumsy, mysterious and disconcerting adolescence is unlike any other film.
