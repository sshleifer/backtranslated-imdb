It's a really sad and touching movie! It deals with the issue of child abuse. It's really sad, but mostly a true story, because it's happening every day. Elijah Wood and Joseph Mazzello play the two children or Lorraine Bracco, a single mother who is just trying to build a home for them. While living with his parents, a man who likes to call himself "the king" is part of their life. He strikes the youngest boy, Bobby, but the two brothers swear to say nothing to their mother. But eventually, she finds out, after the Bobby is seriously injured. The end has somehow ruined me, because it's so amazing. But other than that, I love the movie.
