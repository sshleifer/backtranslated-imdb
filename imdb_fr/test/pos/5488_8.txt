Here's another action-thriller movie by Clint Eastwood. I'm not particularly fond of him, but I have to give him: he knows how to make fun movies. This is another example. John Malkovich did not hurt either. Now, there is an intense actor! In this story, Malkovich plays an assassin and he is fascinating to watch, thanks to his various disguises and the tremendous dialogue he has had. He also has an interesting voice. <br /> <br /> Rene Russo is rather discreet (for her), but it's good and Eastwood plays the usual role of solitary cop, not appreciated by his superiors but showing them all in place at the end. I guess he could not stop playing Dirty Harry characters, but he interpreted them well. <br /> <br /> There were however a few negatives in this movie, namely: credibility per part, it If it had been real life, the killer would have removed Eastwood. The climate scene, in particular, had too many holes. There was also too much abuse of the name of the Lord in vain here. <br /> <br /> Overall, however, it's good, the price of escape.
