This film is one of my favorite comedies of all time. The dialogue is clear, the pace is fast. It's not only a smart comedy, but also an interesting look at what's going on behind the scenes of TV news. <br /> <br /> There are so many funny lines ... some of my favorites: <Ernie Merriman: (sarcastic) It must be nice to always believe that we know better, to always think that one is the smartest person in the room. Jane: (seriously) NO, it does not matter, it's awful! <br /> <br /> Aaron: He must be handsome. Jane: How do you know that? Aaron: Nobody invites a bad-looking fool in their room! <br /> <br /> The performances of Holly Hunter, Albert Brooks and William Hurt were absolutely brilliant! Even years later, I remember that movie well. We often forget the wonderful funny Joan Cusack! I like the scene where newsroom staff struggle to meet a deadline. There are so many fun scenes that it's hard to pick a favorite. I highly recommend this movie.
