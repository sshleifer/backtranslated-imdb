In the late eighties and early nineties, the decline and demise of independent video companies such as Vestron and Media effectively cut Italian horror films to a large part of its audience American. Coincidentally (?), The quality and profitability of Italian genre films also fell. <br /> <br /> From time to time, films like Primal Rage, "suites" like Beyond The Door III, Troll 2 and some films by Dario Argento appeared limping but most of them remained unpublished (until to DVD) in the United States for nearly a decade or more. The films of those lost years have become highly sought after and discussed by horror fans. <br /> <br /> Among these films, Cat In The Brain is probably one of the most popular of all, due to the legions of fans of Lucio Fulci and the fact that Fulci himself staged it, but also featured their idol. <br /> <br /> Although it's not really the best of Fulci, it's still better than most of his later efforts. His enraged fan base will probably love him. Italian horror and giallo lovers could also enjoy it, depending on their tastes, but I'm sure of no one. People who only watch Hollywood movies may not want to believe the many rave reviews published here. <br /> <br /> One thing I personally found fascinating was the scenes staging probably the only lasting contribution of Benito Mussolini in Italy, Cinecitta Studios. The name is immediately recognizable by all fans of Italian films. Until I saw him here, I could only imagine what it looked like.
