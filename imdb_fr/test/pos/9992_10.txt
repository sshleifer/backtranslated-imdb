I will divide my criticism into 5 categories, each representing a maximum of 100% (if it is perfect) ________________________________________________________________ <br /> <br /> Visual pleasure: [100%] This film is extremely visually pleasing. I had a good time watching it. The golf scenes were very well shot and the dramatic effects on the putting green were quite amazing. I also loved seeing the old golf clubs and the bag. <br /> <br /> The director's work: [70%] Bill Paxton is more associated with acting, but this film shows that he has talent. Did a decent job. <br /> <br /> Actor: [90%] Shia LeBeouf was very good in his role as Francis Ouimet (this guy can ACT). The rest of the cast was also good. <br /> <br /> Entertainment Value: [100%] I enjoyed every minute. It was extremely entertaining. <br /> <br /> Scenario: [91%] This film is based on a true story and makes the film much more special. It was intriguing from the beginning and I loved every scene until the end. <br /> <br /> __________________________________________________________________ <br /> <br /> My advice: a watch not to be missed for all sports fans will love it). Anyone who is looking for a good entertaining movie and does not hate sports can watch it. <br /> <br /> _____ <br /> <br /> 10/10
