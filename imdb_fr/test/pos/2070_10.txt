1. I saw Branaghs Hamlet: Branagh is too old and often speaks with a shrill voice (reluctantly funny!) - not a convincing Hamlet, and his directorial qualities - mediocre! (See also a lot of noise for nothing from Branagh - the fun parts of the dialogues were cut for the most part, not to mention the directors' mistakes in the dialogue breaks!) - but such ugly actors - all 3. Orson Welles Hamlet is OK - but this BBC Hamlet is the best! Derec Jacobi is convincing - seems a little crazy - very appropriate! and Patric Stewart - wonderful, and Claire Bloom is a very attractive queen. You believe these actors what they say - I think it's the best compliment.
