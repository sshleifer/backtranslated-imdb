I saw "I feel the dead" - sorry, "I'm selling the dead" - during a press screening. Glenn McQuaid, scriptwriter-director-in-chief of the film, is an Irish-Irishman who presented the screening by announcing that, even though he was in class, he would "go out for a pint". I do not blame him for a drink, but - telling us about it - he seemed to need to certify his baseness or his irony, or both. When the opening credits were launched, there was - as usual during the screening in the press - big ovations of the name of each actor or member of the team having friends among the public and silence for those who did not have one. McQuaid then came back for a witty Q & A. <br /> <br /> This horror movie is not taken seriously, which is good because its humor is considerably stronger than its horror. One scene is even scary, and most of the "horror" is just rude, but I laughed for most of the movie. <br /> <br /> This film seems to unfold in Ireland around 1850 (by the time when the looting of the tomb was practically gone). The story is told in flashback: we have flashbacks in the flashbacks, as well as information about the flashbacks of the narrator who he could not know, because sometimes he was not present or (in one case) because the action takes place behind his back. The story begins with a prisoner taken to the guillotine. Guillotines were not used in Ireland in the 19th century, but for once we see a plausible sequence of guillotines. The prisoner fights to be executed, the crampons are precise and the prisoner is able to lift his eyes to see the blade above his head. (And there is a later gain to justify the historically inaccurate use of the guillotine itself.) <br /> <br /> The characters are ostensibly Irish, but a major character speaks Cockney slang: using expressions like "a mug game" and "take a butcher" (for 'look'). For once, actors in 19th century roles display 19th century dental hygiene, but almost all clothing and hairstyles (as well as women's makeup) are resolutely 21st century. I'm not complaining in the case of Heather Bullock, who wears a very attractive black cozzie that seems to be PVC. Phworr! <br /> <br /> The main actors (with the exception of Ron Perlman) are excellent, but most actors have no sense of the Victorian period. The worst offender is Joel Garland as a publican, whose characterization is firmly anchored in the 21st century. Just when I thought Garland's performance could not be less Victorian, he used his fingers to make "ironic" aerial citations. <br /> <br /> The sets (especially Angus Scrimm's lab) are detailed and impressive, yet impressive. failed to convince me that people lived and worked in these places. Almost every interior contains lighted candles, but I have never seen what it would have been if it were real Victorian houses or workplaces: leftover candles from previous candles. <br /> <br /> A scene presents an extra-terrestrial character: I McQuaid was annoyed by the fact that McQuaid opted for a stereotypical "gray" alien Schwa, rather than for something original. <br /> <br /> There are beautiful editing sequences, but McQuaid opts for flashy effects do not serve the story. I was impressed by a recurring blue screen feature superimposing the heads of the main characters to other backgrounds. Less effective was a recurring, "Creepshow" style pattern, of shots turning actors' faces into drawings resembling panel drawings of the horror comics of the 1950s CE. I am a fan of EC Comics, but they do not belong to 19th century Ireland. The money that McQuaid spent on flashy F / X photography - showing off her editing skills without serving history - should have been spent on specific costumes. <br /> <br /> BIG SPOILERS NOW. Ron Perlman gives an "Oirish" performance full of school actor tics. Apparently playing with an Irish priest of the nineteenth century, he writes with his left hand. (In Victorian Ireland, left-handed children were punished for using "the hand of the devil" and were converted by force to become right-handers.) But Perlman's character turns out to have a reason to hide his right hand. Elsewhere, a character is bitten by a zombie but suffers no ill effects, so I knew there would be a gain later. Several scenes that would occur more logically at night are taken in daylight, apparently only because it was easier and less expensive. (McQuaid being a talented director and editor, he could easily have turned "day for night" ... but using a process photography effect to help tell the story seems less interesting than showing his editing techniques flashy.) <br /> <br /> McQuaid seems to pay tribute to these great horror films from Hammer. But these hammers were really great because the actors and the designers of the production worked hard to convince us that we really attended the events of 1888 in Whitechapel, or elsewhere. 'I Sell the Dead' hardly evokes the 19th century. <br /> <br /> Glenn McQuaid demonstrates talent as a director, screenwriter and editor. However, in all three cases, it makes strange choices ... does not justify these choices. But I appreciated "I sell the dead". I will evaluate 7 out of 10, and can not wait to see his next movie.
