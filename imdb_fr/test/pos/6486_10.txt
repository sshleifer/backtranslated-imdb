Of all the major actresses of the 30s, Miriam Hopkins was the most strangely neglected and underrated. Her series of great movies from the '30s and' 40s is quite impressive, but she is often described as shaky or brittle. Still, she had a great sense of humor and was memorable in several comedies, including Old Acquaintance (with Bette Davis) and The Smiling Lieutenant (with Maurice Chevalier and Claudette Colbert). Hopkins was famous for his dislike of Hollywood and the result was a bad name - undeserved. <br /> <br /> In Wise Girl, she plays an heiress trying to save the children of her dead sister from their guardian - sister-in-law Ray Milland. The film features several hilarious scenes such as Hopkins taking a bath in a storeroom, Hopkins joining Milland and Guinn Williams at a $ 3 Greenwich Village restaurant to play the role of "gypsies", and Hopkins fighting near the ring at a fight between Williams. Milland is also excellent and very entertaining. <br /> <br /> Hopkins and Milland are a beautiful couple. The film also enjoys strong support from Williams, Walter Abel, Henry Stephenson, James Finlayson, Margaret Dumont, Grace Hayle, Leonid Kinskey and Inez Palange. Both girls are fine. <br /> <br /> But Hopkins, drunk on a "slice of wine" and wearing a dress pinned twice her size is hilarious, because she gets her hair cut while smoking .... A scream.
