I saw the film at the Hollywood Film Festival in October 2004. Mark Robertson took a huge chance writing an extremely difficult role for his first film and it paid off in his casting of Kelly Overton. I had the feeling that she came from the theater, so I looked at her here and ... surprise, I'm right. More and more Hollywood actors should follow his example, abandon expensive theater classes and return to the theater, because only with this type of training will you be prepared for such an adventure. Despite all I can say good about the film and the director (and there are many), I can not help but talk to people about Kelly Overton's brilliant performance. We will see MUCH MORE of his work, no doubt. <br /> <br /> Congratulations to Mark and Kelly for a daring film. Take it out to the theaters so that all the people I've created want to see the movie as soon as possible!
