Mas Oyama was the greatest karate master of the late 20th century. He rejected the "training" of karate clubs of the time, focusing on intense "no hold" training. He finally built his system in a huge business empire with hundreds of schools around the world, without compromising his teachings. Kyokushin's school tests are still among the most challenging tests for all martial arts schools. A non-physical difficulty that Oyama faced was prejudices due to his Korean ancestry and he spent time proving his loyalty to Japan and Japanese karate. This film series was part of this effort, even if anyone who had the chance to meet Oyama (me too) would never question his allegiance to Japan. In this series, Sonny Chiba, the most famous pupil of Oyama, is called to represent his master. <br /> <br /> Oyama comes from the countryside where he trained alone. He challenges and works quickly on the established karate schools he meets. Disgusted by the state of karate, Oyama resumes his training alone. He ends up looking for a student, falls in love with him and hinders gangsters allied with established karate schools. In the middle is the legendary bullfight with a mad bull. It is doubtful that the film is true. <br /> <br /> It is true that Oyama can kill a bull with his bare hands. He has been called to repeat this feat many times. There are filmed cases of Oyama doing this, although sometimes the bulls seemed to be tied up while Oyama had been moving for years. Sonny Chiba portrays his master with conviction and karate is pretty good. Chiba may not have been the best karate rider, but at this point he was certainly above average. <br /> <br /> Overall, the film is good, much better than most martial arts movies from the theater department. I always wondered why it was not better known. Perhaps the very realistic representations of the martial arts. People are shown that they are tired and injured, unlike 99% of action movies where the hero is a boundless source of energy and where every shot instantly sends an opponent to death. Chiba seems so exhausted at one point that it hurts to watch. Maybe viewers prefer that their entertainment does not reflect reality so closely. <br /> <br /> Recommended especially for martial artists.
