.. especially by Lambert. This is the essence of the Burrough Tarzan that I grew up reading as a child. I read some negative reviews on this movie and I could not help but wonder what their problem was. They obviously did not see the movie I watched or expected something more like the Saturday afternoon soap operas. <br /> <br /> This was the novel's Tarzan and the filmmakers should be applauded tackling the source material and taking it seriously. Lambert was excellent. I still think he's one of Hollywood's most underrated actors. It's a film in which he shines. <br /> <br /> Photography and monkeys, made by Rick Baker, were extraordinary. You have certainly felt it since the jungle. The second half of the series, Tarzan's attempt at civilization, really takes you into the emotional conflict he was forced to solve. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie
