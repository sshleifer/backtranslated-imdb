It's a strange and convincing film. The subject, which concerns the atomic bombs created in Los Alamos (New Mexico) in the United States and used in Japan during the latter part of the Second World War, is vast and, of course, deeply troubling. The plot of the film poses many problems and the actors have to bear a large part of the creative tension. I had never seen the film before or read it before reading "Smoking in Bed: Conversations with Bruce Robinson". Robinson wrote the story and the script. I think the movie was better than I expected by reading Robinson's point of view in the conversations about it, but I can see how he thought he was derailed. I think Paul Newman is very good, but is basically misunderstood. He is too Hollywood. At one point, a big bad guy broke into Newman's office and has such a striking presence that I immediately thought he should play the character Newman plays. The other leader, who plays the main scientist, is also good enough, but somehow not brilliant enough to describe the tremendous anguish that accompanies the role - the immense responsibility of creating a ultimate machine of death and destruction. One of the most effective characters seems to be a composite personality, played by John Cusack. It strangely affects all along, and in the end, the character whose destiny really strikes the house and made me think more vividly of the fate of more than 200,000 Japanese in Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
