When I bought this movie for the first time, I had some doubts about it, even though the cast was rather impressive. But after seeing it, I really do not regret having spent this money. In fact, I would love to spend it again and again in movies like this ... An absurd combination of humor, drama, thrills and big questions. That's exactly what makes it an excellent movie. Okay, some might not appreciate what they see, and some might even turn it off after a while. your loss. It's a great way to deal with the problems we've all had in one way or another, and the characters you think you do not like the company throughout the movie turn out to be the ones you meet. really love after a short time. For all those who have an open mind, a sense of humor and who live - watch this movie, I promise you that you will not be disappointed!
