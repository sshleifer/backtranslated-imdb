After finally getting the DVD of this 1997 HBO movie, you have to watch it. By the time I finished it, the old adage "those who can not learn from the past are condemned to relive it" resonated in the mind. Introduced for the first time four years after the first bombing of the twin towers (and four years before the events of September 11th), Path To Paradise reveals the series of close encounters, gaffes and official decisions that led to the first bombing of the Twin Towers . and the lessons we should have learned from them. <br /> <br /> Path to Paradise presents a good cast of credible actors. Peter Gallagher and Marcia Gay Harden lead the actors, FBI agents John Anticev and Nancy Floyd, who face not only the threats of terrorism but the official lack of interest from their superiors as well as their NYPD counterpart Lou Napoli (Paul Guilfoyle). Art Malik, Andreas Katsulas, Shaun Toub and Tony Gillan are among the planners and perpetrators of the attack, all of whom play their role not as potential clich√©s, but as real people who make the film even better. Special mention is Ned Eisenberg as Emad Salem, a man who, if he had not been skeptical of FBI officials, could have been informed of the plot. <br /> <br /> The film is also well produced. Although designed for cable, this film does not look like a low-budget movie with its production values, especially in its set and locations in New York. The fascinating cinematography of the film sometimes gives the film an almost documentary style. When all these elements are combined with the scenario, it helps to give the film a sense of reality that makes the events even more disturbing. <br /> <br /> The most disturbing aspect of this film is its scenario. The film's events are true (minus a dramatic license that is still needed) and are in retrospect made even more shocking than they were when the film was shown for the first time twelve years ago. The film reveals how a group of men managed to smuggle a bomb into the World Trade Center. They did so because of the lack of Arabic translators, the inability of government agencies to pass on information, ignorance of FBI sources, and the inability of the police to collect clues. Worse still, the inability of investigators to connect the points is the fact that many of these things have not only allowed the attacks of 9.11 but also, in some cases (such as the lack of translators), problems still arise. These days. The end that really happened is even more frightening and seems very prophetic today. <br /> <br /> Path To Paradise is a movie that should be essential to watching today. The film is not only well played and produced, but teaches us a lesson that we should have learned earlier. The lesson of the film? May those who can not learn from the past be condemned to relive it. If you can find this movie, watch it and learn it.
