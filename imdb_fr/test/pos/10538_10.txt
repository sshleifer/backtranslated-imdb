The comments of the previous user are really severe. We wonder even if they have already seen this beautiful film. As for being so mean about it in front of the writer / director ... well, it's just rude! For those who grew up in the eighties, it is an artistic nostalgia and a beautiful story well played and well produced. The Irish film production makes a lot of angry and bitter people part of it, and the commentary on the spleen is proof of that. As people, we have the choice; give up and moan about people who go there and make things or make something yourself .. I know which is the easiest ... Do yourself a favor and watch this movie and see how a short film is made. .. you will not be disappointed
