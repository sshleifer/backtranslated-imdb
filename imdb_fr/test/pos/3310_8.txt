It is interesting to see how the society of the 1950s is described in this film. Men are lecherous and smoke with only one idea in their head (time has not changed men so much, but "sexual harassment" has done it) and women are only in the workplace that they find a husband and settle down. Some dialogues are crazy, but they are charming in an innocent and outdated way. I like the opening credits that show a romantic and exciting view of Manhattan with Johnny Mathis singing "The Best Of Everything" on the soundtrack. I want to jump straight into some scenes, filmed in the streets of New York, about 1959, and live an era that I only saw on film and on photos. Some scenes from this film remind me of Melanie Griffith's "Working Girl". Especially when Hope Lange (who is a cross between Grace Kelly and Dolores Hart) gets bombed in handsome Stephen Boyd's apartment, he holds her and watches her sleep (like Melanie, she wants to know if "something" happened passed between them the next day). Joan Crawford is certainly comparable to the ugly female leader of Sigourney Weaver, except that she was outwardly naughty (with a soft core), but Sigourney's character was soft on the outside and horrible on the inside. I found it shocking to see how the character of Suzy Parker (Gregg) debuted as an independent woman with career goals, being an actress, who would not supposedly need a man to complete it. She becomes naughty / crazy when she lets the man with whom she falls in love drive her bananas after finishing with her. I loved the character of Mary Agnes, the office gossip, with her thick New Yawk accent. If you like movies like "Valley Of The Dolls", you'll also like this one.
