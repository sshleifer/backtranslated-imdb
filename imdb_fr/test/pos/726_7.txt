What can I say? Not as bad as many here have done. The only reason I even watched this movie I had never heard of before was strictly for IAN McSHANE. <br /> <br /> I was not disappointed at all. IAN McSHANE has been absolutely brilliant and brings an incredible subtlety to her role. He is always good to watch and for my money ... an extremely underused actor. <br /> <br /> Regarding the rest of the film .... All the other actors in the film delivered strong and solid performances. These people certainly did not receive huge sums of money for their participation (it was a low-budget film), but that did not mean that none of them "published" their appearances. Everyone was convincing and convincing with the given roles I was even pleasantly surprised by the performance of ADRIAN PAUL, although I must admit that I had never seen it before in the HIGHLANDER television series before this film. <br /> The plot was well paced and the storyline intriguing and a little like in real life, all does not end up ending up in a nice little package tidy for you at the end of the film. All those who expect the numbers to be clear and precise, connect the points "conclusion" or "answer" at the end of the film ... CLEARLY, did not look at the film too closely! This film will not tell you what the "meaning of life" is! The idea is that after seeing the movie, you could go and talk to your friends about unresolved issues over coffee. I certainly did it. <br /> <br /> No pursuit by car ... No explosions ... No fight in a bar .... (it sounds rather dull, huh?) But the reality is that I has been completely absorbed by the film and it's just a well-written little piece with an interesting hook and solid character performances by all involved parties. <br /> <br /> ****** ATTENTION ... ****** If you are the kind of person who does not like movies that pose a huge "question" as the central engine of history, then who finishes the film without directly answering this particular question ... <br /> <br /> YOU CAN NOT ENJOY THIS FILM.
