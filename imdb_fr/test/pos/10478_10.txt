If this is not the best movie of all time, "Babette's Feast" is certainly one of the most loving. It's a wonderful exploration of the meaning of art, generosity, loyalty and grace. Humor mingles with a tender desire; the characters are treated with honesty, but also with deep respect. There are meditations on memory, destiny, old age and fidelity. Magnificent photographic work by cinematographer Henning Kristiansen: wrinkled faces have rarely been so bright by candlelight. The meal is accompanied by delicious period music, Brahms, Mozart and simple folk hymns. Enjoy this feast for the eyes and the spirit, because as the general says: "Mercy and truth have met, and justice and happiness embrace each other".
