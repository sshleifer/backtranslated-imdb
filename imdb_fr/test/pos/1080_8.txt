I saw this film at the Toronto International Film Festival in 2004. Since working in the wine industry, I was eager to see this documentary and I was not disappointed. The good news, which would have been drawn from more than 500 hours of film, is that Nossiter will release not only a theatrical version, but also a series of ten parts of the film on DVD by next Christmas (ThinkFilm distributes it). The bad news is that it's still a bit difficult to handle. When it was shown in Cannes, it lasted nearly three hours. For Toronto, he lost about half an hour, but he still recorded 135 minutes. Now, for me, it's okay. I love wine and I like hearing about the controversies raging in my business. <br /> <br /> Nossiter travels the world, from Brazil to France via California, Italy, Argentina and speaks to winegrowers and public relations as well as consultants and critics from state of the wine world. . The theme that emerges is that globalization and the undue influence of the critic on the Robert Parker wine force a kind of similarity on the wine. Smaller local producers are either bought by bigger conglomerates (American or local), or under market pressure to change their wines according to Mr. Parker's palate, which dictates taste to most US and global consumers . ) markets. <br /> <br /> It's a complicated subject, and I understand why Nossiter wants to let his subjects talk. There is Robert Mondavi, patriarch of the Napa wine industry, and his sons Tim and Michael, whose efforts to buy land in Languedoc have faced opposition from local winemakers and government officials. There is Aim√© Guibert, founder and winemaker of Daumas Gassac, iconoclast opponent of Mondavi's projects and defender of wines that express local terror. There is Robert Parker himself, expressing discomfort with his influence while refusing to stop writing about the wines he favors. Michel Rolland, "maker of wine in flight," a consultant for dozens of wineries around the world, told them how to make Parker-friendly wines. This documentary includes many other fascinating personalities. <br /> <br /> If you are a wine lover, you'll want to search the series in ten episodes as well as the theatrical version of this film. But even if you're not a wine lover, the film is an interesting look at how the forces of globalization are changing many of the world's oldest and most established traditions. The effects on local crops and economies can not be ignored. <br /> <br /> (8/10)
