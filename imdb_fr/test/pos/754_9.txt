If anyone ever gathers a compendium on modern American horror that is really worth salting, there will have to be * an entry for SF Brownrigg's ubiquitous exercise in Asylum Horror. Whenever I watch this film, I am impressed by the whole economics of the film, from the compact and completely self-contained intrigue to the startling and ultimately horrific end to the engaging performances of what was essentially a group of unprofessional . actors, and a feeling of terror and claustrophobia that engulfs the story effectively with a certain inevitability that is all the more terrifying as viewers know what is happening well before the hero [Spanish], the only question being when will they wake up and smell the coffee? <br /> <br /> Shot on a dental floss budget in Brownrigg's native Texas in a former palace mansion that nicely serves as a backdrop for a private sanatorium, do not look in the basement Another intriguing twist on the good old Edgar Allan Poe on the fate of the inmates taking charge of the asylum just before an otherwise "normal" stranger involuntarily joins the ranks without realizing that it is too late that everything does not seem, they are totally cut off and beyond any outside help, and inevitably find their mental health questioned while madness unleashes. The original TV series STAR TREK tried this with his 1968 episode WHOM GODS DESTROY, Juan Moctezuma During the proceedings, a psychedelic Mexican trip powered by peyote in the Dominican Republic. The TARR'S TORTURE DUNGEON dungeon in 1972 and tangibly related is the ASYLUM EROTICA / SLAUGHTER HOTEL of Fernando Di Leo, which injects the elements of an unknown killer and an end that can only be defined by "Splatter Cinema" - Brownrigg may not have seen or thought of SLAUGHTER HOTEL, but he has surely come up with similar ideas. <br /> <br /> Rosie Holotik, Playboy Playboy Playboy Playboy, plays Charlotte Beale, Clinical Psychology Nurse, who has just left her good job as a Supervisor A hospital will move from a Peckinpa movie to the middle of an abandoned god and will work with a doctor Stevens in his private sanitorium. Dr. Stevens has developed a new form of therapy that is based on the emotional and psychological encouragement of people who are relinquished to face their inner obsessions, to bring them to the surface and, hopefully, to rid patients of all that is who has come close to their sense of reasoning. Nice idea, but arm a crazy man with an ax and tell him to fight his aggression AND THEN SHOT THE BACK OF IT is probably not the smartest idea, and Dr. Stevens is sent even before Mrs. Holotik not appear on the screen, with a good punch in the lower part of his skull. <br /> <br /> This event leaves the sanatorium in the hands of one of the Geraldine Masters [actress Annabelle Weenick, who also served as script supervisor and head of production], a female director. a surprisingly professional behavior that quickly defuses the situation with the help of Sam, the wonderfully improbable hero of the film, a lobotomized African-American bohemian played by an actor named Bill McGhee, who unfortunately was deprived of his Oscar nomination for his role in an Oscar. Muscle mass with the brain of an 8 year old boy. Sam's wish is to ask someone to help him put his precious toy boat "in the water", and to constantly ask the members of the female cast to do so [as well as his constant consumption of lollipops chocolate ices] as * SOME types of underlying theme, although we will avoid this here because the children might still be standing. There is also a quick subplot about a staff member who has decided to leave after being threatened by one of the patients, but I will leave the details to your discovery. <br /> <br /> Mrs. Holotik arrives when Dr. Stevens is truly at rest and seduced by Ms. Masters' keen professionalism, which reluctantly allows the young leg nurse to stay despite the tragedy that comes from happen, oh, TWENTY minutes ago, and you have to admit it, wore it rather. Beale nurse from Holotik begins to show symptoms of not being the smartest meat chopper in the drawer. However, when she is informed that she shares her quarters with a group of maniacs, the doors are not locked and do not drag for the nearest ace. Hardware for taking a corpse and a padlock for protection, and we're witnessing some really terrifying scenes in which some of the inmates sneak into her room and do things like smelling her hair, trying to kill her with butcher knives and caress his neck with ax heads. But Ms. Master informs her that she works in a psychiatric care environment as radical as this one and that she describes her strangely defined "tricks," which involve wearing a nurse's definition that you can find in a 42nd street. fetish shop and get to know the inmates. <br /> <br /> Allysson is an obsessive compulsive nymphomaniac with homicidal tendencies who likes to take off her shirt and give the film a bit of T & A between two horror crises; Harriet is a young, old mother who has let her child die in a stupid accident and loves an old bastard doll, which she is also a homicidal protector. The Seargant is a seargeant [and involves] a veterinarian who, by his negligence, has caused the death of his platoon and now watches through the window with binoculars the approach of an invisible enemy; Jennifer is a fan of Phish who did not manage to win a ticket for the New Year's show and went crazy. She likes to search the nembutols and other barbitu√©s when nobody looks at them. She also concealed homicidal tendencies related to her inability to find a bra; Judge Cameron is apparently a murderous pervert who has become obsessed with his own sense of power and now likes to cut things with axes; Mrs. Callingham is an elderly poet who acts as a kind of old MACBETH witch before the cat gets her tongue. and Danny is a foolish idiot who was included in the cast as a random element that the plot can not control, and his antics are the real catalyst of the series of tragedies and murders that ultimately took place in this dark and old scary house in the middle of nowhere. <br /> <br /> The house itself is a beautiful ensemble, with a decadent decor from the early 1970s that is remarkable for its beauty, with a fantastic use of color achieved through subtle ambient lighting. The house is a series of corridors and rooms with bright brown wooden floors, narrow and twisted stairs, closets and secret passageways that lead to different larger areas, and of course the basement mentioned in the title - Visited once, but it sure turns out to be a doozy! I love the old frosted freezer where Sam keeps his reserve of ice lollies, the quite simple exteriors that remind me of a summer house that our family used to visit every year and force us to warm up in the heat : Everyone is covered with sweat beads and exhausted looks, and even Sam, always happy, begins to suspect that bad things are happening, though he does not understand what all this means and that Rosie H. is too firm in her belief of her profession to suspect what really happened, and even though Ms. Holotik's actress limitations may have diminished the effectiveness of her Big Revelation scene, she's a big crier when the hell starts to break loose and Brownrigg indulged in pretty shots of her in suggestive poses or at different stages of undressing show what a pretty woman she is without revealing any more q what his contract stipulates. Pity! <br /> <br /> The real thief of shows is Sam, however, and fans of what I've been taught to call Splatter Cinema will not be disappointed by the pretty shocking finale, and there's some thing that moves about how Sam runs to protect his friend and brutally kills everyone at hand within seconds, suggesting either that he was a bad motha before his lobotomy, or that the film is CUT . In any case, you will not be ready for the end the first time you see it, even if you know, as a spectator, what is the score of the film well before anyone in the film brings it together. > With the exception of one person: Rhea MacAdams' old-fashioned, rude stereotype, Ms. Callingham [who appears to be inspired by Donald Sutherland's Old Woman from Michael Reeves's 1964 film, Christopher Lee, CASTLE OF THE LIVING DEAD, in addition to a rather nasty character. death by swirling in the eye], which not only predicts the future, but also the most entertaining dialogue of the film, during a walk in the garden with Mrs. Holotik, where something like this takes place - > <br /> "It's really beautiful here, do you go out a lot, Mrs. Callingham?" asks Holotik, to which the old woman replies <br /> <br /> "IT'S YOU who must go out." <br /> <br /> Hilarious, and one of those things you must see for yourself "get". DO NOT WATCH IN THE BASEMENT is available on at least half a dozen "promo code" DVDs from companies like Brentwood Home Video, Diamond Entertainment, VCI and Platinum Disc Corp.'s HORROR CLASSICS series. I love the sexually beautifully decorated version of Alpha Video at $ 6 launched in 2003: <br /> <br /> Dig in these bins at bargains! But be sure to get one with the 89/90 minute impression that it contains; an older version of 83 minutes is downright confusing because of some trimmings, and you really have to see the end credits as planned to bring this sick, twisted and surprisingly fun thread to an end. <br /> <br /> Masterpiece? Maybe not compared to THE EXORCIST or ROSEMARY'S BABY, but it's a very American horror movie, and a real classic of the drive-in age that deserves to be rediscovered by those looking for something done with more than just a brain. juice, and not a penny more than they absolutely needed. <br /> <br /> *** 1/2 on ****
