I first saw "Night of the Demons 2" before "Night of the Demons". Unfortunately, my old Blockbuster thought it was a good idea to have the following, but not the first. Looney, huh? Now, I think all horror fans need this movie. It's like McDonald's, you know it's bad for you and you prefer to have the Cheesecake Facotory (or the more expensive restaurant you prefer), but you can not help but just want the cheap things. <br /> <br /> Demon Night has everything: your innocent, sexy, respect the chicka-dee rules, your symbolic black guy, who surprisingly does not get killed. You're a slutty girl, you're a slutty guy, a black girl or boy, the disgusting ball, the cheesy decorations of a haunted house, the acting game and a lot of useless nudity. Is not it great? I mean, I know deep in my heart that it was very bad, but it was good for horror movies. Horror fans should enjoy it and dig! <br /> <br /> 8/10
