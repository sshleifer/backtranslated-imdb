this film is extremely funny and enjoyable, with appropriate, funny and experienced casts. I find this film enjoyable not only by the elements of humor but also by the music of different scenes. Kevin Kline, a good comedian, did a great job in many parts of the film with Tom Selleck, who is incredibly different from many of his other films. The humor in this film is clumsy, which causes various exaggerations in many scenes, especially debut. Joan Cusack is also remarkably funny and exaggerated; and the same goes for all other casts. This movie contains many elements of awkward humor and is nice if you want to laugh.
