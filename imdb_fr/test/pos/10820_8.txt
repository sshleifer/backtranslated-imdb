I think the costumes were excellent and the hairdressers also performed well. He feels very authentic for this period. <br /> <br /> I do not know if it was the magic of the computer or if it was real. Some of the big scenes have hundreds of extras in the background. I was particularly impressed by the scene of this bridge. <br /> <br /> the main character that the actress has also interpreted well, she showed us a nervous and witty woman who knows how to take in hand to seduce men and get what she wants . <br /> <br /> some scenes were hilarious. Although it was about 2 hours, but it was never boring. a very good entertaining film.
