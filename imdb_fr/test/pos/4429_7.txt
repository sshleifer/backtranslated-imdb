I think the title of the film describes it well. if you are looking for a documentary about louis kahn and his work, look elsewhere. Even if part of it is covered in this movie. <br /> <br /> Of course, I eat just about everything I eat, and I do not know much about the story of the family that has turned around this business. So I thought what I had been told about Nathaniel and his father, and so on. <br /> <br /> For what this movie was, I thought it was pretty good. a little slow and taking time, i wish nathaniel had focused a little more on his father's work than on the family drama (although a large part of the story is interesting, louis was a little a player). <br /> <br /> It's really a journey through someone's life, and I was happy to share that experience. a learning experience for me, and so, it seems, also for the filmmaker. <br /> <br /> oh, and the footage of some of kahn's work is * gorgeous *
