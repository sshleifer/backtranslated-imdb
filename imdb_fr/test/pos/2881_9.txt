The dramatization of Oscar Wilde's unique novel by playwright John Osborne (Look Back in Anger, The Entertainer) positively reveals the homosexual subtext of the original, perhaps too much. Nevertheless, the dialogue, the acting, with a cast led by Sir John Gielgud & Jeremy Brett, and the brilliant brain production (spoiled only by a "too fast" end) make the value of any theater lover, with a capital "T".
