Awesome just great! The west coast has "Dirty" Harry Callahan, the east coast at Sharky. Burt Reynolds plays Sharky in "Sharky's Machine" and I enjoyed every minute of it. Playing a maverick anti-drug officer in Atlanta, Georgia, is exactly what everyone wants. Instead of a suspension, he is sent to the vice squad. Like in Dirty Harry movies or any other crime movie, the captain will always be the idiot. When I was a child, I was curious to know what this movie meant "Sharky's Machine". Well, I knew who was playing Sharky, I wonder what his machine was. It was his group of police comrades. After discovering the murder, he goes out of his way to find the culprit. When it comes to a big boss, Sharky does not play. When he puts the other prostitute safe, Sharky defends himself hard and well despite the loss of a finger by the thug. And I also like the part where the bad fate of the building through a glass window. It was the BOMB! Randy Crawford's "Street Life" really put the film in the right mood, and the movie itself is really a big hit for me, ALWAYS! Rating 4 out of 5 stars.
