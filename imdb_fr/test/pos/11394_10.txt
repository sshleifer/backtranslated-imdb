The approach is what needs to change in the current attitude towards movies like Boogie Nights. The approach is awful! Comparing it to Pulp Fiction, seeing only pornography and all its aspects ... go there people, there is more than that in this beautiful film. And for all the skeptics, did not Paul Thomas Anderson prove himself over and over again? Magnolia is one of the main reasons I watch American films and continues to believe in this "industry" that is today cinema. And what about There Will Be Blood? It's a film that will remain in the history of cinema, whether we like it or not! Yes you! The so-called consumer .. you know something: F # * k you! you do not deserve that, you deserve nothing. Today, many artists are struggling to make themselves known and it has become increasingly difficult to make serious movies, even mainstream, because people just want celebrities to do stupid things ... like this star of Britney. <br /> <br /> Anyway. it's very painful for me to say that because I do not want to see that, I do not want to believe that today, all that matters is to add the numbers .. the number of business and the return of sales .. I want to see the magic, the magic that Fellini, Bergman and Kurosawa have brought and created through the language of cinema .. Because that's what PTA does ... it creates Magic !!
