A documentary about a nomadic Tibetan tribe going to a dry lake for salt does not seem very appealing. But it's not a popcorn movie, but a visual cultural feast where you take part in a piece of humanity that is disappearing. Superstitions, epic songs and poetry, the faith of a people who sincerely believe in following their own patterns of life are something that the West had at the time of Homer, but which, unfortunately, is totally foreign to most of the "developed world." We have lost the spiritual serenity that results from following well-established lifestyles, often with disastrous mental consequences in our increasingly soulless society. mixed with the fabric of these materially poor but spiritually rich and disjointed salt men, and made us see that there was more to life than the mall and pop culture, so disconnect your land lines, turn off your cells, turn off the lights of the driveway, sit back and let yourself be immersed in a timeless adventure.
