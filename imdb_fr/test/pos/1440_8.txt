Since the crash of the opening theme, "The Man with the Golden Arm" is a classic entertainment of the 1950s. No subtlety here, Frank returns from prison with a monkey on his back and returns to the old neighborhood where are still the old fools. This is a story of his dark adventure with all his emotional baggage intact. The performances are a bit too ripe, but that's part of the pleasure of watching. Darren McGavin and Arnold Stang are unforgettable and almost steal the show. This and "The Manchu Candidate" are the two greatest films of Chairman of the Board, IMHO. Do not miss one of them.
