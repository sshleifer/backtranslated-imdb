Yeah great cult TV series. The good atmosphere, the high-tech scenario and the good performances make it a class A candidate for DVD release. <br /> <br /> This is a decisive tour de force in the history of Australian television and this unforgettable soundtrack punctuated with the voice of grag and phlegm of Doug Parkinson vomiting the Australiana of 70s in your CRT box like an incredibly long camera. zooming out reveals the religion of the open road in all its glory of the antipodes. This is a memory of another era, not too distant, and carries the pride of the country, Down Under, from beginning to end, in all its raw freedom and grandeur. <br /> <br /> Go ABC! Launch the program and publish this cult baby of the 70s to the delight of all - or re-have fun if you have the chance to have lived the dream of the time.
