It's a masterpiece. 'The Big Snit' is a crazy, strange, hilarious and ultimately moving look on an old married couple and his quiet life, who are fighting for sawing and scrabble as a nuclear war rages on the outside. Everything about this big animation short film is memorable: the trembling eye of the woman, the aspiration frenzy, the fetishism of the wife (watch these backgrounds!), The very verbal cat, the televised game show , the informative news anchorman, the "beautiful" accordion serenade and the end touching and memorable. I am so happy to have found 'The Big Snit', one of the greatest film works ever produced.
