I watched the first moments on TCM a few years ago, but stopped after about 15 minutes. I saw her scheduled on the Stanford Theater in Palo Alto and I promised myself a 40-minute drive. The Stanford is an old movie house that starts every movie with the curtains still closed Yes, they have curtains. They opened when the Fox logo fanfare started playing. When "The best of all" appeared in huge pink letters scattered across the skyline of New York City, I knew I was right to wait. <br /> <br /> I missed this movie. There were so many little moments that added to the film's appearance: When Hope Lange enters the publishing house for the first time, the titles of the magazines that are published are engraved on the glass (The Teenager and Elegance); Joan Crawford's crested apron she wore so she could serve her guests at her party without undoing her outfit; the way the camera rocked to indicate how crazy Suzy Parker was going to be (she was almost sidelined at one point); how Hope Lange continued to live in this shabby apartment she shared with others, even though she obviously earned a lot more money than at the beginning of the movie (guess it was too scandalous for a single girl to live alone ). <br /> <br /> Hope Lange was so beautiful; Suzy Parker too. And what about Mark Goddard in a non-speaking role. I fell in love with him when I was a child and watched Lost in Space. <br /> <br /> Seeing this gem on the big screen made me plan a new trip to Stanford to see The Old Dark House. Incidentally, I bought a small soda and popcorn at the concession kiosk and was taken aback when the worker asked me for two dollars.
