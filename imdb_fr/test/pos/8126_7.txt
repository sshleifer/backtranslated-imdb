This film was a nice surprise because I did not expect much. I did not know that some actors have since become more important stars in major tournaments. Although switching to the matrix is ​​not an advantage in my book (I hated it), I'm sure it's a career advantage for Hugo. James Purefoy is excellent in this field and Jennifer Ehle sweet and wonderful. It sometimes looked like a Carnaby street party, 30 years later, but I appreciated the second-hand shop that Janis Joplin's clothes mingled with the modern spirit of sexual and sexual blur. The real estate agent who has an erotic relationship with his ads is very entertaining. The meetings of the group of men Iron John are a little old fashioned but I still loved them. It's a social satire comedy in the best way that reminds me a bit of the old movies "Carry On". The British know how to do sex comedy and it's an old tradition, unlike the United States who are too prude to really understand that sex is funny.
