I love horror movies. However, I'm not usually a big fan of movies "so stupid it's funny". I had to evaluate this very simply because Death Bed: the bed that eats, is so unique and so original. there are a lot of question marks, a lot of holes in the plot, and the WTF factor is pushed to 11, but I was not really bored for a second. I really could not call it scary at all times. Every minute, I said to myself, "What will this bed / movie do next!" I watched this with a friend who is by no means a fan of horror movies or movies, and even she was pretty in this movie. the effects were really very inventive and the colors and atmosphere were pretty good. it keeps a very uniform and uniform tone throughout the film (even if it is incredibly ridiculous) and the acting was not terrible. I can see on the point that there are some inconsistencies in the actions of the bed that make suspension of belief almost impossible, but the film itself was such a unique and bizarre concept that this fact does not really disturbs. seriously, for me, this film has touched the realm of the one I will never forget, but I guarantee that I will find myself thinking about certain scenes in the future. Does anyone else know other films like inanimate objects that eat people? totally fantastic.
