Darr is a great movie! Shahrukh plays an obsessed lover who will do almost anything to defeat his lady who is in this case Juhi Chawla. Juhi does not know much in the movie that Shahrukh has a major crush on her and stalking her constantly. I must admit that some of the things he did in this movie were rather scary ... like threatening phone calls. Never in my life will I forget the phrase: "I love you K..k..k..Kiran!" <br /> <br /> It's a shame that Shahrukh and Juhi are not exactly "together" in the movie. But Juhi and Sunny make a pretty good couple in the movie. Although Shahrukh's role is quite psychotic, I still think he played it very well and it's impossible to imagine anyone else doing it. No wonder he received an award for Darr in 94 '! <br /> <br /> Juhi ... what can I say ??? She looks particularly amazing in this movie! It's not that she does not always look great in her other films, but Darr gave the audience a wonderful picture of her! <br /> <br /> Regarding the music ... it was excellent! Especially "Jaadu Teri Nazar", one of my favorite songs of all time. I also thought that "you mother Samne" was very nice too. <br /> <br /> A must for everyone! Overall, Darr deserves a 9/10!
