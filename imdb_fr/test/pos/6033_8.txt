As far as history is concerned, it's not a Columbo film of the highest quality, but the film is extremely well done, with an excellent staging and a really refined game. <br /> <br /> The action in this film draws particular attention. Director Nicholas Colasanto did a great job with the actors of the film. Apparently, he left Peter Falk and John Cassavetes plenty of room to play, also since they are both credited here as uncredited directors of this film. He has to be part of his leadership style to give actors as much room. It works extremely well for this movie. Maybe he did that because Colasanto himself was also working as an actor. He is perhaps best known for having played the coaching role in the hit series "Cheers", from the beginning of the series in 1982 to his death in 1985. <br /> <br /> Peter Falk seems better than ever in his role as Lieutenant Columbo. Veteran actor John Cassavetes is also doing a great job as his assassin's movie and is a good match for the lieutenant. Beside them, the film also presents Myrna Loy. A great star of the silent film era and also Pat Morita, in a small beginning role. <br /> <br /> But making actors in the film is not just a good thing. Visually and technically, it is also a very good film, with slow and long shots, without cut. Also, obviously, the reason why this movie is longer than most Columbo movies. It really takes his time to put things in place and tell his story. The film also offers some beautiful types of artistic and experimental shots. Of course, everything really fits for the 70's. <br /> <br /> But as I said before, the story is not one of the best Columbo movies. In addition, the clues left to the lieutenant are a little too obvious this time. This makes the killer a bit silly, as if he did not find his plan good enough, while the character is obviously a smart man. Columbo is this time trying to irritate the suspect and the other characters he does not usually try to solve the crime. This actor approach and that of Peter Falk are one of the reasons why his character might look as different as in other Columbo films. <br /> <br /> The film also offers a very good score of Richard DeBenedictis, who then became in a way the stable composer of Columbo films. <br /> <br /> A good movie Columbo to watch! <br /> <br /> 8/10
