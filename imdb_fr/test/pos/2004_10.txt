I started watching this show by accident, but I love it. The fact that the main character is in a wheelchair is something that is missing on television, especially for children's programs. My five-year-old nephew (as most children do) only looked at people in wheelchairs or with other types of disabilities, but after seeing Pelswick, it just seemed normal. Every time he saw a wheelchair, he simply said "Like Pelswick" and continued with what he had originally done. And yes, the animation is a little rudimentary, but if you can bear watching the first season of the Simpson, it's not so bad. The "Genie" is actually an angel who is there to help Pelswick learn from life. He CAN NOT walk. Someone else said he could walk from time to time. I saw all the episodes and he never remembered having walked. As for humor, if you can get a copy of the episode "Ntalented", which will shine like a boy-band, you'll love this show.
