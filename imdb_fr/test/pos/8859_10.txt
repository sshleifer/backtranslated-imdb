John Carpenter shows how much he loves the original of 1951 by giving him the greatest respect possible. The only difference is that Carpenter chose to stick to the paranoid heart of John W Campbell Jr.'s story. The secret to the success of this version is the unbearable tension that accumulates as the group of distrustful of each other, the pressure to wait literally for support takes terribly its source. Carpenter manages to deliver the shocks as well as the mystery necessary for the film to continue in the right direction. Whether it's a horrible scene or a "what's in the shadows" sequence, the film is for me a perfect fusion of horror and science fiction. The dialogue is perfect for a group of men trying to keep it together under duress, and Carpenter's score is a wonderful, strange pulse that accentuates the feeling of unhappiness and paranoia that go through the film. The actors are superb, a solid set of actors led by Carpenter, the director Kurt Russell, while the effects used give the necessary impact. But above all, it is the end that is the crowning, an end that does not respect the norm and that is incredibly appropriate to what happened, wait to see what is really happening, 10/10.
