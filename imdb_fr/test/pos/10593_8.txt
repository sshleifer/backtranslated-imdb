I do not know about the crew of CKY, but everything they produce seems to be great in its simplicity and stupidity. Haggard is so incredibly stupid and funny that it's almost a comical excellence. Sometimes it does not make sense, but who cares? <br /> <br /> That made me laugh. A must for fans of CKY / Jackass!
