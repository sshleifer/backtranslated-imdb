This is the question that astronauts Roy Thinnes and Ian Hendry face when they discover a parallel world of Earth still hidden on the other side of the sun in this cult science fiction melodrama of 1969, published here in America under the title Travel Way to the far SOLEIL. The plot of the film was designed by British writers Gerry and Sylvia Anderson, creators of television shows such as "UFO", "The Thunderbirds" and "Space 1999". It is extremely strange at times, betraying the influence of "The Twilight Zone" and even Stanley Kubrick's 2001 classic: A SPACE ODYSSEY. The work on visual effects of Derek Meddings, who later also worked on SUPERMAN: THE MOVIE, is surprisingly well under the last three decades of advances in special effects; and although they are not really at the same level as Kubrick's movie, they are really beautiful. If you do not plan a STAR WARS movie and you can overcome the sometimes banal dialogue, DOPPELGANGER is a good movie. it was good enough for me to classify it as "7" and to consider it as a science fiction not discovered.
