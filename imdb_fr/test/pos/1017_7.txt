There is much to love in this film, despite its humble attributes of a PC preaching tale about rape and crime that is always better than the victim. The film created a bit of suspense in the mystery surrounding the sending of notes. (For my part, I was sure it was the teacher.) In fact, it would have been more likely in terms of scenario because the idea of ​​the best friend's boyfriend came from nowhere. The purpose of this is that "rape is ubiquitous - you never know who it is going to be.") Ms. Beller is as bright as ever (see the KB Discussion Board for the accuracy of this statement). Like all the film preachers, the plot lasts 15 minutes after the climax. You may want to stop watching at that time. Unless you're really curious about what's happening to Phillip. Blythe Danner, as a mother, plays the role for which she was born: the worried and overly protective mother. Some good 70s scenes for fans of the 70s. (The dark bar that the father goes to absorb his pain is composed of dark beams, barrels, oak and cork). A must for Beller fans and highly recommended for fans of high school 70s melodrama or 70s kitsch in general.
