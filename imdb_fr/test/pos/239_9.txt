One of my favorites among non-MGM musicals is a classic!> Rita Hayworth is in top form, her beauty springs from the screen. Gene Kelly shows off his dancing skills and introduces an innovative and avant-garde choreography to musicals that will eventually change the way choreographies are choreographed.
