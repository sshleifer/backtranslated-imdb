Yes, indeed, we have a winner - a winner of the best silent action movie! <br /> <br /> The only reason I chose to vote 10 for this film is because it's so incredibly badly done that it gets funny. <br /> <br /> "Night Hunter" basically talks about Jack Cutter, a vampire hunter (apparently, the vampire hunters have been part of his generation for centuries), and his mission, which is to kill the last Vampires. <br /> <br /> This movie contains one of the cutest scenes I've ever seen in my life. Not to mention the very bad scenes of rifle shooting. When people shoot in this movie, the blood splatters - ketchup everywhere, the movie seems so cheap and so lame that you lose interest. The constant shaking of the camera is what annoys me the most during the fight scenes. I suppose this is done to create an "action effect", although in my opinion it does not produce any effect. It's completely ridiculous! <br /> <br /> All the waterfall scenes are extremely poorly done. For example, a scene where the leader of the dead vampire is thrown from a roof. When the corpse touches the ground, it bounces like a flickering rubber doll. A scene where Jack snorted the ground, getting a vision was so lame that I laughed hysterically. <br /> <br /> The dark music, the lame scenes, the bad filming techniques and stupid filming techniques are obviously the features that make this film a malfunction. To say that it is a good film would be to say that nuclear bombs are good for humans. It's clear that those of you who say it's one of the best action movies, have not seen much in your life. <br /> <br /> It's basically a class B vampire action movie that deserves 0/10 but I'm going to give 10/10, just for its ability (being the ugliest action movie I've never seen) to make me laugh and because I just can not live without it.
