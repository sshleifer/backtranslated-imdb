As I mark the film at 7, I must also point out that it is both historically interesting (with Mae Marsh, Lillian Gish and Lionel Barrymore when they were all younger and less well known) and presents quite a bit of action. exciting for his day. . <br /> <br /> The plot is strange for a Westerner, in that all the problems with the Indians start for the strangest reason I've ever seen! The Indians decide to organize a banquet for giant dogs (no, they do not feed their dogs, but rather those who feed them) and when two Indians arrive late, there are no more mutts! So, they steal two dogs belonging to two orphans from the nearby white colony and this triggers a total war !!!! Not only is it silly, but seems to play on the prejudices of the public. I do not know if the American Indians actually ate a dog, but that sounds like the kind of stereotype that was then applied to other ethnic groups. All this on dogs! The film features excellent battle scenes and exciting moments, as when Ms. Marsh crawls on the battlefield to save a baby! Exciting things! But, strange too!
