As a fan of time travel stories, I was surprised to find that no device allowed Russell Johnson's character to go through time. It just appeared in 1865. It was a disappointing part of the episode. I appreciated the premise of the dangers of "changing" the future by changing the past. Other episodes of Twilight Zone on time travel, such as "No Time Like The Past", "Once Upon A Time", etc., were more to my taste because of the uses of "travel devices" in the weather. Maybe if Russell Johnson's character had been the same one he had played in "Execution", it would have been more acceptable to fans like me. As science fiction fans know, no character really has to die in episodes of time travel. All kinds of "twists" can be applied to this type of story. This is the only flaw I can comment for this episode.
