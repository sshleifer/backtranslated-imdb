If Sicily is a Baroque territory, with its doubled perspective, this is part of the challenge of the realism of this film. And it's an exuberant pleasure here to surpass Fellini with not one but three directors, without forgetting of course the current Bellocchio, who has made very good films and should not be worried about his honor. "I Promesse Sposi" by Manzoni offers various casting and casting improvisations with, somewhere, the actual wedding. Sicily is also considered a territory of skulduggery (you already know this version of the island, so no spoiler is involved), of which a comic version makes the table worthy of interest for the work of Sergio Castellito with room of a palace.
