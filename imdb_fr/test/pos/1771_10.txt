I saw this film when I was very young in Houston, Texas. I really enjoyed this movie and I wrote to Jean Peters in Hollywood to tell him how much I liked seeing it in this movie. She sent me an autographed photo. This film was directed by Jacques Tourneur and, with Jean Peters, in the lead role. It also stars Louis Jourdan, Debra Paget and Herbert Marshall. It was released in 1951 in color and lasts 81 minutes. Jean Peters was married to Howard Hughes. She also starred in "Viva Zapata" with Marlon Brando, Anthony Quinn, who won an Oscar for her role in the role of Zapata's brother (Marlon Brando as Zapata) (1952). And she also starred in "Captain from Castile" (1947) with Tyron Power. Since then, I have been trying to find a place where he is available, but I have not succeeded so far. Does anyone have any suggestions on where I can find and buy this movie? If this comment contains spoilers, I am not aware.
