As a fan of Studio Ghibli and in particular Hayao Miyazaki, I went to see the movie from day one. When I came out of the theater, I had this strange feeling that I was missing something, that "magical" feeling that I felt in all of Miyazaki's films before, but I could not say why it had failed this time. this. After thinking about Ghibli's other films, I may know the reason: this movie had most of the elements of a big Miyazaki anime: cute characters, wonderful animations, a great soundtrack composed by Joe Hisaishi and the feeling of watching a high quality Japanese animated film. However, two elements were missing: a deep story and dramaturgy. The purpose of this film was obviously to entertain little children with a simple story, as in the case of "Totoro", so a complicated story told in "Spirited Away" or "Princess Mononoke" is not really necessary, but of the other side. However, this story was simply too superficial. I could not connect to the main characters because there was no character development, the dramatic scenes were only limited and did not last very long. I really hate to give only 7 stars to a Miyazaki movie, because I would give 10 stars to all the previous films, but this time it was just not that wonderful "ghibli experience".
