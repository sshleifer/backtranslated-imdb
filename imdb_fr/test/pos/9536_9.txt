The book "The Railway Children" is a children's book published in 1906 by Edith Nesbit, one of the first British socialists who had strong ideas about the importance of family values ​​for the education of children and whose history was supposed to to be contemporary. . A bit surprising, this seems to retain a significant appeal for today's children a hundred years later. <br /> <br /> The film adaptation of a classic Edwardian children's story with the main roles of children does not seem very exciting. most moviegoers at that time. Jenny Agutter played a leading role in the role of the oldest daughter, Roberta (Bobby), who joined the remarkable work of screenwriter and director Lionel Jeffries and outstanding photographs of Arthur Ibbetson made this film a film not to be missed and that most viewers find memorable. It is remarkable that this book, which dates from 1905, was shot five times between 1951 and 2000 (including four by the BBC for British television). All these versions are not only always admired but also highly appreciated. (something that users' comments on this database will confirm), although this may seem almost inconceivable for a nostalgic period story designed to please kids first and foremost. Since I have not seen all four versions of BBC TV, these comments relate exclusively to the 1970 film version produced for theatrical release. Unlike most children's book movies, "The Railway Children" may appeal more to adults than children. The structure of family life has changed so much in the last century that many children may feel totally lost by the way it is portrayed in the film, while many older people may find that its nostalgic appeal is considerable. Perhaps to compensate for this, the children featured in the film are full of life and vitality, while the adult characters, well rounded, tend to be mostly "padded shirts". The story is mature, it speaks of love, support and encouragement. It is not only timeless, but able to please all ages. It can be described as sentimental and more than a little idealized, but it is by no means cursed and this adjective rarely justified "edifying" it goes like a glove. <br /> <br /> Spoiler Ahead. <Br/> <br /> The film begins with an upper-middle-class Edwardian family celebrating Christmas in a comfortable and spacious London home, when two unexpected visitors call and bring their father (a senior government official). Mom has to move to a very small cottage along the railroad in a remote part of Yorkshire and children are gradually building a new life primarily associated with the railroad and a few passing trains. This life is quite hectic and the older daughter Bobby is growing up quickly as she takes more responsibility from her mother. At one point, she avoids a train accident when her piercing eyes notice that a landslide has created a natural hazard. There is never much emphasis on Father's story, but it is never forgotten, and it becomes progressively clear that he is incarcerated and suspected of treason. Finally, these suspicions are cleared up (we are not told how or why) and he reappears unexpectedly on the local television channel to join his family. <br /> <br /> For many years, this film was not available in videoconferencing format in North America, but Anchor Bay created a DVD three years ago. So they clearly recognized that this very simple movie had not lost its appeal yet. For those who do not already have one, I strongly recommend that you rush to buy a copy of this DVD as it is still available - you will not be disappointed if you have not become totally cynical, or if you need the film includes buckets of blood and / or intense sex scenes.
