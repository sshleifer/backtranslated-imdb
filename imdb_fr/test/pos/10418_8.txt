This film did a remarkable job in capturing NYC stereotypes at best. If you want a simple and cute story, you will not find it here. The linked stories are woven together to capture the very unified but contrasting lifestyle that characterizes Manhattan. A perfect watch for those who love and can laugh at New York life in its most natural state.
