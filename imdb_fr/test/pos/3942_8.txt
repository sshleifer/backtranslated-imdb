This film was adapted from the famous Journey to the West sutra where a monk and his three students look for a lost book about the Buddha's teaching. <br /> <br /> Although this film is not as solemn as the previous films made according to legend, it has nevertheless managed to introduce a humorous and amusing romantic scene. <br /> <br /> This real purpose of this film revolves more around the monk who was mostly saved from being eaten by demonic flying creatures. One of his students, the god of the monkeys, managed to get him out of the battle in time, but was in turn captured by the demons and thrown into the deep throat of a dragon, locked in this particular dungeon. <Br /> <br /> The monk woke up in a small village where he found Mei Yan (the so-called ugly snake girl) who fell in love with him at first sight. Although ugly, she did not leave her appearance aside so as not to reach her. However, a quest to save his three students soon turns out to be fraught with obstacles and each of them worsened with Mei Yan following the monk. The problems have widened further and it is here that the conflicts between relationships are worsening. <br /> <br /> The rest of the story would be left at your disposal, but suffice to say that this film does not describe the typical scenario of the book, it is more for those who want to look for a funny and light image of what Journey to the West and the obstacles to love really mean. <br /> <br /> At the very end, we could describe the entire summary with one word, and that's love. The monk went to show the Heavenly Gates, the Heavenly Palace and Buddha himself how love could overcome even the worst of fears and was considered the most powerful weapon that could be used against any enemy of the higher powers. <br /> <br /> A wonderfully created and fun action awaits those who buy this ticket. Of course there would be no regret, at least from my side and those who were with me at the cinema that day watching the same movie.
