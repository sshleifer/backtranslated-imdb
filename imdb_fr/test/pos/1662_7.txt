You can remove the rogue from the joint, but it seems much harder to remove the rogue's joint. We have already seen this kind of character in this kind of situation before (and since): in movies like BOB THE FLAMOR, ELEVATOR GALLOWS, TOUCH NOT GRISBI, BANDS ANDERSON, etc. Too often to be mentioned. What helps to make one of the most remarkable is (of course) the holdup itself, which is played without words in real time, and the behavior of the lead. Bogart would think twice before crossing this guy. The ironic ending is perfectly suited to this story (she almost demands it). All around, one of the best black movies.
