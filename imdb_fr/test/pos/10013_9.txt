I saw this film at the Rotterdam International Film Festival in 2002. It seemed to be one of the less popular films of the festival, but it turned out that it was all the more interesting. <br /> <br /> The story of an actor trying to take control of himself and control his environment after withdrawing from an addiction, is based on real facts. In addition, the characters who play in the film are real people who relive this experience, this time for the film, which is partly conceived as a play. Not only are they all good actors, but Jia Hongsheng's parents are also real-life actors, but the methods used to showcase their relationship with Jia are very effective. <br /> <br /> Jia Hongsheng is the actor of some The Chinese action movies of the late eighties begin in the nineties. Later, you can see it in great movies such as Frozen and Suzhou River. Between these two paths, Jia becomes an addict and loses all desire to act or even to do something productive, except to make some futile attempts to become a virtuoso guitarist. <br /> <br /> I like how the scenario writer chooses to focus on his behavior after the withdrawal rather than the horror of the drug. We really feel the pain and struggle of Jia. At the same time, we hate him for the way he treats those around him. <br /> <br /> The film plunges the viewer into a tiring scenario, Jia seems to be trapped. , taking along with him his parents and his sister who try to take care of him. Because there are personal "interviews" with the characters, we believe that we are getting to know Jia not only through himself, but also through others. <br /> <br /> The film has a heavy feel, but scenes of Jia going through Partying and partying with friends alleviate the tone. So does the bitter humor in many events throughout the film. The music is beautiful and stayed with me sometime after. This is a film that may not please many people, but for those interested in Chinese film, more serious and more modern, this is a strong recommendation.
