Well, I'm not the biggest fan of Sondheim in the world, so even though I have the distribution album and I've listened to it a few times, I've never seen this show play and I did not see the movie version Tim Burton either. I felt that I wanted to see something more faithful before seeing Burton's and giving him a chance as a movie. This version is not a film at all, it's a movie shot with some of the original members of the cast, including the role played by Angela Lansbury as Nellie Lovett. This is one of those performances that serves as a hub in the heart of Broadway magic and theater. She must have had so much fun with this role. Sweeney Todd himself is not played by Len Cariou, who did it originally, but by George Hearn. Hearn does a fantastic job. his voice is not as good as that of Cariou, but he seems to have a slightly wider tone. <br /> <br /> The only problem I had was with the character of Johanna played by Betsy Joslyn, and to some extent her lover Anthony played by Cris Groenendaal. Joslyn's voice does not support high notes, but I did not know if it was supposed to be the goal, because I do not know much about this piece. More importantly, I'm not sure that the story of "Sweeney Todd" has enough weight to support some of the music, but fortunately, the whole thing does not seem to have been taken too seriously by its creators. Like a lark and a little comedy in the vein of "Grand Guignol", it's very pleasant. I do not think it's as important a job as "Company" and "Into the Woods" or some of his other shows. Some of the music is quite spectacular, but at other times it seems to exist in a world outside of the show. <br /> <br /> I will not say much about it here because this is a movie website and it's really not a movie, just a filmed play. There were maybe 3 or 4 scenes where they moved the camera, but that was it. People will want to see it, as it preserves Lansbury's legendary performance, which deserves its legendary status, as it is a hilarious and insightful performance. George Hearn can also be proud of his version of Sweeney. It would be a good movie to show to children over 5 or older to interest them in musicals, because blood and cannibalism will really surprise them. Seeing a performance filmed so expertly and faithfully makes me hope that more efforts like this have been made over the years with musical theater, because I prefer shows from the '20s to the' 50s to business in recent years . "Sweeney Todd" is an exceptional show of its time however, miles and miles above the AL Webber madness.
