I saw Pardon Franklins at a screening in Paramount and I loved it. I must admit that I really did not want to go and I was pretty jaded movies that I'm doing today, I must say forgive. The Franklins were cool and wonderfully put together, I laughed, it was a good story to tell that I could not believe that two guys had shot at it and put it all together. I thought that if these guys could make a movie like this with this budget, imagine what they could do with a lot of money behind them. And then I thought it would be the jaded type of studio that would probably be fucked anyway. That being said thanks to the guys I got lost and in your movie and that's why I go to the cinema to forget the world for a few hours.
