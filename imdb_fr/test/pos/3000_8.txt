Lewis Seiler's hasty approach with King of the Underworld establishes a deeper plot, while maintaining an efficient execution time. One of the clearest examples of this is the transition from poverty to wealth for the married medical couple. The public is instantly transported from a medical office to a luxurious suite of the most prestigious hostel in the city. This development is essential to understand the position in which the doctors were thrown. History shows, from the introduction, that these two people are generally satisfied with the medical practice of those who are less fortunate. By abruptly switching from this scenario to a morally conflictual occupation (the personal physician of the crowd), the viewer is called to experience this sudden turn of events. The Nelson (Kay Francis and John Eldredge) are forcibly employed by Gurney (Bogart) without objection. This stylized notion of organized crime, which is too influential and too powerful to be defeated, has become a standard part of every gangster. One of the aspects of this film that asked me questions ironically relates to the rhythm of the story and the rhythm to which it is told. I think that character development and social identity can suffer when certain aspects of a story are not fully examined. This paradox is the result of personal tastes, in the sense that I think that the cinema experience can be improved by a rigorous development of the characters. However, for the purposes of this film, I must admit that fast action helps to give more dynamism to the impact of the film. <br /> <br /> ** 1/2 (of ****)
