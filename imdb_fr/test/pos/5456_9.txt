The staging is brilliant, the casting is remarkable (although I would have liked to see a little more Aaron Lustig (of the fame of Y & R), who plays Paul Shaffer). I only have two short stories about the movie, however subtle they are. Leno from One-Roebuck is excellent, but his presence on stage (when recording one of the last episodes of his series) is a little disappointing. Two: the distribution of coarse language. I'm willing to tolerate foul language, as long as it's not used for free and, to some extent, the film was free. The language seemed to be used as a tool to reduce the pathos of Kushnick, so well interpreted by Bates, by its frequent use, and was used to make Leno de Roebuck a benefactor by not using it (of course, if the characters are are really behaved this way, well done to everyone). Nevertheless, the piece is excellent with regard to television and video. I think the film had potential for the big screen, but would have required a re-casting for the roles, and probably also a different director (the aesthetic aspect is that of the show Larry Sanders, good for HBO, mediocre for the cinema).
