I gave these 8 out of 10 possible stars. The scenario was excellent, and Peter Coyote and Michele Lee, along with the rest of the cast, did a good job. <br /> <br /> Peter and Michele were too long for the ages that their characters were supposed to be, and their children in the movie would obviously have been better suited being their grandchildren. <br /> <br /> I missed the first ten minutes of this film So I do not know exactly how this body appeared after 25 years and appeared until Denny Traynor (the character of Peter Coyote), but I had no difficulty understanding the script. <br /> <br /> Barbara Traynor (Michele Lee) is stunned when her long-time husband, Denny, is arrested for a murder in Oregon about 25 years ago, a state in which Denny says he never entered. <br /> <br /> However, evidence accumulates Denny, his story changes. Then, her story changes again and again, until Barbara does not know what to believe. <br /> <br /> However, Barbara decides to get to the bottom of the mystery surrounding the fateful moment that Denny and a girl named Sherry accepted the ride of a stranger named Wayne Kennedy, which resulted in a murder. <br /> <br /> I found the film entertaining, well paced, and it let me guess what really happened between them. three people. <br /> <br /> From what I saw in the closing credits, it seemed to be based on a true story.
