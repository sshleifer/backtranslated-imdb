Over the years, I have often watched this movie after seeing it on "HBO" and now have a copy on DVD. I must say that it is very memorable and entertaining in the meantime, it is interesting and informative too. Like all television fans can understand the early 90s, when the time has come to replace Johhny Carson, the living legend of the TV show "The Tonight Show". Who will it be Jay or Dave? This original HBO movie "The Late Shift" stays true to reality and describes real events very well. It shows the battle behind the scenes between the network leaders of NBC and CBS and even ABC who were all fighting for the services of Jay and Dave. The acting gives the impression that it's real, because very few TV shows are shown with real-life people, as actors portraying Leno and Letterman give this film a real-life appearance. I did not read Bill Carter's book, so I do not know if he stayed true to the pages, but I really enjoyed this movie over the years. From the moment he begins to show CBS entertainment leaders who watch Leno for Johhny, they decide to participate in the late-night game. Yet when Carson announces his unexpected retirement, NBC wants to stay loyal to Leno, but the conflict comes when Letterman also wants a slot at 11:30. It was fun to watch the crazy meeting with Michael Ovitz (Treat Williams) that makes all the networks want to consider Letterman for a show. It was interesting to see Johhny's scene tell Letterman by phone a direct way to move from NBC and consider CBS. And by the way, Rich Little was great, Johhny Carson could not match his portrait. And moments of tension were provided showing the quarrels and dismissals of Helen, Leno's talented manager, who was pressured by NBC leaders. Overall, it's a great movie that shows what TV really looks like and shows that networks are hungry for power and money, while showing that it's a bustling business. Clearly, there is no business like show business. Excellent work from HBO very memorable and a watch at any time, it shows the true story of the wars of late night.
