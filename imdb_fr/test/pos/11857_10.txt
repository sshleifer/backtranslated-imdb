Why this film was released only in 4 states exceeds me. I thought this movie was a divine story. The name says it all: to see other people. This movie has more logic than laughter, which is why I guess it works so well. Common sense is also appearing in what appears to be another childish sex comedy. Alice is frozen in the cold when she feels irrational about how she could play for her fiance, not just sexually, but as a partner, friend, and so on. two. One race after another creates problems, as if it was not a bad idea from the start. Witty dialogues and comic installations make this one funny like hell! Nicholson and Mohr set the tone of the film right from the start and keep the promise they promise. Lauren Graham, Andy Richter and Helen Slater (in his first theatrical movie in 10 years!) Are also in the spotlight. Climax is starting to take a crazy turn, but a simple ending makes it a lot nicer than most of today's movies. Mohr's fans will see something different in Ed's character, and Helen Slater's fans will appreciate his brilliant moments of a quick but excellent return. Any Richter wins the award for the most moralistic character. Romantic and funny, or just fun. Seeing other people is a jewel to behold.
