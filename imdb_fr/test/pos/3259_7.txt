I had never heard of this movie, but I like Heath Ledger and Bryan Brown and the story seemed interesting, so I decided to try it. I found it very nice. Heath Ledger plays a 19-year-old man who works in some kind of lousy job and wants to start making some serious dough. So he's asking gangster Bryan Brown for work. I will not go into details but things are going badly for Ledger and have big problems with Bryan Brown. Their film becomes better and better, with a scene in which Ledger rubs a pair of bank robbers. And let's not forget the beautiful Rose Byrne, who plays the role of Ledger's love. I would definitely recommend this movie.
