"The Student Nurses" is an excellent film about four women linked by a friendship and a career. For the first time, we can see a realistic representation of relationships within the workplace, outside the workplace, the risks of these relationships and their consequences. This film also offers a rare chance to see theater and television actress Katherine "Scottie" MacGregor as a nurse instructor, "Miss Boswell". Ms. MacGregor is best known for her portrayal of "Mrs. Oleson" in the television series "Little House on the Prairie". The direction, the music and the print color are very good, as is the opening theme song performed by Clancy B. Grass, III. This film offers a rare opportunity for lovers of themes centered on the late '60s and early' 70s, which offers a "softer side of life" while enjoying the beauty of the female sex.
