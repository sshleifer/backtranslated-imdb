I saw this film about 12 years ago and I can remember it as if I had seen it recently. It's how much this film has affected me. <br /> <br /> Since this is a film from the 50s, I think he was ahead of his time. This surprises me by the way he maintains his integrity in this subject that some might have considered taboo at the time. Very realistic, it shows the tumultuous and heartbreaking journey that an addict chooses. One can only imagine how much the audience was affected by the realism of this film at that time. <br /> <br /> Personally, I think Frank Sinatra was one of the top five big screen performances. <br /> <When talking about movies about mental illness and / or addiction, I always recommend The Golden-Armed Man as one of the top five to watch.
