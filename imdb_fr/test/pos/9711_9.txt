Where do I start? I sat ready to laugh a little and was blown away! This film is just perfect, it's indescribable. In all honesty, Jackass Number Two was rude, obscene, funnier and more fun than the first. That was exactly what I needed tonight. <br /> <br /> There are so many scenes in this movie that will make you say "Oh my God, no way!" or "Ouch!" Perfectly mastered and configured, each event and scene were well coordinated before, which made them even more perfect. I loved every minute! I'll just say that there was even a scene where it was necessary to censor particular images in order to avoid an NC-17 classification! It was so hilarious that they had to put it anyway! Incredibly good. <br /> <br /> 9/10. Incredibly funny, do not miss it!
