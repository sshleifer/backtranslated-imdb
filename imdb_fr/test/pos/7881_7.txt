Joe is the movie on the dark side of the 1960s force in America, and Susan Sarandon had beautiful breasts. This film frightened me so much when I saw it at the theater that I never liked Peter Boyle until the young Frankenstein and he was still suspicious enough, even after this comedy. Looking back from today's experience, this movie seems to be live again and until half of the voters approve of John McCain's "Joe The Plumber" font and fear to elect a Black to the presidency of the United States in the coming weeks. . A black Prez would be perceived as a sweet revenge of the "negroes", but would not fail to ignite again many spirits, if not the streets, this time by Joe's fans. So, Joe's spirit in the movie is resurrected in Joe The Plumber's campaign! Nevertheless, I like to be American and be terrified by both, and by the fact that they illustrate what ironically Gregory Peck said our civilized law was also: "a living and breathing reality!" May God help us.
