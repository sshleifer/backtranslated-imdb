**** SPOILERS THROUGHOUT **** This is a very strange film - in every respect for its time. For six years, American films have shown American soldiers as the son, the brother, the father of everyone. <br /> <br /> In films like The Best Years of Our Life and Until the End of Time, our hearts are torn by the difficulty that returning soldiers have to adapt to peace and their families. Yet that same year, this movie shows soldiers as a mix of people rather worse than the viewer - one of the messages in this movie is, "Lock up your girls." <br /> <br /> Even good soldiers - who have a lot of time - play all the time, drunk a lot and absolutely do not want to have a woman. And their reaction to the investigation of a murder by the police is to conspire against them. <br /> <br /> Mitchum, the most compassionate soldier, says things like, "I do not know if my wife wants to get out of it now after the war, I have not seen her for two years. I do not care, not really, maybe we'll succeed, maybe not. <br /> <br /> Another soldier is shown unusually sensitive, because after years of absence, he would like to see his wife again. <br /> <br /> Later, when this soldier declares at the police station that he spent the evening with a whore - without knowing that his wife is sitting right behind him, it seems there is no doubt that his wife will be fine - in fact, it's - I guess it's "Hey, the soldiers will be soldiers." <br /> <br /> The police detective played by Robert Young, who is trying to solve a murder case, convincingly and with infinite lassitude tells the story of someone's actions on the night in question, <br /> <br /> "Am I?" in worry ie? No. I do not care about anything anymore. I did it too long, I guess. "<br /> <br /> A man comes to the whore's apartment and says," I'm just a man like you, interested in fucking. " he says, "No, it's a lie, I'm her husband. I would like to be in the army, I have already been dismissed. "When he says," No, it's a lie, why would I want to be a soldier? "He makes another series of lies when the police tell him ask who he is ... Until the end of the film, we do not know who he is or why he is here! He is one of the strangest characters in the history of cinema! <br /> <br /> > A man standing with his friend in a bar talking to four soldiers, when a clumsy soldier gives a drink to his girlfriend, she goes to change her dress - and wears another without any problem. do not leave with his girlfriend - who simply disappears - but follows one of the soldiers when he leaves to go to another area of ​​the bar! The man then extrapolates from the minimal information he learned on the soldier - to philosophize big about the problems of the return of the soldiers - and immediately invite the soldier to his house because he is iv I'm feeling sick, it's strange. <br /> <br /> Similarly, a dance hall girl is irritated by the sentimental soldier who would like to take her "for a real dance - and maybe a dinner". Yet she dances with him and immediately gives him the key to his house! <br /> <br /> In the late 1940s, did people always urge soldiers to come to their homes after meeting? <br /> <br /> Robert Ryan kills his host, a stranger, when he is enraged to see the Jewish army trying to get Ryan's thirsty drunker out of his house. The reason for the murder? "No Jew tells me how to drink." "How to drink?" Huh? What does it mean? <br /> <br /> This film is always offbeat, quite deliberately. The soldiers always act with total defiance of the law and all the characters are as cold and harsh as any movie I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> And yet, the movie is really captivating! You simply do not have any idea how these people will act - or what a weird new character will appear - without anyone thinking that the actions of the person are strange to say the least - for example the behavior of the woman. <br /> <br /> The acting game is about the best I've ever seen - Robert Young, Robert Ryan, Gloria Grahame (who won an Oscar nomination), Paul Kelly and others actors I had never heard of. <br /> <br /> I have never heard of this movie - and it's a complete delight that I've discovered one that I want to see again and again and again. it's really strange but impossible to look away because you have no idea what these creatures will do next.
