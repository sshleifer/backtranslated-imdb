Over the years, I became a fan of director / screenwriter Barry Levinson and he did not let me down with that very funny look on politics. Popular TV comedian Tom Dobbs (Robin Williams) enlightened the country with his scathing jokes about the state of the country and elected politicians. Night after night, he has his fans rolling in the islands; then the question is put that Dobbs stands for the presidency. His manager, Jack Menken (Christopher Walken), said: go ahead. Dobb's flippant truisms ignite a popular movement that places him on the ballot. Comedian to the elected president. Meanwhile, a young woman (Laura Linney) finds a flaw in the computer system that will count the ballots from one ocean to another. My favorite sequence is the collapse of Linney in coffee. William is absolutely hysterical with his quick jokes. Other cast members: Jeff Goldblum, Lewis Black and Rick Roberts.
