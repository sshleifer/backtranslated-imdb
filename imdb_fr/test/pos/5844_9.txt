Oz is an excellent series, one of the underestimated television series. It has some connection with the soap opera in that something bad is always happening, and it is the development of each case of evil that fascinates. From my discussions with people in prison, it sounds right. Each interaction has a machination that works in the background. Behind every action lies a ploy, a plot in which to do someone else. I love this series so much that it's one of the few television series I bought completely, on DVD. yes, I agree with the author who preceded me who commented that it contains elements of satire. The wheelchair character who offers a yellowish vision of life does so with some ironic humor.
