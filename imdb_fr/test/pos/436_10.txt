I just watched Jean Renoir's wonderful film, French Can Can. It's a visual delight and great entertainment. The Moulin Rouge recently manufactured is in comparison. I did not really receive all the praise from the recent movie. Now, I am more than ever convinced that my assessment was correct after seeing a master filmmaker like Jean Renoir's version of the same story. He managed to get great performances from his entire cast, and the great French actor, Jean Gabin was in a rare form. The dance sequence towards the end was one of the most exciting I've ever seen. It was long, but I did not want it to end. This film deserves to receive more recognition than it has.
