I watched fantabulosa! because over the last few years, Michael Sheen has become one of my favorite actors, and if you've never seen him before, shame on you and then get your hands on a copy of Heartlands or Dirty Filthy Love . This production did not disappoint: Michael Sheen turned almost magically into Kenneth Williams and gave a performance as moving as it was tragic. Without taking anything away from other performances but like Kenneth, Michael really stole the show. I do not know how he does it, but every performance I've seen seeing Michael seems to be changing until the character he's playing is really believable, and no matter how hard I try, I can not to blame him. Have a treat, enjoy!
