A comment says it was not a comedy ... Error! It was a delightful comedy from a period of history that does not lend itself easily to this genre. Very busy ... and active film from start to finish. Often the shots from the window of the train or the car were simply beautiful. A nice way to spend a few hours at the theater. All the historical French characters, such as Charles de Gaulle, Petain and some people involved in the French Resistance were included in the scenario, which could send those who are unaware of the fall of France under the German invasion . The characters were attractive and the actors describing them were excellent. I recommend it 9 out of 10.
