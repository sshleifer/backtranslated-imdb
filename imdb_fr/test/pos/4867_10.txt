This second couple of Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner is a great match. Predictable maybe, but I do not care and I still laugh a lot every time I see it. The Wile E./Road running shorts have always had the most special place in my heart. So knowing that the second disc of the Golden Collection would not only include 11 of them, BUT they would be in chronological order (2 to 12, the first episode was about volume 1), made me scramble eyes . I love that stuff. This animated short is visible on Looney Tunes Gold Collection 2 Disc 2, and features an optional commentary by Micheal Barrier. <br /> <br /> My note: A +
