"Four Daughters" introduced John Garfield to the public, and this is remembered most about this movie today. Unlike some actors appearing in several movies before their images were gelled, Garfield immediately installed a cigarette at the end of his mouth and telling him that destiny was for him. <br /> <br /> This is actually the story of four girls, their widowed musician father (Claude Rains) and their various contenders, one of whom, Felix, is played by the handsome Jeffrey Lynn. That's the one they all have a crush on, but he's in love with Buff (Priscilla Lane). Then she meets Mickey Borden, who fears nothing. When Buff realizes that one of his sisters is in love with Felix, she leaves him at the altar and marries Mickey. <br /> <br /> This is a fairly formal story given to life (and sequels) by the acting. We have already mentioned Garfield, but Priscilla Lane was by far the strongest girl, the most interesting and the best actress. Jeffrey Lynn was a cool, handsome man. This film allowed him to get off to a good start with Warners. However, the real celebrity did not have to be. Like many others of his time, he entered the service and when he went out, he had a bronze star but not a lot of career. He then went on television and real estate. Claude Rains is warm and wonderful as a patriarch. <br /> <br /> "Four Girls" was so popular that it inspired "Four Women" and "Four Mothers", as well as to reunite a lot of the cast in "Brave Girls" where the actors played different characters. <br /> <br /> Very nice, a nice memory of simpler and probably happier moments, and a chance to see John Garfield in his first film.
