I finally had the opportunity to settle and compare the two versions of this film that are currently circulating: first, the good old imminent scam, Embassy VHS, called SCREAMERS, then a new Italian DVD completely restored by the New media company favorite of everyone, no shame for Italy. <br /> <br /> As everyone says, the American ads on "Returned Men" are totally misleading and suggest that Roger Cormanized is performing what would otherwise be a fantastic fantasy adventure thriller for adults. The full Italian version is a somewhat sprawling, well-designed and deliberately rhythmic version of "Island of Dr. Moreau", and there is nothing wrong with that. This is a sumptuous and beautiful Euro Horror release with a brain, a good plot, a development of the character, shooting shooting, period costumes and sets, etc. <br /> <br /> But I have to admit that the 14-year-old knucklehead puffer is still waiting Somewhere inside me, I had a bigger kick of the squalier, fishy and neglected by Roger Corman, which contains some cool excerpts, a flashy but absurd opening segment, then most of Martino's original film, though somewhat shortened. give way to Roger's idea of ​​entertainment. The pace was a little faster, the shock sequences are getting closer and you see both the fantastic form of Ms. Bach and that of the extended Italian version. <br /> <br /> I still do not have much An idea of ​​what the specific story is about however: there are a number of twists of conspiracy and accessory characters that were a bit difficult to follow. A local voodoo sub-parcel did not help much, and it's amusing to see how everything ends in another fight between the noble shipwrecked prisoner and the mad scientist ... Maybe some additional viewing is needed . I will say this: fans of the film should use one of these PAL imports and take a look at what is actually a movie rather than a simple old troubled home video - widescreen compositions reveal once again that Martino had the eye to fill his screen with interesting things. Nobody gets torn off as in SCREAMERS printing, but it's still interesting, and further proof that his standards may have been pretty limited to the bottleneck, Roger Corman really had fun when he did for him, and side by side, they are actually better movies than they should have. <br /> <br /> 7/10
