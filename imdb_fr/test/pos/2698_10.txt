Here in Germany, "King of Queens" has a status of great cult! Almost all teenagers (and adults) watch this sitcom. It's really awesome !! Better than the other ugly American sitcoms like "Full House" or "Set by Step" (the only series, which is still OK, is "Al Bundy"). There was no American sitcom in Europe that was as effective as this really funny show !! Kevin James and Leah Remini as Doug & Carrie Haffernan are the craziest couple I know, Jerry Stiller as Arthur is the funniest "grandpa" I know, and Victor Williams and (mostly) Patton Oswalt as Deacon and Spence are the most different, but funny guys I know. I look at it as often as I can, and I still do not have enough, in a good mood!
