Although this does not seem very promising for a long time, Renoir's French Cancan is a film without charm. The story is cliché: a laundress, Nini (Françoise Arnoul), is discovered by a nightclub owner, Danglard (Jean Gabin). Danglard steals her from her baker's boyfriend and drops off her current girlfriend, both of whom are returning to their old lovers. Nini must choose between returning to her humble life at the baker's, continuing the show with her employer, oh, or becoming a princess, because a prince falls in love with her at some point. I'm glad that the film did not choose the obvious choice, as certainly would have made a film of lower quality. The film ends with the opening of Danglard's new nightclub, the Moulin Rouge, and some great songs and dance acts. The first, "Butte's Lament", which also forms the basis of most of the scores in the film, is simply one of the most beautiful songs ever written, and Renoir herself wrote it. If you're a fan of Baz Luhrmann's 2001 film Moulin Rouge!, You'll recognize this tune at the beginning of this movie, sung by Rufus Wainwright. Although this is not very important in this film, everyone I know and who owns the soundtrack like it. In addition to having one of the most beautiful songs ever written, French Cancan also has one of the cutest women among the most talented to date. It's hard not to fall head over heels in love with this girl. 8/10.
