This often-maligned film is a must for Blake Edwards, Julie Andrews, Henry Mancini or Hollywood's musicals fans. Other writers have commented on the changes of tone, the confusion of the plot, etc., but the film has many things to recommend. The score is one of the best by Henry Mancini (and he wrote a lot of wonderful ones), several songs are sung to perfection by Andrews, Julie's performance is nuanced and she is adorned with beautiful clothes (she is here in his absolute best), the shots on the site are breathtaking, and there are some fun visual gags like Inspector Clouseau. Rock Hudson basically phoned for his performance, but he's pretty good. A true element of curiosity to the extent that it is the last major film that Julie shot for about 10 years and, in many ways, is a precursor of Victor / Victoria. It's nice to watch and listen. When will it be available on DVD ??? When that's the case, I'd like both versions - the longest and shortest version of the director. Since it was turned into rifles at S.O.B., they would make an excellent pack of two!
