With everything going on there is a movie about young love. Yes, it's true that young love often does more than it deserves, but why are not people down "Romeo and Juliet"? Paul and Michelle are good role models for them. <br /> <br /> Yes, they run away and set up an ideal life, but it's a movie, not a real life. Paul is more sexually interested than Michelle, who has been misinterpreted. They end up having sex, but no one is forced to do it. The film lets children know that sex can cause babies. <br /> <br /> One thing, there is nudity in the movies. The camera does not focus on it, but it is there. <br /> <br /> The end of the film suggests that Paul has a good chance of being discovered. In "Paul and Michelle", they separate for a time. If you do not like the end of a movie, imagine one yourself. Alternative purposes are not just about DVDs.
