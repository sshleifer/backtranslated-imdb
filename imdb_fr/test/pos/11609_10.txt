I was able to see this great film at Fantasyfilmffest Berlin and when I came out of the cinema, I wanted to be drugged * g *! I really saw a lot of movies and there are some that I would call perfect like Fight Club or Koyaanisqatsi! Subconscious cruelty is now one of them! Half of the people who watched television in Berlin came out of the room and I can fully understand that, because it can be a real shock to a person living in his ideal world, day after day, dreaming of his dreams without thinking to the horror of our world. planet-in our life! I do not think I should describe the story of the film because of the people who have already written on this page! It's a movie that shows everything and more !!! Gets 10 points + of 10 !!! It would be cool if you who saw it also liked it, write me an e-mail! So far, I have met no one as impressed and as satisfied as me !!! Finally, sorry for my bad English-I'm not a student (und das is auch gut so so !!! :-)))))
