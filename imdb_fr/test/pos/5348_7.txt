'' Wallace & Gromit in The Curse of the Were Rabbit '' is the same type of animation and comes from the same creators of '' Chicken Run '', but the story is now different: Wallace, an inventor who loves cheese and his Smart Dog Gromit, who always helps Wallace in his problems, tries to keep the rabbits away from the vegetables of all the inhabitants, because there is in their city an annual contest of giant vegetables. But when Wallace tries an invention he has made, so that rabbits avoid vegetables, the one who is going to be cursed is him. Before watching this movie, I did not know that these two characters already existed and were famous. I loved Gromit and I think he's one of the coolest dogs I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> aka "Wallace & Gromit -A Batalha dos Vegetais" - Brazil
