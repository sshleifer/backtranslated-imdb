Whoever shot this film was a genius, each of the characters in this film is perfect, and they all do absolutely excellent work. This is a good overview of what life was like before and during the Civil War, the difference between the rich, the average white and the black. The story gives you an insight into the real problems of the time and the difficulties inherent in everyday life at that time. The script is convincing and the drama holds your attention throughout the film. There are characters you will fall in love with, there are some that you will hate, and you will find yourself emotionally involved. <br /> <br /> My wife and I loved it and we will see it again in years, I'm sure.
