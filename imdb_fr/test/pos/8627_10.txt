The duo of Abbott and Costello continue to live in this version of a classic tale. In "Jack and the Beanstalk" there is everything to see, music, magic and comedy. Costello plays Jack after listening to the story told by a young boy once. We know that Jack was a poor boy who sold his cow "Dolly" to 5 magic beans. Well, he plants these 5 beans, and they were really magical. He climbs into the air, sees a big castle and sings a song, without meeting the giant (Buddy Baer). Not only him, he would dance with the woman who was also a giant. She clobbered Jack with her elbows during the dance. It was fun! You have the harp who knows how to put the giant at ease. The goose that lays golden eggs. And my favorite, the way Jack gets rid of the giant. He takes the ax and starts cutting the beans. Another funny thing is where the ax got stuck during the cut, and the final celebration happens when people dance around the footprint where the giant has fallen. A lot of fun and fun for the whole family. Very recommended! 5 stars!
