This film begins as it ends and ends as it begins. In the middle is a collection of comedies, philosophy, music, observations, commentaries, mini-stories, colors and more. He looks at the world and our lives and tells the story of The Monkees from the point of view of the band members themselves. He also examines television and film and offers a visual commentary. It's shocking too, with war scenes and shows how we're just pawns in a big game. All that is said, and much more, but if you do not look at it objectively, you will not see much more than scenes assembled to bring the music together. It's the kind of film that can never become boring because it's done so well.
