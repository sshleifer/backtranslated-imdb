This is NOT your ordinary police story where characters were only secondary to battles and car chases. So far, the episodes are more realistic and intelligent. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for something with a lot of history of cop kidnapping like Rambo, you will not find it here. <br /> <br /> I gave him a 9. I wish this series lasts a long time. Morse is excellent!
