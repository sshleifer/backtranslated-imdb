I would give this film a strong 7. Although it's really not the best movie, or even one of the best movies of its kind (The Killing Fields is better), it tries at least to tell a necessary story. <Br/> <br /> I think Laura's introduction method in Burma was a little artificial. First of all, Burma is not the easiest country to visit, especially in the late 1980s. Secondly, if you did Burma, your passport would not be lost. A sensible person would be sure to know where their passport is at all times. With that in mind, I'm sure the scriptwriter knew it was weak, but needed something. Patricia Arquette's performance was underrated and I just did not understand she was a doctor. However, at least she did not exaggerate the role, which often happens in movies like this one. U Aung Ko was good, but also sober. The end is hard to follow because most of the dialogue is in Burmese, with translators for Laura. It would have been difficult for Laura, and the viewer too. Another advantage is the strong image of Southeast Asia in the film, which was nice to see.
