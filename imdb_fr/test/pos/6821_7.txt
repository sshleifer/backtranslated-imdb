Joseph Conrad's timeless novel, Heart of Darkness, was featured in the 1994 film. I read Conrad's novel, and I must say that even though I prefer the novel itself, the film was an excellent performance. . The sets and costumes gave life to Conrad's novel as we followed Marlow's journey. The acting game has also brought characters to life through manners, voices and personalities. If you have read the novel, I recommend that you also watch this movie. If you have not read the novel, the movie may be harder to follow. Conrad's heart of darkness is too filled with action, emotion and information to be turned into a movie of just over an hour and a half. Therefore, if you have not read the novel, the plot in the movie may seem too cluttered to be followed. Overall, I gave this film a seven out of ten. The basic plot of the novel was presented on screen with great sets, costumes and games. However, nothing can replace the original work of Joseph Conrad.
