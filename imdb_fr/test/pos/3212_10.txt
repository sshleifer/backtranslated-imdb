I watched this show from the beginning and I am a 45 year old man. For me, it's so much more than a show that appeals to women. It is the story of a family, perhaps unusual, but nevertheless family. It revolves around a mother and a daughter, Lorelei and Rory Gilmore, two brilliant, attractive and successful women. Lorelei resides in Stars Hollow, Connecticut, a small town in New England with a sense of history and an unusual population, but who acts as a dysfunctional family. The show also throws in the relationship between Lorelei and his parents, Richard and Emily Gilmore, old money DAR WASP people who do not approve of Lorelei's choices in life, although Lorelei does not care. The history of relationships and the line is what makes this show, in my opinion, the best on the WB network (soon the CW). Watch this show!
