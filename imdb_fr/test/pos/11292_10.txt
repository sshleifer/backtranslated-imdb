The visual efficiency of this film is unmatched by anything I've seen. And the work needed to make it must be incredibly long and tedious (you do not have to just stick "Kodak Grainy Film" in your camera to get that look). Do not watch this movie to be entertained, watch it to be visually stimulated, watch it to be challenged and provoked in your thoughts on the film and any other subject that comes to mind, religion will probably be a thought. <br />
