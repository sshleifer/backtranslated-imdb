Guilt and redemption are two of the basic emotions and elements of the plot of the heavy and powerful dramas that the Oscars love so much (which is quite funny because "The Kite Runner" was only nominated for the best original score, lack of nominations may have been unfair). Although most film adaptations (or any other means) are generally inferior to their literary counterparts (and "The Kite Runner" is NOT an exception), Marc Forster's film adaptation is a good one. <br /> <br /> Most people are aware of the story, the book having been read by millions of people, so I will not go into the plot except to say that the book remains pretty true to its source. That said, if you do not know the plot, do not see the movie or, better yet, read the book. <br /> <br /> The best thing about "The Kite Runner" (other than his story) is director Marc Forster. Forster is a director with an epic frame and unique vision, perfectly used to bring Khaled Hosseini's book to the screen. A small part of me feared that he would use the same dream images as those of one of Forster's previous films, "Finding Neverland". Do not get me wrong, "Finding Neverland" is a wonderful movie, one of my favorite movies in fact, but the visual deception he used here has no place here. Fortunately, Forster understands it well, and the brilliance of his direction shows its versatility. Although the absence of nomination for best director for his work here is not exactly a parody, I see a number of statuettes reserved for him later. <br /> <br /> It should also be noted the adaptation of the scenario. He remains faithful to the source, but allows Forster's vision to interpret the material. The dialogue is not silent, and that. with the management of Forster, advance at a steady pace. Like Forster, the lack of recognition of the scenario at the time of the awards was not a scandal, but I would not have complained if he had at least been nominated. <br /> <br /> The demarcation line between this film being great and remarkable lies with the acting of the actors. Most performances are solid, but there are some who do not make the cut, and it hurts the film. The most notable weak performance comes from Zekeria Ebrahimi, who plays the young Amir. It's not that it's bad, it's just that it's not as effective as it could be. He simply can not translate the guilt that consumes Amir to the public. In fact, I think I might be a little lost at this point in the film if I did not read the book because of that. He looks dark and sometimes resentful, but we can not feel his emotions. This is a difficult part to describe and most often, the young Ebrahimi holds up, which is particularly surprising in that it is his first role in the cinema. <br /> <br /> The best performances come from Khalid Abdalla, who plays the adult Amir and Shaun Toub, who plays the wise Rahim Kahn. Abdalla may not be a well-known name (although he was in Paul Greengrass's "United 93"), but his work here is incredible. He is a discreet and modest man, and he emotes perfectly when he has to. A smaller player might have been able to capture Rahim Khan's character, but Shaun Toub uses enough subtlety and care in his performance to create what the clich√©s are trying to describe. <br /> <br /> Forgive me if I make a speech here, but that's something I need to address, that's the PG-13 rating of the movie. The fact that this film received such a low rating is outrageous. There is no justification for that. Some might argue that the odds were distorted because of the need to see it, such as the gore in "Saving Private Ryan", which some would have thought had earned it an NC-17 rating. But this exception can not be applied here. The only purpose of the scene is to tell the story. Forster (probably at the request of the producers) has tried everything to tame the most painful and disturbing scene of the film to allow the film to sneak with a PG-13 rating, but the content is too disturbing to be described in depth. anyway and get less than the R rating, no matter if you can describe his "taste". Worse still, this editing removes much of its power from the scene and trying to make it less disturbing to get the lowest score is insulting. In addition, some scenes of violence are incredibly disturbing. In terms of time, these scenes take from the film, it does not add much, but what really deserves a grade R at least. The MPAA, whose film rating system has always been corrupted, has reached a new low by assigning such a low score to this film. <br /> <br /> But do not blame the film. The film is a solid film that is worth seeing, especially if they are fans of the book.
