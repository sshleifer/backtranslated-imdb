Greystoke is without a doubt the best Tarzan movie I have ever seen. Christopher Lambert represents a very credible man who tries to return to the world of humanity alongside the fantastic Ian Holm. John's struggle to leave the jungle and the monkeys that raised him is very moving. Some very memorable scenes, including the one where Lambert sounds the sounds of the jungle to his romantic interest and the scene where he attends the death of his monkey father. The feelings of Tarzans for both worlds are well developed and really make him feel for him. <br /> <br /> An excellent and underestimated film.
