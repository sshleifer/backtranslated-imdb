What should not be loved? <br /> <br /> I caught up again tonight and marveled at Hugh Bonneville's capture of Philip Larkin's essence without resorting to tics and caricature. <br /> <br /> There are many layers to the description of the complexity of the main character and Hugh gives them life. Her mother prudish, her unresolved problems with her father and her inability to engage with a woman. <br /> <br /> His poetry is interwoven and some scenes are captivated in his story to the wife of a friend he later proposed, but fortuitously, almost innocent. It is not difficult to see where is its attraction for the many women who fell in love with him (and who knew each other, to continue, and who continued to see him!) <br /> Cerebral, cheerful, aficionado of jazz, faithful friend. It's always more than looks, women have gone beyond baldness, deafness and myopia. And a wonderfully nuanced performance of Eileen Atkins as her mother is an added bonus. <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10.
