The first thing I noticed about this movie was setting everything up. A quality film all around. <br /> <br /> I guess you might like this movie just for its action, but I loved it for more than that. <br /> <br /> This is a pure thriller / horror movie. It offers a more complete scenario than most horror movies. I thought the American version, at least, ended brilliantly and was excellent all along. The story seemed honest and brutal. <br /> <br /> The film has an excellent tight storyline that keeps the action moving, with credible characters in widely believable situations.
