Once again, we have the chance to see a beautiful opening scene where the work of the artists has been fully restored and we see this old grocery store at the corner of a street with the snow falling gently. Inside, you'll find the rich colors of all merchandise, from products to canned and canned goods, candy medications, and more. <br /> <br /> In essence, this is a story of these "nascent" goods, such as animals on the labels of items, or a pie, or even a pack of cigarettes. <br /> <br /> The entire show is told by "Jack Bunny", an imitator of Jack Benny, with music by conductor Leopold Stokowski, who was in so many animated shorts Looney Tunes that I lost count. A lot of humor is relevant, so it is useful to know who is "Little Egypt" and the other characters. Busby Berkeley's "aqua" number with bath sardines coming out of the tin can and tomato tin canning were smart! <br /> <br /> All of the above, and more, were in the first half of this drawing, which was slightly longer than normal. The second half was about a guy from King Kong who escapes from the box "Animal Crackers" and terrorizes everyone. This part was not big and ended on a rather stupid note. So ..... an "A" for the first half, a "D" for the second, making it a total of C-plus or B-minus.
