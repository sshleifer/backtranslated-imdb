At the time this film was shot, most housewives knew exactly who parodied Barbara Stanwick. Today, only some women over 50 probably remember Gladys Taber, whose column "Butternut Wisdom" featured in Family Circle magazine from the pre-World War II period to the 1970s. She lived in Stillmeadow Farm, Conecticut, and its columns were collected in several books: Stillmeadow Seasons, Stillmeadow Daybook, etc. The lines that Barbara Stanwick recites by typing them in her column are quite typical of those that began with Gladys Column Taber. In addition to cooking and living in the countryside, she was sometimes rather nostalgic and philosophical. She has a lot talked about his favorite dogs, mostly cocker spaniels. You could say that Martha Stewart is today's Gladys Tabor. <br /> <br /> Christmas, Connecticut may not be a cinematic masterpiece, but it's nice, a light entertainment, soothing for stressed minds, and that's enough
