Okay, so maybe the imitations of Jay Leno and David Letterman are not in the foreground, but you still have an idea of ​​who these people are and how they work on the screen. Bob Balaban and Treat Williams are excellent in the roles of Warren Littlefield and Micheal Ovitz. <br /> <br /> The film does not go for the joke or the punchline but it is always funny. Kathy Bates in particular is amazing as a Leno manager. <br /> <br /> Funny, amazing, interesting, very watchable, it's a good TV movie.
