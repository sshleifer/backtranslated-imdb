It's a comic short film by Laurel & Hardy with some great and funny moments, but overall, the film is a little too much of a comic principle. <br /> <br /> The comic principle on which this film rests is very simple; Stan Laurel does not wear pants. Laurel plays a young Scottish na√Øve who arrives in America in great shape. For some reason, he's the center of attention because of this and his uncle played by Oliver Hardy thinks it's time to put Philip on pants. <br /> <br /> His humor is well executed, but the main premise also gets a little tiring after a while. The film certainly still has its good comedic moments, but it is also far from the best of Laurel & Hardy's many comedy shorts that still exist. The film is simply too simple to be considered one of the best, although it is really very well executed for the most part. </ P> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p /> <br /> 7/10
