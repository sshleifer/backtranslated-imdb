It's not a walk in the park. I saw him when he came out and I did not have the courage to look at him again. You will never see a film so horribly devastating or depressing. I felt as if I had been severely beaten. What kind of world do we live in when we have children treated worse than garbage? It's our world, what we created, what we let happen. And I would hesitate to say that I-ME-WE is not responsible for that. Babenco made this movie to wake us up, to shake us deep inside us, and he succeeded. How can we be cruel, or complacent, or careless to our children, when we see the graphic results of such behavior? He points a finger at us all for doing this at the lowest and at least powerful of our society. And if you do not do something every day to prevent it, then you are part of the problem. I am NOT a religious fanatic, but this film reminded me of the state of my soul.
