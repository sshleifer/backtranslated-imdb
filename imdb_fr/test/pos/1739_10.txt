I remember being so excited on Saturday night as a child, waiting for Dr. Who. I thought it was the best show ever made. Then, I grew up, Dr. Who stopped broadcasting and no one I knew had ever heard of it. Then I discovered that there would be a new series. I was a little nervous about it. Would that meet the expectations I had since my childhood? Would they have it messed up? Does the doctor suck? Would his assistant be bad? Would they create a more intimate relationship with the doctor and his assistant? YES, NO, NO, NO, NO !!! This show is beautiful !! I like the new Dr. I love his assistant. I like the show. And I find myself excited on Friday night now, waiting for the "new" episode. I just watched the episodes of 2005 because I live in the United States, so I'm a little behind the rest of you. I hope the next Dr. is as great as this one!
