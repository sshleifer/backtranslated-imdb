"The Mayor of Hell" looks like a first film of Dead End Kids, but with a much harder appearance and very few spots of light, preceding the first appearance of the four-year-old Dead Enders. James Cagney has a full-screen opening credit, although technically the "mayor" of the film's title is actually described by Frankie Darro, one of the boys sent to a reform school during the opening scenes. Darro's character is Jimmy Smith, a strong young man linked by "Patsy" Gargan (Cagney), who is elected to this post when Gargan attempts to transform conditions into a state reform center. <br /> <br /> Warner Brothers made many of these types of films, trying to provide a kind of awareness in an era that was too familiar with the effects of crime and poverty. This film is hard enough, without excuses for ethnic stereotypes, as in the submissive attitude of a black father in court or the way a Jewish child runs a candy shop in a reform school. The rules of the rehabilitation center are quite simple: work hard and close your mouth; get off the hook and personally answer to Prefect Thompson (Dudley Digges). <br /> <br /> The role of Cagney in the story seems somewhat ambiguous, because even though he makes a serious effort to improve the conditions inside the reformer, on the outside, he always has the control of a criminal racket. The movie's attempt to juggle this dichotomy was disappointing in my opinion. The goal of the final is to put the emphasis on things as Gargan awaits the result of the almost fatal shooting of one of his henchmen. This is not really the kind of role one would look for in a movie like this. <br /> <br /> Warner Brothers removes some elements from this story in a 1938 remake entitled "Crime School", featuring Humphrey Bogart as Cagney, and Billy Halop as Frankie Darro. If you're biased with Dead End Kids, you'll probably like this latest movie better, as it also features familiar faces such as Leo Gorcey, Huntz Hall, Bobby Jordan and Gabriel Dell. However, the end is somewhat confusing in this one too, as Bogart's prison guard character is involved in hiding a prison escape. Both films offer a romantic interest for the main characters, in "Mayor", Madge Evans is a reform nurse who falls in love with the character of Cagney. <br /> <br /> Curiously, many of James Cagney's early films are not commercial. available, you will have to keep your eyes open for a projection on Turner Classics, or get the film from a private collector. Personally, I can not get tired of these kinds of things and find intriguing points of interest in movies of all genres from the '30s and' 40s.
