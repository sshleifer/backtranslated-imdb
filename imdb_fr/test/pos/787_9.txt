Buster Keaton was probably the most enjoyable of the 20-minute films he visited, and they are no more fun than this little gem. The deadpan comic is involved in a photographic mix with a wanted criminal. This leads to his elaborate escape from several street policemen and other passengers who recognize the faces of the "Wanted" signs. The Goat is a block-to-plate with brilliant site gags, from the opening scene to the bread queue, to the magnificent elevator chase at the end. A Keaton movie never feels as if its silence is lacking, because sound is never needed with it. His films are explained by the wonderful (but incredibly dangerous) things he has done to himself. It's not hard to see how influential he really was - the man is just as incredible today as he was in 1921.
