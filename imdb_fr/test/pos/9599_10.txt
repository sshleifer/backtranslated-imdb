I'm certainly not a football fan, but I watched it with a friend because there was nothing else on the box at the time. (Thank God). Not only did we laugh from start to finish, but about a week later, at the pub, when we started talking about it, we had a good show with uncontrollable laughter. Does this sloping terrain really exist ??? I've posted my e-mail here, so if someone hears about future availability or a replay on TV, please let me know. Certainly the funniest thing I saw on TV !!! King Leek was good too !! another Tim Healy classic
