I would like Hollywood to make more movies like The China Syndrome. Because it marks at all levels. <br /> <br /> He has an intelligent and credible script. This shows you that it is not only nuclear energy, but the money involved, that creates a danger. And the film also gives you a good insight behind the scenes of television making. <br /> <br /> There is a thriller: the first time I saw him, he kept me at the siege. And this marks as a character film: I was really interested in the main characters. Jane Fonda, Michael Douglas, Wilford Brimley and especially Jack Lemmon are excellent.
