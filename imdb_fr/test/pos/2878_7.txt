I was expecting this film to be nil, but what I got is a very good movie slasher / gore. Most scenes of death are brutal enough. Teens are decent, with Penny McNamee certainly the best of the group. Rachael Taylor looks like a young Christie Brinkley, but does not bring much to the film apart. Kane was good as a killer and is totally believable as a formidable juggernaut. I saw the "twist" come several kilometers, but I still enjoyed the film. <br /> <br /> But what impressed me the most is the direction. Gregory Dark may well have a career in the legitimate film in front of him. In addition to using too much the horror movie "speed cam" (you know, where does this guy's face tremble fast?), There are good shots here. The angles and environments of the camera really emphasize Kane's size, making it even bigger than it really is. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a story or deep characters, that's not it. But that's not what slasher movies are. If you're looking for some violence or if you like bloody movies, check it out!
