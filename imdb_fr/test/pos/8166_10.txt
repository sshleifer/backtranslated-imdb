First of all, I would like to say that I am only a fan of movie commentary and that English is not my mother tongue, but that I felt a strong impression of forcing myself to write on such movie; perhaps to thank and congratulate C. Jay Cox, cast and crew for such a brilliant production. <br /> <br /> Yesterday, I watched "Latter Days" for the first time. <br /> <br /> At first, I thought it would look like the movie "Priest", which I really liked to show a gay priest out of the closet. But "Priest", perhaps because of his restricted Catholic ideological notions, did not meet the needs of my audience by revealing a sad and profound end. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, "Latter Days" broke this concept (and some others too, such as the Mormon principles); presenting a tender and joyous story, leading her to a happy and emotional end, while arousing a sense of blessing and hope from God. A great movie indeed! <br /> <br /> In a way, "Latter Days" made me feel L.A. as a city of angels. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie to anyone who loves incredibly beautiful love stories!
