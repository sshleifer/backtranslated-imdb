<br /> <br /> At the release of this film, I considered it a nonsense of light pop. It was a mistake. <br /> <br /> After repeated screenings and a documentary on the realization of DIRTY DANCING, the discovery of the depth of this film certainly increases its appeal. <br /> <br /> DIRTY DANCING is a film about change. The changing nature of relationships within the family, changes of worldview to adulthood, etc. The story takes place in August 1963, the last week of the last summer of innocence for the American people. The many personal changes experienced by the characters reflect the many changes in American society that would be marked by the assassinations of Kennedy and Vietnam. <br /> <br /> Movie fans loved this movie and have been to movie theaters several times. it's the most successful dance film in the world. As a male, I find it very difficult to accept the romantic couple Patrick Swayze, the ultimate stud with Jennifer Gray, which is very simple. This would be fatal for most romantic dramas and could also create the intense disgust expressed by most male critics. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack of the film regained status No. 1 before its release. To this day, it's almost impossible to attend a wedding reception without hearing a song from DIRTY DANCING. <br /> <br /> Halfway through the movie, Baby's mother wakes up and asks Baby's father, "Something's wrong?" <BR /> <br /> The baby's father, a member of the anti-change family, tries to keep everything that's going on secret. He told his wife to go back to sleep. However, resist as one can, the change is unstoppable. DIRTY DANCING is the story of a person who wakes up just in the last moments of the last sleep of our country in innocence.
