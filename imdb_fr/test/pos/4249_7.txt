Of course, the film is full of black activist stereotypes and much of the jargon of the time. In this sense, the film is indeed dated. But as a satirical look at the number one pest industry in the United States, advertising it is still on target. But the counter-message is just as important, namely the effect of large sums on those who would make the industry more socially responsible - not promoting war toys, alcohol, etc. Thus, the film also speaks of the attractions of capitalism. Note, for example, how Putney's outfit suddenly changes to look like the third-world revolutionary Fidel just before he leaves the company. For a moment, it seems that Swope's mini-revolution has succeeded among his staff, and he is moving forward, perhaps to propagate the movement. But then the former militants succumb to the charm of the big pennies and he goes away shaking his head, perhaps to hijack a plane to Cuba. Downey's last word is however ironic while the Arab (I believe) destroys the silver tower, leaving the metaphorical structure of (advertising, capitalism) in steaming ruin. For me, this sounds like a change that can only succeed as a purifying act of destruction and not as a process of reform - a message consistent with the radical spirit of the time. <br /> <br /> Whatever the subtext, there are some really fun moments, especially with the commercials that are playing so well now. Those who compare the anarchic style to that of Marx Bros. point. Token lines fly thick and fast with outrageous facilities. Forty years later, it's still a difficult film to master. Despite the crudit√©s, the film remains a work of daring originality with truly revealing moments.
