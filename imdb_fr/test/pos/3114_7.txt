George Cukor is and will always be one of my favorites. The unsung hero of his generation. Nobody mentions Cukor in the same breath as John Ford, Howard Hawks, William Wyler or Billy Wilder and yet, look at his filmography. From glittering comedies "The Philadelphia Story" "Adam's Rib" "Holiday" psycho melodramas "Gaslight" "A double life" a big semi-western "Heller in Pink Tights" without forgetting "My Fair Lady" or "Travels with my Aunt" He was at the service of his actors, he never put himself in front of the camera. I feel a certain tenderness to look at the "Rich and Famous" lightning of the old master always very present. Candice Bergen gives us for the first time in her career a glimpse of the wonderful comedian she was about to become. Jacqueline Bisset is a return to the era of Greer Garson and Loretta Young and Hart Bochner intervene, teasing us, promising us something spectacular that will materialize in 1989 with "Apartment Zero", Meg Ryan, the daughter of Bergen being already Meg Ryan. As tired as the formula is, it remains a film of Cukor and, for what I think, one of Almodovar's favorite films.
