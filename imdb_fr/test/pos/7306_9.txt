I think several others have already commented on this film, but I liked it so much that I just wanted to say how good it is. I gave him a score of 9 out of 10. He did not get a 10 because the start is very slow. I'm almost gone, but I'm glad I did not do it. Hold on, it's worth the wait. <br /> <br /> This is mainly a film about relationships: deception, trust and treason. <br /> <br /> Michelle Pfeiffer, Jessica Lange and Jason Robards All work in this film. <br /> <br /> Jason Robards is a farmer whose grandfather moved there. Jason's character gets older and he decides to create a trust dividing the thousand acres of farmland between his three grown-up daughters. It is at this point that the plot of this movie really begins to cook. <br /> <br /> The sisters turn against each other because of misunderstanding rather than greed. They also make discoveries about each other's childhood and their current marriages, including an affair of adultery, while the father becomes more and more abusive, demanding and paranoid - until the terrible truth that reigns over everyone ends up bubbling. <br /> <br /> This film really touched me emotionally, I got angry with some characters and I was sad with them. I could feel their pain because of the excellent performance that was given. <br /> <br /> The end was a surprise for me, but in sync with the growth of the characters. <br /> <br />
