Another piece of well-made moral ambiguity where the anti-hero makes it difficult to decide who to look for. </ P> </ p> </ p> </ p> </ p> </ p> </ p> <b> </ b> <b> </ b> <b> </ b> </ < </ b> <b> </ b> <b> </ b> <b> </ b> </ b> </ b> silence anyone who says there are no good parts for actresses in movies - at least in 1971. There were four excellent roles for actresses in this film. All were well interpreted and executed. <br /> <br /> Pamelyn Ferdin did a great job as Amy and was going to play "Wanda June". . This is probably the first time a major male box office player shares a prolonged kiss with a 12-year-old girl in front of a camera. I wonder if there is a lot of controversy about it at that time. It was probably Polanski's favorite scene. Given the fate of Amy's turtle "Randolph", it is not surprising that Ferdin grew up to become a staunch defender of animal rights. <br /> <br /> Geraldine Page was also excellent, playing a complex character with just the right amount. It is interesting to note that she died just three days after Elizabeth Hartman's suicide (throwing herself through a fifth-floor window), as they had also worked together in "You're a Big Boy Now" . <br /> <br /> Hartman (who looks like she could be Blair Brown's sister) was wonderful like Edwina and should have won an Oscar (no other performances were so close that year), but being Given what we now know about her, you wonder how much her performance has been studied. effort and how much comes from inside her. Edwina shows such raw pain that it is difficult to watch. Like the incredible performance of Marilyn Monroe in "The Misfits", the viewer probably sees many of her own demons in the character she is performing. <br /> <br /> Finally, there is Jo Ann Harris who is incredibly perfect flirty Carol. For my money, Harris was the sexiest actress of the 1970s, combining sensuality, intelligence and humor. She was the best reason to watch the TV show "Most Wanted" and the only reason to watch Wild Wild West Revisited. Hard to believe that someone who could bring it all to the screen has never become a big star.
