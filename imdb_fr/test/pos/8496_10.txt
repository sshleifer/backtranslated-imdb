It's one of the best movies I've seen in years. I took myself to a new place and another time. It was like I was in the same place as Ray with his many trials and triumphs. Jamie Foxx has turned into Ray. During the movie, he was Ray. In addition, Kerry Washington, Sharon Robinson and Regina King were superb. The film was well shot and directed, the music was fantastic. <br /> <br /> I saw the film four (4) times with different people and the last time was just as nice as the first time. I will buy the DVD as soon as it is released. It's a movie that will be watched again and again for years. <br /> <br /> Thank you for this wonderful experience.
