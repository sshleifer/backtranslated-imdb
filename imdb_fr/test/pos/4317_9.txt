Looking at the last 2 episodes, I remembered a TV ad from my childhood. It showed the wild west, very dusty and dry, and there is a small living room, a man enters the bar / lounge, he is thirsty for hell, his lips chapped, etc. He has just crossed the Nevada desert. did not drink water for days. He believes the bartender "Give me a bunch of chips" While he eats it, we can feel how thirsty he is, we hear a voice in the background that says ... Hold it longer ............. then blow it with TEAM "The man drinks TEAM (a soft drink) It feels like a dozen bags of chips The thirst is so intense that I I can not stand it anymore, season 2 has even more twists than season 1. The end answers a lot of questions, but asks a lot more questions, hope we'll know the answer in season 3, but I doubt, because I feel lost the momentum goes well beyond three seasons, if the people behind the camera continue their good work. <br /> <br /> For my part, I will continue to watch. <br /> <br /> From Pakistan with love
