It's funny because I've read all the reviews on this page after having this movie and it's either a love or a reaction that he hates. You will probably either love him or hate him too. I think the best films are the ones that divide people because they obviously have an impact. I'm in the five-star camp because this film gave me a real number and made me want to go back and find out more about Afghanistan and Iraq. I must admit, I knew enough when everything was going well. Especially Afghanistan and I feel guilty about it. The music through the movie was beautiful. I kept getting lost especially during some of the historical flashbacks. Personally, I thought the audio was great. It seemed to me that the soundtrack with the speeches, the music and the radio had been assembled so that you felt like in VR with Jim, the main character, or in his head. Everything that was not on the radio was very clear and everything on the radio sounded like it was really on the radio. Anyway, it's a very amazing DVD that made me cry.
