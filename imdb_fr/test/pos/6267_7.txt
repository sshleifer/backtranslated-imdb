A very nice film about a young Chinese loving Western technology and an Englishman trying to make a fortune showing movies in China. It's a very interesting story that is likely based on real events, although I guess it's more fantastic than real. It has a fairy tale quality that you rarely get in real life, and it also has 8 people credited for the screenplay, so they must have invented stuff from right to left. <br /> <br /> This is a very nice film that shows how magical the film was for people who had never seen it before. This is not a particularly profound film, briefly addressing the loss of tradition and the encroachment of Western culture, but especially a nice little film. It's actually a film that I really liked and that is already starting to disappear from my mind 15 minutes after seeing it. Light as a souffl√©, but I enjoyed every minute.
