News circulated {dir. James L. Brooks, 1987} <br /> <br /> **** / **** <br /> <br /> Although it lacks the emotional shock of Brooks' first feature film, (Terms of Endearment) Broadcast News is an exceptional film, with outstanding performances from each of the three main characters and a scenario as authentic and well-documented as a compelling story. Let it be known, this is a movie of characters above all and a satire after. In my mind, he succeeds at both levels in his own way. The characters in the film have a surprising depth and dimension, while the satire remains sly and never bitter. Comparisons with Network are not necessary because movies have two completely different goals and attitudes. Network is certainly an excellent film but cynical and tired; in other words, it's crazy like hell and fed up with the state of television. The satire style of Network feels more extreme and guerrilla. On the other hand, the characters who populate the Broadcast News press rooms love and live for their work (sometimes at the expense of their love life). They enjoy the stress and satisfaction of reporting, just as the public enjoys watching it. soft masterpiece and realistic romantic.
