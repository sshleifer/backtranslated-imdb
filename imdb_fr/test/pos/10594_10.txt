I have never seen a film like this, nor so funny. I laughed at my fucking ass and watched it repeatedly. Infact I'm looking at it now. Chad from CKY is hot too. Anyway, if you have never liked it, you explode buttocks, you have no taste. The film involves Ry (Ryan Dunn) who has just broken up with his girlfriend who turns to Valo (Bam Margera) and Falcone (Brandon DiCamillo) to help her discover what she did with "Hellboy" (Rake Yohn ) of Raab (Chris Raab / Raab himself), they act precisely in this way. <br /> <br /> The scene of the fender bender and the Cactus scene at Record Bin were hilarious.
