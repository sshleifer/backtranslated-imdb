Governments are elected for a three-year term, as Reg Whithers said in 1973, the Liberals were determined to continue forcing Labor to go to the polls until they were defeated. If you ask me, this is described in the docudrama, but anyone who says that Kerr acted correctly in this area fails to recognize the interested and costly strategy of the Australian Liberal Party. On the show itself, if Max Phipps was a poor Whitlam, his voice was too ghostly. In addition, more key political actors from both sides should have been used, although this may have reflected the budget constraints of the time. Nevertheless, I recommend it with caution.
