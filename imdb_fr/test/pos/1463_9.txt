After the highs of darkplace, it was never conceivable that Holness and Adobye were able to create anything other than that of Garth Marengi. However, I think that the man to the man alone is as much a show (on the good episodes) as a darkplace. I can not deny that 2 episodes are not really good, but the other 4 certainly compensate. If I had to choose 2 big episodes, I would choose Steve Pising (pronounced Pissing) and the brilliant Garth Marengi. Having a little bit of understanding of the program is a real benefit, as Dean Learner makes a lot of jokes about it, but even if you have not seen a lot of things, Dean recommends to recommend it because some of the fires in which he launches are great, for example. His argument with Def Lepord on their name. All in All, a great show that is totally out of points because of some less funny episodes.
