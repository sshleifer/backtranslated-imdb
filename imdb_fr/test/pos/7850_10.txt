This film presents quite shocking scenes and subjects, considering that it was shot in 1971. <br /> <br /> Clint Eastwood, Geraldine Page and Elizabeth Hartman do an excellent job in the film, as well as all members of the cast. <Br/> <br /> The film begins in the American Civil War and begins when a wounded Yanke soldier, Johnny, played by Clint Eastwood, finds refuge and is helped in a girls' academy in the south of the country. <br /> <br /> The principal of the school, Mrs. Farnsworth (Geraldine Page), the only teacher, Edwina (Elizabeth Hartman), and a small group of half-grown girls are without a man among them since maybe to be a little too long. <Br /> <br /> While their loyalty rests on Confederation, their emotions and physical needs lead them definitively in the opposite direction. Johnny immediately uses his masculine charms to try to win the women on his side - and prevent them from delivering him to the patrol boats. <br /> <br /> However, feelings previously inflamed by incestuous behavior, an adulterous father, brutal rape and teenage inexperience combined with jealousies - turn things around and have unintended consequences for Johnny and the residents of the city. 'school. <br /> <br /> 10 stars
