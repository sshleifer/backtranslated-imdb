Inferno gives Los Angeles what it deserves: a baptism on fire, death from above. An excellent cast of obsessed characters could survive and make the passage of the coronal mass ejection transpire, but it would be neither amusing nor spectacular. A lame criticism in Variety has criticized the characters for their concern for their personal redemption instead of banning together to save the world. But what's refreshing about this big heat is that nobody can do anything about it. As a result, we are fortunately not subject to scenes of "comfort" by fascist presidents and other great extremist statists as they elaborate intriguing intrigues to save a chosen remnant of humanity (eg Deep Impact). Here, the half-dozen sweat-soaked sweats, fueled by lust, calculate their own redemption or face their old-fashioned oblivion - together, as individuals or alone with the solitaries. Excellent TV movie overall. This is clearly not distorted by the destructive ingenuity of overzealous network administrators. I highly recommend.
