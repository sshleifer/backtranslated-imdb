We are in a small town, a widow (Ida Lupino) is hiring a handyman (Robert Ryan) to look after her house. She soon begins to regret it as Ryan becomes erratic by the hour, it seems that she is the host of a dangerous schizophrenic and she can not escape from her house. <br /> <br /> Beware, My Lovely is an adaptation of Mel Dinelli's The Spiral Staircase and her play "The Man". Rather a film and a scenario composed of two characters, the film offers two remarkable performances and offers an interesting vision of mental illness. However, do not believe that this image is heartbreaking and heartbreaking because it is not. It's clear from the start that Ryan's Howard Wilton is a dangerously troubled man, but it's a different type of "danger" film. A model that throws another angle on psychosis and makes it difficult to hate our dangerous protagonist. <br /> <br /> Ryan and Lupino form an excellent combination. They had also done a great job, and much better, On Dangerous Ground even year. So, with the two actors clearly at ease together, it brings out a perfectly regulated story, based in the compound of a house, the prison. Ryan is particularly strong as his character comes and goes in madness, some scenes are powerful and sometimes arouse fear and arouse deep sympathy in others. Harry Horner's direction is safe (in reality, he does not have to do anything but let his actors follow it) and George E. Diskant's cinematography contains intelligent and punchy visual touches. With one involving immensely memorable Christmas tree balls. Beware, My Lovely has enough to make a recommendation for the fans of Bordline and is easy to follow by Film-Noir. For Robert Ryan fans, it's an essential show, oh yes, and more. 7/10
