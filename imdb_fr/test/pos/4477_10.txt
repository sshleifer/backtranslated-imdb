This film is beautiful in every way. It's visually stunning, and it's a good thing, because the dialogue would only take a page or two of paper. The acting is superb; it's subtle, passionate and intense. Ben Daniels does a fabulous job of becoming an animal and mixing this wilderness with the dominant passion and honor of this man. There is not a flaw, not a mistake or a bad time to find anywhere. It's completely perfect, but only if you understand what you are going to experience. This is not a film for who wants the normality.
