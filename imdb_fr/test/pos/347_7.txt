I love pretty much everything that the late Al Adamson directed in his long and varied career, but "The possession of Nurse Sherri" is above the fun and yet indisputable Z-grade schlockfests like " Horror of the Blood Monsters "and" Dracula Vs. " Frankenstein "This film is really scary, am I saying that you are going to jump out of your seat when you look at" Nurse Sherri "? No, of course not, but this pastiche of elements of" The Exorcist "," Ruby "and" Carrie "are some of those strange horror movies that were common in the seventies.You can not put your finger on what's so scary about it, but the film is dripping (And what an end, do not worry, I will not spoil it.) Adamson and producer Sam Sherman have really understood this, and it does not matter if "Nurse Sherri" is a calculated success or a happy accident. Jill Jacobson is friendly but not remarkable as an unfortunate nurse who becomes possessed by the spirit of a recently deceased sect leader (Bill Roy, who shines in his brief role) .Geoffrey Land is fine as a doctor boyfriend. There are some blaxploitative elements here (a Near all, profit was the bottom line of these cheap cheap movies), but they actually contribute to the plot instead of being a facade. "Nurse Sherri" was a production of Poverty Row, and this is sometimes seen (scenery, special effects, etc.). Nevertheless, the film has heart, actors and a decent staging and real chills. Sam Sherman also saw fit to use Harry Lubin's musical theme for the "One Step Beyond" television series of the late '50s and early' 60s in this film, which certainly adds to the scary atmosphere. The DVD contains two very different film cuts (the first version contains a lot of T & A that end up in the editing room to make way for more horrible things), as well as the theatrical trailer, the TV spot and an excellent comment. by Sherman. By the way, does anyone know what happened to Bill Roy? Next to John Carradine, he's the best actor I've ever seen in an Al Adamson film, and he's the leader of the cult in his own way.
