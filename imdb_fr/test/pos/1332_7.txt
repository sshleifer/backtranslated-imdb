Soderbergh is a fabulous director, but nothing he could have imagined could beat the incredible cast he has assembled for this zenith of sequels. Clearly, he knew it from the start. The term "star-vehicle" is traditionally used to refer to a film that revolves around a star. This film aims to bring together a group of Hollywood hot shots and make them even brighter than before. The last scene says it all - all the stars sitting around nothing and nothing is said. We just have the opportunity to see them socialize as if it were a scene from a reality show where George Clooney, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Matt Damon, Brad Pitt and Don Cheadle just hang out, being them -Same. So history does not matter - at least, that's not where the greatest pleasures come from. If you want a smart movie, better stay with 11. But if watching the stars turns you on, it will make your day.
