One would have expected Hitchcock's return to the main cinema in the studio to take the form of cautious prudence. Certainly, few people were waiting for his most overflowing and unbridled movie, a joyful mix of vicious black comedy, thrilling suspense, mocking manipulations and fantastic invasions. But that's exactly what they got: FOREIGN BY TRAIN. <br /> <br /> What is remarkable is how much Bruno's transgression disrupts the film world. Much has been made of the masterly transversal motif, but its immediate effect is to completely block the straight line of progress that Guy is making in his life, and therefore the society he represents or is eager to join. Guy is the archetype of the American, the boy of the working class has done well, evolving in influential circles, athletic, successful, handsome. Bruno is his destructive opponent, gay, decadent, "European" (he lives from his father in a big house and only wants to dream of a murder). Bruno's life is one of repetition, of circularity, as Guy moves straight ahead. Bruno's success is to place Guy in his kingdom (represented by the merry-go-round) and force him to transgress (break the law, hope of murder (Bruno)). <br /> <br /> Bruno is literally fighting patriarchy. All the authority figures in the film are criticized - Bruno's father, a man whose brutality is glimpsed, but whose film constantly hints at the real horror (especially in Aunt Clara's paintings): an incredibly negative energy intense must come from somewhere); Anna's incredibly Machiavellian father; the insensitive judge who does not think of having lunch after an execution; the tennis commentator whose sufficient and authoritative comments are always wrong. Far from being the hate of legends, Hitch, as Robin Wood has perceived, is deeply hostile to fathers and patriarchy. <br /> <br /> Bruno's transgression shifts the world. This is Hitch's most surreal film. Whenever Guy is in his screenplay, he is filmed right, with traditionally romantic music. But every time Bruno intervenes, the atmosphere becomes carnivalesque, weird, much more fun. This is Hitch's first truly American film, reveling in the primitive detritus of Americana. Cultivated men perforate the balloons of little boys or try to throw them rides. Leading mathematics teachers talk about goats in trains. The matrons of the old society are strangled during elegant evenings. Washington is filmed as a series of reserve lines in a vast desert under a huge sky, like a haunting picture of Dali. There is one of the funniest and funniest scenes of all cinemas when you see a motionless and smiling Bruno in an ocean of heads that revolve around a tennis match, an image worthy of Magritte. Just watch any scene with Bruno and watch it derail in the strange. <br /> <br /> The phalluses abound in the most ridiculous permutations - check out all those balloons (Hitch obviously came to see THE THIRD MAN) - as well as in quieter surroundings: Washington will never be the same again. FOREIGNERS is also, despite VERTIGO, the most openly sexual film of Hitch - as well as the phalluses, there is sustained homo eroticism, the remarkable play with horses "on horseback"; the gobsmacking blowjob joke when Hitch's daughter spills powder on the policeman. <br /> <br /> And yet, Hitch does not stay in the good old suspense. In order to show how much he was a great artist, critics tend to neglect what made him famous. Much has been said about Bruno as a prototype of Norman Bates and Hitch wreaks havoc on public identification, wanting Bruno to be assassinated. There is a painful hilarious sequence in which Bruno loses the lighter with which he intends to calm Guy. The tension and sighs of relief from the public I was involved in supporting an insane murderer are inherently funny, slightly disturbing, and very revealing of our true reactions to compliance and success. And Hitch treats him with insensible joy - listen to mocking music and exaggerated compositions, and congratulate yourself for taking it seriously. <br /> <br /> Strange is one of Hitch's five best films, and therefore one of the best things in the cinema. The dialogue is so strange and brilliant, I can not believe it was not written by Chandler. Patricia Hitchcock is a wonderful pixie who replaces her shameless father as she makes fun of Guy. The carnival finale is a remarkable and breathtaking fusion of exciting and tense activities, black comedies and symbolic sites. If the final words of Bruno condemn him in hell (according to the Catholic precepts, Hitch is supposed to embody: compare with a similar end in THE KILLERS), we applaud his integrity, infinitely preferable to the degraded service of Guy.
