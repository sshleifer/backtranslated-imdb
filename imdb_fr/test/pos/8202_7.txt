It was a movie that made you think a little. Some parts a little cheesy, others pretty good. The plot sometimes got thicker and by the time you thought Angella (Sandra) had found a friend, he was a fraudster or a dead person. All I have to say is that DENNIS MILLER should have been in the whole movie. His character was the best, very refreshing after all the bullshit Angella had suffered. He would have raised Angella and me through the dumps.
