This is a solid little underrated thriller, which has thrills - a lot, with a cool story, Sandra Bullock is great! All the characters are great, and I was surprised by the unpredictability because there were only a few predictable moments. Sandra Bullock is simply amazing! Jeremy Northam played a great villain, and I know what the character of Bullock is, because I'm kind of the same kind of person (I almost never go out), besides, it's pretty well done and written for the mostly . That should be higher than 5.5 in my opinion, plus Denis Miller was surprisingly better than expected in his small role. The scene where Northam terrorized Bullock on his boat was very moving and was one of my favorite moments. I also liked the carnival hunting scene. think Northam was defeated too quickly. There are many other good pursuit scenes too, and sometimes it's smart too, and there are also some shocking moments, it's also a solid little underrated thriller, which has a lot of thrills, with a cool story, Sandra Bullock is great, I highly recommend this one! The management is great! Irwin Winkler does a great job! Work here with great camera work, adding a great atmosphere, good angles and keeping the movie at a very fast pace. The game is fantastic! Sandra Bullock is amazing as always and is amazing here, she is extremely friendly, tough as nails and yet very vulnerable, and I was able to stand her because as I said, I'm a bit like Angela, I go out hardly really appreciated his work in this movie! (Bullock rules !!!!!!!). Jeremy Northam is excellent as a villain, he was sneaky, unpredictable and very threatening, he was great. Dennis Miller is surprisingly correct and not annoying in his small role and has managed to bring comic relief. The rest of the cast is fine. Overall, I highly recommend this one! *** 1/2 out of 5
