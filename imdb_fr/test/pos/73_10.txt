Yes, I am a romantic who loves musicals and comedies and that suits perfectly! Julie Andrews gives a fascinating performance at the beginning and the end of this film with the production number "Whistling in the Dark". The seductive to outrageous number she plays in the middle of the story when she thinks Rock Hudson has seen a dazzling dancer / call girl and will certainly make you laugh. <br /> <br /> I only wish this film could be found on video or DVD because I would buy it in the blink of an eye for my personal library!
