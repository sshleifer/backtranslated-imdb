"Think like a Dinosaur" was a well produced and realized series of the "Outerlimits" series. The actor (Enrico Colantoni as Michael Burr) plays an impressive and convincing protagonist role. You can really identify with him and his "introspective" feelings about what to do for the girl he fell in love with (because he's been alone and disappointed for 2 years and feels desperate until "Kamala" comes back in his life with So he fears being transported, then the console and lets him know that everything will be ok, which ends up being a disappointment for both. she (the prototype) comes back ... .and she (clone) is sent to the planet of the other inhabitants, although the -Dino- and "Micheal" have not yet discovered what they had discovered. Michael decided to kill her or let her live, but what happened to her before meeting her (kamala) was very much related to what happened to his wife, his wife died the same way. professes a great deal of irregularity and sadness ... about what has should have been done and you are stuck with the 50/50 of what is right wr ng. Therefore, the equation "balance" is only that there is nobody. <br /> <br /> 10/10 I highly recommend watching this show.
