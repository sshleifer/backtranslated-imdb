The idiocracy had the feeling that Mike Judge was taking my thoughts on society and turning them into a film In fact, the film is a social commentary. It's almost like a documentary. Luke Wilson did a good job playing with a boring average (as in most of his films). <br /> <br /> Of course, idiocracy was an extreme case of the current state of society. But that's what makes most comedies funny, an extreme of any situation. Fiction is not so different from reality. <br /> <br /> With children who praise the materialistic Hip-Hop culture and who are proud to be ignorant. When people feel useless in life, they reproduce. Give them a goal in the world. And it seems that only the worst people reproduce the most. I can understand how others do not like it. It does not help most humor jokes about second-year bathrooms. Not very different from a Kevin Smith movie. <br /> <br /> Idiocracy throws logic, reason, all intelligence (for good reason). <br /> <br /> The return of Mike Judges was a coup de grace.
