Alfred Hitchcock's remake of "The man who knew too much" is usually not as good as the original, but it's for me one of the best movies of all time. I prefer it to "Vertigo" and "Rear Window". <br /> <br /> Like "North By Northwest", it's the story of an ordinary man thrown into the world of international intrigue. James Stewart plays the father of a son who is kidnapped because he is mistaken for an international spy. He will do everything in his power to get his son back and protect his family. <br /> <br /> The original was good at the moment, but it's hard to watch by today's standards. The remake has excellent production quality, an endearing Doris Day and a really scary bad guy. <br /> <br /> Do not bother renting this one, because you will want to see it again and again.
