I can not believe it ... after all these years, we finally found this trace ... it was to be called "The great suitor" at the stage of production. I lived in Oz at the time and, through a friend, I was watching one of the house's premises by filming ... It was I who taught these guys to speak Scottish and after all this time, I realized that one of them was Russell Crowe !!! It took me all these years to trace, I did not even know if the movie was going to be sifted as I left Oz the following month after the closing night. At that time, Russell Crowe was not the requested actor, but I did not know it was him before seeing the previous comment, and then rethinking the time of the filming ... unbelievable ... really delighted with myself! !!
