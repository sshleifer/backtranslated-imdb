What about a movie like Rock Star? A lot in fact! This is the type of movie that is almost done for critics to slam. It's also a film that I loved, as a MAJOR fan of hard rock, which was not loved, while being aware of its many flaws and the fact that the film, although a decent effort in some ways, missed the opportunity escape the greatness and become a classic rock cinema. Oh well .... <br /> <br /> I loved this movie - and I would see it again and again - but I know it's purely based on my personal taste - Rock Star is a movie that will appeal to anyone who has experienced elements of rock or hard rock lifestyle and wants to embark on the path of nostalgia. It was a good time for the metal heads. And it's good to have a movie that effectively captures that time (long forgotten by many non-rock fans.), As I think Rock Star did. This is one of the strengths of the film, the concert sequence. You will feel at home and how can a hard rock fan not like that? As for the atmosphere, the Rock Star gets a 10 out of 10. It also gets a 10 out of 10 for pure entertainment. If you want a movie to just let you go and have good memories of the past, then this is the movie for you. That's also why I loved this movie. <br /> <br /> But it's not a good movie. I understand it and if it was my job to look at movies in a professional way, I should probably be a little tough on this one. The problem with Rock star is the development of the character. <br /> <br /> What's wrong with the development of the character is that it is. No. The film has some scenes, rare but widely spaced, that evoke greatness: WARNING BRIEF SCENE SPOILERS: 3 examples- 1) When Izzy makes his stage debut (including his fall) <br /> 2) The first party "after show" with Emily (Anniston and Izzy.) <br /> <br /> 3) A little perspective - At the beginning, when the first singer is licensed (licensed) - the All the tone "business as usual "paves the way for what will happen. This is very effective. <br /> <br /> But the problem is that nothing ever comes. There is little or no development of character in anyone in this film, the characters of each are simply mentioned, but never fully explored. I do not think it's the fault of the actors / actresses, especially Anniston who makes great efforts, we just do not give them much to work. It's just that the script was weak and lacked the ability to go beyond the "formula" in the depth of the movie. The rock star was so drunk sometimes (even towards the end) that it was almost ridiculous. And, however, the scenes I mentioned were exceptional and very credible. Unfortunately, there was not much going on in the movie. <br /> <br /> Another critic mentioned the lack of accumulation towards the end and I agree, but there was lack of accumulation of anything. WHY is Izzy leaving at the end? Because he misses his girlfriend and the band does not let him write songs? He tests the limits of credibility. And, frankly, the end was just lame. It made no sense and had no reality. <br /> <br /> Watching this is almost like watching a movie where the writers of it said: OK, it happens here, then it happens, then that, etc. etc. In the end, it's no longer a movie about a boy whose dream has come true, it's just another thick love story. And you wonder why so many details are left out .... <br /> <br /> I hope I'm not too hard on Rock Star because I really loved it, but not for the good ones reasons. I would have liked to like this as a great movie about the highs and lows of rock glory. Instead, I liked it for its 80s feel, clothes, hair, lights, life ... Although many others liked it, I guess most are people who have lived the life of a rock fan, like me or some who play. I would have liked to see the movie go through and just be respected to be a good movie well told, instead of a clich√©. I think one of the problems was the length. Myself, I hate long movies, but it's a movie that should have been longer. If a movie is done really well, the length is not even felt: there is too much to tell in the story for it to be as short as it was. -This is one of the reasons why the story and the human beings described in the movie do not seem to develop much. <br /> <br /> Finally, it's a movie you can really enter. - but not a good movie. See for pleasure. See for entertainment. Look at it to go back to this wonderful space in which metal was not part of life, it was REALLY - and for non rock fans, see it for a glimpse of that life that meant and still means so much to many of us.
