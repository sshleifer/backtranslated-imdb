Little spoilers will follow, but nothing you would have learned from reading the back of the DVD. <br /> <br /> Held as a result of Renee Zellweger's wonderful central performance, Nurse Betty is a comedy that is both dark and misleading. . <br /> <br /> Suffering from emotional depression after witnessing the murder of her sordid husband, Betty, an already troubled and hopelessly unhappy waitress, is convinced that a character featured on her favorite soap opera is her fianc√© since long lost and leaves Kansas in Hollywood to find him. <br /> <br /> Instead of joking at the expense of Betty's mental state, writer John C. Richards is very likeable, Zellweger describing her as a lost innocent, not quite helpless but tragically nevertheless vulnerable. Crucially, she is never really a victim yet and although she is undoubtedly suffering horribly, the motives of the characters who treat her badly are understandable - even Greg Kinnear, as an object of her delusional affections, may be a selfish, arrogant but arrogant pig, but he sincerely believes that she is just a fanciful actress with tons of talent rather than a foolish stalker. <br /> <br /> The joke that pushed all the protagonists to go down to the same place (Betty's house at the same time) at the same time to get him out is as old as the cinema itself but it works pretty good here, even if the change of tone is unfortunate. <br /> <br /> Zellweger is ably supported by Kinnear and Morgan Freeman both of whom are doing a solid job, and in particular I am delighted to see Chris Rock show restraint in his previous scenes. <br /> <br /> Nurse Betty is not as cruel as you think, and not at all nasty, solid entertainment elevated to much more someth by the main actress.
