Michael Radford, the director of "The Merchant of Venice" does an amazing job opening the room because it makes it more accessible to everyone to have a good time in the cinema watching this thorny story of a horrible passage in history . The sumptuous production of Shakespeare's play is a feast for the eyes with its rich details of the sixteenth century Venice. <br /> <br /> This is a story of vengeance, prejudice and justice devised by William Shakespeare. After seeing the play a few times, we were not prepared for what to expect. Mr. Radford takes care of presenting the story in such detail that everyone can easily understand it. In addition, he used a version of English that makes more sense, rather than relying on the original text. In fact, the way Shylock speaks in the film does not shock at all, being himself a member of a minority marginalized by the Venetian authorities and the Catholic Church. <br /> <br /> Al Pacino formidable Shylock's portrait shows a man who is vulnerable, arrogant, vengeful, mean and totally human. Mr. Pacino highlights the character of the man who is defeated in court because of a technical detail. His own daughter has left him and everyone seems to be giving him up. At the end of the film, we see a man who has been reduced to being the target of hatred and ridicule on the part of everyone. <br /> <br /> Lynn Collins, Portia is a happy discovery. After seeing her eating lighter, she not only surprises, but makes the most of her role and time in front of the camera. She shows us that she is a very intelligent woman who comes to the rescue of her husband and best friend, who risked her well-being by trying to help Bassanio get Portia's hand. <br /> <br /> Jeremy Irons plays Antonio, the man who is looking for Shylock for a "bridging loan". After all, he knows his ships will return soon with a foreign fortune. Antonio gets much more than he negotiated by agreeing with Shylock loan terms. Antonio's best plans go astray when he is suddenly unable to fulfill his obligations. Mr. Irons gives a subtle performance. <br /> <br /> Joseph Fiennes makes a good appearance like Bassanio. Her beauty and charm make an impression on Portia, who clearly sees a soul mate in this young Venetian, because she knows it is made for her. In addition, in more modest roles, Kris Marshall, Zuleika Robinson and Charlie Cox help make the film a pleasant experience. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, this is the triumph of Mr Radford thanks to the vision he gives us of Venice and its citizens during a horrible period in the history of mankind .
