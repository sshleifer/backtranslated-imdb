A lush, beautifully written and edited cinematography, John Boorman's Beyond Rangoon is a must-see for anyone interested in world politics and the arc of personal transformation. It intertwines a personal and political narrative which continues to haunt me and which comes back to me frequently in the memory. The plot is captivating and the inner and outer courses are carefully and carefully paralleled, both cinematically and in the story. I have watched this film at least six times and it really is a magnifying glass. This is particularly relevant today, given the world events. Check it out, you will not regret it! By the way, NetFlix does not carry it yet, but you can ask it.
