I just watched this movie for the first time after finishing the book last week. What is the problem here? People admit that the performances are excellent - I mean, Lange is stellar! - and that the film is beautiful, but it has less than a '6'! I do not understand. Come on! The writing is not so bad! <br /> <br /> After reading a lot of Pulitzer's award-winning novels and seeing a lot of the films that come out of it, I think more than satisfying work has been done on the screenplay together. I thought that the reduction of all the dialogues in the novel was almost perfectly executed. This story had a fairly heavy amount of dialogue and was actually screened despite the fact that only a part of it was used. <br /> <br /> ** PART OF THE SPOILER BOOK ** I was, however, a little disappointed with the omission of the Ginny sub-parcel-essays-to-kill-Rose. I thought it was one of the most moving parts of the book, but it was probably a good bet to drop it. Film-hungry spectators, more than avid readers, tend to forgive the protagonists who draw antagonistic stories. This is likely to confuse Johnny Lunchpail and Joe Sixpack. <br /> <br /> If you liked the book, you will like the movie. If you hated the book, you will probably hate the movie. <br /> <br /> ******** <br /> <br /> Rog
