Abel Davos (Lino Ventura) has been on the run for more than 10 years and is hiding in Milan, Italy. In his absence, he was sentenced to death in France, his country of origin, for his crimes. Disillusioned by his life in Italy and the police tightening on him, he decides to return to his former battleground in Paris. Sending his wife Thérèse and his two young sons before him in Nice, Abel and his next commander, Raymond Naldi, make a final flight to finance their new life in France. The robbery yields a meager half a million francs, much less than their sources have suggested, despite this and, pursued by the police, they both go to Nice, where they hide briefly. After stealing a pleasure boat in a local, they want to go to San Remo, a tourist place where they will mix more easily, but they are stopped by armed customs officers on a deserted beach, a shooting ensues and Thérèse and Naldi are both killed. Davos, now wounded, accompanied by two children, will be easily identifiable by the police. He therefore asks his old Parisian friends to send help, but they have left since their old friend hid and are not too inclined to flee. a risk themselves, so they send a little thief, Eric Stark (Jean Paul Belmondo) to save him. Davos is disgusted to see such a humble thief come to his aid. Despite the fact that he immediately attacks the charming Stark, he tries to find out why he was snubbed, but their betrayal does not stop there. <Br/> <br /> The All Hazards Class was written for the screen by former death row and court writer Jose Giovanni (The Hole, The Sicilian Clan), with Ventura already aboard the project, Giovanniwanted A single person to lead the project, Ventura, suggested an assistant director who had drawn his attention to a previous project, a Claude Sautet, better known at the time for having assisted Georges Franju in The Eyes Without Face. Sautet immediately accepted and the rest, as they say, belongs to the story. Sautet directed a gangster movie, which plays a lot on characters and relationships. Davos, who is constantly hiding, has plenty of time to think about his life, his past, present and future, his friendships that no longer seem to be what he thought he was, his now deceased wife and what will happen of his two young sons. Ventura as a character actor has always amazed me. Convinced of both the police and crime, he is here sublime and powerful as his world collapses around him, as well as the loneliness and loneliness of a man The former job of a fighter of Ventura is very useful because it launches the Parisian thugs with a disconcerting ease. Belmondo as Stark animates the other scenario of the film, that of its nascent relationship with a girl he meets during the trip. With her frank charm, her revelation to this woman in danger that he is only a "Thief" and that "the only good thing about me is my left", while he knocks his aggressor, is also a joy to see, falls for him anyway. Belmondo's performance had been neglected at the time, Godard's "A bout soufflé" having been published only three weeks earlier, Godard getting the credit for discovering the new kid, his versatility in these two films, while being able to to be admired and admired. Sautet's film is a class affair, using a lot of attractive places, the film also has a very sparse dialogue, Sautet preferring to let the actors do the work with a minimum of glances or sufficient glances to advance the story, needles to say that this fan of Black will take a look at Sautet's work in the future.
