Rarely does a film capture a drama and such intense emotion. What makes this film so disturbing is that the drama seems so real, it's almost hard to remember that it's just a movie. This is by far the performance of Madeline Stowe and Alan Rickman in their careers. The film is almost like a theatrical production in the way it is staged and enlightened. The only drawback of this film is that it is very difficult to get a copy. I have not seen it yet except on Laserdisc. This really powerful movie deserves a digitally remastered transfer and a special DVD edition. It is really good.
