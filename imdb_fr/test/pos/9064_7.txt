This film was original in a non-original way. Although many films have covered the subject of suicide and psychiatric institutions, it was still a question of caring for patients and improving them with the help of the doctor. In this movie, however, we follow a depressed guy who falls in love with a suicidal girl will stop at nothing to make her happy even if she does not care at all about happiness, she just wants to die. It was a very interesting romantic comedy that has nothing less than pleasant. This is a fun game to check if you have the chance, you just have to be open on the subject. Overall, I give him a 6.4, I just voted 9 to get the highest rating :)
