Sony Pictures Classics, I'm watching you! Sony has the rights to the records Harry - you have to distribute the film and you will get a radical increase in sales of his back catalog! Anyway, this is an excellent study of a fascinating musician, terribly unknown, filled with great stories, better music, and it could have lasted 3 hours more and I would have loved even more. I saw it at the American Cinemateque Mods & Rockers Festival, at the Aero Theater in Santa Monica, where it was presented in a packed house. They sent people to the door! I have watched many Mods & Rockers films and I want to assure you that no other film has sold, let alone fired. Watch it at the movies, buy the DVD and make sure that a small company [* cough SONY cough *] gets it back as soon as possible!
