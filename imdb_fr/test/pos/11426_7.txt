Seeing Laurel without Hardy in a movie seems strange, but entertaining anyway. It is a well-made parody of what has become a classic silent film and which highlights Stan's talents very well. Although his images with Oliver Hardy are excellent, these early solo efforts give you an idea of ​​his skill and skill if he had continued in the tradition of Keaton and Chaplin as an individual star. The dance sequence with his real wife in the cafe scene is the best part of the photo, and there are some pretty fun passages to do with Laurel's great steps. And the climax of the bullfight is a jewel, because even the bull almost fell. And I like the irony of the scene where he is buried in hats and arrives with his familiar bowler hat Laurel and Hardy. Although I really like the Laurel and Hardy teams and I feel that there has never been such a funny comedy duo, it's nice to see them from time to time (see THE FIGHTING KENTUCKIAN that Hardy did with Duke as another example.)
