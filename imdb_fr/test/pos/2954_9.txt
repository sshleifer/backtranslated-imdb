I always thought my father had a second life and was looking forward to the development of 51 Birch Street when I sat down to watch it for the first time. Surprisingly, the trip of this film took me to places I did not expect and led me to rethink assumptions and judgments. A remarkable personal story told in an intelligent but direct way. I especially enjoyed the filmmaker's use of writing his mother's daily newspaper type - very effective. I read the previous comment and I want to note that the sound was good when I watched it and that I suspect that the film was somewhat modified or that the theater could have contributed to a lower sound quality for the other author.
