It looks good and you will probably think that there is no reason to rent this movie! But do! I did not expect anything from this movie, just enough to pass the time, but I was addicted from the beginning! Two interesting premises - A bank robbery gone wrong, a million dollars missing and two girls on the road to start a new life - How will these two stories meet? Just when you think you know in which direction the film is heading, it's a 180 and you're amazed by the twists and turns of the plot! The end is big but unexpected, and you never miss it - always a good sign - rent it or even buy it, you will not be disappointed!
