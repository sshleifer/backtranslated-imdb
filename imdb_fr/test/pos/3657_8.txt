Hari Om speaks of an impossible love between a French tourist and the rickshaw driver who agrees to take him to an appointment with his indifferent boyfriend. A sort of third-world road movie, from reverie to delirious comedy, is distinguished by the remarkable performance of Vijay Raaz, who became one of the busiest actors in India after his appearance as event planner in The Marriage of Mira Nair, Monsoon. <br /> <br /> In an interview, Raaz is fairly spared by her success, answering questions carefully and thoughtfully. He discovered the taste of the acting profession and joined a great theater troupe while he was at university, but for such a formal training, he is surprisingly inarticulate about his art. He speaks of honesty and purity as the source of his approach, and the sincere desire to communicate something authentic to the public is clear. On the screen, Raaz conveys an emotional integrity and dramatic assurance that elevates his characters to an extraordinary level, and director Bharatbala perfectly directed him. He has a wonderfully expressive face in which the camera plunges; the close-ups of this face are as convincing as photos of Camille Natta, who is as beautiful as the French Isa.
