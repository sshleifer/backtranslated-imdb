Before seeing the Anngels & Demons overview today, I got rid of all the uncertainties that could prevent me from taking advantage of it; the huge amount of hate against Dan Brown, the fact that it was written by Dan Brown and that Dan Brown's name was slapped on all the posters. I came in with an open mind and was expecting the worst, but instead I got a 2 1/2 hour Roman cat and mouse game with Forrest Gump, which is definitely a good value for entertainment. <br /> <br /> The film is vaguely suspended from the novel itself. Robert Langdon (Hanks), a Harvard symbologist, flies to Rome after the Pope's sudden death and his re-election by Pope Conclave. Carmelengo, Patrick McKenna (McGregor), takes care of all this. However, he soon learns a new threat, one that involves a secret brotherhood making his presence known, an anti-business time bomb to which the Vatican City is destined and the kidnapping of four cardinals. Langdon, who uses his intelligence (and believe me, you will hear A LOT) is responsible for finding and saving them using the mysterious Path of Enlightenment. Vittoria Vetra (Zurer), a CERN scientist, is also the co-creator of antimatter. <br /> <br /> The film itself runs at an uneven pace. One minute, Langdon and the Swiss Guards hasten to save a cardinal's mark. The next minute, he bores you with useless information about all the items he passes at random, which obviously slows down the thriller's long-awaited footage. It's an interesting reading on paper, but on screen, it can go both ways. <br /> <br /> The characters are decently written on the big screen. Ewan McGregor achieves a convincing performance as Patrick McKenna, a discreet but knowledgeable man, strong in accent included. Tom Hanks is slightly more agile, intellectually and physically, since his last performance in the mediocre Da Vinci Code. Stellen Skarsgard plays Commander Richter, the right leader of the Swiss Guard. Unfortunately, neither his performance nor that of Ayelet Zurer are worthy of interest. Instead of playing a role in history, they are simply put aside as an asset. <br /> <br /> However, Angels & Demons accomplishes what DVC could never do; an exciting fast-paced film filled with satisfying explosions, magnificent reconstructions of St. Peter's Square and the Basilica (including many churches) and a pulsed bomb counting at midnight. Ron Howard is doing a decent job leading this second Langdon adventure, this time taking a lot of criticism to heart and almost completely exchanging the boring dialogue for (almost) tense pursuits. <br /> <br /> While newcomers may call it a "National Treasure 3" with a much greater threat, there is still enough contagious thriller / thriller and brilliant shots of Rome to breathe . One might think differently to the radical changes in the movies, but given the amount of blasphemy and inaccuracy it generates, A & D is extremely successful in keeping the viewer locked on the screen this time rather than on his shoulder asleep. <br /> <br /> A good book-film adaptation that will seduce and entertain. <br /> <br /> 7.4 / 10
