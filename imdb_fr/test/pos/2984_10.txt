Well ..... I would not want to teach anyone, but I feel the need to say some things that I think are important about this BEAUTIFUL movie. I saw it for the first time in 1976 (I was 14 years old), and then again a year later. That was it. The rest consisted of the pink disc of Elton John's soundtrack, which deepened the music and story deeper and deeper into my heart. What is the depth? A week ago, my cousin gave me a VHS copy. (No DVD yet) Boy .... was I surprised !! Poets have always supported this deep childhood and adolescence of beauty, of love, of God, of the idealistic pursuit, to stay with you forever. Since they occur mainly at the level of the heart (no intellect at the moment!), They define the contours of your soul as a sculptor with a stone would. If at times we did not tend to forget how right they were, we might be better able to understand the meaning of every minute, every decision, every turn in our lives. <br /> <br /> So, I admit that I feel nostalgia. But what's fascinating is watching the film again and, thanks to this trip back in time, to better understand why we, the people of the sixties, grew up like us. The spirit of this era is all here: a Genesis created far from the official world of consumption and economic success, making love not war, the beautiful ballads pop, the poetry of the lyrics, a totally romantic vision of the rebellion teenager with the awakening of a sexuality carefully wrapped in a tender and chaste love, these two solitary spirits always filled with childhood innocence growing together as they learn mutual commitment and transform themselves into "adults". <br /> <br /> I showed the film to a group of young people at school and they abounded in such simplistic and cynical comments regarding him as naive and stupid. Guys, be serious !! Cinema is an art. As an art, it reflects not only human emotions, but also historical moments. And that's exactly what "Friends" does in a great way. This reflects an idyllic idea of ​​rebellion and new beginning that we all dreamed of when we were 15 years old. I am now a musician and I feel that some of us, artists from elsewhere, dream again! How could we live differently? It's "Friends", it's "Brother Sun Sister Moon", it's "Hair". These were epochs still foreign to AIDS, foreign to the explicit and vulgar texts of pop songs without melody, pornography presented as "sexuality", to this new barbaric "world order" developing after September 11th. <br /> <br /> What a comforting experience to see Paul and Michelle, timidly and tenderly exploring the new fantasies of their romantic world. What a trip to the bottom of our hearts: in Paris, Elton John at its best, this urban scenario surrounded by 2 CV Citroëns and VW Beetles. What a pure air comes from the peaceful cottage in the Camargue, surrounded by fishing ponds and wild horses. They made us who we are, like Serrat in Spain, Brel in France, Peter Paul and Mary, Joan Baez, Luther King, the Beatles, the first Bee Gees, the Spirituals of Belafonte, Gandhi, the Gospel of Elvis. <br /> <br /> People are still hoping: get this picture. Start with innocence and grow from there. You will know what it is. And from there, you will have a solid and more truthful foundation. ideals to look for in life, a way of managing personal and global affairs. We need it so much today! Give yourself a chance and maybe one day the cynics' time will end. (I have an extra VHS copy) <br /> <br /> Santiago Zuleta. Bogota - Colombia.
