Cactus Flower is what I call a "pizza film" - a personal favorite that never fails to satisfy. Perfect for a night out at home with a pizza. Know all the lines (and what lines!) By heart only increases the pleasure. <br /> <br /> Because so many others here have told the plot, I will simply add the correction that Bergman's character, Miss Dickinson, was a nurse-receptionist, meaning she was a qualified nurse - and so an educated person - not "just" a receptionist. <br /> <br /> Bergman's performance in this film - and the film itself - was largely rejected at the time, but today's audience will marvel at its scope; not just the impeccable timing of the comic, but the ability to make us believe that his character ignores his own feelings while revealing them so clearly to Toni and to ourselves. Although the overall plot has credibility, Bergman's performance is convincing: honest and quite believable. <br /> <br /> Jack Weston's performance as Matthau's former friend and co-conspirator, Harvey, is also remarkable. No one could deliver a zinger like Weston and I.A.L. Diamond's script gives him a lot. For example: "It's such a dirty, dirty big lie that he has class." Weston excelled in the slightly shabby characters, as he exuded a warmth that allowed you to forgive the flaws of his characters. <br /> <br /> The film is a fairly simple adaptation of the play Abe Burrows (itself adapted from a French play by Barillet and Gredy). On Broadway, Matthau's role was played by Barry Nelson. Bergman by Lauren Bacall and Hawn by Brenda Vaccaro. It lasted 1,234 performances (three years) and was nominated for two Tony Awards (Vaccaro and Burt Brinckerhoff, played by Igor). <br /> <br /> For me, the score of the film, written and adapted by the legendary Quincy Jones is another strong point. The main theme (A Time for Love is Anytime) is played by Sarah Vaughn during opening and closing credits. It is also insinuated in various arrangements throughout the film, especially when the romantic piano music highlights Berman's speech in front of Hawn in the record store. Jones has also created covers of popular songs of the time (To Sir With Love, I am a believer) for the nightclub scenes. As with all elements of the film, talent, taste and professionalism are evident. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, few modern romantic comedies can hold a candle to this classic. It's great to have it finally available on DVD. It's time to call for a pizza ...
