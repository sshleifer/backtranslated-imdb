At the beginning of this film, which I watched on IFC in the early hours of the morning, I was overwhelmed by a feeling of claustrophobia and general discomfort. The feeling of being trapped without any means of escape was so powerful that I did not know if I wanted to keep looking ... even though it did not really seem to me to have much choice, as the situation was convincing. <br /> <br /> But little by little, this discomfort faded (although it never completely disappeared), and I was drawn to the difficulties of Tessa & Bobby, and I was hoping really hope they would pull themselves together. <br /> <br /> A moving and powerful story fits perfectly into a very small package. I did not know that Sarah Polley had anything to do with this before going through her anecdotes, so now I love it even more. <br /> <br /> I recommend it without hesitation. ... if you have the chance to see him sometimes on the Independent Film Channel, or smart enough to find another way to see him.
