This is without a doubt the most exciting and satisfying film I've seen in years! The intrigue seen in the print is almost banal: a ship crashes on a desert planet with three suns, the survivors have to adapt to the landscape and to each other, then the darkness falls and the monsters appear. The pilot Fry, after a moment of cowardice during the descent into the atmosphere where she almost dropped the passengers, takes charge of the group and calls for the help of the convicted murderer Riddick to drive them in the dark until 'At the exit ship - it is he who has an improved eye surgery who can see in the dark. But it's really not that simple: each character is complex, three-dimensional, with contradictory features, so you never really know who's good or who's bad. <br /> <br /> The performances are uniformly superb - Radha Mitchell shows Fry taking drugs for leadership, overcoming his own fears and trying to prevent further bloodshed, while Cole Hauser, bringing Riddick back in detention, shows that it has its own agenda and idiosyncratic norms. But the film belongs to Vin Diesel under the name of Riddick - it has the largest magnetic screen presence I've seen in years. Most of the film, his face is in the shadows, and he does not say much, but he still attracts your attention. Sometimes, it catches your attention by not talking - or by not moving. And Diesel does not trivialize the character, as it could be done so easily, by giving him a "golden heart" - Riddick is always a nasty and vicious man when approaching the ship - he just lets us glimpse those first hesitant steps since worrying only about oneself to care for others. <br /> <br /> Technically, the film is very good. The light effects are excellent at both ends of the spectrum - the triple ray of sun too bright and total darkness. Special effects showing Riddick's points of view and monsters add to the suspense, as do the sound effects of monsters flying and using ultrasound to "see" (the monsters themselves are anatomically plausible and scary enough). The editing is so tight that it is sometimes very bad: there is literally no padding in this film, no fade, no time to reorient. <br /> <br /> From the initial shot to the end of the credits you have keep your mind about yourself. Every scene, every line of dialogue, every shot is important. See him three times to understand everything. <br /> <br /> My only disadvantage concerns science: the solar system, as the model shows, is impossible (the planets revolve around the suns and not the other way around). However, it does not affect human history, so I did not take any points for that.
