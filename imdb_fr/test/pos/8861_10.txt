Many people have a movie that they think is their favorite movie. My film will always be John Carpenter's Thing! The main reason this film is a cult film is perhaps the splash effects created primarily by the genius Rob Bottin and the fact that it is the film that made Kurt Russell what he is today (With Escape from NY) In my opinion, this is not a good movie because of the effects, but the story, the atmosphere and, of course, the acting. I have watched thousands and thousands of movies (3 to 6 every day in the last 10 years), but none have had as much impact on me as this one, not even the big "Das Boot ". <br /> <br /> Here's my suggestion to those who love science fiction and horror movies: get into the right chair in your house. Make sure no one interrupts you. If you do not have a projector, sit near your TV and watch this miracle of a movie. Let him absorb you and you'll see him how I want him! <br /> <br /> Best visibility period: End of February between 5 and 9 pm
