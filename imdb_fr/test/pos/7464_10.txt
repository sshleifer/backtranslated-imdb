My friends and I rented this movie simply to please a friend who was very keen to rent it when he had no idea what it was. We all thought it would be like "a Canadian-American pie" but when we watched it, we were completely surprised, we all remained silent throughout the movie and we loved it! It did not look anything like American Pie and there was a plot that teen girls will definitely love (seeing that the guy was defeated at the end), after that night it became my favorite movie, not only for his plot but also for the actors. and the great writing. There was not a moment when I thought it was incredible. Everything is very realistic and easy to understand for anyone living in a small, unpromising city. I love this movie and I would recommend renting it the next time you get the chance, it's worth it.
