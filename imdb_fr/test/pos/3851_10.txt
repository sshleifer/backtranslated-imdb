Oh my God!! I like this movie sooooooooooooooooooooo !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It's so amazing ...... I loved it as a little baby and I still love it as an adult. This is my favorite Disney movie of all time allllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll! You should look, look and like. My friends and I are watching this a ton ..... It's so good. I recommend it to anyone who is a child or a child at heart. My favorite part is the song and the dance number with all strays and Thomas O'Malley. The writers / producers / directors have completely nailed this one ..... yes, they nailed it to the wall. <br /> <br /> xoxo ~ Wolly ~ xoxo
