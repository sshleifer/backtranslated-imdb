I loved it, but I'm a child of the 80's. I loved Rainbow Bright all my childhood. I do not know if the little ones these days would be very interested in the show, mine was not. (But I'm fine, I bought it for myself anyway, I just brought the baby so that the teller does not look at me in a funny way.) I like non-violent drama and colorful landscapes. It just reminds me of a simpler time before the cartoons have more violence than our local news can legally show. :) Although I can be just a little biased on the subject. After all, I was Rainbow Bright 6 years in a row for Halloween ........ I wonder if they make a Rainbow Bright adult costume. Lol.
