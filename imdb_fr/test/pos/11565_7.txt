This is a pretty little French comedy mute about a man who tells another that he can not stay in this castle for an hour because of his obsession. And, once the guy enters the house, it looks a lot more like a mad house crazy or perhaps the aftermath of LSD! Although there are ghosts and skeletons, there is a strange menagerie of animals, strange special effects and gags. It is terribly difficult to describe but the only visuals make the film worthy of interest. HOWEVER, be aware that the indulgent director also had many "funny gags" that fell flat and hurt the film. His "camera turns" were not so difficult, but annoying and stupid. IGNORE THEM AND KEEP THE WATCH - things get better. The film is fast, funny and deserves to be seen. In particular, I really enjoyed watching the acting and aggression of Max Linder - he was so expressive and funny! Too bad it's almost forgotten today. For an interesting but very sad reading, check out IMDb's biography on him.
