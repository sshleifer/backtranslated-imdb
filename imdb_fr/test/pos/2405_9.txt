Well, it took them 4 tries, but they finally succeeded! In this 4th sequel to the Karate Kid franchise, the producers really hit a homerun! Well, first of all, I congratulate them for finally getting rid of Ralph Macchio. I felt that he had never served the role of karate kid. I would have preferred to see Danny 'Ralph Mouth' Most in this role. Macchio proved to be the best movie of the series, and look at where is his career! Instead, they put a girl! They had Hillary Swank, best known for playing a variety of sheman roles in all the movies in which she plays. Personally, I do not like his sharp teeth, but it's a personal preference. But still, look at how Karate Kid 4 launched his career in orbit! She won a damn Oscar. Jiminey Christmas! In the meantime, where is Ralphy ?? He should get out of amateur porn like Screech or something like that. <br /> <br /> In any case, my only disagreement with the film is that they have a girl who does karate. As a self-proclaimed karate master, I am the proud owner of a white belt since 8 8/8 years. The first thing they taught me is that there is no place in the martial arts for girls ... well, except for judo ... but it's a little cheerful. So, for the sake of precision, I think they should have stayed with another man for that role. I thought maybe Dennis Franz. He would give the role the required depth. <br /> <br /> Maybe they will listen to my suggestions and make the necessary adjustments in Karate Kid 5. It's also Pat Marita who is no more. I thought perhaps that Justin Guarini would be the ideal substitute for his adorable compatriot, Mr. Miyagi. It will give a new meaning to "wax without wax". HAHAHAHAHAHA funny huh? Anyway, if you are looking for an exciting movie full of karate and triumph of the human spirit, Karate Kid 4 is for you. Do not waste your time with 1-3. This is Karate Kid for you! This is karate kid for ages!
