OK, I'm a sucker. I liked it. I had no expectations and filled them all. It was a terrible movie. I liked it. I managed to use a DVD of excessive use. Nobody can understand my obsession. I can not, either, to tell you the truth. For those who saw the film, it's not a surprise, but I asked the clerk of the video store if I could buy a copy and I could because there were two in stock and only one had was saved and more than half of the time had passed for me. <br /> <br /> Now the movie is terrible. The special effects are terrible. The acting is terrible, but I loved it. The actors are stupid, the plot stupid, the many blunders - as if we could see through the monsters, Do not be deafening, etc ... <br /> <br /> You must really love B-Movies for to make the most of it ... alcohol helps the others a lot.
