There are many, many older films that deserve to be transferred to DVD format. This is surely one of them. A triumph of Anthony Quinn! Dozens of films describe the victims of the Nazi atrocities before and during the war, but I do not think any of them have plunged into the psyche of the victim and the predator as well as this one. Anthony Quinn was really a man for all seasons. He had the ability to portray the humblest of creatures devoid of any human veil to a creature of extreme animalism and make it believable in the eyes of spectators who looked without reflection after what they had just seen! Really one of our greatest artists. We miss him.
