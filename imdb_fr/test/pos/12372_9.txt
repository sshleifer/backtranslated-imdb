Victor Sjöström's "Körkarlen" plunges the viewer into the depths of life for much of his life, with grim scenes of alcoholic degradation, domestic violence and suicidal despair, but the most memorable passages involve the mythical image of death. Here, death is a ghostly horse-drawn car, driven by a miserable sinner who was the last person to die on New Year's Eve. For a year, the wretch must gather the souls of the dead and, after twelve months of this horrible servitude, the soul of the driver is finally released when the last one to die on December 31st becomes his new driver. <br /> <br /> The scenes featuring this car (the movie was called "The Phantom Carriage" or "The Phantom Chariot" in English-speaking countries) are strange and hypnotizing. They use a double exposure cinematography quite sophisticated at the time and still effective today. The most striking is that the car goes to the bottom of the ocean to collect the soul of a person who drowned. As fascinating as these scenes are, however, most of the film is devoted to the infernal spiral of David Holm, interpreted by the director himself in the sober portrait of a man who gave up the opportunity to lead a decent life . In flashbacks, we see Holm having a nice day at the beach with his wife, children and brother, and he seems to be a perfectly ordinary guy. Abruptly, without argument or explanation, we see Holm as an alcoholic wreck, in conflict with the law and alienated from his family. Usually, this before-and-after jump may seem like a narrative deficiency, but in this case, the filmmakers trust us to complete the familiar and sordid details ourselves. It seems that Holm was misled by his friendly friend George, the drinking companion who tells for the first time the story of the Phantom Chariot, but whatever the cause of his downfall, Holm seems to be a lost cause, a naughty drunkard who take evil moves. pleasure in hurting his family and refusing to reform. <br /> <br /> While David Holm is our central character, the true catalyst of the story is a young Salvation Army nurse who is very interested in his case and believes in it. despite his hateful behavior. When the nurse herself is dying - indirectly because of her responsibilities on behalf of Holm - she asks to see him and inadvertently triggers a chain of events that will lead to her recovery. <br /> <br /> Sometimes, this film resembles Dickens' account of Scrooge's use of ghost visitors, which incites a deeply flawed man to take stock of his life, to suffer from his misplaced behavior and reform. I also remembered the drama of Terjn Vigen from 1917 in Sjöström, in which a man was returning from prison to find his empty house and his family left (a sequence resonates here). The director also reiterates a classic theme of Scandinavian folklore, previously discovered in his "Berg-Ejvind och hans hustru" (aka "The outlaw and his wife", 1918), according to which no man can escape his fate. This time, however, one could argue that David Holm really manages to escape his seemingly inevitable fate, as he is offered an unexpected second chance to make amends. <br /> <br /> Spectators who expect a dip in the supernatural will appreciate the sequence featuring the phantom coolant of the title, but that might not be prepared for the painful examination of the alcoholic drop of a troubled man. But those who have a taste for intense and powerful silent drama will appreciate "Körkarlen" in its entirety. He stands with the best serious cinema of his time and is certainly one of the most accomplished works of Sjöström.
