First, let's call this movie what it is: <br /> <br /> 1. It's a wellness film with a message. <br /> <br /> 2. The acting is correct, the dialogue slightly better, the value of production rather good. <br /> <br /> 3. Rugby scenes ... barely passable. <br /> <br /> But here's the thing: it's not something that was invented by Hollywood and it's not being a fiercely accurate portrait of the sport. It is rather a pretty good representation of most real people, under real circumstances, and a real scenario. Of course, they could have done the sport better, but my vote: it's a very good job. <br /> <br /> (And then, I can not think of many football, baseball, hockey or football movies that are true to this sport ... Go Bull Durham?) > <br /> I'm not a rugby player (I was a wrestler) but I graduated from Highland, I attended the race from 1986 to 1990 and, on occasion, I trained with the guys from Rugby. My brother-in-law, however, was one of the founding members of the Highland Rugby Club in 1976. (His youngest brother, Billy, played the following year, if I remember correctly. has a Highland rugby site on highlandrugby.net which deals with the history of the team. <br /> <br /> At the time, the club had already existed for ten years and had long since acquired a reputation for excellence. It is a fact that they have concentrated on "general" subjects of formation: devotion, honor, discipline, effort, not tactics. I thought that the rugby guys I knew had a bit of a headache, but I think maybe I'm a little jealous. They were faithful to the belief system promoted by Gelwix. <br /> <br /> Regarding the problems of "cultural mixing" evoked, it might be interesting to note that while I was In the 80s, one of the largest schools in the city was South High School - and his students were divided among the other 3 SLC primary schools. To be honest, the pre-80 Highland was a nice white bread ... I have a photo of the 1977 (I think) team that shows a * All * White Club. South High, on the other hand, was a much more racially integrated school before it was closed: I had two friends from South who joined the team, a Tongan, a Samoan and, as I recall, there was an island-nation group Players who have joined '88 -'90. I do not think anyone has questioned the credibility of the team when they adopted Maori traditions (or other cultures): if there's one thing that's obvious to these guys, it's that they walked. <br /> <br /> And as for the strength of the team compared to the best high school teams in the world: yes, it's true that US-Rugby, on average, as a whole, does not represent especially good against the best elsewhere. There are exceptions, but hey, it's a simple fact that Rugby has neither the impact nor the visibility needed to develop the multiple traditions of excellence in the United States that exist in other countries. <br /> <br /> That said, Judge Highland on his merits: <br /> <br /> - the * only * team to qualify for the National Rugby Championship every year of 25 years of history . <br /> <br /> - a record win of 392 wins, 9 losses. Read it again ... winning coach of all American sports in history. <br /> <br /> - regular international tours. <br /> <br /> - some convincing victories against legitimate international teams. <br /> <br /> Are they the best in the world? Maybe some years, probably not most ... but they are pretty good on a constant basis. And it's disrespectful of the game to stop them, while Highland Rugby may be the best ambassador for sport in the United States.
