This film does not present the exceptional graphics proposed by American Beauty or The Ice Storm and, since it was made after these films, can not be described as very original either: the music, although slightly brilliant, is very similar to that of American Beauty. <br /> <br /> The story has some similarities with the ice storm in particular (as well as Sigourney Weaver). Without intention perhaps, the film seems to try to recreate too much the success of the two aforementioned films. Sometimes, history tends to be a little more superficial than its bigger and better "brothers" because of the slowness of the debates or the absence of the most effective dialogues. Here, writing can not be compared to that of American Beauty. But that can be said of most of the movies ever made, even the best and there is still a lot to like: the score and (efficient, given the cast) effective. It should be noted that Emile Hirsch will shine a few years later in the exceptional "Into The Wild". <br /> <br /> Overall, I can recommend this film if you like suburban dramas, even if it's not the first on a list. Among the must-haves, which would be surmounted by: 1 American beauty 2 Ice storm 3 little children. <br /> <br /> After seeing and loving them, consult this one.
