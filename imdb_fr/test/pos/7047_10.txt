I saw this film for the first time in the mid 80's and I thought it was a funny movie. As I get older, I watch this film for different reasons. I like to see him when I feel sad / nostalgic for my "lost youth". I was a teenager (14 years old) at the time of the release of this film, which allowed me to identify with many of the same problems / dilemmas that those faced by campers / CIT in this film. I like to see the clothes that were worn at that time and hear the same old urban legends as told on the canoe cruise. The film is also full of funny liners. I highly recommend this film to all teenagers from the late 70s to the early 80s.
