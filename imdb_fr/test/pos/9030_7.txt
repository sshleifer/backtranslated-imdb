If there had not been To Kill A Mockingbird, this movie would be much more famous. If Gregory Peck had not played the role of Addicus Fitch, the role played here would be much more commendable. Without William Faulkner, perhaps killing a mocking bird might never have been written in his shadow. <br /> <br /> I found this film sadly familiar, because it showed me that one of my favorite movies, To Kill a Mocking Bird, may not have been as original as I had always thought about it. Perhaps he was inspired by this very similar movie. Oh, the "polar" is different, but the underlying story, a "white" just and fair advocate against a southern white city defending a black man is quite familiar. And, written by a woman, Mockingbird focuses on rape, the ultimate betrayal of a woman as this film focuses between brothers against the hate of his brothers, the rape that a man feels by fraternal treason. <br /> <br /> There is no depth of Mockingbird here. Not the comfort that Addicus brings with his presence. So, all you have left is the sadness that Harper Lee's Mockingbird makes fun of, whether she intends to remove the plot from the film or not. Nothing has changed in the last ten years or so since she may have read Faulkner's book and seen her film while at university, in Alabama, unconsciously or not. Nothing has changed in race relations and some may say that nothing has changed even in recent years. <br /> <br /> This is sadly familiar, and we would like an addicus of our time to correct all that. Where Mockingbird gives you hope, rocking into Addicus' arms and waiting for a morning of better times, this film just leaves you sad that the pride of blacks can be equal to or greater than that of whites. But the pride of one or the other is not an answer at all. <br /> <br /> It's more of the Addicus response we need, the comfort that we are all imperfect and that in our fragility we should have pity on each other, face to face. other in our differences.
