I'm not Ebert. What I am is compassionate and I have never felt more compassion for a fictional character than for Leland P. Fitzgerald. Sorry if I do not offer criticism, but I see only perfection in this film. I'm sure many who watch this movie will never see the same things as me, but if you look pretty well, you may see something you did not expect. I read that Leland's character was flawed. It seems to me that the author of this letter could not see beyond the question presented by this film. I'm sorry for those who do not see the answers provided by this movie. Open your heart more than your mind and you may be able to let Leland P. Fitzgerald show you a world that really makes sense. Exceptional history with extraordinary acting. Ryan Gosling deserves to be talked about.
