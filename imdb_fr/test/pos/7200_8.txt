After reading this: "When it was released in 2002, its budget of $ 47 million, or FRF 327,000,000, would make it the most expensive French film of all time. However, Asterix and Obelix against Caesar (1999) had a budget of $ 48 million, or 274 620 000 FRF, which would make it supposedly the most expensive French film of all time. I've never seen, I loved the scripts, the clothes (especially Cleopatra's) and the atmosphere of the movie, it's so happy and joyful, I found the jokes smart and hilarious and I have to consider that this film is part of my favorite comedies of all time! <br /> <br /> The distribution is also excellent, with Monica Bellucci (who is very beautiful like Cleopatra) Gerard Depardieu, (great Obelix! Christian Clavier, Jamel Debbouze (whom I saw for the first time in '' Amélie Poulain '') among others! :) <br /> <br /> I recommend this film even to the nè do not know the comics Asterix and Obelix You will have a lot of fun! <br /> <br /> also called "Asterix and Obelix : Miss Key in Hand "- Brazil
