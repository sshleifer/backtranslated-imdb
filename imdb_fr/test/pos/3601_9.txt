This film tells a story of the Second World War with a touching romance, a bit of fantasy and a significant emotion - as well as beautiful landscapes. Nicholas Cage never fails and does a great job. And so do the other main characters. A key figure, the doctor / father played by John Hurd, delivers (to his daughter) one of the best definitions of love I have ever heard. Some events are a little too fortuitous to be real, but I apologize, knowing that it is partly a fairy tale and a fantasy. My wife and I loved the movie. And it's nice to see people taking the risk of loving the enemy. A man who left the theater near us told his wife, "This is the way to make war!" I think you'll see what he means when you look at the Italian occupants of this beautiful Greek island.
