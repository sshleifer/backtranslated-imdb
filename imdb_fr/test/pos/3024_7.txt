I remember seeing the trailer of this movie on its first outing and it was pretty cool. I have never had the chance to see him though. When I went to Blockbuster to rent videos, I thought I should watch it. After all, I loved "Silence of the Lambs" and "Se7en", and if you enjoyed these movies, you might have a soft spot for "The Cell". The concept of the story is very interesting. Enter physically into the mind of a killer, I can not imagine the world in which they live. The acting game is actually quite decent. Jennifer Lopez is the only one I can say that is not terrible, but she is doing a credible job. I recommend it for a scary thriller. <br /> <br /> 7/10
