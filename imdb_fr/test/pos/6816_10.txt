For a film from a director for the first time, it's a little film just incredible, although I must admit that it's a bit difficult to watch and will probably offend the sensibilities of those who watch it, because the film definitely takes the position in favor of assisted suicide. However, what I liked about the movie was that I did not know at all what the film was like until the movie was half finished and I was already addicted. <br /> <br /> In addition to the excellent The way the subject was presented surprised me the very professional style of the film - with one of the best cinematography I have ever seen in a short film . In addition, this camera work was combined so well with music and images that made the film simply beautiful. <br /> <br /> As I said, this is a controversial film. I fight myself with what I think of this debate, but the film managed to make a statement in such a literate and intelligent way, that I really must respect the team that made this film.
