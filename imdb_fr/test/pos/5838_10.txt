I watched a lot of television during my 51 years, but I never had so much fun week after week that I watched Oz. The acting game was excellent. The writing was perfect, each character remaining consistent throughout the past six years. I also enjoyed chaos and ultra-violence. It may sound strange, but it was sometimes comical to discover how one of the characters would eventually die. I particularly enjoyed the real novel and the love between Beecher and Keller. These two men really knew how to throw, in every way possible. I really hope that HBO will continue to show us the reruns of this great show FOREVER! I watched every episode at least 4 times, but I always look forward to Tuesdays and Thursdays at 11pm. for an episode of this entertaining and very entertaining show.
