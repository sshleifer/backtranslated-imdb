I can not emphasize how wonderful this movie is. Just the <br /> <br /> memory of this film fascinates me. If you want to <br /> <br /> see a breathtaking epic of a movie, with wonderful actors in vivid <br /> landscapes, with a good dialogue, reminding you of what America was like early on /> Could have been like [what the world could have been like <br /> <br /> back then] ... well ... I highly recommend this movie. Especially in <br /> <br /> period of war and conflict in Iraq ... when our American image is not to <br /> <br /> all that it was ... this film you brings us back to a time when we had just started. Being American meant <br /> <br /> really taking charge and moving forward. When <br /> <br /> the world was such a wild and unknown place. Well, this film <br /> <br /> has that ... and more. Enjoy.
