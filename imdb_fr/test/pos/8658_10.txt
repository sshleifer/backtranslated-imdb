Synopsis: Andreas (Trond Fausa Aurvaag) finds himself alone in a coach, being deposited on a deserted land, to what seems to be the last leg of his journey. He does not know how he got there, but a welcome sign was erected. After thinking for a moment about his whereabouts, he is greeted by a man who takes him to his new life. He then enters a different world from where he comes from. <br /> <br /> As Andreas quickly discovers his new accounting position, he realizes that his environment is a little too uniform to his liking. As he takes his first lunch break, he immediately notices that everyone in town is walking in gray suit. The same day, he sees a business associate dead on fencing peaks, which looks like a suicide act. The strange thing is that city dwellers pay no attention to this horrible act and walk as if nothing had happened. It is easy to see that these people are genetically desensitized and their ability to distinguish anything from human to inhuman is absent. <br /> <br /> To help Andreas settle, he is invited to go out with his colleagues to a local nightclub. The club seems to be about to become as exciting as a bingo night. And as Andreas drinks his sorrows, he realizes that no matter how much he drinks, alcohol has no effect on him. As he tells these observances to a stranger in the men's room, a man in a washroom begins to pronounce words that have been of concern to Andreas since the beginning. Realizing that this man thinks what he is, he follows him home and notes where he lives for future reference. The plot evolves predictably with Andreas wanting an escape. He looks for the man he once followed ... in the hope of making him become human again ... but is it too late? <br /> <br /> My thoughts: This Norwegian film is something that everyone should see. because it contains the answer to the big question! What is the meaning of life? (well, pretty close). The film sketches the dark reality of what has become of the men and women who work today. Its only purpose is to make people understand that life is too short to be materialistic. He tries to show that small clich√©s, such as the sound of children playing, should not be taken for granted, because as soon as you stop hearing this sound, you are about to become a robot. The end of the movie is reminiscent of what happens when it's too late to escape the banal routine you are now used to. You begin to adopt the following saying: "If it is not broken, do not correct it" and become too comfortable to take the risk of change. <br /> <br /> Even though this film should not be taken as realism ... its message is more than real. The lack of empathy in the film, and the one that Andreas sees meaning, is a bold statement of what life can become. The director, Jens Lien, made a film that would have failed in the hands of another director. He is a great cinematic genius and I look forward to seeing what he will do next. <br /> <br /> The main role, played by Trond Fausa Aurvaag, is perfectly interpreted. Representing the average Joe, Trond is a good catalyst to make this picture dark and humorous. Supporting actors are also doing a good job, and for whatever reason, I think Keanu Reeves would have been perfect in this movie, because most of the supporting actors demanded that their game be emotionless. <br /> <br /> The score for this film has been beautifully composed. The recurring theme has always been a pleasure to listen to and has given the film a very dark but appreciated atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Scheduled for release in the UK on May 25, 2007, I will definitely go back and relive this big-screen experience. This movie made its way into my top 10 ... now turning out to be my top 20! There are shocking scenes and a dark humor all along ... A MUST -SEE !!
