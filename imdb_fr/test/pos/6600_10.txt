In fact, I have more of a question than a comment. I loved Z-Boys and Lords of Dogtown. Saw Lords first, then the doc, and although I loved the story, I'm curious why in the movie, Sid was an important character, but in the documentary he was not part of the team, just a child they knew. Does anyone know the story about this? The story of these boys was incredible. I have never experienced the craze for skateboarding where I grew up, but my kids enjoyed it. What I saw in local skate parks is what these boys had invented. I never knew that. When the film showed the competition and the Z-Boys acted, they shamed the other competitors.
