The title comes from an alteration made by a teenage prisoner in a penitentiary to cover his school book on the government titled "The United States;" he adds "de (his name)." <br /> <br /> Many characterizations in this film work well - the scenes between Leland (Ryan Gosling) and Becky (Jena Malone), Pearl (Don Cheadle) and Father Fitzgerald (Spacey) as well as Leland, Becky and his sister Julie (Michelle Williams), among many others. <br /> <br /> But the main theme of this film - the pivot on which everything hangs - is Leland's character and motives. This is a rather shy, passive and kind high school student who boldly presents herself to Becky who (we find) goes to an alternative school because of her history of drug problems. In Becky's family, she has a sister, Julie, who has just graduated from high school and is preparing to pursue graduate studies. Julie's boyfriend, Julie's age (and whose parents are dead) also lives with them. <br /> <br /> Leland lives with her mother; his father (Kevin Spacey) and his mother have long divorced and his father is a famous novelist. Leland is very insightful. The boy from "The Sixth Sense" saw dead people; Leland sees teenage lovers and recognizes that years later, they will divorce, that the pain will follow the current happiness experience of many people. BUT, for reasons that are never explained, his wise gift seems to operate sometimes, for some people, certain relationships, and not for others. ??? <br /> <br /> Some parts of the movie look a bit like a derivative quilt, borrowed from "American Beauty", "The Sixth Sense", "The Graduate" and maybe others that I do not have known. recognize. It would not matter if only Leland's character was working. <br /> <br /> I think Gosling played the role of Leland very well, but the script and the story set limits. Would a young man so meditative and attentive always be a homicide? Even for altruistic reasons? Nothing in the film gives a reason for that. I am a retired therapist with a lot of experience working with families and teenagers. Although many of the reactions presented in the film work - this part, this essential element certainly does not do it. <br /> <br /> And there is at least one other element that, in my experience, would not correspond to the reality of life, although it is not so critical. The reason for the differences between sisters Becky and Julie is never mentioned, but it's good. Once two brothers begin to take on different roles (one in good girls, the other in trouble), the roles themselves can begin to lead each other to more extreme positions. For the troubled person, Becky, it's a little: "What should I do to be loved here, give up on being me and become Julie?" And the pressure to be at the height of what is good, to please parents, is no less intense for Julie. So why would she want to break up with her long-time boyfriend and whom her parents so obviously approve? <br /> <br /> Don Cheadle was good as a Leland teacher; all the others were good in their parts. 98% of the scenes were good. What was missing was this crucial shift in the understanding of human nature. <br /> <br /> A good action game; imperfect history and psychology; worth to be seen; not a total loss.
