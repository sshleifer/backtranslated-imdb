The centerpiece of Lackawanna Blues is the character of Rachel "Nanny" Crosby, who runs a boarding school and offers unwavering support to a young boy, Ruben, the narrator of the film. Drawing on the experience of author-actor Ruben Santiago-Hudson, the film lovingly recreates the boarding school in upstate New York and discusses the cultural climate of a world in transition in the 1960s. <br /> <br /> The first half of the film is almost continuous music. The second half addresses more completely the different characters of the boarding school. The nanny's ability to "take fragments and close them" affects everyone in her sphere. A particularly vivid scene occurs when she confronts an abusive husband and says, "If you touch that child again, we're going to dance!" As delivered by the actress S. Epatha Merkerson, this line is so solid and so full of determination that the husband with the triggering temperament is frozen in his footsteps. <br /> <br /> From beginning to end, Merkerson assures an imposing presence. His character unites the disparate lives of the borders of his house. It was a touching and sincere film with a fantastic cast. As played by Merkerson, Nanny's character simply radiates with love. It's a cinematic experience that I will remember for a long time.
