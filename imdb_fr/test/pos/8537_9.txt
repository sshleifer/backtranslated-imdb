Oh my God. Obviously, when you rent or buy this, you do not expect to see a documentary about the mating habits of small rodents in their natural habitats. You wait for a visual feast of blood and blood and maybe even one or two frights. Well, for those who are as sick and twisted as I am, you will not find many frights, but you will very well urinate to laugh in you. the slogans in this movie will stay with you and your friends forever. The first time I showed this to my friends and colleagues was more than 3 years ago, but we still laugh and use slogans. it's as addictive and funny as The Evil Dead II: Dead By Dawn by Sam Raimi and Dead Alive / Braindead by Peter Jackson. From the absolutely ridiculous dialogue of the opening scene to the most refined works of the Splatter and Gore department, to the wonderful abilities of Ed the film editor, you will laugh again and again. As for the visual feast of blood and blood, oh yes, they have it. And they're damn good at it ... "The neck is connected to the head ..." This movie may have also made the best nightmare / hallucination / scary scene I've ever seen. and this one is not meant to be funny, but is the man well done (and terrifying.) All in all, to all who are not against the blood and a hell of a good time, IF YOU NEVER SEE THIS FILM, GET !!! it's on Netflix, I know it.
