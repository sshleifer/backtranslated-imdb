The second episode "Mr. Eko" has less interesting flashbacks than the first ("The 23rd Psalm"), but in almost every other department, it is one of the best episodes of Season 2, advancing the mythology / background of the series as well as the characters. Locke and Eko discover a new Dharma initiative station - The Pearl - and the orientation film they find and look inside completes Locke's transformation by believing ("Orientation" - after the end of the film: "We're going to have to watch again") to a skeptic ("SOS" - "Did you press this button, Henry? I need to know") to a non-believer ("?" - after the end of the movie: " Do you want to watch this again? "" No, I've seen enough. "Terry O'Quinn's performance is powerful, as usual (" every second of my pathetic little life is as useless as this button "place as the man who makes sure that he was brought to the island as part of his true destiny, which is to continue to press the button." The other strengths of "?" are a surprising and unique sequence of dreams where person A has the dream to be person B (this is the kind of bold idea that the current LOST season could use and much more), and the haunted scene of Libby's last word before death, and the way Jack and Hurley can not know its true meaning. *** 1/2 of 4.
