Although not for everyone, Crackerjack is a delight to watch, with the tongue firmly planted in the cheek. The likable Jack Simpson, played by Mick Molloy, swindles the local "bowlo" for free parking and earns a few dollars aside, selling the parking space to co-workers. When bowling club members have to raise money to save their club, they invite Jack to join their bowling team and play bowls of competition. <br /> <br /> Filled with Australian charm, Mick Molloy's laconic wit shows much through (he also co-wrote the script) reminding this viewer of his previous work on the radio. Perfect Australian cast with Bill Hunter as Jack's bowling mentor, Stan Coombes, John Clarke (Games fame) as ruthless businessman and owner of rival bowling club, Bernie Fowler, starring Samuel Johnson as a roommate of Jack, and Judith Lucy as a jaded journalist, Nancy. <br /> <br /> At first, I thought that only Molloy fans would like this film, but judging by the number of blue rinsing scenes coming out of the cinema laughter, this is a movie for everybody.
