After reading most of the comments, I feel like I have a say. <br /> <br /> What bothers me most is that most people here think that this movie is either for or against the subject of death penalty and if it worked with them. I remember reading an article in 1995 when the movie was published (yes, I'm so interested since I heard it was going to be published that I did not forget the articles I had read at the time) in which Tim Robbins stated that he did not want to make a film to convince the public of neither. <br /> <br /> And I think that's completely true. I must admit that I think that in the way he made this film, he tends to be on the side of those on death row, but people are still allowed to make their own choice. And it's a very rare thing in American movies. <br /> <br /> I've been showing this film to a lot of people since it was released and I've seen all kinds of reactions. Proponents of the death penalty have become opponents or have become even stronger in their belief. And many opponents of the death penalty (including myself) became more convinced that the death penalty was to be abolished all over the world. But I even saw opponents become supporters. This and the fact that people here seem to argue over this show me that there are really a lot of ways to look at things. Whatever effect it has on you, the important thing is that it makes you THINK. <br /> <br /> This is one of the few films that really gives you the choice, that does not fear a simple way to make the convict bad or innocent. This can be difficult for those who prefer to have fun or take a lesson. There is no lesson here, you must find one yourself. <br /> <br /> Everyone praises the acting, the director and the music, but as has been said many times, I will never repeat it. <BR /> <br /> So if you have not seen it yet, do it - if you dare to be challenged!
