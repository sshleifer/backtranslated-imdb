I was 13 when Elvis hit the big time in 1956 with his first RCA hit. A year later, Buddy Holly intervened to give a competition to the king. One of Buddy's main talents, besides his unique singing style and songwriting ability, is often downplayed. Buddy was also a qualified lead guitarist, developing a unique rockabilly style on his Fender Strat. Gary Busey tries to capture this aspect of Buddy's personality. There were other contemporary guitar master rockers of the same caliber, such as Chuck Berry, Carl Perkins and Eddie Cochran, but Buddy's talent is often overlooked. <br /> <br /> As others have noted, Busey is the success of "The Buddy Holly Story". Not only does the screenplay play with the facts of Buddy's life, but he even lays out several anachronisms for Buddy's two years of popularity, mostly from 1957 to 1959. One thinks in particular of the scene where Buddy and Maria are watching a movie in 3D . Buddy is disenchanted with everything and tells Maria that it will never last. It's just a fad. In reality, there were no 3D movies in circulation at that time. The apogee of 3D was in the early 1950s. In 1955, the craze had already disappeared. Yet another example where just a little research would have been enough to make the story more believable. <br /> <br /> It's sometimes hard to separate what really happened from the urban legends surrounding Buddy's career. The story of how Crickets got their name may not be apocryphal, but it certainly did not unfold as it is portrayed in the film. Another problem with the movie is the way Buddy's parents are represented. Buddy's parents were certainly supportive of his musical career. "Maybe baby" is attributed to Buddy's mother and she helped write the song. <br /> <br /> It's nice that the biggest Buddy tubes were used in the movie, but I miss hearing one of my favorites "I'm looking for someone to love." I am proud that following this film, Buddy's music has been reissued by a new generation. His legacy is one of the best beginnings of rock 'n' roll. Rave on, buddy, rave on.
