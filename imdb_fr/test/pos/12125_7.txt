Of all the mafia movies I've ever seen, it's one of the best for many reasons. The actors of Pesci, Cortese and Vincent. The story is one of the best of all time (in the mafia genre), realistic. Characters are people with whom many others can relate. This film is as great as the dialogue is good. He also has very realistic fights and action scenes. This film also launched the careers of Pesci and Vincent. Without the success of this movie, Casino and Goodfellas might not have been as good as they were. <br /> <br /> History 10/10 Actor 9/10 Realism 10/10 <br /> <br /> GLOBAL 10/10 <br /> <br /> My favorite movies about the mafia are <br /> > <1: Goodfellas 2: Casino 3: The Godfather's Trilogy 4: Family Enforcer 5: The Sopranos (I know it's not a movie)
