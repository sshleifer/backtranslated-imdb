Asterix and the Vikings is the first asterix animated film in more than 12 years since 1994 "Asterix conquers America". It also has the honor of being the first asterix animated movie in digital colors, which makes the story largely entertaining even more breathtaking. <br /> <br /> Each scene of this film is vividly rendered in bright, cheerful hues the colors of the comics on which it was based. The character design also remains relatively close to comics, for better or for worse, while preserving the simple but unique look of the characters. Simple in terms of character design, it allows you to devote more time and effort to the actual animation, which goes beyond many other theatrical animation movies on the big screen. The character movements are very fluid and have a quality far beyond what a modest budget would usually produce; there is always something moving in every scene and no evidence of the usual animation shortcuts to reduce costs. 3D computer images are seamlessly integrated with traditionally animated 2D art. The shading style instead gives 3D elements the appearance of traditional comic book paintings rather than CGI models. <br /> <br /> The scenario takes up a lot of its elements of the comics "Asterix and the Normans". where is his main fault. As an adaptation of this comic, "Asterix and the Vikings" takes too many liberties with its source material. The long-time fans of the comics would probably find a lot to dislike about the film's story and its lack of support for the source. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, we can see this story as a really funny story if taken alone without comparing it to its source. Well written and well written jokes illustrate the optimistic scenario. The funniest parts were the many references to pop culture and everyday life of the 21st century. Mobile communications, the shopping chain, commercial airlines, and even sports cars are being subjugated effectively. Excellent chemistry and acting (I watched this in English by the way) although some voices like Cacofonix really pissed me off (but I guess that's part of his character). <br /> <br /> If there is nothing to criticize about the story, it is the lack of "asterix". This story seems more like Justforkix's story about teen romance and her "maturity" with Asterix and Obelix playing only supportive roles. This gives a fairly large sense of absurdity, since most elements of the story are the usual basic elements of such teen movies. Derivative and sometimes clich√©s, only the spiritual comedy and traditional elements "Astrix" (Romans, pirates, etc.) manage to prevent this film from sinking into ordinary mediocrity. <br /> Although this is not the best choice of the Asterix animated film library is certainly one of the funniest, best scripted and most beautifully animated. DVD seems a little hard to find if ????????
