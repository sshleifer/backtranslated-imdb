A mix of 70s drug humor with a parody of medicine and a classic story. As I have often said about this movie - if you do not understand it - you are really bad ... Classic lines such as (paraphars√©es) "I have this erection and it will not go no No matter how much many times I do it.You are a nurse, what can you give me for that? "The nurse answers" All I have is 5 dollars and my wedding ring ... "An excellent soundtrack . The classic "Hyde has nothing to hide". Remains surprisingly close to the original plot - not that the original remains a joke ..... I did not meet anyone with an IQ greater than 115 who does not find him hysterical. <br /> <br />
