One of the great classics of MGM came out in the last years of the Second World War. This is the film that made young Elizabeth Taylor a star. She had already made some movies as a child actress before the National Velvet, but her place in the cinema was assured. Ironically, biologically, she would grow up fairly quickly after the release of National Velvet and her next fight as an actress was to get important roles for adults, as casting directors only saw her as the innocent little Velvet Brown who loved his jumping horse. <br /> I'm not sure how it would work because steeplechase horses must have confirmed lines and Pi are an untreated subject in National Velvet. All we know is that he is a reckless and indescribable horse in the hands of Reginald Owen. After having liberated himself and caused considerable damage, Owen got rid of it at a symbolic price for butcher Donald Crisp. <br /> <br /> In addition to these events, Mickey Rooney immerses himself in the life of the Brown family, consisting of Crisp, his wife Anne Revere, and their daughters Angela Lansbury, Juanita Quigley, Elizabeth Taylor, and their child Brother Butch Jenkins. Rooney is a former jockey who is now on the road and heading for the Brown family, where his father was a horse trainer for Anne Revere's family. It is he who sees the potential of the Pi (abbreviation of pirate) as steeple rider and it is Elizabeth who convinces Crisp not to miss this opportunity. <br /> <br /> Elizabeth Taylor was so sweet and so innocent in National Velvet. The Good Book says that you must have faith as a child and it has it in reserve. She infuses Rooney to trust the heart and capacity of the Pi and leave a little more for himself. <br /> <br /> Anne Revere won Best Supporting Actress for National Velvet. She is a very wise mother who hides from her depths that the public does not suspect. It turns out that in her youth, she had a taste of glory and glory by swimming in the Channel and that her money prize, saved all these years, was given to her daughter. This scene is probably what earned him the Oscar. National Velvet also won another Oscar, for the film edition. <br /> <br /> More than 60 years after its debut, National Velvet, a family classic, has not lost anything. His description of life between the two world wars in Britain remains remarkable. And National Velvet has launched a movie legend. Can not do much better than this for the highest esteem.
