I did not know too much before renting this movie and I made sure that Hilary Swank had always given excellent performances in her films. She seems to use restraint to get the emotional impact she is undergoing. And she did not prove the opposite in this film. <br /> <br /> However, the film also had fantastic performances from other members of the cast, whether they speak or not. I must name Jamie Bartlett and Chiwetel Ejiofor - the two main protagonists - for their exceptional acting skills and their representation of real human feelings and failures. The film as a whole has almost turned as a documentary. <br /> <br /> I must congratulate Tom Hooper as a director and Avril Beukes as editor for letting a multi-level story come out smoothly while maintaining a fashionable dialogue. The opening sequence of the South African landscape was striking and I had to press the pause button to enjoy the photograph. <br /> <br /> Why can not a film like this ever be nominated for an international prize? It seems to me that the button of the top rating is in all respects. It was not just a film, it was a real life experience in a country emerging from apartheid. A life of poverty was omnipresent but it celebrated the dignity of the human spirit.
