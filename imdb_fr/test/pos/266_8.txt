He inherited the DVD collection of my x when he left with my best friend (enough said), watched it one night when there was nothing on TV (nothing new then) and had a very pleasant surprise. Very British (you have almost no budget, no faces that you know or have seen before), the accents were a bit thick for my taste, but after a start worrying (a little too close to my home in my case), he began to grow on me. Apart from some useless editing that did not bring much, I found the film very edifying, very real and natural, throughout my performance, leaving me wanting more of an end too sudden. Highly recommended!
