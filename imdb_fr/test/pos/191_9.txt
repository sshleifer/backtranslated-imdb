The director's film Mikhail Kalatozov, The Cranes Fly (Letyat zhuravli) is a glorious film. In the scenario of Viktor Rozov, inspired by his own game, Kalatozov offers us a vision of the heroism of the war and the suffering of those who stayed at home. Flooded with countless war movies showing us the frontlines and carnage, the subject itself becomes tedious and avoidable. However, this Russian jewel shows how the story of the difficulties can be told differently. By telling us straight from the mouth of a soldier that the war is hated by all, hoping that those who died did so for a cause that will bring peace and an end to the fighting, we see a new vision of the Second World War. We have young men volunteering to fight for peace, to keep their families and loved ones safe at home rather than recruits engaged in a battle they do not believe in. With so much hatred towards our current situation in the Middle East and dying for no reason, against their will, it is nice to see a film that shows how disinterested and heroic these soldiers are, as well as those who are waiting for their return. <br /> <br /> Communist Russia shows how all were involved in the war. While Boris may have volunteered to go to the front, his father is the head doctor of a hospital and helps to treat wounded soldiers. Her sister and her daughter, Veronika, help him stay put. that no letter has arrived from his love. An entire city is coming out to send the boys to party. Even the factory for which Boris and his friend Stepan work, sends representatives with gifts of gratitude. I do not know if this is a glorified look at Russia at the beginning of the Second World War or not. There is no protest or reproach of these boys who risk their lives for a country, it is praise and thank you. Some in America might learn from it because, whether you agree with the war or not, protesting and wreaking havoc in one's name only tarnishes what these men and women are sacrificing every day. <br /> <br /> the acting is excellent, but some deserve to be distinguished. I really enjoyed Antonina Bogdanova in a small role as Boris's grandmother. She is the only family member he can trust, and his sadness at his departure is very evident on his face and through his body language. Vasili Merkuryev, as patriarch Fyodor Ivanovich, brings what is perhaps the best performance. As we said at the end, about fathers needing to repress their hidden tears, Merkouriev embodies these feelings. He wears a hard exterior, especially jokes and hard driving when his son discovers that he is volunteering just hours before he leaves. But when Boris goes out to the assembly station, we see the true pain of the man sitting in the pain at the table. He loves his son a lot and, although he may not be able to show it to him, his actions throughout the film express it to the public. Aleksey Batalov is effective as Boris, a playful and idealistic young man, who does what he believes to be right. Aleksandr Shvorin is good as a naughty Mark, staying home for his talents as a talented pianist, or maybe just to steal his cousin's love. This love, interpreted by Tatyana Samojlova, really trains the public in its grief, its despondency and its thin ray of hope. Real star of the film, she must experience many emotions during a trip where she gets lost, must reconnect with the cape, hoping to have it soon enough for the return of Boris. <br /> <br /> In addition to the realism of the story, and not being afraid to use tragedy to convey the theme, I also loved the visual style of the film. The cinematography of Sergei Urusevsky is incredible, especially considering that the film was shot in full screen. It's one thing to create beautiful compositions in a widescreen panorama; it's completely different from doing it in a square frame. From the beginning, we have a beautiful static picture of a winding bridge at the edge of the water, a bridge in the background at the top, while our two lovers sneak on the screen. There are many cases where the camera is hidden behind fences while allowing you to see the action, creating a unique depth and spatial interest at any time. Sharp angles are used, as well as careful blocking to allow for high-resolution shots and exaggerated juxtapositions of characters in the image. <br /> <br /> However, the real exploits are those of the long shot. Used in the end to follow Veronika among the mass of returned soldiers, he is beautiful at first, while he walks among those who say goodbye to their loved ones while looking for Boris, his farewell must be said. The planning for this shoot had to be long, as while she was sneaking between people, the camera focused on kissing couples, screaming people, and more, all voluntarily in the frame at times accurate while the camera was moving. Everyone needed to hit his target with precision and that led to a brilliant movie. This is only part of a global masterpiece of tone and style; The Cranes are Flying shows how successful placement and direction can be by showing the audience what they need in the easiest way possible. The composition and professionalism of the actors and the team can work wonders, adding something that gigantic ensembles and special effects can never do.
