When it was first broadcast on Masterpiece Theater, it really struck me. It's beautifully filmed and played. I immediately read Mary Webb's book, and it remains one of my favorites. Janet McTeer is wonderful in the role of Prue and I expected her to become a regular on the British drama scene. I guess she chose to focus on the British scene instead. <br /> <br /> I was hoping that with the American success of Janet McTeer years later (with Tumbleweeds), this movie would be available again. Alas, the DVD has not been published yet. If anyone listens, make it available again!
