I really like this movie. The first time was on Turner Classic Movies. All the actors have done very well but Brynner steals the show as always (he is so sexy!). This is one of the movies where you see Brynner's emotions. In fact, this film is the first that I have ever seen it laugh because it plays very strong, larger than life and serious roles in other films. In this film, you see both a male, hard and sensitive side of Brynner. Brynner seems to be a "man of woman" in this film. It's amazing how Brynner eats the glass cup and speaks in his Russian language, it makes me crazy love. I do not understand when Brynner and Kerr (they both have very good chemistry) play together in a movie and then Brynner always dies at the end, it kind of reminds you of "The King and Me".
