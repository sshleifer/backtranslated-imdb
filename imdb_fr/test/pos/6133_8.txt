I came across this film by chance. I was traveling a few years ago and this movie was aired late at night on a hotel cable channel. Not much else and I thought I was looking at him for about 20 to 30 minutes, until I decided to go to bed. Needless to say, I stayed up and watched the entire movie. The plot was very interesting and makes you wonder if there was no SS who did this or at least thought about it. I searched everywhere for this film. I even sent an e-mail to the production company, but I did not know if it would ever happen on DVD, but I said there was still hope. If anyone finds this movie, write a note where you found it, because I'd like to get a copy one day.
