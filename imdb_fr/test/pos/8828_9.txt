I highly recommend it to anyone who likes good storylines, good actors (even if they are not well known) (often, it's better that way), science and / or science fiction presented in an intelligent way on the (small) screen, good special effects even if they did not have billions of dollars to produce it ... <br /> <br /> much better than any war in the stars ... <br /> <br /> there was only one comment that was not necessary: ​​speaking of the comet, the commentator says that LIFE may have been brought to Earth through a comet ... that's fun, there must always be a chance for a magical way, huh ?! That's great with LIFE, can happen anywhere, no need for external force
