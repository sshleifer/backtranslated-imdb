This film is based on the true story of Iowa housewife Lucille Fray, who had breast cancer after the birth of her tenth child. Realizing that the state would remove children from her alcoholic and ineffective husband, she spent the last year of her life traveling across the state to find new homes for each of the children. A great scenario - which lasts another 20 years after its creation. The adult children, many of whom had not seen each other since their mother's death in the late 1950s, were reunited on "It's Incredible" before the film was released in 1983. Barbara Stanwyck won the Emmy Award for best actress in a miniseries TV movie, but in her thank you speech, she strived to kiss Ann-Margret for her moving performance.
