When this movie came out, I had seen Geena Davis play only feminine and sweet roles ... This movie was anything but sweet and feminine. Great features, good action ... she and Samuel L really clicked. Too violent for kids, but if you and your partner are trying to get along on a movie, try this one in size. Go Geena! Go Geena!
