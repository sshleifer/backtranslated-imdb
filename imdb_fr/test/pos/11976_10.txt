If you want to have a good time, then this is the movie to watch. <br /> <br /> Take the premise - There is this college that admits people with a minimum of BA, B.Com, M.Com, MA skills. , MBA, MCA, BE, M.Tech and BCA. It is therefore necessary to take into account the time consumed and it is obvious that all the students are over 40 years old. The school also admits students to a heavier dispensation and follows a P.Hd weight loss course and the only student who failed. Of course, Manisha Koirala. Only she was a snake in the past life. Still not convinced? OK, read on. <br /> <br /> Here is a scene. Akshay Kumar, a university student, is being sued by Arman. He takes out a bazooka and shoots him! Then throw grenades. Then one of the grenades hits Akshay. But does not die and continues to fight, Arman, the snake, plunges a half-foot dagger into Akshay and tramples him, but Akshay is still there. Then Akshay rides on a jet ski and follows Arman. They fight and Arman chokes Akshay underwater and finally, Akshay is dead. So we think that as soon as Arman is gone, Akshay will go to Raj Babbar, director of this college + Refree Boxing + Parapsychology, professor ka + mumbling priest. we take the cake but a certain Mr. Nigam. You are looking to find out more. :-)
