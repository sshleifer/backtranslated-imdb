One hilarious thing that I will say at the beginning is that I am not the biggest fan of Seisun Suzuki. In fact, I saw many of his works (thanks to a retrospective film festival) and I found his films just a little too inspired by Yakuza. So, I went to Princess Raccoon, suspicious of what I was going to see. Boy! I was knocked out! "Raccoon" is Suzuki's attempt for a musical, using elements of Japanese opera mixed with many modern elements (Audial and Visual), Raccoon is a treat from start to finish. The lead actor, Joe Ogdari, proves that he is one of the most fashionable actors in Japan these days in this role. I must admire that the youngest Japanese actors still play roles that take place in the feudal era of Japan, disguised as samurai costumes. The story itself becomes a bit confusing, if you do not really follow it closely, but even if you do not follow it, get ready for the treasures that Princess Raccoon possesses.
