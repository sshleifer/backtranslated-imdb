I did not know this film very well when I entered the cinema for an advanced projection. From the commercials, I understood that it was a thriller. <br /> <br /> What we have is a bit like "Compulsion" and "Matlock". Two teenagers decide to commit a perfect murder. A victim is randomly selected and then carefully executed so that no trace of the real murderer is found. Then, a bunch of fake tracks are planted that indicate an innocent bystander. (Innocent of murder anyway) <br /> <br /> Enter Sondra Bullock as investigating officer. (IMDB says she's FBI, but I do not remember, I thought she was an ordinary policeman) She's frustrated with the inconsistency of the killer's profile ("The profile does not match the profile! ") And by the power and influence of the father of one of the boys. <br /> <br /> She also has her own demons that figure prominently in her decision to become a cop. But it's the only character that's really more than one-dimensional. All the others are pretty flat. <br /> <br /> For a thriller, there is really no big chills. It's mostly a cat-and-mouse game like an episode of "Matlock" (which she watches at some point in the movie). The problem is that there are two people involved in the murder. Who is the real murderer, Justin or Richard? It will cost you eight dollars to find out.
