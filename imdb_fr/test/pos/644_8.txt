I just finished this movie and my only comment is "OH! WOW!" Jennifer Beals agrees as a fianc√©e, but Yancy Butler as a dance instructor is pure sexual dynamite! After seeing her in WITCHBLADE, I was not prepared for pure and pure sensuality and the raw sexual arousal she throws on the screen. <br /> <br /> I have to see this film again ... if only for Yancy Butler as Corrinne!
