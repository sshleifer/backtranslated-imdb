Like many twilit episodes, one of my favorite parts of it was Serling's explicit social commentary on history. As was the case in a recent episode "Screaming Man", I remembered my long-standing suspicion, for example, that if Jesus came to earth to bring his disciples to heaven, he would immediately be judged mad and probably cast away. in an asylum. Our main character in this episode faces a similar problem when we try to convince the Americans of 1860 that he is of the future and that President Lincoln is about to be murdered. The episode incorrectly asserts that this means that some parts of the past can be changed, others can not, but it's still fun to travel. <br /> <br /> Of course, we do not know for a fact if the story could be changed by the trip in time, because the journey in time has never been accomplished and unfortunately will not be never. But it seems logical to me that if you could physically put yourself in a bygone era, you could physically prevent something from happening, as long as you do not drag yourself around like a madman screaming about assassinations. <br /> <One of the most interesting aspects of time travel movies and shows is, in my opinion, the method by which time travel takes place. There is really no method here, our main character discusses time travel in a gentlemen's club, then walks outside and dissolves from the early 1960s to the mid-1860s, but no matter. The twilight zone has not hitherto struck me by its complex sets or high production values. <br /> <br /> Russell Johnson plays the role of Peter Corrigan, the time traveler, and discovers that he was brought back to the exact day of the Lincoln assassination, he managed to get thrown in jail, but fortunately for him, John Wilkes Booth, for some reason, had just been hanging out at the police station and was surprised at the fiery Corrigan desperately trying to describe the very assassination Booth planned for that night. <br /> <br /> Booth asks for Corrigan's custody for a psychiatric experiment, and the officer sees nothing wrong with this guy's custody. After all, he had a business card. How bad could he be? <br /> <br /> The show seems to suggest that you can change people's lives by slightly changing past events not willing to accept that time travel carries such limitations, it's still a fun episode that really makes you think, which is one of my favorite qualities of the good spectacles of the twilight zone ...
