It was the best film of 1998 and one of the best of the 90's. Yes, it's a Goodfellas scam. But as the saying goes, good poets borrow, great poets steal. And PTA has stolen brilliantly some of the best, and added some touches of genius. I gave him a figure of ten (which is very rare for me). <br /> <br /> The main reason I comment on this fact is that everyone who has seen it on VHS standard problem ... what do you think? This deserves the FULL SCREEN experience. Look at the ratio in which it was shot! I saw him 5 times at the cinema and I did not bother to watch it on video. <br /> <br /> Nuff said!
