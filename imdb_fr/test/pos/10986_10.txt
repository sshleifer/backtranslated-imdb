Two things can happen when a set is together. Either you leave the theater and ask yourself, "Why?" or you receive MANNA FROM HEAVEN, a delightful comedy of the Burton sisters, whose mother not only inspired, but also the screenplay itself, Ursula Burton plays the role of Thérèse, a nun whose friend and family had always believed to be touched by God from heaven, the clan uses the young Thérèse's faith for all her dreams to come true and money was a gift from heaven, years have passed and we find Theresa back home in Buffalo, her native country. Reimbursed and calls her friends and family (Oscar winners Shirley Jones, Louise Fletcher and Cloris Leachman) to pay off her debt before Easter Sunday, which has long been used and all the characters find themselves in financial difficulties. Frank Gorshin, are a team of husband and wife con who teach the important lessons of life, how to dress for the winter in Buffalo and my favorite, "they expect you to verware," when visiting a restaurant. The public can only hope that if Thérèse achieves her goal, she will not be spared by the money. The film teaches us that it's not money, but ourselves that make our dreams and those of others come true. Each action has a result not only for you, but for the community around you. When we look in the mirror, we see ourselves as we would like to be, MANNA FROM HEAVEN, answering the question of how others can see the image we would most like to reflect. The Burton have done a remarkable job of getting actors out of their shells and creating new and inventive characters. At a budget of millions of dollars, this budget low budget proves that it is not the money in hand, but the real talent that will generate the most laughs. Wendie Malick (US President, Just Shoot Me) adds a special flavor to this already talented cast.
