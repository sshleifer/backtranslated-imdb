This is one of the best movies I have seen in recent years. Belmonndo and Deneuve shine in their respective roles, him as a naive plantation owner and she as an enigmatic trickster.The words will not do justice to this masterpiece, Let's say it is a movie which explores the dark side of love and the pain, humiliation and self-delusion that go with it, although it is dressed like a black film. Forget this mediocre remake with Jolie and Banderas, see the real article and enjoy moments of great cinematic beauty.
