I was surprised to see this on TV on Friday and I enjoyed it. Between the presence of Bobbie Phillips and the many references to anything that could be considered "cyberpunk", it was a fun movie to watch. I enjoyed the story that reminded me of a book I read ("Earth", David Brin) and that made me happy to see on TV. Bobbie looks great, but I also enjoyed her performance as Kam because she seemed different from everyone else. But the main asset of this film is the atmosphere described in the books of Gibson, Sterling and others. It was just fun to see him on TV.
