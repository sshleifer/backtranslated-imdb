The innumerable television screens and memorable appearances of four of today's biggest stars (plus Hope Davis' first on-screen) keep the Flatliners always in the forefront. The plot is about a non-academic research of five medical students pursuing their crazy idea of ​​discovering the secret of death, and learning what is after death, then coming back to life. Yet the script was not as fascinating as the idea of ​​the plot. <br /> <br /> There are popular stereotypes for developing a regular teen-slasher scenario in Flatliners. There is Nelson who creates the idea of ​​decoding death, pretty but introverted Rachel, David cutting the Gordian knot to not be fired from school, the lady Joe and finally the clever Randy ("I did not go to the medical school to murder my classmates, no matter how much they could be bothered "). They join their hands in an experiment where Nelson's heart will be stopped and rerythmed. Then, they decide to continue this experiment with confidence at night on campus. Shortly after Nelson's experience, everyone starts a race against the craziest death and the longest, risking their lives one by one. However, they quickly realize that their daily lives are affected by these experiences. Visits to the afterlife bring back their delinquent feelings from their childhood memories. Depolarizing their deep subconscious vigilance, they begin to have somatic delusions and visual hallucinations. <br /> <br /> When the moment comes to explain the explanation of the unconscious, the director Joel Schumacher forgets that every human being has a subconscious personality of which he is not aware. . This inner personality prevents one from turning into a loss of identity. If you lose or depolarize this subconscious personality, you will certainly lose your identity instead of refreshing your childhood memories. I wanted to add this as a movie mistake, which has already been mentioned by movie critics in the previous 90s. Obviously, in this film, Schumacher made sure that the actors had the least affected. So why are they reluctant to continue the experience after learning their lesson, as if death were designed to be indistinguishable from God? David had been presented as an atheist. Now he turned out to believe in God when he remembered a flashback of his childhood. After witnessing this 180-degree change in David, it is clear that Schumacher's film was so conservative and full of lily pains; this is ultimately why it is never classed as a science fiction work. Alas! He had good potential. He even tried to dissuade unconscious maturation from living a mortal experience, starting to believe that death is so natural and is only part of a human being's life. <br /> <br /> More than there is in the film, it was also memorable to remember what is with the movie. Jan de Bont, as director of photography, who worked almost every time with Schumacher, creates a dreamlike atmosphere like a Gothic horror movie. The blue colors reflecting the actors' faces on the walls provide first-class lighting, which is perfect for the film. Close-up shots of gargoyle statues in campus buildings, catholic frescoes on the walls, stop-motion cameras and dynamic camera speed were all part of Bont's talent. <br /> <br /> Flatliners have become a cult film. in tune with his sociological pen-portrait of the generation X juvenile, particularly via his futuristic editing style with storyboard connection sequences, as part of a music video clip in an aesthetic way. It was at this time that rhythmic and multi-sequence video music clips are on the rise. This style was very rare in the years that followed "The Hunger (1983)" by Tony Scott.
