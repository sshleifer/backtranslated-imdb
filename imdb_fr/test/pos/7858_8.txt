Clint Eastwood plays a wounded Union soldier, found by a daughter of a Confederate boarding school. He was taken care of and found in good health instead of being confided to Confederate soldiers. It seems like the women there have ulterior motives. GÃ©raldine Paige, the director, justifies not turning it into a confederation and even passes it off as her cousin. Of course, when the man feels better, he becomes quite the man of the lady and almost goes around, but when he gets caught, he gets fired, so bad that he cuts his leg but it is for his good, of course, not for retribution. Things go a little further when some women do not get what they want. I have not seen this for years and it still has some goosebumps that, by today's standards, is still quite strange. Not typical Eastwood at all. If you have not seen this one, it's worth seeing. 8 out of 10
