When I saw Lon Chaney, Jr. and Boris Karloff in the cast, I was expecting to find a typical "schlocky" horror movie of the 1950s. The opening scene (a cemetery with a wolf howling at the background) seemed to confirm it. Once I started watching this movie, I discovered that it was a little mystery about an Englishman (Richard Green) who was trying to find out what had happened to two of his friends who had disappeared into the Forest - Black and, if necessary, to take revenge on the bad count (Stephen McNally) who reigned on the territory. Chaney, as a voiceless Gargon, had a rather limited role (one that reminded me of the Hunchback of Notre Dame, in fact), while Karloff had a somewhat more important role as Dr. Meissen. In fact, Meissen was one of the most interesting characters in the film and it was difficult to know until the end if it would be established that he would be good or bad! The whole castle was beautiful and even the limited representation of the Black Forest was very real. It certainly did not seem like a low budget, compared to other movies I've seen anyway. I thought the only disappointment was Rita Corday's performance as a countess. She seemed a little dry and did not seem to put much passion into the role. <br /> <br /> That aside, I found that this film caught my attention, and that the suspense was enough to know how it would all happen. turn out to be worth watching. Highly recommended, with a score of 7/10.
