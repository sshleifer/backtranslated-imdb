FIVE STAR FINAL is one of the best movies of the early 1930s. It featured Edward G. Robinson and was a very serious story about a shady newspaper and their willingness to do anything ... ANYTHING to sell newspapers. In particular, an old story of an innocent woman is stuck on the pages and helps to destroy her now happy life - many years after she was implicitly involved in a scandal. The reason I liked the film so much is that it was ruthless and not fists, which shows how much publishers can sell newspapers. <br /> <br /> Here at TWO AGAINST THE WORLD, it's a remake. of FIVE STAR FINAL - with some modifications. Instead of Robinson, this film stars Humphrey Bogart and is responsible for programming in a radio station and not in a newspaper. Otherwise, the story is essentially the same, except that it is a little less nervous and lacks the courage and sensationalism of the original. That does not mean that the movie is bad - it just does not have as good a punch as the first movie. In other words, if you have to see one of these movies, see the first one - even though this movie is quite powerful and enjoyable too. As for me, I loved the story so much that I saw and enjoyed both films. <br /> <br /> TWO AGAINST THE WORLD begins with the UBC radio owner who complains to his head of programming (Bogart) that all the "high front" shows he's put on get odds low. The owner asks for mud - a lot of mud to have more listeners. One of the ways they argue is to do a multi-part dramaturgy of a famous murder that happened two decades ago - even though the murderer was acquitted and only killed to defend herself. However, they decide to play the story as if she were guilty and even send a writer to his lady claiming to be minister (!), While spreading its current name and location. Needless to say, it ruins the woman and leads to a horrible tragedy. Then, and only then, does Bogart feel real remorse for the production of such garbage, resulting in a dandy finale on the integrity and decency of journalists. <br /> <br /> Well done, great story idea and a clear message. Just as important today as in the 1930s, it's a story that must be seen. In particular, note the marvelous and very emotional confrontation scene where the girl attacks the owner and Bogart - it's a pretty good example of theater and writing.
