This is the main object of James Cagney: sarcasm, greed, badass and irreproachable charisma. <br /> <br /> Although the plot seems serious, the film has nothing to envy. This is done in the comedy style of the 30s and works well with his "argument" with fiance Mae Clark and his reactions to the high stories of his colleague James Burke. <br /> <br /> What is above normal is the dialogue and the casting that delivers it. The dialogue is good but it is nothing unless the delivery is perfect and can bounce on the characters involved. This is well done by all. <br /> <br /> A good entertainment and an absolute pleasure.
