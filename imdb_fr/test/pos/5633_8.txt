I appreciated this one, because I can understand it. <br /> <br /> At one point in my life, I was trying to make films and met many of the problems that Mark Borchardt had encountered while trying to make his film. And I also went through a long period of development stopped, absorbed by myself, where I refused to grow. But then, miraculously, I got married and had children. I realized that being a filmmaker in trouble was probably not going to feed my family. So, I had a decent job and did what I felt I needed to do to make it happen. That's what a mature and responsible adult does. <br /> <br /> Mark has not yet faced this reality and, in that sense, he is a retarded teenager. For that reason, there is a desperation at home. Like Don Quixote, he seems so inept and illusory that he does not realize how bad he really is. The viewer feels a sense of superiority and pity for himself and those around him. Mark has children, an ex-wife and bills to pay, but the film portrays him caring only for pursuing his "artistic vision". <br /> <br /> Despite this, Mark appears in the film as a likeable individual, surrounded by a family and a group of very interesting friends. Unfortunately, Mark lacks many things necessary to succeed in life and in a career: maturity, responsibility, education, knowledge, life experience, hierarchy, financial power, etc. Still, he walks hard, a bit like Ed Wood, apparently without any semblance of clue. <br /> <br /> I guess we are supposed to feel encouraged by the spectacle of the "never say dying" attitude of this noble individual who fights against all odds. And dude, what are the chances! Kiefer Sutherland, Colin Hanks, Tori Spelling and Angelina Jolie are all from major actors in film or television. no doubt, they will all want to lead one day, if they are not already. How much space is there for a freelancer like Mark? It's like watching a guy hit his head with a board again and again. When you think about it, it's pretty close to what's happening to one of Mark's actors, with the kitchen cupboard door, in one of the funniest scenes I've ever seen in a movie. <br /> <br /> Despite these concerns and apparently critical, I really enjoyed this film and I highly recommend it to anyone. Uncle Bill is amazing. I have a friend who met Mike and Mark and he told me that in real life, these guys are exactly like they appeared in the movie.
