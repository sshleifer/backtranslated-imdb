Golden Boy is an ecchi humor (at the edge of the hentai) as "educational moments". The main character, Kintaro, walks in the most silly situations concerning women ... It's just that he is shy on the surface but analyzes everything until he can learn something. The most striking feature of the series concerns the circumstances surrounding his "education", which are downright embarrassing, but at the same time funny.
