As a fan of Wm. Faulkner since college, I have been particularly pleased to see Intruder In the Dust and for other reasons. My grandfather, also named Clarence Brown, grew up in the Oxford area, where he was born near there in 1888. We attended a week-long family reunion in Oxford in July 1964, at 15 years after filming. It still looked like that in the movie, but it was going through a period of civil rights disruption at the time of the Ole Miss site. My memory is to have been a pretty little university town that summer, but I was only an 18-year-old college. sophomore and white student. I was just beginning to see the injustice of segregation and prejudice, but I still had a long way to go. Anyway, the film is worth watching, but the filmmakers must have had to walk a tightrope to do it there and I would like to know more about this story. <br /> <br /> Nowadays, Oxford is a bigger, more modern university city, with all the evils that go with it, and I hope to go back there to see how it has changed socially in the last 40 years years. . Juano Hernandez should have been nominated for an Oscar this year, but Hollywood was still too fanatical to let that happen. Other Faulkner stories have been filmed, so look for them and compare them. One of the best was a 1985 PBS treatment of The Barn Burner with Tommy Lee Jones. It really reflected the intensity of the southern whites of the countryside that Faulkner wrote so unpredictably so often.
