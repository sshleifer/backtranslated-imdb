Ok, so there are always people who seem to dislike movies because they are good, but prefer to like them based on their degree of depression or boredom, or if they are from a foreign country. . All that aside, One Crazy Summer is the perfect example of what a great American comedy should be. The jokes are a good mix of slapstick (at the Bobcat Goldthwait), surreal (Bobcat under the direction inspired by Steve Holland) and dry (John Cusack, one of the most sordid and fun actors of American cinema), and no characters in this movie that delivers at least one fun line (ok, except Demi Moore). <br /> <br /> Yes, it's immature, yes, it's a ball screw, yes, Bobcat dresses like Godzilla and destroys a model of a seafood restaurant. as funny as hell. Look at this.
