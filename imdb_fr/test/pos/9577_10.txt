At the time of the series Farrelly Brothers and Jackass, to make the film realized and presented by the Americans is rhythmic, full of charm and that the hilarity is almost miraculous. This set was behind other efforts, just recently "A Mighty Wind" which was so subtle that it seemed like a real documentary without entertainment overlay, but "Best In Show" has it all. It is superbly interpreted by some of the best current American actors, Parker Posey, who releases energy even when it is still, Eugene Levy as a tolerant man who is not the doormat of anyone, even if it seems to be (or maybe an indomitable doormat). The brilliant styles of Fred Willard, the discrete performances of so many others, a characteristic that is not generally associated with Americans or their actors. One of the few humorous movies I can watch over and over again.
