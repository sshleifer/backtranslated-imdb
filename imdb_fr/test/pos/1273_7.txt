If Christopher Nolan had made Memento before following, all the defects of the latter would have been corrected. In Memento, Nolan perfectly built the switches in time. We were able to know when it was the past, when it was current, etc. However, Nolan has experimented with it a bit, and it just does not work. Although he had a small budget and could not use color (one of the ways Memento worked), it was too difficult to distinguish between time. On the DVD, a feature allows you to play scenes in chronological order. I intended to write my review after watching it. So I hope it makes more sense, but of course it did not work. <br /> <br /> You can not blame Nolan for not having original ideas. A young man, Bill (Jeremy Theobald), is bored, so he decides to follow random people in the street. He finds one, Cobb (Alex Haw), who is particularly interested. Soon, Bill befriends Cobb and accompanies him as he burst into the houses and steals them. Then a delightful young blonde (Lucy Russell) comes in and the movie gets even weirder from there. <br /> <br /> The end of the next series is one of the most shocking endings I have ever seen. Of course, Fight Club had an amazing end, but the end of Follow's sequel was amazing. I felt like someone had hit me in the head and gave me a concussion. Nolan has the taste to end well (well, maybe not, I would guess Insomnia is a mile away), and can really build a beautiful story. Following is perhaps not the easiest thing to follow or watch, but it's a story so worked and original with a shocking end that you'll probably want to watch all of its 70 minutes again. <br /> <br /> My rating: 7/10 <br /> <br /> R rated for language and some violence.
