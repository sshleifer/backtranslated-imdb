This film will not be considered for an academic prize, but if you like a film that does not take itself seriously and wants the viewer to enjoy it for ninety minutes, it's not a disappointment. You'll enjoy a Darth Vader for the bad guy (the breather), a Batman woman for the heroine (but a lot more cute with a lot less suits) and a racing joke that includes cigarettes and the police captain, that's very funny. Not at all a great cinematographic success. But if you like to have fun camping, it was worth watching. God help me, I liked it.
