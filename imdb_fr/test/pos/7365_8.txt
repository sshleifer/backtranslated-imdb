This film was recorded in a local video store for five to five dollars, and it was a most pleasant surprise. It's a collection of four interrelated tales built around four kids who have just had a car wreck and are waiting for someone to pick them up. They tell each other these stories to kill time and are sometimes surprised by flashing lights and amusing noises that all come together in a late O. Henry-esque that left me happy. A real discovery. Blood (in abundance), breasts and beasts, all that pretty well ... Jacinda Barrett is worth the price of entry alone. This one is a caretaker - Jim Bob recommends checking out. <br /> <br /> Oddly enough, "Pumpkinhead" was also one of our five choices and IMDB recommends it to anyone who likes "Campfire Tales". I will follow you as soon as I have the opportunity to sit down and watch this one. Happy Samhain!
