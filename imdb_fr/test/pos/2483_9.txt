This extraordinary pseudo-documentary, made in 1971, perfectly renders the genius of America today ... which makes it all the more frightening and relevant. The "subversives" (students, hippies, black activists, academics) are arrested by the government and sentenced to long prison terms for crimes of thought and social protest. As an alternative to life imprisonment, these convicted "criminals" are offered three days at "Punishment Park". Their goal inside the park is to make their way to the American flag where freedom awaits them. Not surprisingly, the Punishment Park option is a dirty lie. This brilliant film by Peter Watkins is even earlier than "Battle Royale" and "Series 7", although his angle of attack is more obviously political. Shot in 1971, it looks and looks as fresh as anything made today. The performances are exemplary and the direction is clearer. The story goes back and forth between various groups trying to survive the harsh conditions of the park and the McCarthy-like trials that sentenced them. Today, this film retains its power. In 1971, there was nothing but nothing. It is a masterpiece that succeeds on a dozen levels. He has the bullets that most people have lost today.
