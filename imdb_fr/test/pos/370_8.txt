In my never-ending quest to see as many quality films as I could in my lifetime, I came across this cable movie. I tried Hitchcock three times before and I never felt that this man's work was commensurate with the praise he had received. I always thought he was good, not great (from what I saw). It was the best of his films I've seen so far. Robert Walker is absolutely scary, his performance takes the film where Hitchcock wanted it. Even average performance damages the product as a whole. My favorite scene was his obsession with taking the lighter out of the bowl (how come his arm is there?) Bruno is a very convincing character, but I also loved Patricia Hitchcock's performance as Barbara . The rest of the Morton family as well as Guy were a bit dry and boring, but she added a touch of light to the movie, as well as some of the best lines in the screenplay. <br /> <br /> Finally, in any movie of suspense, you will live and die by your end. It contains water, unlike some other Hitchcock films I've seen. I really did not know how it would end, which kept me on the edge while I watched and waited.
