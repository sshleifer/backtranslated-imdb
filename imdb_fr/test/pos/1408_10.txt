William Haines tells the story of an impetuous student who thinks that West Point will really be something now that he has arrived. Haines was his mark of fabulous goony comic strip, which made him a box-office star from 1928 to 1932 and one of MGM's biggest stars. Joan Crawford and William Bakewell are doing well too. And while this story may seem trivial now, it has been a huge success, putting Haines and Crawford in a history of college football (a national infatuation in the 1920s). After Haines clears his face once more and is almost fled by his fellow cadets, he achieves a magnificent performance by swallowing his pride and embarking on the great match against Navy. Even with a broken arm, he wins the game for the army and regains his place at West Point. It's easy to understand in this film and Show People (with the always underrated Marion Davies) why Billy Haines was a huge star of time. He needs and deserves to be remembered!
