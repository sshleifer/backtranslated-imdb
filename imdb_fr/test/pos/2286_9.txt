* Minor Spoilers * I just wanted to say that for those who love fun baseball movies, it's definitely in my top three. Only Little Big League and Major League can compete with this one in my mind. I would also like to congratulate the authors of this film for creating such a pleasant dialogue! Without being too specific, I would say that the lines are perfect for each character. Tom Selleck seemed to have no problem creating a realistic baseball player character. His animosity towards playing abroad in Japan sets the tone for both comical and meaningful interactions with his new team, the Dragons. He must adapt to life in Japan ("First, we wash, then we bathe!"). He ends up agreeing with his coach. conceived! So, for all baseball fans, or those who want to watch a good baseball movie, Mr. Baseball will not let you down!
