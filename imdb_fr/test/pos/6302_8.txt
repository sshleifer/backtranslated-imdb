The opening shot of Consequence of Love perfectly puts in place this intriguing and absorbing film. A traveler slowly carries a solitary and blurred figure to the camera, trailing behind a huge suitcase. Just like the central character of the film, we do not know anything about him and our initial interpretation of him, his job, the contents of the suitcase could be completely wrong. <br /> <br /> The consequences of love are this kind of movie. According to the title, you could expect a dissection of a relationship according to Bergmanesq. Rather, we have a main character, Titta, who lives his life in emotional exile, apparently choosing to cut himself off from those around him. If the film can be classified in any way, I will call it a mystery because we are determining who Titta is and what he is talking about. What we know from the beginning is that he is 50, he is cool, composed and dressed in a costly way. He has lived for eight years in a luxury Swiss hotel, still paying for his room on time, but with little interest in staff and other guests. <br /> <br /> His only real companions are a couple who he plays at casual card games with. It seems that the couple owned the hotel, but now has everything bet and only has the room in which he lives. Their love of money, antiques and the other was their loss and Titta seems to identify with their fate. He once had everything, but he now lives as a virtual prisoner in the hotel. His brother, a long-haired surf instructor, comes to see him from time to time, but he sees his visits as an intrusion more than a pleasure. They talk about the person Titta considers his best friend, even though he has not seen him for 25 years. This friend lost for a long time is now a telephony engineer, repairing the communication network that brings together so many people. Meanwhile, Tittas' phone calls to his wife and children end quickly when they refuse to talk to him. <br /> <br /> In the middle of the film, Titta makes an unusual gesture and begins to open to a young maid at the hotel. With his judgment clouded by emotion, he embarks on a series of actions that will finally seal his fate for good. <br /> <br /> The slow progress of the fall of Titta is a beautiful writing, a script. The overwhelming techno soundtrack contributes a lot to creating tension as more and more secrets are revealed, the last half-hour turning into a learned thriller when Titta lets his mask slip and must again face the consequences of his acts. The end, with a visual nod to Felini, is both dramatic and ambiguous and lets the audience question his motives. <br /> <br /> Patrick Bliss, 01/06/06
