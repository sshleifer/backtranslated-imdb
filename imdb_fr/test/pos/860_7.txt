I really enjoyed this movie and to this day, it's one of my favorites. The story was excellent, although the final turn was far too predictable and I knew what would happen too soon. Usually, when that happens, the movie is spoiled for me (like "The Others"), but even knowing the result, I've always enjoyed it until the end. While browsing the comments of others, many people were impressed by the performance of Kelly Overton (Eve). I'm afraid this is not the case. His performance seemed to be the weakest part of the film for me, unlike the incredible performance (or characterization) of James Haven (Don Wake) ... I hope we'll see him more. What a beautiful little movie, highly recommended to all!
