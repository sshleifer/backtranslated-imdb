As if reality shows such as "American Idol" were not enough, in which judges such as Simon Cowell make harsh criticisms at competitors trying to mark the world of music - critics who have often knocked out exceptional singers after what was considered a "bad performance", the American "Top Top Model" has been invading the breast tube for three years with its own version of "looking for the next big thing" in a company that values ​​superficiality and concepts of beauty and body dysmorphism. <br /> <br /> A concept created by Tyra Banks, who is also judge of the series, brings together about fifteen candidates of all horizons and submits them to innumerable "tasks" in which they must prove their "talent" in front of the camera and submit not only to the late Janice Dickinson (nicknamed "the first American model"), but to Jay Manuel and Nore Marin, who are equally fat, who could at one point focus on a girl does not work not good and briskly bring it to shreds as if it were a bad morning coffee. As in many reality shows, each week a candidate is eliminated and has to pack and leave immediately (something Tyra reminds them of every turn). Of course, there is the tension of bitch between several women of type A, feminine ties, tears, a dramatic outbreak of music at key moments and some breathtaking images that transform pretty girls once ordinary into pretty goddesses inaccessible. <Br/> <br /> I have to admit that the show is a guilty pleasure. It may be the state of mind in which I am, but I always wondered where the vomitorium was in cases where already thin girls would need to rush to make the cut and look like judges and photographers as well as many fickle designers felt right at the moment. Nevertheless, it attracted me despite my previous paragraph, perhaps because I have always had an interest in the world of fashion and I have always loved watching beautiful women become even more deprived with makeup Perfect and perfect lighting. But I wonder where they are going with these increasingly difficult photo shoots. It's like they're competing with Fear Factor. Shots that look like reconstructions of battle scenes in CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON, where models must lay under water or in almost impossible situations one hour? Or a shoot where they are under water, chained, trying to break free in record time while searching by rubbing their chiffon, never forgetting to smile their pearly whites in front of this camera? What about the "Pit and the Pendulum" version of a photo shoot? <br /> <br /> We must first congratulate the show, which is similar to "American Idol". With that, I will probably justify the harshness of both series and its abrasive judges - and go essentially against my original paragraph. "America's Next Top Model" is a long audition series, like "American Idol", in which girls will benefit from the kind of test treatment they will receive in the real world, where future designers and photographers are also incredibly versatile. to the extent that they can be, they will crush them in no time if they can not sell as they are supposed to, and when one member is asked to leave, another will replace the requirements required. Which makes it a miracle that any girl wants to enter such a difficult medium, but that's what we dream of. <br /> <br /> At the dawn of her fifth season, Janice Dickinson's departure was a big disappointment. ; during her run, she was a pretty hard barometer of how girls should walk, talk, be motivated, express themselves and present themselves as a living, living product that sells. With the cold addition of Twiggy, I wonder where this is going to go. Twiggy simply can not replace Dickinson's excessive temperament. So, in the absence of Janice, the series has lost some of its potential and may have even signaled its slow disappearance, but in the meantime, it's still a fun-to-watch, senseless entertainment on evenings. the week, or even beautiful visuals. If so, it's the show that put Adrienne Curry in the spotlight. Curry has made a name for herself because of facts that have less to do with the model than her theatrical love affair with actor Christopher Knight in her own reality show.
