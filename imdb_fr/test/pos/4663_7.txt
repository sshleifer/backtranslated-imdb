**Warning! Light procrastination before you! ** <br /> <br /> "The Italian Job" is not the best movie you'll see all year, or probably even this summer. But two hours are worth it, because they color lines, knowing its limits and not trying to exceed them. <br /> <br /> What brings the film is the work of casting. In a movie about a crew of thieves, individuals must maintain good relationships. Without this feeling of cohesion, the public does not believe in the characters, neither collectively nor individually, and the film has no chance. But from the first scenes, in which men bicker and clump together by infiltrating a Venetian palace, the appropriate chemistry is in place. <br /> <br /> The characters themselves are nothing new; These are basic criminal gangs, containing about half a dozen players, each with a specific and decisive skill. But each actor brings the appropriate products to his table. Mark Wahlberg's acting and low-key humor fit in well with his role as a brain planner. Edward Norton gives the attitude and makes his mustache turn in his dark role. Donald Sutherland is the father figure of the crew, and he resembles the role of the suave and old-fashioned robber, who is always so keen. Jason Statham, Seth Green and Mos Def do not do much beyond their character's abilities, but they each play their part. Statham as a driver who works well; Green as the genius of tech geek with a chip on his shoulder; and Def as the man of the demolitions. Charlize Theron slips into a part that does not ask too much. She is mainly invited to drive fast and look good. What she does. None of the characters are so deep or three-dimensional, but in this familiar movie genre, two dimensions are enough. <br /> <br /> As the title suggests, the film has a European atmosphere, in the manner of "The Bourne Identity", partly because it was shot in Venice, with Philadelphia and Los Angeles. Rhythmic and bouncy music also contributes to the European style. It adds to the optimistic nature of the film and completes the relationship of the cast. The look of the film is also a perfect match. The bright colors of all places enhance the mood and add to the attitude. The Minis not only offer a fun variation of the car chase, but also function as a necessary tracing tool. <br /> <br /> The plot is more or less simple. There are some surprises, but they are more of the fast spin type, as opposed to the hairpin curve that drops the jaw. Even with those, the film is moving fast. Once the bases are laid by the first act, everything progresses continuously. Fortunately, there is no pause in the action for a romance, which the film has wisely avoided. There is not even a break in the "real life". The story has its purpose and follows this course without distraction. The lack of depth of character prevents "The Italian Job" from being more than a good popcorn film, but with all the intricate details of burglary planning, such superfluities would have resulted in the quality and rhythm of the film. . <br /> <br /> There are a number of implausibilities that I have thought about both during and after viewing. But the film is so nice that I did not care. In the real world, most of the film probably would not have gone that easily. But "Italian work" does not take place in the real world. This happens in an elegant and cheerful criminal world that appeals to all rebels. <br /> <br /> "Italian work" is a film, in the true sense of the word. It has no Oscar claim and does not contain a deep moral message. It offers a pure escape entertainment and does it very well. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: Perhaps the best popcorn movie of the year so far. 7 out of 10
