What I had was something better. <br /> <br /> Like many movies I've commented on recently, I've been looking forward to seeing this one for a while. Especially after seeing one of Toshiaki Toyoda's other films, "Blue Spring", which easily figures in my top 20 favorite movies. I loved the trailer for "9 souls" and thought it sounded great. I did not hear anything bad about it. Now, I know why. <br /> <br /> This film begins as a sort of comedy, then, in the last half of the film, it quickly becomes something else. It becomes more dramatic as each character faces his own tragedies. Each character gets just enough time on the screen and you care what happens to each one of them. Although we have 9 characters to learn and the important thing, in just two hours, Toshiaki Toyoda is doing brilliantly. <br /> <br /> After seeing "Blue Spring", I was hoping the soundtrack would be a little bit as good as it was in this movie. I realized my wish, because the soundtrack of "9 souls" was also incredible. The music used in each scene, especially the most dramatic, is simply beautiful. I loved every second. <br /> <br /> I did not know if I wanted to see another Toshiaki Toyoda movie, "Pornostar", but after seeing it, I'll do it. Absolutely. Also, because I read the plot for that, and I think it sounds really good. I can not wait to be there. On the DVD R1 of "9 souls", there are two talks with Toyoda. He says he has finished another film and wants to start writing the script for his next film. I can not wait for both. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie. You must see him. Now.
