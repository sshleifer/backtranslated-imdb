Apartmente'L is one of the most interesting films I have ever seen. I was extremely frustrated watching this film as I sought to bring the two main actors together. This never happened at the end which disappointed me endlessly. But the end adds an even more cynical twist to a generally cynical movie. It's not a film that people are likely to revisit, but a watch itself will have a profound impact on people. For now, I have not seen the movie again and I do not think I'll do it. <br /> <br /> The story follows the experiences of a man, Max, who is engaged to Muriel. He remembers his old girlfriend Lisa (he sees it as the love of his life) as he accidentally listened to Lisa talking on the phone. So, he tries to find Lisa. Here begins his extremely frustrating search for Lisa. There are many layers in this film. There are underlying currents of jealousy, voueurism, and so on. There is also another character called Alice who is involved in all the confusion. The film then goes through a series of twists and eventually leads to an end that could be interpreted in different ways. It is fascinating to see how this film has only four main characters, but its intelligent writing makes it interesting and unique. What I like in the fact is that a movie about obsession, jealousy is done so lightly. Its pace is very fast, which probably explains why it can appeal to a wide audience. The main character, Max, has shades of gray and I felt that the end was perfect. I do not think he's supposed to be a clean-cut character considering that he's looking for his long-lost love while he's engaged and also has an affair with Alice. <br /> <br /> Alice's character is even worse. His manipulation and compulsive lies can really irritate viewers (that's the goal, I guess). The scene where she collapses before Lucien shows another facet of his character. It shows a side of her that wants to be accepted and that she is tired of all lies and games and wants to lead a normal life. In the end, she understands that she has to get away from everything. The end brings a cynical touch. Because it seems that Max's love for Alice is temporary and fictitious. It is as if we say that love in general is a temporary emotion and that it is better to choose the safe option (Muriel) than to pursue such an ephemeral thing (Lisa or Alice). In many ways, it's not really a romantic film, but a satire of romance (in a way). <br /> <br /> The performances deserve praise. Vincent Cassel as Max gives a good performance. It perfectly describes the confusion of a man who is not really sure of his engagement. Its geek appearance is an added bonus because it fits the character perfectly. But the real star of the film is Romane Bohringer in the role of Alice. Her nuanced representation of a woman jealous of Alice and in love with Max. The scene where she shouts "I'm crazy too" really shows her despair and her desire to lead a normal life with a man who loves her. <br /> <br /> Btw I also thought that lesbianism was another possible interpretation from this movie. Alice's actions can be explained in many ways. And her unreasonable obsession with Lisa can also be explained as a manifestation of a lesbian desire. It may be ridiculous, since she encourages Lisa to forgive her current boyfriend. But I had the feeling that she was a lesbian for a long time. She also avoids Lisa's questions about a boyfriend. She spends a lot of time with Lisa and she is happy during this time. This can lead many to question his sexual orientation. <br /> <br /> Overall, I would give him a 9/10. I think it deserves it, but I subtracted one because of the automatic reassignment factor. I think it's a perfect movie otherwise.
