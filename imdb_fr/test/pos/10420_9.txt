The director, Ramin Niami, delivers the goods to Somewhere in the City. I think this hilarious farce is in line with Mel Brooks comedies. Niami makes fun of New York society by creating the credible, eccentric and tragic characters of an apartment building that gives them life at the first shot that presents them. Peter Stormare's performance as a gay Shakespearean actor is absolutely worthy of a prize and the film in general does a good job in showing despair and the ability to laugh at a selfish ambition. Sandra Bernhard is perfectly qualified as a right therapist and obsessed with herself. I really enjoyed Sandra's performance, especially since I was not a big fan so far. Bai Ling, Ornella Muti and Bulle Ogier complete this international ensemble par excellence. I loved the scene with Robert John Burke and his gang of foolish criminals who could not plan a robbery if their life depended on it. With an appearance by Mayor Ed Koch and a solid performance by Paul Anthony Stewart, the boy of the revolutionary mom, Somewhere in the City entertains without losing a minute.
