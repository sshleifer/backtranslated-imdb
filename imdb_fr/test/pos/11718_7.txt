I think it's one of Burts' top five movies, with Deliverance, Smokey and the Bandit, Boogie Nights and City Heat. He also directed this one, so he had a talent for that too, like his friend Clint Eastwood. I wish he could make more movies like this or even a sequel to Sharkys Machine than Stroker Ace or Cannonball Run II. It's a tough, hard cop thriller with Reynolds at its peak. Having the beautiful Rachel Ward in the glory of Thorn Birds also helped. Henry Silva is the bad guy and he always does a good job in this area. The film is also an excellent soundtrack. I highly recommend it. If only it was on DVD in the UK, an audio commentary from Reynolds would also be very useful. *** 7/10 ***
