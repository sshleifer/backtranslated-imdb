It's a very good (documentary) film about Istanbul and its people and its music of all kinds. The editing and the success of the director are very impressive. I've been interested in Faith Akin since I saw the "Gegen die Wand" ("Duvara KarsÄ±") and I admired her work a lot, but this one was the more touching for me. am here writing this. It's not just about Turks or anything like that, it's a very good biography of a city and how the music stays alive. There are many people's points of view and very different ideas about life and love. I really liked it and I think everyone should see it, NOT ONLY, but especially those related to Turkey ...
