This commentary deals with the "North and South I Book" dealing with the period 1842-1861 <br /> <br /> The history of the United States in the nineteenth century is mainly identified by people living with the American Civil War (1861 -1865). This is a reasonable opinion, for it was the civil war that put the Union to the test; It is the civil war that has allowed Americans to realize how precious it is to live in peace. finally, it is this period that finally ended the shameful system of slavery. <br /> <br /> From the birth of the movies, there were people who adapted this time on the screen. Griffith, in the early 1900s, made his unforgettable BIRTH OF A NATION. Yet the most famous film about north-south clashes is still, I suppose, GONE WITH THE WIND (1938). Unfortunately, not many people are familiar with the wonderful television series based on John Jakes' novel "North and South". This is the best television series ever made and the time spent watching it is really precious. I recorded it on my Polish television video many years ago and have come back with great pleasure many times since. Why? <br /> <br /> First of all, the whole story is deeply rooted in historical reality. The two families, the Maines of South Carolina and the Hazards of Pennsylvania, represent two totally different ways of life. Despite this, friendship unites them. Yet what they experience is the struggle of all peoples: friendship attacked by the "truth" of "politically correct", love attacked by the hatred of "legal spouses", softness by the force of "social heroes" ". Orry Maine (Patrick Swayze) is my beloved character - someone who finds love and is quickly deprived of it; Someone who cares about his friends but political fanatics gets in the way and ruins a lot. Finally, it is someone who can see the tragic future of his country, but he can not do anything about the inevitable destiny of the South. His friend, George Hazard, is similar in most respects, but he sometimes seems to have a stronger character. It is he who shows Orry that, despite the tragedies, he has to come out of despair and live, life being the most precious thing. Although they represent two different lifestyles, their friendship is stronger than any prejudices, policies or conflicts. <br /> <br /> The other characters are also particularly developed. There are villains, like Justin LaMotte or Salem Jones, who are really mean, but most people are ambiguous, as is the nature of humanity. Charles Maine is, at first, full of rebellion, inclined to fight, but he later learns to be a true gentleman of the South, for whom the pride of the South is not a courageous word, but an act above all brave. Virgilia Hazard represents the most fanatical aspect of the abolitionist movement that seeks to condemn slavery and punish the owners of "black livestock farms". His marriage to Grady seems to be a symbol of equality but also a symbol of saying "NO" to southern politics. The two interesting characters are the sisters of Orry, Brett and Ashton - sisters in whose veins the blood flows completely opposite. Brett, in his gentleness but also his naivety, believes in absolute fidelity. She marries Billy, even though he is from the North, because she really loves him. Brett is the representation of all that is precious in a young woman. Ashton, however, is a vampire, a tigress, a woman who does not hesitate to do the worst things. The clear picture of the confrontation between their visions of the world is their discourse on men and family ... an unforgettable and universal moment! Most of the characters are moving towards their values ​​... yet, the war breaks out and they will have to put a lot aside ... <br /> <br /> Second, the performances ... someone said that everyone was not acting naturally. I would not say that. I would say rather that all the actors do very good work in their roles, from the main characters described by the youngest members of staff to guests composed of celebrities such as Liz Taylor, Robert Mitchum and others. Patrick Swayze as Orry does a great job. I consider this role one of his best. Lesley Anne Down as Madeleine is also very memorable. Her share may be too painful, but she manages to express all kinds of feelings very well. Kirstie Alley is very attractive and truly memorable as the abolitionist Virgilia Hazard. Phillip Casnoff deserves to be considered the horrible ambitious Elkanah Bent as well as David Carradine as a monster, disgusting husband of Justin LaMotte. And, unlike him, we must mention Jean Simmons, who is really excellent as a mother of Orry, whose heart beats for the glory of family life and the harmony of the union. <br /> <br /> Third, the memorable moments of "North and South" leave an indelible mark. Who can forget the first meeting of Orry and Madeleine - what a charm, what a sweetness in this scene! Or is it possible to miss the death of Madeleine's father? I found it really powerful, there is a real drama right now, the drama of a woman left by someone who really loves it. I also liked the sequence of Churubusco and George Hazard so worried about the life of his dearest friend, Orry. Then, his meetings with Constance are fantastic. Virgilia's speech in Philadelphia is a masterpiece of performance. And the last moment of the first part: although North and South can separate, their friendship will never die. Orry and George symbolically join hands as the train moves forward. Simply, there are so many beautiful and powerful scenes that it's impossible to mention half of them even here. And these beautiful tunes of Bill Conti and shot in beautiful landscapes. The music in "North and South" is very touching and memorable. <br /> <br /> What to say in the end? "North and South" is an essential DVD, a simple television series about the victory of all that is precious in us: love, friendship, loyalty, honor, truth, absolute fidelity. 9/10
