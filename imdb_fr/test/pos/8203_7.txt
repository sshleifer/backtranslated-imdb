When "The Net" was announced for the first time, the ads seemed ridiculous. Then, when I saw it, it was actually pretty good.

Then, through a series of events, her identity is erased by a crowd of dark people and she can not prove that she exists. <br /> <br /> Some parts of the film are a bit far-fetched; you would probably know what parts if you saw the movie. That said, it's a good glimpse of what the existence of the Internet has been able to inflict on unsuspecting people. I recommand it
