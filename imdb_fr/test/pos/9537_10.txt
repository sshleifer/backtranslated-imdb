Maybe once a generation a film arrives at perfection. For me, "The Railway Children" is this movie - a timeless classic that has been made and interpreted beautifully. He describes all that is worthy of being in humanity and culminates in the conquest of love and faith on a cruel injustice. Each performance is a jewel, even though Bobbie stands out, and in the manner of Judy Garland and Dorothy before her, Jenny Agutter prevents us from imagining anyone in the role. <br /> <br /> The world is better for This film and today's children would be much more enjoyable to watch. <br /> <br /> Of course, like so many young men of my generation, I fell head over heels in love with Jenny Agutter and her hold was so strong when I had the good fortune to meet her a few days ago - his mesmerizing smile and voice like dripping honey were always there to send me weakening his knees as they had done for the first time many years ago!
