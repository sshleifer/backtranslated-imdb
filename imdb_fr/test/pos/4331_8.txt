"Death Wish 3" recalls Charles Bronson as time keeper Paul Kersey, now retired. Yeah, well before long, Kersey is back to his habits. who stormed part of the city (New York still, by the way) this time his war, so Kersy Hauls pulls out the big guns (literally) for that. This movie is actually quite fun to watch, especially for a few. The bad guys are dying or seriously injured creatively, which is always a good thing. Violence is not so personal in this one, it is, of course, on a much larger scale, much like bombarding your victims from afar, rather than fighting alone. This film is clearer than the first, which makes it easier to watch. film, its more loophole than anything.is also sometimes corny and pseudo-inspirational, but the pipe scenes fall flat. they should have left the original "Death Wish" without sequelae, but since they did not do it, they should have stopped here. 8/10
