People seem to be waiting for Citizen Kane here! The Planet is a movie about Monster B and, as such, is fun and different enough to be appreciated. The director clearly has something to offer - not so sure of some of the actors. With regard to the effects? Â£ 8000, it's not a lot of effects. I would gladly recommend this outing to a sci-fi or anyone who does not take monster movies too seriously. If that is the case? Look at 3 blue colors instead. I noticed a comment saying that he had stolen Alien. As Alien did not scammed things. The best thing about the movie? The director. The worst thing about the movie? The casting. Maybe it's time for the manager to move from Glasgow to London and find talent. In the meantime, bravo. At least you are trying to do something.
