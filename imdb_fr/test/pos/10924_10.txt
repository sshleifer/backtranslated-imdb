Above all, I would like to say that before watching this film, I considered myself an individual who accepts. Someone who cared about others, appreciated others, found hardly any judgment against other people, and this film has (I think) radically changed my life or my point of view. When I looked at it, I did not really know what it was, I knew it was a kind of forbidden relationship, but other than that, I was without intelligence and, while I were beginning to see what was happening between these two wonderfully portrayed characters, I was in shock, disbelief, confusion and surprise. The first time I looked at it, I was blind. Blind to their love, to their intimacy, to their connection, to their purity as human beings, to their relationship. I looked at it a second time because I finally realized how hypocritical I was, saying to myself and to others, "Oh, I accept all kinds of people and I try not to not judging them "while judging this story wonderful and incredibly insightful, because of my fear I guess. The second time I watched this movie, I opened my eyes that were closed the first time and I really watched, not the kind of taboo relationship I had heard all my life, but simply two human beings in love. And I loved it, I loved the plot, I loved the individual characters slightly broken, but still strong in the film, I liked the sharing of feelings and I loved the strong links that 's were created. It's a really beautiful and admirable film that made me cry from time to time, and I hope those who read this and watch the movie will eventually remember that everyone deserves to like it, no matter the form in which it is presented. ....
