I particularly liked the end of this film - I really felt what the characters must have felt, which, in my opinion, is a mark of good achievement. The new record shop rookie amazed me - the character's development was excellent, even though her "role" would probably be considered minor. <br /> <br /> I was also impressed by the fact that the entire movie Although its content was dark, it was free of nudity, profanation and violence free. Sadness, sexuality and darkness can all be communicated (often better) by what is left unsaid, but it seems that this is often unique to truly "classic" films and actors. Congratulations to the filmmaker for that.
