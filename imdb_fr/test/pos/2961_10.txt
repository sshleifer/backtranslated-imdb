At the time, when I was in the United States, I was about 7 or 8 years old, I always woke up early, just to watch this, along with a lot of other cartoons like HootKloot, The Road Runner Show, The Pink Panther. But it was perhaps one of the most memorable and entertaining animated works of the moment, and I still find it very funny today, I'll never forget the episodes, like the one where two aardvarks were fighting over the box chocolate pudding? or the one where the aardvark tries to reach the island where all the ants are and my favorite, the one where the ant, the aardvark and a dog end up in an animal hospital, which will later be the base of a band Looney Toon similar cartoon with Sylvester, Tweety and the bulldog. This is one of the most unforgettable cartoons in which everyone would like to come back, I would do it. An excellent series.
