Most of the other reactions of subscribers to this service were very relevant, although some found it slow or ambiguous perplexed me. Rather than ambiguous, it was complex and involved several levels of meaning. It can be seen as anti-war, because of the scenes of opening and closing, and the madness of pretended greatness, and the wonder that the riders had when they were preparing for the great charge of Eylau, contrasting with his horrible and disturbing conclusion, when we see bloody uniforms, dead corpses, etc. - but above all, I consider the film as a moral man in an immoral society. In the end, Chabert chooses to withdraw from the corrupt French post-Napoleonic world and opts for the simple pleasures provided by Derville (himself saved by his recognition of Chabert's fundamental decency and the morality of his choice of renunciation) - white bread, cheese, wine and tobacco - on the wealth he leaves to his wife, to her and to the dishonor of society. In her case, we can see the film as feminist, in the position of women at that time, in which the only weapons of Mrs. Chabert are its charm, its beauty, its artifices and, finally, its money.
