It is a spiritual and delightful adaptation of Dr. Seuss' book, brilliantly animated by the best and most deserving UPA of the UPA. Special mention must be made to the superb score of music and sound effects, which are an essential element to help make this cartoon so memorable and enjoyable. Subsequent episodes of the series (four in total) are not based on Dr. Seuss original elements, although all but the last continue to use his familiar rhyme style. The three suites are: Symphony of Gerald McBoing Boing (1953); How now Boing Boing (1954); Gerald McBoing Boing on the planet Moo (1956) - although he also appeared in a later episode of Mr. Magoo.
