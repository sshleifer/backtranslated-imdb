When it comes to movies, I do not easily distinguish between shit, pure shit and masterpieces. I believe this film is an absolute masterpiece and it's hard to entertain myself for more than 90 minutes. This movie was slower than Mystic River and Harry Potter 3 combined and I still managed to stay in my seat. For me, this is the passion that Eric Bogosian put in his performance. It is extremely difficult to achieve such a feat and to obtain a positive effect. Bogosian has probably made one of the most difficult solo performances of modern cinema. I had no respect for Bogosian until the end of the film. The whole monologue, a few minutes before the inexorable climax, was the turning point, it was the key that was returning to me. This man reached a point so low that he knew he could never recover. The businessmen congratulated him on his performance. His lightning prose made even the thinnest of the cavalcade shake his head. This made me realize that personal integrity and hypocrisy do not matter in the world of spoken radio, even in the corporate world. Stone may have put forward a hyper-liberal program, but it's film and production that caught my attention. Oliver Stone is a minor master of bad mood. The last third of the film probably had the best lighting and cinematography I have ever seen in a movie. Stone cleverly dressed the DJ's booth like a five-in-seven cell in a nineteenth-century prison. Visually, it seems that the only friend of Bogosian is the black foam that absorbs his usual vitriol. He speaks and it does not answer. This is a sad metaphor given the way he treats the people who entrusted him with his success. Stone and Bogosian made an amazing film about a man trapped in a walled prison and a prison of his own. This man is confined to his own will and he can never escape it. The scene that made me understand his enigma was when he did not want his ex-wife to come back. He preferred his own prison instead of the outside world. Every story has a conflict and it has resulted in the simplest of all conflicts: the man against himself. "Talk Radio" presents this conflict in an intelligent, striking and clever way. This movie does not contain any hidden message and any astute viewer should expect the progression of the events. I just leaned back and let my mind be grabbed by this movie and I loved it. It is ignored, invisible, and it will never be properly recognized. Hope this remains so because the gems deserve to be found and then hidden again. It's a gem because I found it in the discounted DVD box of my local Wal-Mart store. For $ 5.50, it was worth the half hour I spent digging to find it. I did it and I had more than my money. It's one of the best movies ever made and it's only for ten reasons. Ten reasons give a score of ten. <br /> <br /> Here ends my speech.
