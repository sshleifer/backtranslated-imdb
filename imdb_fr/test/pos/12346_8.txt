The famous and mysterious loner Raymar, who is a kind of deadly telekinetic psychic vampire, suddenly dies in bizarre circumstances. Julie Wells, high school student, is a friendly girl (a warm and friendly performance of the charming Meg Tilly) wants to be accepted by the snobbish clique of the Sisters (played to perfection sublimely sparkling by Leslie Speights, Robin Evans and the hug Elizabeth Daily) so she agrees to spend a night in a scary mausoleum where Raymar's body was buried as part of a rite of initiation. Of course, Raymar still has his extraordinary powers. It will be a long and painful night of pure and frightening terror for poor Julie. <br /> <br /> The director / co-writer Tom McLoughlin (who later gave us "Friday Part 13 Part VI: Jason Lives") avoids creating a dark and disturbing atmosphere, but does not succeed this feat because the first hour is too slow, too talkative and without incident to be at a distance scary or suspenseful. However, I nevertheless found that this film of imperfect dread was strangely attractive and amusing. The great poofy hairstyles, a wacky music editing sequence, fake alerts at the right time (including the omnipresent hand on the gag on the shoulder!), A scene in a sequined video game arcade, a jar happily smoking and a hilarious and stupid teen slang ("brain nerd"!) gives this image some quaint quaint charm from the 80s period. Hal Trussell's beautiful and refined cinematography (I especially dug the Slowly gliding Steadicam shots), Bob Summers' phantasmagorical and whimsical synth synthesis, and Tom Burman's stunning f / x are breathtaking. Adam West of the "Batman" series of television never loses room in a secondary room. The mausoleum is an impressive, vast and troubling main place. The grand finale with a rotting decaying corpse band coming out of their coffins and floating is considered a wonderfully macabre shock piece. Of course, this baby is certainly not a jewel unfairly misunderstood, but it still offers a lot of pleasant pleasures and ridiculous.
