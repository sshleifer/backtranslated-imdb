Typical Spanish production - slow, but with a lot of sensuality and oozing sexuality on the part of lead actress Paz Vega. (Watch it in "Spanglish"). Great sets, lots of colors - you can see Cordoba, Seville, the Spanish mountains and the countryside. The plot tends to furrow here and there, but if you follow closely (I managed to do it, even if the film is in Spanish), you will understand the meaning. <br /> <br /> This is how Carmen, a very sensual Gypsy girl, uses her feminine tricks to seduce men. Carmen is taken to prison after attacking a cigarette mate at the cigar factory where she works. She persuades Jose, the soldier responsible for taking her to prison, to let her escape. José succumbs to his charms because she speaks Basque (he is Navarrese and speaks the same language). Jose is punished with one month's imprisonment and demoted to the rank of infantryman. He then meets Carmen at a party and they end up falling in love. But Carmen refuses to commit to him and continues his lascivious and seductive lifestyle. Jealous, Jose kills another soldier who was with Carmen. They must leave the city. Running life makes Jose a bandit. Carmen, meanwhile, remains the same, a very promiscuous woman. In the end, Jose loses his mind and ends up killing Carmen. <br /> <br /> The story is told by José in prison, waiting to be executed. The person to whom he tells the story is a French writer and anthropologist, Prospero Merrime, whose luxury watch (she plays Fur Elise of Beethoven) was stolen by Carmen or Jose. <br /> <br /> the delicious Paz Vega.
