During his journey, Yunfei meets a young woodcutter named Tan (Chan) and a fighter in disgraced sword (Chang Chung), nicknamed "the vagabond". The two men suffered at the hands of Shih and want revenge. The three team up to defeat Shih and his eight bodyguards and escort the revolutionary to safety. <br /> <br /> The action of the martial arts is above average under the direction of Sammo Hung. Dorian Tan uses his trademark very effectively as "The eighteen styles of the North" with some "boxing of the five styles of the South". Sammo Hung and Jackie Chan also offer excellent martial arts performances. James Tien is not the greatest martial artist on the Jade screen but does an acceptable job. Some of the early fights are a little slow and seem choreographed, but the final clashes featuring Chan, Tan and Hung are very good. <br /> <br /> Director John Woo provides a lot of interesting information about the development of the character in the film. refreshing. Leung Wing Kat's cinematography is very elegant, unique and beautiful for a kung-fu movie of that time. The music of Joseph Koo: a combination of flutes and 70's "Shaft" orchestral pieces gives the best of kung fu cinema. Hand of Death is not the usual kung fu comedy of Jackie and Sammo. Hand of Death is a serious and direct story inspired by revenge. <br /> <br /> The Hand of Death aka Countdown in Kung Fu is an underrated classic of old-fashioned kung-fu.
