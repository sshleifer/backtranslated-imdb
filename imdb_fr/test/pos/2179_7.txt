Well, I just saw Buster Keaton's movie in Fatty Arbuckle's The Butcher Boy and, in spite of the harshness, everything seems to be happening without any logical reason - I thought there was something to laugh about. Like when Buster orders molasses from Butcher Fatty, Fatty forces Buster to pay, Buster says he puts it in the bucket containing molasses, Fatty throws molasses into Buster's hat and takes money, Buster breaks his head as he gets stuck, Fatty tries to remove it while molasses falls to the ground, Buster's feet are now stuck to the floor and so on. It was probably not amusingly read, but on the screen it was hilarious, as were some slapstick containing flour and a later sequence in the boarding of Fatty's girlfriend with Fatty dressed in drag and Buster helping Fatty's rival in drag. As I said, many scenes do not make sense, but the visuals, especially those involving Arbuckle and Keaton, make you laugh even more today. Recommended viewing for Keaton Completists.
