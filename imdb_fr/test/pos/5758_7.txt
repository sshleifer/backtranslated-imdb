I had been looking for this movie for a long time before finding it; I had seen it when I was younger and I loved it. After my second reading, I have always loved it and I still do it. <br /> <br /> a film of love / hate, if you like low, young, comic, then you will find that funny. If you do not like that kind of humor, do not worry. I love this movie and I grew up with these humor programs. For me, this film only places their comic genius on the big screen. It is by no means a winner, but if you just want a good slap done well, it's here! <br /> <br /> the film lacks the quality of the TV series, which is usually the case of movies, but it still has enough material to make you laugh even if many jokes are quite similar to their previous job . <br /> <br /> yes, the humor is a bit childish and does not suit all tastes, but sometimes you just need it in a movie.
