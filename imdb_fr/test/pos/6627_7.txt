Shame, is a Swedish film in Swedish with English subtitles. The film is about a husband and a wife named Jan and Eva. They live on an island where they work as farmers. There is a war and soldiers begin to attack the inhabitants of the island. Once the war has calmed down, a little Jan and Eva are arrested for joining the opposing camp. Once made public, the film still shows how two ordinary people will act in a situation of war, life or death. Recipient of CEC Award for Best Foreign Film at the Cinema Writers Circle Awards, Guldbagge Award for Best Actress (Liv Ullman, who plays Eva) for Guldbagge Award, NBR Award for Best Foreign Language Film and Best Actress at National Council Of Review and NSFC Award for Best Actress, Best Director (Ingmar Bergman) and Best Film at the National Society of Film Critics Awards. Shame, good direction, good scenario, good performance of Max Von Sydow (performer Jan) and Liv Ullman (performer Eva), good cinematography and good production design. Shame is a well-made and well-made story of how people in a desperate situation sometimes do everything in their power to survive. The movie has a powerful message and is a good movie. The reason I do not classify this film higher is because it's not a masterpiece like some other Ingmar Bergman films like Wild Strawberries, The Seventh Seal or Persona, for example. The film did not have as much impact on me as I thought and it lacked the reflective and philosophical dialogue of Ingmar Bergman. Although it is far from being one of his best films, there is still much to be done about Shame, and it's a good movie. I probably would have preferred it not to happen any more, having not seen some of these other Bergman masterpieces.
