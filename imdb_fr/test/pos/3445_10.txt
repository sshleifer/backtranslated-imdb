This epic gathers a team and talented actors, a narrative depth superior to most novels, a wonderful music, a philosophy and a link with LIFE difficult to explain. To immerse myself in Die Zweite Heimat is for me a spiritual experience, similar to the fear of stargazing in a clear night sky. The language and use of color and monochrome segments add to the dramatic impact. The film inspired me to go to Munich and visit some of the sites, including Edgar Reitz's office. From that moment, I promised myself to improve my German skills. After Die Zweite Heimat, I feel almost German, as if I were in the head of the characters. I'm also trying to match the piano playing of Henry Arnold (Hermann), but that's the only thing that will ever escape me! This drama is unparalleled and I had the chance to see it on BBC2 in the UK and SBS in Australia. The sequel, Heimat 3, is currently shooting in Germany.
