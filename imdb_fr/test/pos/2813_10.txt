When I saw the preview of this film, I said to myself, "Here is another silent TV movie that is written with the thought and complexity of a soap opera", but when I saw it, I was surprised. Tiffany-Amber Thiessen is a woman who falls in love with her husband and the wife of a man (Eric Close of Now and Again), but begins to lose confidence when a series of rapes begin. take place in his community. At first, she is blinded by his assurances that he is innocent and his love for him, but over time, she continues to be suspicious of him. <br /> <br /> It sounds like a boring preparation. A melodramatic TV movie is really much better than that, because the characters are well interpreted by Thiessen and Close, and the film's scenario allows them to be much more complicated and intelligent than you thought; it's not just caricatures or cardboard characters that only exist to advance the plot, but real, three-dimensional characters, and we really care about that. And the film is smart enough to offer an exciting climax to the story without resorting to stupid action scenes, stupid clichés or cheap melodrama. Instead, we share the inner fears and conflicts of the main character and give her a realistic description of how she might be able to solve and act appropriately. <br /> <br /> If you have the chance to give this one a look, please do it. Its production values ​​are not really great (after all, it's a TV movie), but if you can look beyond that, you'll find an excellent story.
