The Kite Runner was beautiful, poignant and very moving. I particularly liked the two children actors of the film as well as the actor who represents the father. It really made me want to go back and re-read the book. <br /> <br /> Music was a wonderful part of the movie's plot. If there is a soundtrack for the movie, I will buy it to accompany my second reading of the book. It's also a visually stunning movie. The cinematography was beautiful and really added to the experience. <br /> <br /> The Brazilian word 'saudades' is very descriptive of how I felt at the end of the film ... "it's a deep desire from someone or somewhere, which is very kind but also marked by an inevitable sadness "(definition given years ago by Antonio Carlos Jobim). <br /> <br /> See the movie in a small cinema here for an advanced projection. I would love to see you again on a very large screen with a sophisticated audio system. <br /> <br /> I can not wait for the official release. I will definitely recommend the film to friends.
