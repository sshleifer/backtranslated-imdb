Yes, I watched this mini serie with my mom and dad as a child. It was one of the few miniseries that my 9 year old could really follow. I remember it was very well done and I did not necessarily feel like the typical mini-series. It was more or less an original concept that really caught your eye. I would recommend this mini-series to all fans of history and twists. Although most twists in this movie are spelled or predictable, it's still worth it. However, I have not yet verified if you can get it via Netflix. I imagine not. They should play on the story channel or something.
