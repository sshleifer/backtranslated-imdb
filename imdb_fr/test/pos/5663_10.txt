I think it's incredibly difficult to write a complete review for Giorgino, simply because it's one of those complex, poetic and philosophical, television-dependent films that put the brain to the test if, looking at them, you are trying to enjoy Their shell and their kernel are touching simultaneously, but there are several things that are certain and that make no doubt for any art man (which, I hope, I am). The first thing: it is a certain masterpiece, even of this type of art which remains long; the second: it is one of those rare "dark" films in which the darkness is poetic, even romantic, attractive and much sadder than depressing, like the art of Pieter Brueghel or Caspar David Friedrich. As for the heart of the film, someone called him Kafkian, even though I disagree with that, because he far exceeds Kafka's misanthrope logic and looks more like Edgar Poe's parable. : dark and scary, but touching the softest strings of our souls. In reality, from a poetic point of view (which is much more important than the narrative), Giorgino is a tale about eternal peace and love that can only be realized through the eternal childhood of the soul. Those who have such souls are generally called crazy by our society, but from another point of view they all have lost virtue when they have become "developed": the virtue of God's love. Indeed, Giorgino is a very Christian film, "Be like children" (Mt 18: 3) is a real hidden slogan, although the film never deals with any kind of morality and focuses solely on Christian philosophy for Dare to suppose, the true God is beyond all human morality. Yet I think Boutonnat is too harsh, describing the "adults" as a sort of demon trying to steal their infancy from rare souls, but that's his point of view and he has the right to think so. While looking at Giorgino, do not try to search for hidden symbols (although they do exist), it is better to look for the thoughts expressed through the characters and their behavior, and learn from them. In addition, I can not say that the film is surprisingly like an excellent photograph, including the rational use of color filters, incredibly correct editing, fantastic acting and, of course, atmospheric beauty. winter mountains that reminded me of Brueghel's "Hunters in the Snow". It is also interesting to note that the scene with Death in the form of an old woman with black eyes, mounted on a cart, instantly reminded me of Pesta (plague) from the series of drawings by the Norwegian painter Theodor Kittelsen, illustrating the plague sweeps the population of a small town from the mountain valley. Is this a coincidence?
