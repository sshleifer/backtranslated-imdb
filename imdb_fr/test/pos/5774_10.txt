Hello, I was wondering if anyone had a copy of the movie Broken Promise ?? I loved growing this movie and watched it every time. I've seen it for years and would love to have a copy. I checked all the internet and I could not find it. If someone has a copy to exchange or sell, thank you to send me an email to NoelGypsy@Yahoo.com ... Thank you and have a good evening !! Christine --------- The "broken promise" was made to Melissa Michaelsen, aged eleven, whose parents abandoned her and her siblings. Michaelsen, admitted by the county, was helpless to witness the separation of his brothers and sisters and their exploitation by different families. One of the children is even institutionalized. Chris Sarandon, juvenile justice officer, joins Michaelsen in his fight to reunite his family under one roof. Broken Promise was originally proposed as a "General Foods Golden Showcase" presentation. It was the first television broadcast on May 5, 1981.
