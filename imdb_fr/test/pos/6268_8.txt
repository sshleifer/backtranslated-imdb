God bless Joe D'Amato ... I love Italian horror, cheese (in movies), science fiction, and so on. <br /> <br /> This one, of course, was a little harder to watch, but another bad movie fun. <br /> <br /> I like how people prefer a negative criticism with "I normally enjoy bad movies, but ..." It was not a goal, it was a bad film FOR people who like bad movies. It's one of my best movies. <br /> <br /> Miles O'Keefe was a poor man's Conan, but what a pleasure. Who can not have fun with a primitive nuclear bomb, a hang glider and a rubbery rubber monster? It's good to hate this movie if you only like Hollywood Drek as "Titanic" or "Pretty Woman", but if you really want to, I mean really love bad movies, look at this one. <br /> <br /> This is one of those movies that are fun to rent for a beer or when you have a couple of friends and are looking for some brain-less fun. <br /> <br /> My rating 8/10.
