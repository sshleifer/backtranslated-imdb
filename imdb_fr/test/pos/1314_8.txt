Paul Schrader and his brother Leonard wrote Mishima and, in doing so, clearly drew parallels between Yukio Mishima's life and his work. The film is divided into four sections: beauty, art, action and the fateful day when Mishima held a general hostage and addressed the garrison, so that she would make fun of him and his Bushido ideals of the code of samurai. Mishima committed a ritual seppuku on November 25, 1970, and planned it as a mesh of beauty, art, and action. Schrader sets scenes recreating that day with three different scripts from Mishima's novels: Golden Pavilion Temple, Kyoko's House, and Horses on the Run. The moment of seppuku is perfectly realized in relation to its shocking climax when you back the camera while zooming simultaneously. <br /> <br /> Black and white sequences mingle with the colorful moments depicted in Mishima's novels. The black and white scenes represent memories of Mishima's childhood and youth. Schrader correlates some of these autobiographical moments with scenes of novels often similar to Mishima's real life, such as his infancy, the development of his obsession with bodybuilding, and his promotion of the samurai code. Each of the three themes of beauty, art and action is illustrated in the representations chosen in the respective novels. The color sequences are reminiscent of Technicolor's first films, staging the film, perhaps giving it a surrealistic quality considering the subject matter. <br /> <br /> Ken Ogata plays the real Mishima with unwavering determination and heads to the General's office on that fateful day and looks like the real Mishima. Schrader took enormous risks with this film by focusing on his novels and linking them thematically to Mishima's personal life and literary ambitions. The editing of the film between the three main sections of November 25, 1970, the growing segments in black and white and the colorful scenes of novel clearly indicate the deliberate intersection of these elements of beauty, art and action in the life of Mishima. Sometimes it is hard to follow and there may be little to recommend to the uninitiated viewer. *** of 4 stars.
