Whenever I do not give 150% of my dreams or goals, I think of Mark Borchardt, the real subject of "American Movie". Mark's persistence in making his first feature film produced and shot is so compelling that it will make you laugh, shake your head with sadness and encourage him. <br /> <br /> I have not seen such an honest documentary since. the movie about R. Crumb. The "actors" (Mark's family and friends) are all excellent. Give this film a chance and you'll see a great movie and a beautiful portrait of everything the American dream is made of.
