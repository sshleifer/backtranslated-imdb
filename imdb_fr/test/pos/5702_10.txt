... and my reasons are simple - there are so many great films presented and discussed here (most of them by their own directors and stars), so many clips of infamous moments in the film history of the 70s , and actually a number of movies that I have not seen yet, that it would not be fair to note this work. By this logic, I should not have given a note to other documentaries such as Martin Scorsese's personal journey in American Movies and My Travel to Italy. But while these films were based on the vision of a film man and told almost throughout the course, Richard LaGravanese and the decade (Infante), Ted Demmes, let the films and creators express themselves fully. <br /> <br /> What makes "Decade" worth at least a watch for moviegoers or just for those who love movies from the late 60s / 70s in America, these are the levels at which it goes version (three hours, not the theatrical version, that I have no comment) a lot of ground is covered. Interviews include Scorsese, Robert Altman, Sidney Lumet, Julie Christie, Jon Voight, Francis Ford Coppola, Paul Schrader, Pam Grier, Bruce Dern, Peter Bogdanovich, Roger Corman, Dennis Hopper, Robert Towne, and others. flow of insight from beginning to end. The way clips and directors / actors appear, mounted together in a flashy and fast style, is also fascinating. <br /> <br /> My comment on the documentary is that most of the information presented has been reported in various books, such as Easy Riders, Raging Bulls, and although I have not seen the film version of this book, but I'm sure he would have covered many movies, directors and incidents like this (in fact, the book of this book is one of the best I've ever read.) THIS TIME, this documentary is special for the cinema future buffs and movie buffs - they can watch this and learn not only about such well-known images as Easy Rider, The Last Picture Show, Annie Hall, Coming Home, and the lessor known as Scarecrow, Panic in Needle Park, The Owner, Joe, they do not shoot horses, but they can also find out who influenced them (new waves of Europe and Asia), for whom they exerted influence and how the subject that sparked controversy after controversy is always so intriguing and advertising material for the contemporary crowd.
