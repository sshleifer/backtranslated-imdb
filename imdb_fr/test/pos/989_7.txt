I can not really rate that, because I can not say I liked it. But it's the story that bothered me, not the making of the film. The acting, the staging, the atmosphere, the music were all good. It's just after seeing a group of people do things that you can not really understand, the movie ends. It's educational to show the horrors of war seen from home and that the feelings should have no meaning and remain strong, but that's about it. <br /> <br /> The plot covers a period of a few years during which the poet Dylan Thomas is taken under the roof of a former ex-girlfriend. He is married, brings his wife and later the kid, while the ex (Knightley) marries another guy. But the tension is there, Dylan is an idiot obsessed with the car and the new husband comes back from the war with a slight case of PTSD. Add some nice characters and you have your hands full. <br /> <br /> In short: you must be in the mood to love this film. The difficult part defines this mood. I do not think I have ever participated. Already. He is therefore probably best supervised by adults with an understanding of complex and strange human behavior and perhaps a curiosity for Dylan Thomas.
