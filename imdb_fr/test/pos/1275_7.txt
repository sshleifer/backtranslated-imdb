It's definitely Nolan's most intimate and reflective piece. Not to say that Memento or Insomnia are bad, but they certainly were more up to the standards of Hollywood ... while Follow is more an independent film. The story is very brilliant and very well developed. Overall, observe that if you're a fan of one of Nolan's works, I'm sure you'll be able to enjoy it more.
