I thought that this film was excellent, original and different from the usual film from the movie "The disengaged cop catching the serial killer". Kiefer Sutherland was brilliant as usual - I really do not think I saw anything he did without acting brilliantly. The dialogue was sometimes fun, illuminating the atmosphere and the engaging plot. Thanks to the other commentators for showing the link to Alice in Wonderland - I did not see them. I would recommend this movie to all fans of Kiefer Sutherlands (like me) and to anyone who wants to watch an entertaining movie for a few hours. It is unfortunate that it has not been shown in cinemas for a wider audience.
