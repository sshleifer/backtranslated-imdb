More entertaining than all the gay orgies of "300" together. More heartbreaking than a Shakespearian tragedy. More poetic than even the most melodramatic poems about lost love and blah blah blah. And on top of all that, the biggest bin ever made. <br /> <br /> A black comedy testing the limits of the human senses, John Waters' cult film "Pink Flamingos" is a story about the conflict between two families ends in humiliation, death and of course by the consumption of dog feces (yeah by the way, this is not the humiliating part). No no, it is not about impossible love, there is no Romeo or Juliet on these 90 minutes approximately. This movie is about the battle for prestige if you could call it that. The battle for the title - The dirtiest person ever. <br /> <br /> On one side, we have Divine (played by the transvestite of regular waters ... uh ... Divine) a benevolent girl, good mother, cannibal, murderer, pervert and current owner of this title . She loves her son Crackers too much. Crackers themselves have a sexual attraction for chickens and girls by sometimes mixing them into trios. A family friend and a loyal accomplice, Cotton derives his satisfaction from watching Crackers during some of his ... acts involving the aforementioned objects of attraction. Last but not least, the mother and grandmother of Divine at Crackers, Edie. A 400-pound woman who sleeps, eats and lives in a cradle. She is addicted to eggs and loves the egg man (the man who brings the eggs ... lol). <br /> <br /> The four of them live peacefully in a caravan outside the city until they become a target for the marbles. Exhibitionists, manipulators, cheaters, very perverse people actually. Their main source of income comes from the abduction and impregnation of young women. For the impregnating part, they use their trusty but loyal butler to provide sperm. After that, they sold the child born to the highest bidder. <br /> <br /> It's the Marbles' envy of Divine and his title that will lead to an inevitable confrontation between the two families. An epic battle of filth, perversion and violence. <br /> <br /> "Pink Flamingos" is a masterpiece unmatched in the genre of the trash movie. Charged with oddities and strange acts, John Waters' film is hated and hated by traditionalists, critics, and the average movie audience. But for the few people who are not affected by these generalizations, flamingos are an unforgettable experience. Funny and sick, violent and poetic. It's really an exercise in bad taste
