The first music video I saw, Thriller, my mother told me that she had taken me from the hospital to the house. When we arrived, my sister had MTV on TV and Thriller was playing. My mother said that I was smiling. Silly I know, but I love Michael Jackson since that day, the video Thriller inspired me to dance, but the dance is memorized to this day. I even played it in front of an audience 3 times! Words can not describe the power of this song that makes you want to sing and dance, but Michael of course had to raise the bar for MTV at the time by signing with American director Werewolf in London, John Landis, and directing the unique thriller. <br /> <br /> Michael and his date, Ola Ray, are out of gas in a dark and wooded place. They go to the forest and Michael asks if she would like to be quiet. She accepts and he gives her a ring. He warns, however, that he is not like the others, not really, not like the others. A full moon appears, and Michael begins to convulse in agony ?? turn into a horrible werewolf! His appointment screams and runs away, but the werewolf catches up, overthrows her and begins to look at her with her claws. The scene ends in a movie theater where Michael and his friend watch this scene unfold in a movie called Thriller. Michael smiles but his appointment is scared and tells him she's leaving. Michael catches her up and says it's just a movie, but she does not like her jokes and she starts to walk away. Michael and his companion then walk down a foggy street and tease her with the first Thriller verses. They pass a cemetery, where the corpses start to come out of their graves while Vincent Price makes his blow. Michael and his date are then surrounded by zombies and suddenly, Michael himself becomes a zombie. Michael and the undead perform together an elaborate song and a dance number, followed by the Thriller choir. <br /> <br /> Thriller is arguably the best music video of all time. What's funny is that people who want to argue with others Michael Jackson's videos, but what makes Thriller so special is the dance, the story, the effects, it was to the time the most expensive music video of his day. Of course, Michael raised the bar with his famous music video Scream, then again with Ghosts. But say what you want, Michael was the star of the 80s, there was no celebrity like him, he loved life, he lived, breathed and kissed him. Thriller is proof that he was ready to work to do the best and that's what we got with the legend that is Thriller. <br /> <br /> 10/10
