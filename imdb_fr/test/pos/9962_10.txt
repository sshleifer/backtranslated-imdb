My guide to the quality of a movie is if I think about it again after leaving the cinema. I still think about it the next day, which does not happen often. <br /> <br /> The landscape (a reasonable assumption for 16th century Italy), costumes, lighting and cinema are excellent. It's a beautiful film visually. <br /> <br /> The characters can never go beyond the script they have to recite, but these actors have made the most of their material, which is excellent. This is one of Shakespeare's best plays, which will still be 400 years old. All the directors were interesting and pleasant. <br /> <br /> Those who call themselves anti-Semites must be deaf and blind. On the contrary, it is anti-Venetian sixteenth century Catholic. While Shylock plays a man controlled and tortured by the injuries he has suffered, it is clear that the society in which he lives is largely to blame. The scenario clearly places his personal responsibility in his proper place. <br /> <br /> A great movie.
