It's not often that I feel enough to post something on a movie. It was simply the worst movie I have ever seen. The performances were at best laughable, at worst they were, well, there is no other word to say that, it's awful. In particular, we must see and hear the main woman who has random sexual convictions to be able to believe. Honestly, the plot is absurd, the dialogue appalling and the characterization ... there is none. I'm surprised it's not a Alan Smithee movie. I can not stress this enough ... to avoid at all costs. How do movies like this ever happen? It's not a cinematic movie at its lowest level.
