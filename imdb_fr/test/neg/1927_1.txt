I watched this film to see the direction taken by one of the most promising young talents in cinema. Unfortunately, with this film, Leelee Sobieski chose a path not only well used, but totally meaningless. This film used all the baffled tricks of the book to get out of the screen, pat you on the shoulder and politely ask if it could have the strings of your heart to pull them well. The romance can be well done, and when it does, the viewer is left feeling the love described on the screen. During the emotional climax of this movie, I laughed. Warmly. To save you time and money, I suggest instead of watching this movie, take a meal of Karo syrup and Velveeta. It's pretty much the same thing.
