This must match the worst movies I have ever seen. It was just not funny. My wife fell asleep. I guess if you're the kind of person who has bright eyes at the sight of a dog, he can do something for you. If you expect a comedy movie to contain humor, you will be disappointed if you do not find an English radio announcer annoying the word f much. The club strippers kept their underwear so there was not even a bit of nudity to relieve boredom. What happened in the strip club did not make sense. The main character murmured a lot with which I had no sympathy. Mena Suvari was barely in the film, probably just to make it sound like a serious attempt to produce a movie. The bad guys were not convincing and were just as threatening as a dead sheep.
