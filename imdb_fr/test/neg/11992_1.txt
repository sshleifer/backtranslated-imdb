Mr. "Uwe Fail" strikes again, turning a classic game into cheap shit. Bad game; Bad staging; Terrible adaptation; I mean, the Far-Cry game was great, it's like a real FPS game, cool weapons and a lot of "point and shoot". In the movie, we had nothing compared to the game. We had some "aim and shoot" stuff but ... I do not know how to explain to you, but if you've ever watched another "Uwe Fail" movie, you understand. If you do not believe me, go to the "Petition Online" website and check the "Stop Uwe Bowl" heading. <br /> <br /> This film made me bleed eyes, it must be stopped for once. . <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time.
