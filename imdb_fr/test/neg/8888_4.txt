Some time ago, I swore I'd never have another Joe Castro movie (maybe after "Near Death"), but I ended up with it by accident because it was a version of Troma and I did not read the cover carefully. Oops. Well, I looked at it, and it's not good at all, but it's, I suppose, a kind of "tongue in cheek" ... if it's not, it seemed like it was it. Some intrepids from the University of Rio Grande have sought to know if the Chupacabra existed, because of the recording of a GOAT BARN surveillance camera by someone who shows this strange thing that jumps through the field of vision . And also because the person that this thing supposedly killed was the uncle of the chief of the expedition. There are a couple of cameramen, one of whom moans all the time, and an ex-sailor named "Army" (?!), Who is somehow an ammo expert. Anyway, they find the Chupacabra in a guy's ranch and leave to find him, getting involved in two supposed witches. The creature itself is rather ridiculous, with thorns on its back and a very big, long tongue for which Gene Simmons would die. Finally, after a group of people are killed, the Chupacabra does it, and they report it to the university for an autopsy. So, does it come from another planet? Is it a genetic creation of a laboratory in Puerto Rico? Uh, they do not tell us, really. Not really intriguing but not great either. Certainly not a large audience for this one. 4 out of 10
