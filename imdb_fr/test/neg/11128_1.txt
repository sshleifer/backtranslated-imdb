When I got home after work, I bought movies for my four-year-old twins. I bought this movie that my kids would enjoy. I watched this with my children. My 10 and 17 years were about to throw up. In this film, the father acts as a delay. My little ones looked at him every day. One day, they threw away all our movies. I sold the movie Omosis Jones on Ebay. My rating: F ++++++++++++++++ I prefer to be seen on the list of the worst outfits. <br /> <br /> My kids hate this silly movie now. If gives the idea that germs can talk to each other. I wonder how the silent movie sounds in Japanese. I broke the CD in half when I became irritated to see it again and again. Without offense, Brandy and Elena were the best
