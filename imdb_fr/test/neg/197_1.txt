I was a 22 year old hippie in 1965, I saw the play 5 times, I have 2 versions of the music and read the script several times. Maybe taken separately, the film is OK, but as an adoption of the piece, it's terrible. <br /> <br /> First the good. The songs are well sung and the production values ​​are pretty good. The homosexual implications in Black Boys, White Boys is cute. The Claude / Berger switch was interesting. Hair is a fluid production and constant changes are inherent as long as the basic spirit is preserved. <br /> <br /> But the basic spirit was very distorted. It seemed that all that the producer wanted was to sing some songs and adapt them to the story, regardless of what it had done to the original intention of the play. <br /> <br /> Claude, Sheila and Hud were presented. as selfish children who make fun of anyone outside their tribe Claude destroyed Sheila's parents' day (it's hard to believe she smiled while her parents were hurt) and repeatedly stole cars. Sheila stole the clothes and the soldier's car. Then she left him in the middle of the desert where he would certainly have many sunburns, would probably be broken in the ranks and would probably die on this isolated Nevada road. Good fun. And Hud found it good to break his son's heart by shouting after his ex. That's not what the hippies looked like, that's not what the play describes and it's the complete opposite of the generation of lovers. <br /> <br /> I have never seen a hippie begging for money. The goal was to be self-sufficient outside the capitalist system and not to beg. <br /> <br /> After Berger is thrown into prison for ruining Sheila's party and Claude offers to bail out, Berger insists on bail, with no better plan to bail out the rest. against Sheila's parents, then against her own mother. <br /> <br /> "Being in" has always been a very spiritual point, but here it is wasted on stupid wives floating around. Even if it's part of his trip, it spoils a beautiful song. I know they oppose "Floating In Space" to the Army. But again, it totally ruins a beautiful song. <br /> <br /> While Sheila and Claude are skinny, Berger steals their clothes laughing "it was funny" dude, even after seeing that both were very bored. Then a little later, Berger does something that no hippie ever does. He hits Claude. Terrible. <br /> <br /> Then, they have the perfect opportunity to sing "Starshine" at night in a beautiful spot in the city with twinkling stars, perhaps working in an inventive duet. Instead, the whole tribe sings it under the burning sun that rolls on the road in a convertible (stolen of course). <br /> <br /> The 1979 film really disappointed me and I love it even less. I think it would have been possible to make an adoption close enough to the show, but that's not it.
