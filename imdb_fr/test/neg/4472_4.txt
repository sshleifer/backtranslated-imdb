4 out of 10. <br /> <br /> This movie was neither entertaining as a whole, nor even deserving of emotion in the characters. Eugene Levy is probably the funniest .... The rest of the cast does its job, but the story never gets very deep and there are a lot of holes in the plot that are never filled. It was not very fun, even though it was sometimes funny. <br /> <br />
