Although this movie (and I use the term vaguely) was shot in 1997, we just watched it tonight for the first time. My husband commented that a film by Tommy Lee Jones that we had never heard of made him a bit worried. I watched briskly, convinced that if Jones was in the film, it must have been worth at least two hours of my time. After all, he's been one of our key players for years. Although Heche is not one of my favorite actresses, I was reassured by seeing another well-known face. The list of actors / actresses performed continues to grow, so I endured more and more this film, convinced that if I insisted in enough clich√©s and banal social statements, I would arrive victorious on the other side conspiracy. Alas, there was no conspiracy. He seemed to have been burned by the still dripping Doom lava. <br /> <br /> The characters were thin as paper. The plot was so full of holes that it literally distracted me from most of the special effects and actors in the movie. Was the cost of a brief consultation with an elementary science teacher too high for the budget of this film? No acid rain ... no toxic gases (such as sulfur or hydrochloride) ... no deadly ash ... no burning heat a few feet from the lava. Wow ... it's the most friendly lava in the world! <br /> <br /> The events were not better than the characters. Every incident was so artificial and far-fetched ... it's as if the writers had said, "Okay, we need to get rid of the little girl NOW" ... and she's splashed by a bomb of lava that burns her enough to kill her. to be transported safely (not lava, but of her own helpless amazement) ... but a few moments later, in the car, she feels no apparent pain and soon after, she effortlessly crosses the building (moan!) no!) is about to jump. After enduring all this, your reward is the little boy's replica at the end (just about everyone who looks alike) ... which must be one of the worst movie lines I've ever heard. Even though it was not such a painful scenario, it was ridiculous timing for all the characters involved. Kid and cop aside, as if the mother was always around and just had to tell her her name because she did not speak ... what ... she hopes to slip into the shadows and get away the little brat once and for all? I do not think so. It is obvious that the mother of the child would have disappeared or died - or would shout her head to find her infant. <br /> <br /> The black thug gangsta is a big hard with a secret spot against the flea on his shoulder a secret scene of soft spot made me bleed eyes. Even if such characters existed, they would not behave as the movie describes them, given the circumstances. Something about imminent death by fire and mass destruction tends to catch people off guard, you know? <br /> <br /> There are too many canned movie moments like these to mention ... really, it's just an embarrassing movie to watch. These poor writers ... where are they now?
