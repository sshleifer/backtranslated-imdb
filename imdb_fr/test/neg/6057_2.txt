It's easily the worst adaptation of Greek mythology I've ever seen. It totally fails as an adaptation of the original myth, inventing stupid twists and reducing the 12 tasks to ... 3 or 4, I think. It is quite useless to try to integrate other myths in a clumsy way, which calls into question the fact that the authors have never read it, such as turning birds into harpies, lions into sphinxes, Oracle from Delphi to Tiresias and bulls pedanting. Proteus version, even incorporating aspects, never seen outside the entertaining series of Sam Raimi, concerning his first marriage, to a woman with the co-opted name of one of the Furies, so this seems appropriate at the time. <br /> <br /> I could accept a lot of that, but that also fails completely in terms of pure film; the most painful is the dialogue, leaded and heavy pseudo-Shakespearian guts. This is a bad reinterpretation of myths, making a sad attempt at the kind of post-modern revisionism that Crichton's "13th Warrior" has attempted with respect to the Beowulf legend, while including strictly mythological elements such as the clear interference from the gods and the super magic force. Sad, a sad failure of an entertainment experience that many of the quality actors involved regret deeply.
