This German horror film must be one of the strangest I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> I was not aware of any connection between child abuse and vampirism, but this is supposed to be based on a real character. <br /> <br /> Our hero is deaf and dumb as a result of repeated beatings against his father. he also has a doll fetish, but I can not understand where it comes from. His colleagues discover him and tease him terribly. <br /> <br /> During the day, he is a sweet bookkeeper and, at night, he enters the cemeteries and funeral homes and drinks the blood of dead girls. They are all attractive, of course, otherwise we do not care about the fact that they usually tear their clothes up to the waist. He ends up killing, and that's what makes him take it. <br /> <br /> As I said, a very strange film, dark and very slow, because Werner Pochath never speaks and only spends time drinking blood.
