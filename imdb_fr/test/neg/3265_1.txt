This film is so horrible that it was literally a chore to watch. I wanted to eject it from my VCR and throw it across the room, but I thought (stupidly) that it would end up becoming funny and that everything would be fine. "You lose, we win, yay!" This film should be watched by anyone who, even once, thought Jackie Mason was funny. After that, beat them against the head with this film until the tape breaks. And if you even plan to rent this shit (or worse!), I have one thing to ask you: have not you even looked at the blanket? I mean, with shit like this, you can see at a glance how bad it is! "Oy vey!" This film was nil.
