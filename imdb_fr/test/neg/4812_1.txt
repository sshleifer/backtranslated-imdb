Why? Why? Why does not anyone tell the truth about this horrible film HORRIBLE? I get up again in the morning and ask God why he did not stop me from seeing this revolting "comedy". I can not believe I paid to see this offense for my cinematic taste. I'm starting to think that her 5 stars are due to the nudity of Martha Higareda and all the men who can not buy a porn movie and avoid seeing that ... I'll call it "thing" because the movie call is an insult to the Mexican film industry. The characters are a huge clich√©, the acting provokes an involuntary laugh and the scenario is ... well, I can not believe that a human being wrote that. And just when you thought you had been tortured enough ... the last half hour was so painful that I wanted to tear my eyes. The only good thing I can say about this abomination is that it only lasts 90 minutes (that would be centuries, but still). Really, avoid the pain !!!
