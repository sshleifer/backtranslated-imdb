Extremely formal with logical holes of cosmic size and a semblance of comedy. Aw, poor New York lawyer! He is just combing through and when he gets a pay cut, he is not looking for another job, although he is one of the most respected lawyers in the region. We see him arguing in court for others to congratulate him on his winning and fiery performance, but he can not stand up to anyone in his office. At home, problems are ignored until people leave home. <br /> <br /> The only character on which you want to base yourself is the last maid, who seems to be a real human being who uses logic and communication to survive the world. As it is laughable that the maid brings to the lawyer and his wife a chicken and wine on New Year's Eve, because she feels sorry for them! (The song is not played to laugh.) <br /> <br /> Sorry, it's too amazing and with a ** SPOILER ** touch, everyone ends at 180 degrees. How did they get top stars for that? If I had been to the studio, I would have returned this one for a complete rewrite.
