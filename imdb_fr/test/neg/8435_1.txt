This film begins as if it were a comedy. It almost seems like actors are reading memory cards, especially in the airport sequence. William Smith plays the role of "Caribe", a hunter quite twisted and disturbed. Smith always seems to play villains as in "The Ultimate Warrior" (1975) and "The Frisco Kid" (1979), to name a few, although in this film the nasty role seems laughable. It's one of those movies where foolish things only take place to fill the time spent on the screen, like the girl's chase at the beginning and the long stupid motorcycle race. I give this movie 1/10. I would have liked to see this movie on "Mystery Science Theater", it would have been hilarious.
