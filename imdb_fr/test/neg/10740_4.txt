Back home; What a desappointment !! After reading the summary of the plot (the dead returning to vote - AGAINST George W. Bush !!!!!), I was eager to see that. It started interestingly and immediately caught my eye. Unfortunately, this slowly plunged into a boring political satire that I did not need to see (I can just watch a good old Australian comedy for that!). There was only one or two scenes of horror and they were not even so scary. I could not believe it came from Joe Dante, who could have easily managed it with an equal balance of thrills and satire. <br /> <br /> The worst episode so far. <br /> <br /> 2/5.
