SHRIEKER is a full moon production. I knew what to expect (very little quality), but I did not expect it to be as painful as SHRIEKER looks at it. <br /> <br /> It's horrible. Bad acting, scenario and direction confused. Boring characters that I wanted to kill. It was probably done in a week. I have seen CHARMED episodes more complex and convincing than this cheap movie. <br /> <br /> It looks like an orphaned episode of a poorly designed television series that no one has ever seen. It was a chore to watch and I could feel my mind getting darker and darker. Watching a movie should not be hard work.
