** Spoilers possible ** From Dreamworks and director Peter Chan, "The Love Letter" is a romantic comedy set in a quaint coastal village in New England, where single mother Helen (Kate Capshaw) owns a small bookstore picturesque. One day at work, Helen comes across an anonymous letter (the "love letter" of the title) that has somehow lodged under the cushions of a couch. When she reads the amorous prose, she thinks it was written to her, purposely placed on the couch for her to find it, and, for her own reasons, she knows the identity of her secret admirer . Inadvertently, however, Helen leaves the letter where her employee, Janet (Ellen DeGeneres) finds her, believes her for herself and, of course, thinks she knows who wrote it. Circumstances put him in the possession of a young man named Johnny (Tom Everett Scott), who thinks that Helen has written him the letter. And before everything is settled, you can only imagine the hilarious situations in which everyone involved has been plunged; and I mean, imagine, because the way the film unfolds is that the audience gets little more than it brings. There are two specific areas in which this romantic comedy fails miserably: it's just not very romantic and it's not funny. and it's a powerful combination that makes the film shriveled almost from the opening credits. Once the scenery and the main character (Helen) have been established, it's pretty much impossible for the next ninety minutes. At the moment you finally find out who actually wrote the letter and who, you do not care. Tom Selleck, Blythe Danner, Julianne Nicholson, Gloria Stuart and Geraldine McEwan complete the cast. It's a shame to see such wasted talent in such a trap and look bad in the balance. Kate Capshaw, who usually lights up the screen just showing up, looks tired here, while Selleck seems to be back from a three-day bender that has lasted a week. Ellen DeGeneres is really looking for the best of the band. It is said that the trip is often a more intoxicating experience than the destination. In the case of "The Love Letter", however, it would have been better for everyone that everyone stays home. I note this one 1/10.
