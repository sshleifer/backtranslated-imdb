One of the worst shows of all time. The series would begin with intelligent comments to each other, which would be totally disproportionate and unjustified. The big computer geek was incredible, the bible thumper, the wicked girl, who are these actors ??? Never heard of any of them except Cole who was totally incredible in the game. Every time he opens his mouth, you expect to hear: "You see children ..." Pulling the plug was a merciless killing for this horrible sight. The stories were as incredible as the actors. Blade would be the best way to describe it. In one way or another, this series makes a slug like Ice-T more credible as a cop, and he wrote the worst song ever recorded on the cops.
