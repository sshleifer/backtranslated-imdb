By train, a woman (Stéphane Excoffier) ​​mistakenly goes to a distant station when the train stops in the middle of the night. Faster, she discovers that a singular (Jim van der Woude), lonely and strange, who does not speak his language is the only person in this area and that it was the last train of this way. The man houses her at home and they develop an unusual relationship without words between them. <br /> <br /> "De Wisselwachter" is an overestimated boredom, with a different but uninteresting story that leads nowhere. I like Off-Hollywood movies, but this story is too absurd and has no message at the end. The sexual tension between the two main characters is both fun and repetitive. I saw this film in an old VHS and the picture is too dark; I do not know if, on DVD, the image would be of better quality. In the end, I was absolutely disappointed with this feature. My vote is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "O Homem da Linha" ("The man of the line")
