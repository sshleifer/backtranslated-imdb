This film was so vague, disjointed and uneven that it was an effort to look at everything. (I actually thought that some elements of the plot might develop.) It was nothing more than a film of "transition to adulthood" for the thirties. It's total shit and I have no idea what Julianne Moore was doing in this area since that was the only reason I chose it at the rental store.
