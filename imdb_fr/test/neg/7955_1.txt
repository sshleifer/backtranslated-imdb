Pathetic NRI Crap ..... Call to all those who are not Indian .... This is the worst of Indian cinema, created by the worst waste of NRI ..... The story is boring and clich√© ( the way NRIs and Westerners see India) ..... Go ahead if you want to get bored to death. <br /> <br /> The film deals with the fate of widows in India before independence. Much of it is true even now in isolated rural areas, but not to the extent indicated (perhaps because it is a vintage film) ..... <br /> <br /> There are many other Indian films made by extremely talented directors who deserve to be savored. ..This is a definite miss ... Watch a documentary instead or search for information on the net if you are truly interested in the plight of the oppressed in India. <br /> <br /> I lost my time.
