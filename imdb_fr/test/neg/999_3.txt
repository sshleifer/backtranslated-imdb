The basic genre is a thriller interspersed with an uncomfortable household. Fellowes has tried to make the most of this situation by using the title's lies to create all kinds of little twists, always designed to surprise the characters more than the audience. <br /> <br /> It's really rather messy though. Fellowes does not seem interested in presenting the elements of the thriller so as to keep us at the forefront. He focuses instead on the moral problems themselves. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is incoherent, here, here, vernacular and with the constant surprise of the realism defeated by the occasional mining clich√©. Although there are no worries on the scene so that the actors can continue to live in their space, the formidable score can not create another dimension and often goes against the emotional impulse of certain scenes. There is also a very prosaic attitude, dare I say that the British feeling is the same. I did not want to see a document of two middle-class people who managed to be taken in an extraordinary situation, I wanted to see some sort of artistic narrative of the story. <br /> <br /> Finally, it is in fact the story that leaves the rest. Just as the elements of the suspense are rather flat, the story is an asymmetrical sum of subplots of different shapes and sizes, woven as a means of analyzing the character. Wilkinson and Watson support this meta-test with good performances and John Warnaby's fierce colleague, Simon at Wilkinson, is a welcome flash for most of the train path problems. <br /> I am disappointed; not that it's bad, but that it could have been much better. 3/10
