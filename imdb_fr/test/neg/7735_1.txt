An awesome vision, hot chicks with swords, oh, and those hypnotic Chinese violins too ... Let me think, "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"? <br /> <br /> I liked CTHD a bit, with its simple simplicity and well-developed characters, which still gave you enough time to enjoy the vision without having to think about the meaning of DEEEPAA. <br /> <br /> "Hero", on the other hand, is painfully pretentious and visually and conceptually demanding. The morality bigger than life was horrible. I mean, sacrifice your life, sacrifice your beliefs, sacrifice your love for your powerful nation to succeed? WTF ?? <br /> <br /> No thanks. <br /> <br /> But hay, Mao and G.W.B. would be proud! <br /> <br /> Viva
