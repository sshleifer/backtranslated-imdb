For a while, I became addicted to shows like Ghost Hunters and Destination Truth, and although I thought they were full of shit, I found them interesting and fun, and that's why we're watching TV from entertainment. It's fun to turn off your brain and believe that every shadow filmed by a camera is not just a shadow, but the tormented spirit of an insane asylum inmate, or something, as long as you can come back to the real world later. <br /> <br /> That being said, to take advantage of Paranormal State, it is not enough to close your head, but to consume lead regularly in large quantities during your childhood, then to undergo repetitive head trauma, then resume bright colors. Then you have to get drunk and watch. <br /> <br /> The paranormal state is beyond the pseudoscience (which I can appreciate with a degree of critical thinking) that you will find on Ghost Hunters (which I still find quite interesting and entertaining program), c is pseudo ... everything. <br /> <br /> The show follows the adventures of a group of students from Penn State University (not to be confused with the University of Pennsylvania), led by Ryan Buell while they take care of exorcise demons and spirits using ceremonies of the most dramatic religion at the time (Catholic exorcisms performed by university students with Wiccan spells launched by socially awkward goths, Indian purification rituals). credit, these are made by Native Americans). If you believe in Wicca or if you are Catholic or a follower of a traditional Native American religion, I think you would like his purification rituals to be performed by someone who ... is not an unsuitable student with time free. I do not remember the scene in the exorcist where the priests raised their hands in the air and said "it's useless!" Call an out-of-state high school club. for us, they probably read Wikipedia, article on exorcisms. "The show is frankly insulting to the viewer's intelligence. In the opening sequence of the show, Ryan talks about PRS (the Paranormal Research Society), claiming that when he arrived at Penn State (note that you do not see any shows where the host says the same thing, but instead of Penn State, he says, "When I arrived at MIT" or "After graduating from Theoretical Physics ..."), he found other people sharing the same interest in the paranormal. He says they are sometimes "warriors". I remember when I pretended to be a warrior and I was fighting ghosts. I was six years old. Then, Ryan without emotion brings out the flamboyant and odious Chip Coffey, who pretends to go into a trance and becomes possessed by swearing in front of the cast. Impressive. I thought people had learned how ridiculous the idea of ​​mediums and psychics was after the release of "Crossing Over". The series takes itself too seriously, as this small group of marginalized society pretends to fight against an ancient and cosmic evil. The production values ​​are low, the stories boring and, unlike Ghost Hunters, who sometimes catches something abnormal (though probably explainable, but nevertheless interesting) on ​​his equipment, PS forces you to believe that the noises and crunches that they hear are the proof of demons, ghouls, and perhaps elves. The only thing that's scary about this show is that there are people who take it seriously. The only paranormal thing about this is that the people who reside there can do every episode keeping their faces impassive. <br /> <br /> Call me jaded, but I have the impression that the great mysteries of the universe and the afterlife are too good to be solved in a half-hour TV show. hour by a journalism student from a public school. <br /> <br /> That said, I urge everyone to watch this show at least once, if for no other reason than the simple entertainment derived from watching a movie or TV show really terrible. Or you can make it a drinking game. I think the second would be better.
