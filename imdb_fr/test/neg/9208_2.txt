This is the kind of film that could ruin many careers, if garbage could spoil the careers of cinema these days. <br /> <br /> Melanie Griffith took off her shirt and, during her surgery, before her development, she really should have stayed dressed. <br /> <br /> Jeff Daniels was completely lost, but fortunately for him and for us, he's done a lot better since that day ... this ... this ... well, heck, hunk of trash. <br /> <br /> Strangely, all of his main actors have evolved, including director Jonathan Demme. His work here has also been wasted but deserves reluctant admiration. I mean, anything that is not worth doing is not worth doing well. But he did it well, anyway. <br /> <br /> However, there was a brilliant appearance: Ray Liotta, named at the bottom of the list of credits, stole everything. Liotta was beautifully mesmerizing! Hypnotic! Enthralling. <br /> <br /> I saw this trash when it was still relatively new, in the private theater of a friend. For a strange reason, my friend ADORED him. I think that's because Melanie Griffith removed her t-shirt (and, honestly, she should not have), although he tried to pretend it was for other reasons , more artistic. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I thought that even after her first scene, Ray Liotta would become a major star, or at least a major and highly respected actor. <br /> <br /> Despite the cowardly aspects of the heartbreaking script, the sheer ugliness of the whole story, Liotta has almost deserved to be watched. In fact, it's interesting to see once, just to see how far Ray Liotta went. I mean, among other things, that his name is now generally written up or near the top. <br /> <br /> Even in this case, even in a pile of rubbish, Ray Liotta shone like a diamond. <br /> <br /> If you see this trash, get ready to hold your nose. Every major character is amoral or immoral. Terrible film. Dreadful movie idea. <br /> <br /> Added comment: Too many people respond "Was this review helpful to you?" with a "no" because they disagree with the opinion expressed. Maybe IMDb should ask this question instead: "Do you agree with these opinions?"
