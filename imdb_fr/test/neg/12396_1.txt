It was a pathetic film. The Alien was decent, but the film itself gave a new meaning to pity. The plot is something that has been done over and over again! However, this one does the worst! The acting was c ** p, the scenes were often too dark to understand what was going on. Nobody has worried about the main character. The film was way too slow and the murder scenes that were there were stupidly designed and did not seem any more interesting than the rest of the movie. There are films that "suck" but that can still be appreciated because of their scandalous total, but that does not even have that !! Those who shot this film thought they could do something good and they failed miserably. This film has nothing to offer except a headache. Avoid it!
