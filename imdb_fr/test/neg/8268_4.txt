You just need to see this as poorly executed anti-abortion propaganda and you will realize how bad it really is. The main message of this film is that even the sickest people can not abort. If you ask it is not too far to explode abortion clinics. So, this guy wants to kill a poor girl but he has to convince her to do an abortion first. What a load of shit. And the worst part is that he has a compelling argument (to bring a child into a loveless environment), but it's supposed to be rejected because he's a monster anyway. And the part with the Bible writers ... they throw this girl just because she explains that someone stole her money (this rule must be in the Bible somewhere), then they form a kind of angel like Deus ex machina the evil killer by harassing him in his garden. Come on. Among other disadvantages, there is a very confusing scenario (and I do not mean in a good way) ... so this guy is only a psychopath, why? Because his mother gave him liver once? And I do not know about the rest of you, but he seemed to be the nicest person in the world throughout the move! even though he wore girl's clothes, stole money and registered girls in his car. If you forget this silly story, this movie has a very good cinematography and Bob Hoskins was really great, and it contains one of those funny little English cars. If it was actually a psychopathic killer, I would give him at least a 7.
