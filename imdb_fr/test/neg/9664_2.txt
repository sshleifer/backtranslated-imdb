I do not think that the subject of the plot of this film is really important, the main thing you will notice is the extreme amateurism of all the production. The acting game is what you would get if you chose random people on the street. The sound is really annoying: a medicine cabinet closes with all the enthusiasm of a bullet in the head, while the dialogue is perhaps a fifth. Various gaming noises dominate the soundtrack enormously, with dialogue taking place in the background. The theme of the music looks like a quarter of the end of the film's release, with much of the film having no music. The camera work can be described as a gnawing mess, with close-ups where a medium angle would be much better, cameramen walking and jostling the camera in all directions, absolutely no attention is paid to the framing of a scene , they just shot everything regardless of the position, it was more convenient for the cameraman to stand up. If the cameraman was one foot longer than the actors and you end up looking at everyone's head, well, so be it. The editing is only a job of butchering; Everything is mixed in the most abrupt way possible, nothing flows or transits in any sense of the word. I do not know if it was shot on video or maybe a rented camcorder, I tend to think it's the last one. <br /> <br /> I only traveled three-quarters of the way before turning it off. I am so bored by the poor quality of the production that I could not stand it anymore. It's like a ninth-grade audiovisual class project.
