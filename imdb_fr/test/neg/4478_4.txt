I had high hopes when I entered the theater - after seeing the trailer, I was as excited as the next person to see a great talent involved in making a story with a beautiful premise. <br /> <br /> It's disappointing to see this talent devastated by the mediocre composition of the songs - the words are stocky and tacky, probably because it was composed with a more Western theme. I would not have a hard time imagining the same melodies with French or English lyrics. In Mandarin, the sound is strange. <br /> <br /> The musical pieces were also poorly assembled - far too quickly to be pleasant, and the clich√©s of actors seeming anxious have lasted far too long. <br /> <br /> The special effects are the next disappointment. Suffice it to say that it's very obvious where the special effects start and stop. <br /> <br /> It's not Moulin Rouge, and it's not In Mood either, despite the occasional (and very similar) theme of the slow waltz. In total, and an hour too long to tell a simple story.
