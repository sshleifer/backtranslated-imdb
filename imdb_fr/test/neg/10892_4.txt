In horror movies, "Rest Stop" could have been better on many levels. The director / screenwriter John Shiban shows that he probably had the best intentions when he started. Unfortunately, he did not really know what to do with the material, or perhaps he was under pressure to present a film different from what he intended to do, either by the studio or by the authors. The DVD contains several endings, but unfortunately, the one chosen for the finished product is probably not the best. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​a psychopath wandering through the lanes of a remote part of California presents many possibilities in the beginning. After Jess's disappearance into the scary rest stop, things get out of hand. Poor Nicole is left alone to fend for herself against the oddities she finds on the way. <br /> <br /> It was obvious, when we started hearing "Amazing Grace" in the background, that forces were trying to take revenge. in which Nicole and Jess profane their corner of the country by indulging in careless sex that is not popular with natives. <br /> <br /> Watch them at your own risk. There is a lot of gore for aficionados of the genre.
