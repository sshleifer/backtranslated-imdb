What a bloody nuisance! You can not tackle such topics with television budgets and a smartass director who can not tell the difference between a Lanc I, a II and a III. All idiot cliches are in place; the story is so schmaltzy and incredible that it hurts. And all the officials are bursting with joy for the brilliant notes. Technical details: garbage. Lancs flying so close would have rushed to the dozen. Single-engine night fighters attacking the back line: ridiculous. As I said: composed by a director who, I bet, has never even heard Lancaster's name before this project and by some 3D guys who turned Lancs into manic ducks. But these are minor things compared to the overall mediocrity of this film. Although it may be too hard, I dare to say that it hurts the memory of those who died on both sides. Shit of TV, entertain the dumb masses who do not care anyway. Shame on the leaders. Use your brain next time. And enjoy the profit you made from it.
