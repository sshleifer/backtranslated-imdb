After seeing PURELY BELTER, I came to this site to read it again, but it took not only that I consult the curriculum vitae of writer / director Mark Herman. As soon as his name appeared in the opening credits, I realized that I had already seen his name somewhere. After checking, I discovered that he had written and directed the film version of LITTLE VOICE, one of the UK's most underrated and feel good movies. <Br /> <br /> PURELY BELTER is a totally different fish pot. It's a dark stereotyped vision of Geordie's life and very funny about that. Each is either a drummer, a single mother, a shoplifter, a drunkard or a drug addict. Since many scenes take place in a school, the physical education teacher is a sadistic tyrant and that is what comes closest to the film. Oh, and everyone has a very foul mouth, which adds to the sinister and incomparable atmosphere <br /> <br /> I did not really like PURELY BELTER while I was watching and now that I know who is Mark Herman, I love him even less. With LITTLE VOICE, Herman proved that you could make a fun and entertaining comedy featuring souls from the north, but I had to ask where was his undeniable talent in this movie?
