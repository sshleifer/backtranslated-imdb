If there is one word that I can associate with this film, it's his "embarrassment". It must be embarrassing for everyone associated with the movie to actually look at it in a theater. Everything - the script, the script, the dialogues, the lyrics of the songs, the staging - poor quality, lousy. <br /> <br /> I saw this film when I was a child. I liked it then, mainly because it was a fantasy, a superhero movie. It is a genre little explored in Hindi cinema. This attempt deserves to be welcomed, but that's it. Sashi Kapoor seems to have been in a hurry to make the film. I do not understand why foreigners are considered Hindi speaking characters, who can not even sync properly (nothing to say about dubbing). The scenario is terrible. The editing even more. If we follow the dialogs closely, we can detect grammatically false sentences (which completely alter the intended meaning). Nothing special about music. <br /> <br /> The biggest embarrassment must be for the censorship council. There are some insignificant scenes in the film, one of which is absolutely clear (so much so that I can not even think of a metaphor). The director missed them. The editing team missed it. And the censor missed it too. So much for the slogan without indecent exposure. The officials probably fell asleep watching the movie. <br /> <br /> I do not see why Amitabh played the role. Maybe it's because he was a good friend of Kapoors. But the role has almost nothing for him. With wonderful roles in Hum and Agneepath behind him, he could not have done better. There are some heroic scenes, really worthy. But otherwise, they are incredibly incredible (capture an arrow, for example ... it probably could have been better with CGI, but it was in 1991 ...). <br /> <br /> Dimple and Sonam are not exactly defined. the screen on fire. Shammi Kapoor and Rishi Kapoor give an inspired performance, but their reach is limited. Amrish Puri is his usual character in the role of a fairy tale villain (occasionally leaving the naughty laugh). <br /> <br /> Overall, an interesting concept. It could have been much better.
