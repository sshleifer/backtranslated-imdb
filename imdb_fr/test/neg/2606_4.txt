When Family Guy was created for the first time, I was not discriminatory. While the 1990s contain a wealth of intelligent and surreal cartoons, why should I be? Nickelodeon produced Doug; Ren and Stimpy and Rockos Modern Life, among other beautiful cartoons (yes, this includes Spongebob). All had a quirky dream animation, surprisingly sophisticated stories and dialogues. The Simpsons have become an absolute phenomenon, perhaps not as brilliant as its biggest advocates claim, but a very good investment of your time and certainly eliminates the false axiom that any television is undesirable. South Park began as a brutal but hilarious attack on everything with a unique and clever satire underneath. It evolved into a Monty Python show - with outrageous concepts and brutally fast and sharp societal critiques (such as their defense of noble gnome underwear) and eventually ended up being entirely self-referential and "meta", like the Simpsons did. unfortunately, jumped the shark. Family Guy superficially resembles The Simpsons and South Park. He presses buttons and is a favorite among students and bestiality lovers. However, what he has in loquacity, he lacks in true spirit. <br /> <br /> The show is famous for its use of gadgets, especially for flashbacks. Many refer to bad TV sitcoms or advertisements. Some are funny (especially the first two seasons), most are not. Are the references intrinsically funny? I'm not sure, but these are mainly what the series is based on, considering that his characters are painfully uninteresting. Where Homer and Bart have charm, and Cartman has self-consciousness and outrageous artillery to support his horrible behavior, Peter Griffin has no excuse. He is just a noisy and obnoxious pig. Something funny coming from his character is only because the writers forget how not to be funny that day. Lois is also very shallow and dull; Meg is an accessory, only to be abused; Chris is borderline retarded and only occasionally funny, and the two main stars of the series (Stewie and Brian) are so inconsistent in their descriptions that all of this is really useless. <br /> <br /> Other gadgets that I can not stand up are when a character points to something obvious and lingers on it for an uncomfortably long time. It's been happening a lot lately and I can not stand it anymore. Not just the often mentioned chicken who likes to beat Peter, I talk about the painful moments when they talk about pop culture and push it as if they were extraterrestrial spectators. It's not humor or even an ironic humor, it's totally boring and lifeless. <br /> <br /> It's not that the series can not be funny, in fact, some of the previous episodes had made me turn. Highlights include the pilot episode, where Peter loses contact with reality after losing his precious television. when the zealous religious father of Peters arrives and wreaks havoc; When Peter becomes a narc at school Megs, and episode "pancake". I suppose it's the episodes that accidentally incorporated human traits into his characters, or simply times when the writers had a real comic inspiration. <br /> <br /> One last thing, the series is not shocking. This is only unpleasant for those who do not watch the show in the first place, so it's almost like a fool in a circle at the hipster choir.
