I'm happy not to wait too long when I saw this sequel to one of my favorite movies from my childhood. The plot was dull and unconvincing, as were the characters, and I was disappointed that some of the characters in the original were not in this sequel. I did not think that the characters themselves were similar to the previous movie. Charlie had changed and now he has a girlfriend. The first movie had good music, but the music in this movie was unstoppable. In short, this movie did not do it for me. And, looking at the comments of other users, it seems that it has not been for many of you. It's not worth watching.
