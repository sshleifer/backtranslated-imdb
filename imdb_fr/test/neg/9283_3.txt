Anthony Wong plays both in this article and in the original Untold Story (far superior), but the similarities stop there. Wong obviously does not resume his role, but rather plays on a delirious policeman who mingles with a rather suspicious woman, Fung (Miss Singapore, 1994, Paulyn Sun), which is a repressed job, of course. But his jealous look "I want to be with a guy who's with a girl" is not as convincing as what Wong played in the first. The film itself seems tired and by the numbers. Yeung Fan as an unfaithful girl in the love affair of physcho tries to avoid total boredom by undressing as much as possible, and Sun has a nice ass, but even that can not save this failure. <br /> <br /> My note: D <br /> <br /> Extras DVD Mei Ah: Interviews subtitled with Cheung Kam Ching & Paulyn Sun; Anthony Wong filmography; a very brief summary; Theatrical trailer for the film; & trailers for "Chinese Erotic Ghost Story" and "Twenty Something"
