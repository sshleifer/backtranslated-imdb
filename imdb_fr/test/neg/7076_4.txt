I work in a video store, so I saw this one for free. Thank goodness, if I had paid for it, my comment would be less lenient. <br /> <br /> well, the main idea of ​​the film (geek vengeance bloody) is not entirely original, there are several parallels to "carrie" (a practical joke about a loser, at the exception of a nice girl who is really sorry for her, tamaras and who has a bad family history). I still think it's a fun idea for the teenage trash horror movie, unfortunately they have not really taken advantage of the potentials here and are instead focusing on all the bad things. <br /> <br /> What worked: I liked the actress who played tamara. she looked great (when she was hot) and her catty lines were funny ("Sean can not come on the phone, he's f ** king patrick!"). <br /> <br /> What did not work: everything about wicca was silly. I usually prefer rational explanations (she could have plotted with her teacher or one of the boys to take revenge). there was a lot of logic and the gore was really bad (when the boy cuts his ear and tongue - please !!!) but I just think they wasted the comic and the potential of suspense they had. it was bearable but far from good!
