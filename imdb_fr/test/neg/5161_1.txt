It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Thank God I saw it for free. I would have hated wasting my money on it. <br /> <br /> First of all, there is no character in the movie that is really nice. Michael Caine is getting closer, but even he is pretty flawed. The rest of the "commandos" is composed of disgusting ex-cons. There are two gay Arabs, and three guys trying to rape a Red Cross nurse, and the "boss" who has no problem sending his men to be killed so he can escape. . <br /> <br /> mission "is something suspenseful.They have to blow up a fuel dump.This sounds exciting, no? Well, the movie follows them through endless sandstorms and repairing Yes, you've read it right, the suspense is that they're going to run out of spare tires, and we're actually seeing them change something like 12 apartments on the way. This film is incredibly exciting. <br /> <br /> They go to the dump to find out that it is a lure, so nothing to explode, and at that moment, for reasons very complicated, the British army decided to no longer need these guys, and radioed the location where they were to the Germans to kill them. <br /> <br /> will have an exciting race to freedom No, instead, they decide to blow up a different fuel dump, to create a diversion. they enter the square, they trigger a trigger cable and the Germans come to get them - they call their names by loudspeaker. <br /> <br /> Really weird. If the Germans knew where they were and where they were going, why did they allow them to fully penetrate the landfill before firing the trap? Instead, they wait until they enter the fuel depot and set all their charges. Yeah. Right. This would happen. <br /> <br /> They blow up the garbage dump, the chief sells all his men - except for Michael Caine, who offered him $ 2,000 to bring him back alive. <br /> <OK, then, the men are all betrayed and killed, and Michael Caine and Nigel Davenport survive. British troops arrive with tanks and decide to go to be saved. Since they wear German uniforms (they wore them to blow up the dump), they tie a white flag around a stick and head for the road. <br /> <br /> A British guy walks behind them and their machine gun to death. Credits roll. <br /> <br /> Yes. The film's two "heroes" die as a result of random acts of violence. <br /> <br /> It's as if the film suddenly ran out of budget and decided: "It's a curly, kill them and we go home." I lost 2 hours of my life watching this tired, unimaginative and totally unrealistic film, which ended with the grace of a bomb.
