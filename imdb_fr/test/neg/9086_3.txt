Originally, spiders were conceived as a four-part series, and it shows. I do not like series; they are usually ridiculous, complicated and banal. This one is no exception. In the first part of the spiders, "The Golden Lake", a wealthy adventurer thwarts the plans of a gang of criminals - spiders - aiming to steal gold from the Incas. A stupid love triangle ensues, with some Cowboys and Indian actions. His sensationalism and exoticism did not entertain me. <br /> <br /> We can legitimately draw themes from this series in two parts to the work of Lang, much higher later. And the making of the film is better than in other soap operas I saw from that time, including "The Vampires" (1915). In spiders, the camera is not so static, and this film is fast, thankfully. Hue and lighting are also adequate. None of this is remarkable. It is, however, almost indecent to see how much this series resembles the feuilletons of Louis Feuillade; the gang of criminals dress and behave like those of the Vampires: only the names and, to a lesser extent, the situations have changed. <br /> <br /> For more information on The Spiders series, check out the web. pages for that.
