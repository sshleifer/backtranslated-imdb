What do you get when you put Lou Diamond Philips, Todd Bridges, Barry Corbin with a bad toupee and an alien on a train? You get a very bad movie called "Alien Express" or "Dead Rail" that would be more fun on the old series of "Comedy Central" "Mystery Science Theater 3000". You call it, this horrible film has suffered in the fields of acting, intrigue, screenplay and special effects. In fact, the exterior shots of the passenger train seemed to indicate that the production team was using a scaled-down model in front of a painted background! The rest of the special effects are deteriorating from there. <br /> <br /> The plot is very predictable and looks like two 1970s movies titled "Horror Express" and a disaster film titled "The Cassandra Crossing". At least "The Cassandra Crossing" had a better cast, an engaging storyline and real train scenes. <br /> <br /> If you want to laugh and have a movie to simulate at a B movie party, watch it. ; otherwise, "Alien Express" derailed well before leaving the station!
