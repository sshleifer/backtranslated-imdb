Wow, another Kevin Costner's hero movie. Postman, Tin Cup, Waterworld, Bodyguard, Wyatt Earp, Robin Hood, and even this baseball movie. It looks like he's making movies specifically to be the center of attention. The characters are almost always the same ... the heroic, the defects, the greatness, the fall, the redemption. Yes, in the first 5 minutes of the film, we are all supposed to admire his character and the film is built more and more from there. <br /> <br /> And this time, the story ... story? ... is just a collage of different movies. You do not need a spoiler; you have seen this movie several times, even if it had different titles. You will know what will happen well before that happens. It's like mixing an officer and a gentleman with a backdraft, but both are better movies. Watch Backdraft to see how this kind of movie should be done ... and to see how a good, slightly underestimated actor, Russell, plays the hero.
