Ohhhh MAN, this movie is awful! <br /> <br /> This type of tripe is what gives Canadian cinema a bad name, if any. Well, to be honest, I guess most Canadian films have a bad reputation in Canadian cinema. <br /> <br /> Next to the characters (there are some who are the most irritating in the film's history), the most annoying thing is the editing and rhythm of the film. It's like a drunken snail dying. <br /> <br /> Thank God, Melanie Doane is beautiful to watch. She's the only thing that made me look. Unfortunately, the rest of the film kept interrupting. <br /> <br /> Well for a laugh, if you have a bad night in Canadian cinema, though. <br /> <br /> Did I mention Melanie Doane? The only positive point (too bad that they did not feel like keeping the camera on her more than a wink at a time). <br /> <br /> Another addition to the Canadian Hall of Stinking Movies.
