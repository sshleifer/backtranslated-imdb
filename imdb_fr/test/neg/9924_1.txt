This contains spoiler information, but the movie is not worth watching ... <br /> <br /> Why Ellen Barkin and Peta Wilson have agreed to be part of this screenwriter-director debacle Damian Harris me exceeds. The story is full of unrealistic police investigation techniques, including going to a party with a suspect, inviting him to your home and making contact with them. The tale also features a psychiatrist who seems to have only clients - and he sleeps with everyone. <br /> <br /> The notion that women are victims of horrible S / crimes belong to an important but secret group of lesbian S / M executives. <br /> <br /> Filled with bad editing and continuity mistakes, the film is sterile in all its prestigious venues, including Barkin's Detective Salary Apartment. . And the lame dialogue is apt to fall asleep. <br /> <br /> Damian is a bad writer and a bad director. He tried and failed miserably to create a dark atmosphere at times. In addition, he could not get Ellen Barkin to give 110%. I firmly believe that she understood that the film was pathetic and that she stopped trying. <br /> <br /> Peta Wilson, who lost her time studying with a Dominatrix for the role, was singled out. Marshall Bell, the very underrated actor of the character, gave his absolute best, as always. <br /> <br /> And since Damian could not offer his services at all levels, it was hard to feel emotion for any of the characters. <br /> <br /> More importantly, he does not know much about the real world of BDSM and has chosen to create the "Hollywood Reality" typical of perverse and dangerous men and women. <br /> <br /> Save your time, money and brainpower and let it pass.
