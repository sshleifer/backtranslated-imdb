The movie was actually not so bad, especially with regards to the plot, but the pasty actor (and hairy!) That they chose for the lead role was a bit chintzy in the actor's department. I would have chosen someone else. The idea of ​​"going to America" ​​was very ingenious, and the main character questioning everything he had known made him quite likeable, but not much when there is a slush for a lead actor. <br /> <br /> The scenario was interesting. This raises the question of how the subject of cloning will be treated in the future. Admittedly, cloning would not be allowed for the purposes of the film, but that remains a valid argument, even for today. Clones are always people ... no? <br /> <br /> The film was not particularly special, but it is still much better than some of the cheeses released in the 70's. Let's not forget the invasion of giant spiders. I give it a 4 because it does not stink TOTALLY, but the MST3K version makes this movie a 10. (I still like Dr. Super Mario!). You will like this movie, but it will not be your favorite.
