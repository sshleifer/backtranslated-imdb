This film tries to break the era of Hollywood studios and the morality of the 1950s. Guy Stone is supposed to be of the Rock Hudson genre, but the script and actor Matt Letscher end up channeling instead a sarcastic, cruel and George Hamilton's baritone, which makes him an uncomfortable character. <br /> <br /> Guy Stone is such a reprehensible human being that the public has a hard time loving this waste of skin. Unlike Hudson, who is a gentle promiscuity, Stone is a hateful person who knowingly uses and then throws the handsome and pretty young men who share his bed every two hours or so. <br /> <br /> Veronica Cartwright is Jerry, the unmarried lesbian of Stone Director. Cartwright is very good, but the director does not really know what to do with it. The fault lies in the dialogue, which is a little awkward, and the film suffers. <br /> <br /> Sally Carrie Preston owes more to Ellen Greene in "The Little Shop of Horrors". As written, Preston's Sally is good for laughing, but nothing else. Newcomer Adam Greer is lost in this film. He can not play and seems to have been chosen for his warm body and beautiful appearance. <br /> <br /> Like many recent movies, "Straight-Jacket" is a "dramatic comedy" - a comedy film that goes badly through a drama about two-thirds of the way through the film. And, like almost every drama, "Straight-Jacket" fails miserably. <br /> <br /> Despite the expensive services of Skywalker Sound, the sound quality of the film leaves much to be desired. Excessive use of the soundtrack creates many distracting signals. <br /> <br /> The film really failed to satirize the 1950s. Unlike "Singin 'in the Rain," which perfectly reflects Hollywood's ambivalence about the advent of sound and the studio mentality about movie films, "Straight-Jacket" fails to portray Hollywood in the 1950s. The dialogues, sets and behavior of the main characters are innocuous rather than Hollywood's absolute stereotypes of years 1950. The same goes for the tarnishing of the mores, social trends and trendy fashions of the fifties as a whole. Compare the transformation of Guy's house to the endless satire of the 1950s house in "Little Shop of Horrors". There is no comparison possible. "Little Shop" hits hard, while "Straight-Jacket" does not even know there is one. <br /> <br /> Motivations also seem anarchic. Rick Foster is supposed to be a principled Liberal, but he almost immediately falls for a materialistic fool like Guy Stone. Rick is doing well with Guy's closed status for several months. But when it comes time to go to Italy, he finds himself in conflict for completely obscure reasons. And even though Sally seems to fall in love with Freddie during the party, this plot point simply disappears a few minutes later without comment. Rick looks like a homosexual man of the 90s and not a homosexual author of the 50s. Indeed, modern morality permeates this film - which should not be the case, if it was really a satirical look at homophobia at Hollywood in the 1950s. <br /> <br /> The holes in the plot of this bristling movie also abound. Saul says repeatedly that he will entrust Freddie Stevens to the federal authorities, but never does. Allow Freddie to beat Guy. Jerry and Saul's conspiracy to "in" Guy never makes sense, nor does Sally's sudden decision to take blame. And although Guy admitted he was gay, apparently it was not serious and he is a famous star and playwright anyway. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, none of the values ​​of the production managed to save this film. The cinematography of Michael Pinkey is pedestrian. Sometimes the film looks almost like a filmed play rather than a movie (especially the scenes in Saul's office). Everything is limited to medium shots, and the film has an incredibly static. The editing of Chris Conlee does not help the film either. Long scenes that would benefit from the insertion of close-ups or changes of viewpoints remain intact. Whether it is due to a lack of coverage or poor editing is unclear, but the overall effect is to create a feeling of lethargy. <br /> <br /> The film relies heavily on the CGI effects of Guy's house, created by visual effect. designer Thomas Dickens. But the CGI looks clumsy and hokey, and he is very amateurish. <br /> <br /> My general impression on this film is that jokes are easy and inexpensive, that the plot is confused, that the characterizations are extremely inconsistent and far removed from reality. brand, non-existent satire, overbroad and off the mark performances, and comic timing. It's almost an amateur film. It's like someone taking a production in high school and injecting $ 10 million on it.
