I'm so glad he's not alive to see that. This film is a debauchery of his work. I agree with the other speaker - this film was a terrible disappointment. I would give him a zero, but I have to give him a 1. <br /> <br /> The story was weak, and it reminded me of the time I was a young teenager trying to write a movie, then looking back and realizing how awful it was. Bad actors, family and friends, and someone stupid enough to finance it, that's how it was done. It's really amazing how to pull strings to do something. If this film has managed to make itself known to the general public, it raises great hopes in other independent directors who have a talent worthy of the name who are struggling! This film made me laugh, but for all the wrong reasons. By all accounts, it was not really a comedy. Scary movie is a better game about a kind of horror - this movie is really bad.
