*** SPOILERS *** This movie - called EATEN ALIVE here in the UK is probably the worst film ever made and is brilliant just for that. A rich and sexy girl teamed up with a beefy man of action to search for his sister in the jungle of New Guinea. The following is an unmistakably shitty mix of cannibalism, crazy cults and religious maniacs that must be seen to believe it. The scenes of cannibalism are quite horrible but are so badly staged and played that they are quite funny. The actors are awful, except for Janet Agren, who is excellent in the female lead role. Look for the scene where she is undressed and covered with golden paint! My rating - 1 of 10
