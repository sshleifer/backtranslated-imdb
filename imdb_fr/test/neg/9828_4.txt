The sumptuous production values ​​you usually find in a Merchant / Ivory movie are all present, but this is an extremely gloomy interpretation of what could have been a very vivid affair. I agree with a previous poster: it's foolish that the story unfolds through the eyes of an African-American family. Still, their own ancestor, Sally Hemmings, has hardly a role to play in the proceedings. There is not much clarity to help the public understand the motivations of these historical figures. And the accents of a number of characters bothered me enormously. Nancy Marchand seemed very British for what is supposed to be a French nun. And Gwyneth Paltrow and Greta Scacchi seemed to try different accents in different scenes. In fact, Gwyneth is very poorly served in this biopic. Her role as Thomas Jefferson's daughter, Martha, is written in such a way that we never know who she really is. One moment, she slaps a slave and another, she deplores the whole system of slavery. Nick Nolte plays the role pretty well but never really cares about Jefferson or his exploits. Very disappointing overall.
