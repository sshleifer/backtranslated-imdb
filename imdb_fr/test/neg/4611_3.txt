<br /> <br /> I thought this movie lacked the dramatic suspense that the first movie had. It's hard to realize when the film takes place over a week. The original film led to the final climatic scene for a year and was still less violent than the sequel. A good thing about this movie is that the movie went pretty fast, because the plot seemed hasty. When Rachel's best friend died, no burials were mentioned in the film. The involvement of Amy Irving was another factor. All his scenes have reduced the rhythm of the films. The dialogue in this film was terrible. It did not reflect the way kids talk. In conclusion, this film could have been a success but collapsed after the opening scene.
