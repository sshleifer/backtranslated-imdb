With several name actors (Lance Henrikson, David Warner, Joe Don Baker), why Jeffery Combs took the lead? Henrikson would have been an ideal candidate for the lead role, just like Warner, Baker or even other film actors such as Charles Napier. The combs were misunderstood and malfunctioned. Everything he did seemed fake or artificial. <br /> <br /> The script is poor. Which means that if Lance Henrikson (or another) had the main role, he might have saved the movie (removed from my "lost time" category), but it would still be a bad movie. The game on the screen was completely lacking. The director should have recognized that and helped the film.
