How much longer will we be left with this mistaken belief that once a director produces a fantastic and innovative work, any future work "can not be so terrible, after all, he did this or that". > <br /> Mulholland Drive is an example, and it is actually an unmitigated waste. The performances are excellent, especially Watts and Theroux, but a good movie that they do not necessarily realize. What Lynch has clearly forgotten is that making an unnecessarily strange movie only works when the audience is taken by surprise. When the public expects the film to be meaningless, the film must have some substance to keep the audience interested. Lynch succeeds in the first half of the film, with the mystery murder set up with lots of twists and red herrings, then ... plop! The story is transformed into a quagmire of weird halos and unnecessary consequences. Methinks Lynch realized how confused the film was and brought to the public scenes of lesbians and awakened mastobations to prevent male spectators from getting up and leaving. <br /> <br /> Watching the movie in preview, I was surrounded by lynchophiles who had no more idea what was happening than me, but who left the theater to comment on the "layers and the layers "of Lynch's film. Excuse me, but these people are the same na√Øve who, in art galleries, contemplate white canvases on the "courage of the artist to paint such a courageous work". <br /> <br /> Films like these are made because (a) Lynch exchanges his previous work; and (b) because people convince themselves that the unintelligible film is an art and must be good. I interviewed a number of Lynchophiles about what they REALLY liked in the movie and the only answer I received that was not a "diaper" type response was that they liked it when the "chicks were putting out their kit". <Br /> <br /> Nuff said.
