Critics collapse in Weinstein's sphere of influence to praise this ugly, misguided and repulsive adaptation of the lyric novel on which it is based. The punched leadership of Minghella of this odd episodic and terribly dull and acute odyssey is one of the many missteps of this "love story of civil war". They are joking? After Ms. Kidman and Mr. Law met in a small town in North Carolina and stole a kiss before going to war for Jude and his photo of the girl he left behind, this is a a two-hour test on the kidneys as to whether he will survive a myriad of near-death experiences to reunite with his soul mate. We do not care? The amateur scene of Philip S. Hoffman, who plays in a disgusting and unfathomable role, is nothing like the appearance of Renee Zelweger as a corn-fed dynamo that miraculously erupts on the stage of Kidman's solitary farm to save the skin. Rarely has a performance shouted: "Look at me, I play" bliss. His deafening nerve wakes up the lengths for a few minutes until the bluster wears out painfully. Strategically released by Miramax for an Oscar and Golden Globes counterpart (what a farce), the Weinsteins, along with Dick Clark, seem to have the critical community and won eight Globe Awards nominations for their disastrous failure. The resulting crime is that the rewards have become insignificant and the less powerful, less public relations-oriented films become obscure. Cold Mountain is a conceptual film and a waste of time, empty and bitter. Cold indeed !!!
