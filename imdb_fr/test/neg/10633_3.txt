I watched this movie because I thought it would be a classic Amy Adams movie. Wow, this movie is so bad on many levels that it surprises the imagination. It's badly constructed for one, the storyline and the acting are simply awful. But hey, even Johnny Depp has a bunch of bad movies under his belt. The good side of this movie would be Amy singing, and even on this score, I think better songs could have been chosen. Amy is of course beautiful to see and if you are an unconditional fan, you will probably look at this title no matter what, but do not expect too much. I wish I could find more to love, but it was just painful to watch. I recommend Sunshine Cleaning or Doubt.
