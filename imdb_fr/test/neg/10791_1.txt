This story is about an African safari that meets a certain Trent, who convinces them to look for a tribe of white girls. Naturally, they turn out to be amazon warriors and capture men. The rest is predictable enough. <br /> <br /> This film contains everything you would expect from a movie about good deals in Africa - the substantial use of often irrelevant archival footage, movie of animals that are NOT natives from the continent. (like Orangutans, Moose, Coatamundis and Ground Hogs), a dark-hued, dark actor who plays a bad actor (especially Trent - a handsome man with the personality of balsa wood), a comic relief (reminiscent of Chico Marx), a guy wearing a gorilla costume and white women wearing bikinis with perms that are supposed to be fierce jungle warriors - like an angry Tarzan tribe. At first glance, my assumption is that the film was made for less than $ 49.95 - development costs and rental fees included, as well as for renting the gorilla costume! But what I did not expect was an IMDb score of 4.9. It is mediocre, but not so mediocre, since it is a schlock production in every sense of the word and there is no imaginable reason why the film is rated as high! Now, I'm NOT saying that the movie is not worth seeing - it's campoisy and stupid enough to make it a nice movie, especially with friends. Do not expect anything that looks like a professional or competent movie. <br /> <br /> Finally, here is an overview of the dialogue of this classic jungle: <br /> <br /> "Oolama is a powerful white man ... Oolama wants a strong white man ..." <br /> <br /> "oonga-bunga" <br /> <br /> "me-te-tonga .... no, .... keeel ('kill') man"
