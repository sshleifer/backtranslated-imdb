Close but no cigar! - That's what my opinion of this movie is! TAG PURVIS wrote and directed this script which should have been rewritten before the shoot. Sometimes laughable or a nerdy scenario, the star of this film is Dan Mongomery Jr. and the director of photography. These two talents are to be watched in the future. My recommendation is to wait until it hits your local cable station and use the rental money on a classic!
