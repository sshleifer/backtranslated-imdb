That's what this movie is. God, the special effects are void in this movie. It is difficult for anything to suck more than the plot of this movie, but the special effects succeed. Let me try to explain how bad this movie is. <br /> <br /> First, there is the plot. There are four snowmobile punk-ass bikers wandering through a forest in Duluth, Minnesota. One of them is a jerk and tries a ridiculous leap and breaks his leg. A paramedic comes to help him but gets stuck with them when the helicopter breaks down. All five then realize that there is a forest fire, which would have been triggered by a guy who would dump tons of gas throughout the forest. All they show us is his boots, and they show scene after scene the boots of this guy walking around to clear the gas and light fires. Meanwhile, the teenagers try to escape the fire and discover that the bootmaker managed to get ahead (while they were driving in the forest by snowmobile!), Poured gasoline in the area where they were, and turn on more lights. He does it several times and the paramedic finally catches it and sets it on fire. I'm not going to ruin the end, but the resilience of this guy will make you scream "WHAT THE BLOOD NEED? !!?!" on the screen. Be that as it may, they are now surrounded by fire and their only way out is to go through a mine filled with methane. Yes, methane. I will not even try to describe the end, because it's too ridiculous and you'll enjoy it more if you do not see it coming. What you will not want because you can not expect it to happen. This is due to the second major problem of this film: coherence. <br /> <br /> Is a semblance of coherence too much to ask? Apparently yes. I can not even count the number of broken members in this movie (they break their arms and legs while crushing their bike). I think each character breaks at least one member and several others. They then drink until the scene ends and then forget that they are supposed to have broken limbs. There is a scene where three of them who are supposed to have broken legs start to dance. But then their wounds suddenly come back when the plot needs them. <br /> <br /> Finally, the CGI. If there is a hell, you have to watch the fire in this movie. All they did for the forest fires was to align the dirt roads with the CGI lights. You can clearly see that the only CGI light is along the roads and that all trees more than two feet from the road are left intact. And then they zoom out and show the whole forest sinking into the flames. It's hard to describe in words how ridiculous it sounds, but I assure you that ridicule is pretty impressive. <br /> <br /> This film is one of those so mediocre types. There are cases where he falls into the painful-bad category, but most of the time, he stays above the line and is ridiculously inept. I can not wait to watch the other Nature Unleashed movies included in the pack of four with this one.
