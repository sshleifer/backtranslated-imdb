It must be the worst movie I have ever seen in Nielson. This movie just does not have what it needs to be funny. I think the reason why Naked Gun and similar movies is that they do not require Nielson to be funny. He just played the roles as straight as possible while all the comedy that was happening was mostly visual. But when you put it in a film where he must be funny, he is not. The film had only one positive aspect, which can be considered by some as a spoiler and the opening credits were animated. If all the film had been animated, it could have been good. I did not intend to see this movie when I saw the commercials, and the only reason I saw it was because the tickets were given to me by someone who won at the radio contest. It's the first and probably the only movie I've ever released. On a scale of 1-10, I give this movie a score of -100.
