Acting 10, Script 1. "Hurlyburly" comes from this sad postmodern theater school that has banned everything that looks like a story or a plot. Although people can get away on stage, at the movies, it becomes deadly - or at least deadly dull. We still have a group of great actors who launch a dialogue that, although brilliantly written, gives nothing. Even worse, all the characters speak with the same voice despite their origins. Anna Paquin uses the word "is not". <br /> <br /> It does not matter that the characters are loathsome losers in the extreme, the work of the camera is a bit careless and (for Los Angeles residents) the attention to geography is laughable . (Hint: Sean Penn's front window view is about 12 km from that of his back window and you can not drive south through Hollywood and end up at Glendale claiming to be Burbank.) Good, suspension of the disbelief and all that - and normally I would not pay attention to little things like that, because they are just randomness of production. But the fact that they have resisted so much despite the pyrotechnics on the screen speaks volumes about the weakest element of this company - the scenario. <br /> <br /> In short, ignore this one, even in video. . Rabe chose the wrong Scottish Play quote for his title; Hurlyburly would have been better named "A tale told by an idiot, full of noise and fury, which means nothing." A bit long for the marquee, maybe - but at least it would be an honest advertisement.
