the actors can not act. every dialoague was plagued by bad accents and a loss of character. Channing Tatum never moves the lips or changes the facial expression ... NEVER. <br /> <br /> the story is not new. a street child is involved in a professional world of dance and that changes his life. this, added to all the incident involving the little child, comes directly from You Got Served and Save the Last Dance (I do not say that these films were good either, but that is to say that this film does not brought nothing new to the table). <br /> <br /> and the dance ... THERE WERE ONLY 3 DANCE SEQUENCES IN ALL THE FILM AND ALL OF THEM WERE TAKEN ON THE RIGHT OF THE COMMERCIAL. maybe I'm too critical because I'm a dancer, but maybe that's what needs to be heard. Channing Tatum is by no means a b-boy. his small solo on the parking lot had little style, technique or stunning effect, all of which are part of the street dancer's criteria. All the jazz and ballet in the film had nothing to offer except a bad technique and some acceptable hype, but nothing more. the grand finale let me think "... OK, now they will become serious" until the end when I realized that it would never happen. <br /> <br /> I'll admit that Although it's hard to make a good dance movie, Step Up is no exception. You Got Goted, with the exception of its inconsistencies with the culture of street dancing, had at least the appearance of dance. Save the Last Dance was a rubbish, just like any musical of the last 10 years (although I was impressed by Moulin Rouge) ... look on the central stage for Ballet, look to Beat Street for hip -hop
