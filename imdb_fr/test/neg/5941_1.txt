I loved this film! It is the most beautiful parody of Russian cinema to date. Who else but Sokurov could have dazzled Tarkovsky so brilliantly. Did you think that "Stalker" was slow? Well, speak up. "Mat i Syn" gives "Stalker" the appearance of "Raiders of the Lost Ark". This film should not be missed! There is no excuse - even if you live a busy life, you can still take full advantage of this movie by holding down the fast forward button on your VCR. Sokourov gave us the first feature film that can be enjoyed in 12 minutes. <br /> <br /> I guess the next big masterpiece of form will come when someone has the vision and the courage to expose a film that consists of no sound or image at all - 45 minutes of a black screen and silent (this has not already been explored in "In The Soup"?). <br /> <br /> Apparently, the filmmaker (and the fans) have forgotten that "" movement "is the first word of the word" movie ". <br /> <br /> !!! MAJOR SPOILERS BEFORE !! You want to reach the heights of genius that this film has reached? Here is a step-by-step guide: <br /> <br /> 1. Find a talented photographer. <br /> < 2. Find topics and a landscape that is picturesque enough (think of Tuscany!) If you need inspiration, look for luxury car or fragrance ads. <br /> <br /> 3. Shoot about 3 rolls of film. <br /> <br /> 4. Photoshop results to play with saturation, blur and aspect ratio. <br /> <br /> 5. Now, take out your camera, shoot 40 of the best images and let your "actors" mumble their lines on the screen, do not worry about writing it in advance - just let the actors say what they want (lines like "Do you want a drink? "And" Let's eat something hose to eat "are really all you need to refuel for about 8 minutes). If you can not find enough dialogue, no problem! Ask them to repeat what they say a few times. If that still does not work, let the camera work anyway. <br /> <br /> Congratulations, another masterpiece! As a bonus, if you want to distribute it over the Internet, no problem! Static images will compress to nil with standard MPEG encoding: a 73-minute movie would probably be about 2 to 3 megabytes, even at the highest quality levels.
