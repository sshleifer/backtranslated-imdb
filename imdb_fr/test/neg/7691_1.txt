This piece of shit does not deserve critical criticism, so I will write some information for those who do not know the background of this film. First of all, this is not the first Saudi film, they used this misinformation for commercial purposes (they lied!). Second, they earned their money for nothing else, so they chose the cursed (Hesham) who won the Star Academy (like Big Brother). It's a popular show. Mohammed Al Sairafi (as stupid and without talent) but has a popular film (count how many times I will use the word "popular", then send me an email to get your prize, however ...) and the Jordanian actress But Hamdan who appeared in the CBM series (not funny), she is famous * PoPular! Then they chose Saudi actors for ... blah blah blah. The funny thing is the director! He is Canadian with Palestinian roots (I think the identity of the film is the identity of his director) .. wait a minute! The screenplay was written by an Egyptian writer (very awful!) With the help of a Lebanese critic (famous as a critic but in reality, he is a collector!). This group of multi-races (monetary slaves) know nothing about Saudi culture, they do not represent it, but when we know who is behind this trash, all our questions will be relieved! Waleed bin Talaal is a Saudi prince and (businessman) who does not care about Saudi culture or the Saudis, he does not even live in Saudi Arabia (although he lives, he will live in his own world, his world is far from the real world of people), so he knows nothing and cares about nothing, except for his infinite fortune. <br /> <br /> * This is not a Saudi film (not a movie). <br /> <br /> All screws. <br /> <br /> Beep on 10!
