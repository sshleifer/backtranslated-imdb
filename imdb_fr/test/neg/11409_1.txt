In another horrible horror movie that seems so attracted to masochism, a group of friends stuck in a haunted house are being killed, one by one, thanks to a horde of zombies who sprout yellow blood and have very bad dental problems. The first 45 minutes, however, are entirely devoted to the discussion. Since young Thespians can not get out of a paper bag and enjoy the most banal dialogue they have ever recited without reciting, it is particularly painful. If you manage to stay awake because of these nonsense, the situation will not improve ... with bad makeup galore and tacky effects, interesting deals (not so special). As for the conclusion ... well, what is the bet that the old man who warned them not to go to the scary mansion in the first place will arrive and save the day for the last two survivors (a boy and a girl, of course)? ) with his mystical powers? Please .. life is too short for this kind of movies. Give the time you would otherwise have spent watching these guts to help the community, make some changes in a soup kitchen or something. You will feel that your life has been productive and that you will not put money in the pockets of the studios that throw irreplaceable waste like this one. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it's already too late for me .. now where did I put this copy of 'Pumpkinhead'? 1/10
