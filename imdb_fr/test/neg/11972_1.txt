My roommate and I have another friend who works on a local Blockbuster video. He finds really horrible movies for us and tells us about them. One of them was a movie "Christmas Horror" featuring former professional wrestler Bill Goldberg in the role of killer Satna Claus. We did not look at it immediately, but we did not think there could be worse. Apparently, we were wrong. We were shown this slasher movie "starring" Ken Shamrock against a deadly scarecrow. At first, we thought Ken would really be the killer's bogeyman, and that's why we wanted to watch, but he was not, which made the movie even worse. What was absolutely thrilled in the film was the drama for teenagers. If you want to prevent your brain cells from trying to get out of your head, NEVER watch this movie.
