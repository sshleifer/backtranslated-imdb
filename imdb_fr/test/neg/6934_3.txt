The film gets a score of 3 because it dared to be so different. It features a cast that plays while you can hear their thoughts and desires! It's really a strange movie and an experience I will not forget. The only problem is that the experience, while interesting in some ways, is usually quite dull and without commitment. In fact, it's amazing that a film by Norma Shearer and Clark Gable can be THIS dull! The film is based on a play by Eugene O'Neill and seems really quirky. In fact, it would have been better to keep it as a theatrical production - it did not translate on the big screen at all. <br /> <br /> This movie is only recommended for cinemani and those who love Gable movies so much that you just have to watch all his movies!
