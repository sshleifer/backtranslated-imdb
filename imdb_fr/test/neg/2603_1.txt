Everything in this show is terrible. His premise is even set up to get cheap laughs with bad writing. A "dysfunctional family" theme has already been used too many times, especially by the Simpsons, which is an excellent show with excellent writing and lots of laughs. Meanwhile, Family Guy has about five minutes of story in each episode, with tons of celebrity jokes and random flashbacks. Now, whether it was original or funny, I would think it's smart. But no, it's not funny at all. In fact, the only reason episodes are like these is that this is the easiest way to effortlessly launch episodes after episodes of this junk. Much of this program is not original, and what is original is only lame. He's also incredibly raw and irreverent, which can be satisfying if he's still smart. Animation is not everything either, but from an artistic point of view, this show also fails, proving once again that Family Guy is striving for the greatest number of cheap jokes and easy shortcuts. . People enjoy this show, and I do not care, because they can enjoy whatever they want, whatever their purpose, the lowest common denominator. But no, I do not recommend it, especially to those who one day want to study film or become a writer. It is cheap entertainment that has little purpose and has been successful in this area. The fact that it is so successful speaks volumes about America.
