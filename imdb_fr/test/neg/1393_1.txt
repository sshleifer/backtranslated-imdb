I love stand-up comedy. I like to hear the raw ideas of stand-up on stage, because they draw the audience of their peers through different life experiences, or things they have imagined or seen and that they have just considered as if ****. stupid that they had to share it with someone. <br /> <br /> There were stand-ups that took on a personality that everyone could understand (we think of Rodney Dangerfield) or were so crazy that you could not stop laughing with them while they made fun of others (Richard Pryor). And then there were comics that make you think, like George Carlin, who, while pretending to be a dive, was the smartest guy in the room, calling on people to rethink what they saw when they were walking around and realized how fucking they were. It was easy to change things. <br /> <br /> Now, this may seem like nothing to do with "Mind Of Mencia", which, as I agree with most commentators, is comedy. Central's horrible solution to the loss of "Chappelle's Show", but it is. Carlos Mencia spends half of the series doing theater for his audience, sometimes on popular topics, mostly only on racism and racial stereotypes. He tries to be the three types of stand-up above. He is a theater character, an everyday Mexican named Carlos who, despite the stereotypes, is only your usual type. He then tries to make fun of others, people he calls racist or just those who do not agree with his opinion. And then, finally, he presents sketches to the studio audience and the audience, telling them that it will help them understand his point of view. <br /> <br /> Carlos Mencia always says he shows a point of view He does not see, but what he's really doing is not just promoting racist stereotypes that have already been the focus of a wild farce, but it foolishly encourages people to hear them and do what helps them stay put: laugh. <br /> <br /> Promoting stereotypes is usually the easiest but simplest way to make participants laugh while standing up. The best humorists, who, I fear, Carlos Mencia, feel in good company, do not have to resort to them. They speak universally and ask you to laugh about absurdity, rather than with it, as Mencia encourages. While he creates more skits or "real" situations that call for racism or denigrate others by using them, he tells us, instead of asking us, to laugh, and actually presents these nonsense as truths, rather than truths. extremes of it. <br /> <br /> Its broadcast is an insult to the minds of those who watch it. Mencia does not give us the comedy and does not ask us to digest it and extract what we want (something that, as much as I hate to compare the two, was the best quality of "Chappelle's Show"), we say exactly how we should see and react to it - which, according to him, is to make a silly grimace and say "Dee Dee Dee!" This show is named as it should be. It is indeed a show on "The Mind of Mencia". It's the spirit of Mencia, end to end, and as such, it's nothing but silly entertainment. The show is tailored to give life lessons to its target audience, 14-24 year olds, about how stereotypes are bad, but this racial disparagement is acceptable to Carlos Mencia and should also be you!
