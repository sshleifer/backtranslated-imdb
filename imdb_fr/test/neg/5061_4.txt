Angel-A is a change of pace for Besson; monochrome, mawkish and rather mediocre. It is well photographed on site in Paris, although subtitle readers should note: quick dialogue AND good cinematography can make viewing frustrating. <br /> <br /> This film is neither "Wings of Desire" nor "Wonderful Life." Despite its common themes (a heavenly intervention against suicide, angel / mortal relationships ensue), Besson does not does nothing to enlighten or inspire us.Even the restless and tearful moments go down quickly in sentimentality. <br /> <br /> The imperfect ideology of the film irritates, an angel whose message of love and self respect is constantly undermined by his own violent and reckless behavior, a "happy ending" that cancels the hero's so-called journey from impotence to self-esteem and independence. <br /> <br /> Verdict: pleasant enough to watch, but confused moral and philosophical messages tarnish the film precisely where it should shine.
