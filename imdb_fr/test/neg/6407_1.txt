The film starts well, it has a goal. About a third of the film is deteriorating. Carrey begins to be obsessed with the number 23 because he sees it everywhere. So what? This is not a reason to go crazy and start writing stuff all over your body and on the walls. <br /> <br /> The role of the one who plays his son is bad. From the beginning, as soon as he hears about his father's obsession, he jumps on the bandwagon and becomes hysterical. Totally amazing. I hope I never see this kid again in another movie. <br /> <br /> It's a waste of time for this film. Take another one. Boring piece of ... well. Number is killing him? Leave me alone. I will not spoil the end, but let's say it's also disappointing. <br /> <br /> 3/10.
