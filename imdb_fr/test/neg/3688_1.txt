It may not be the worst movie of all time, but it's absolutely the most boring. I wonder why he is shot mainly in the dark and especially with Vincent Gallo who is moving away from the camera or looking down? Because he does not want to show his face for agreeing to be in this movie. I liked his debut, but the claim of the "Brown Bunny" and his casting made him lose a leg in my book. And Val Kilmer? In fact, I want to send him a sympathy card. The "doors" to this ??? In fact, the cast was the only reason I watched this movie, and Val did not show up until the end of the movie. Simply a sad movie.
