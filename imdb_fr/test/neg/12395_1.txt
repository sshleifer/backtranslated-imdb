The students (who are currently 20 years old) on the Boston campus (which looks like the Isle of Man) are threatened by a fierce monster (gathered during an episode of Blue Peter). The new teacher has to save the situation (even if he's really ... Oh, who cares?) <br /> <br /> I'll start with the positives ... here is a nice picture from the new Eastenders girl, Samantha Janus's can in the compulsory campus shower scene with her best friend Katy Lawrence. Sideways: Katy was hired when she came to the auditions with her sister, as well as moral support for her brother or sister, but eventually won some. Oh joy. Chosen in the dark to ... burst her ass in an insignificant scene for a titillation, then get killed for 30 minutes for her problems. Her last role (and the only other role assigned to her) is that of Probationary Nurse # 5 of the Atonement. I wonder if she took a look at Keira Knightly (if extras and stars are allowed to mix) and wondered: where did everything go wrong ?! <br /> <br /> I'll give some advice Katy: If all the other British members of the cast are invited to speak with American accents in a doomed attempt at mass marketing, and the only person who can handle it is the American veteran of movie B, Todd Jensen, you know you have problems. If you look at your pay slip and cover only your lunch and bus trip, you're not playing the lead role in a $ 1 trillion movie. If members of the fourth assistant director's family attend the premiere and cause laughter when the sticky monster rushes through the sewers, you should realize that it's not quite Alien. Or even a Critters IV, to think about it. So, Katy, in your next life (I'm Buddhist, you see), you may be a bit more selective in choosing your first feature rather than jumping impulsively at the first pile of shit going towards you. A flickering skin in your first movie does not guarantee lasting success. Unless you are Sylvestre Stallone. And he had the script to Rocky to support him. <br /> <br /> For all intents and purposes, this is a 0/10 movie like I've never seen it before. However, for unintentional laughter and the sheer value of the camp, he gets a 1. Well played;)
