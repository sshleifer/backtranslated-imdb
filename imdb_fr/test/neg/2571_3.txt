Steven Seagal made a really dull, bad and boring movie. Steven Seagal plays a doctor !!!!!! ???! This film has some action scenes but they are poorly directed and have nothing to do with the rest of the film. A group of American Nazis has spread a deadly virus capable of eliminating the state of Montana. Wesley (the Seagal character) is desperately trying to find a cure, and that's the story of The Patriot. The Patriote is an extremely boring movie because nothing happens. It is filled with boring dialogues, illogical gaps between events and stupid actors. Steven Seagal totally participated in the film and I would not recommend it to my worst enemy. 3/10
