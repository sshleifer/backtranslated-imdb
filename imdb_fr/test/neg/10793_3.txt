Abominable adventure exploitation in the genre of women of the jungle. A mediocre sound happily conceals the stupid dialogue. And it's terribly talkative for a movie about people who do not speak English. There is no adventure to find here; It's a jungle adventure with cliffhangers and a wild animal attack that occurs in flashback. <br /> <br /> Three pale-faced dopes roam the African desert and meet hungry Amazon tribes. These wild women have gone beyond the stone age to invent makeup, shoes and underarm hair removal technology. Despite their desperation for "hus-bahnd", the ladies insist that they will fight men and burn the weakest. <br /> <br /> The only thing that is of interest, as if there was a question, are young women dressed in animal skins cleverly designed as swimsuits of 1951. A lot of struggle and bad dances mixed with stripper movements of the 50s and without striptease. No nudity or appreciable violence. On the other hand, you can hum the Aboriginal catchy song for days.
