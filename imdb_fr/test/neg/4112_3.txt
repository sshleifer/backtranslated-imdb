I will begin by admitting that I like this film a lot. I find that if I can see what the creators have tried to do, I can appreciate their work. Sound of Thunder was a story that interested me. I wanted to see what angles the filmmakers would attack by telling the story. Basically, they tried to create an entertaining movie. The plot was artificial, but most of the action movie plots are. Ed Burns does not know how to carry a rifle, but still holds his role as a leader, believing that he is not asked much. The main problem, "destroys all the film", is the horrible CGI. It is totally unacceptable that animals and environments look so fake. Apart from that, the animal designs could have been really good, as well as the action scenes but failed because the production failed. It could have been a truly memorable movie if only they had finished it. It really looks like they were going back and fixing all the horrible CGI, but they were running out of money and publishing it anyway. Save your money because someone has failed this movie. I gave it three stars because it could have been good but it completely failed somewhere I can not say enough.
