This film was part of a handful that really hurt me. Anyone who thinks it would be fun to see their mother in a crowded nightclub full of people half her age "invents" a totally ridiculous dance in a totally stray effort to be "hip" (in the language of that age). It was hard to watch Ingrid Bergman stoop to such a pitiful performance on the disco dance floor. I was embarrassed. <br /> <br /> To make matters worse, disco music was not realistic at all. This is the misconception of a Hollywood director of what pop music was at the time. It is still a total embarrassment in most films of this period: the ersatz music is preserved and presents only a painful and transient resemblance to the music really popular in the 60s. <br /> <br /> Mathau is desperately a mistake a kind of women's man; he just looks deliciously grotesque. Hawn's wide-eyed innocence is too silly. The beautiful neighbor of her apartment is described too seriously and seriously. He looks like a kid from Brady who got lost in this farce. Painful and pitiful pain.
