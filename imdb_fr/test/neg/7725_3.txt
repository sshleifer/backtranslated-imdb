I saw the first house of the dead and I expected a root canal to be more pleasant, so when it was not so bad, I was pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I had my hope that the second one will be fine too ... and I was wrong. <br /> <br /> Apparently, I'm one of the few people to have seen this movie that thinks it was bad. <br /> <br /> I do not know if I will watch it again and force me to see all the people who have given good reviews have seen, or ask me if I have seen the wrong movie . <br /> <br /> Ed Quinn as Ellis and Emmanuelle Vaugier as Alexandra 'Nightingale' Morgan did a great job in roles far below them. They deserve to be in better movies. <br /> <br /> The special effects were acceptable and some of the characters were friendly / hateful, making it a tolerable watch, but most of the time, this movie was just a movie. waste of time. <br /> <br /> Oh, and I have to ask this question because I found myself asking it all the way through the movie ... Did not someone know how to close the doors behind him for that zombies do not do it? just wander in the rooms? Only once did the zombies move around and I found it a bit inconvenient ... soldiers enter a room, leave the door wide open, pay no attention to the same door so that the zombies can enter. want (the unfortunate "livings" being stuck with no way to escape) and yet, once, the zombies followed them. <br /> <br /> Nitpicky? Maybe, but honestly ... if I was fighting for my life, the last thing I would do would be to go into a room and leave the door wide open so the zombies could come in and eat me. <br /> <br /> That's really the only thing * that bothered me * throughout the movie, and the film, for the most part, was a bad sequel to an original not totally abominable.
