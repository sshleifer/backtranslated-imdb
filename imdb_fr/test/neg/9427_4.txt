An anonymous movie that could have been made by anyone. Where is Anthony Mann, the director of classics such as "El Cid", "The Naked Spur" or "The Man of Laramie"? <br /> <br /> These are wonderful images of planes in the clouds, filmed with love.History is very commonplace and almost completely devoid of dramatization.The couple lives a life almost routine and the user who is complained of June Allyson's choice for his wife, IMHO, totally misses her With her less than seductive look, her hoarse voice, she was the ideal housewife for the screenplay. At the time, women were barefoot and pregnant: there was not a single woman among the basic staff, even in the office. jobs - all they had to do was worry about their matchmakers, who were fighting for democracy and against an enemy whose name we never hear, but in 1955 it was not difficult to to guess. <br /> <br /> One wonders why a young man who has never seen a Mann movie should choose this one from all the great movies he has made.
