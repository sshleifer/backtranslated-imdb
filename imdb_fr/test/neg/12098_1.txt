This is one of the worst anime series I have ever seen. When I looked at the manga magazine magazine, I thought it might be interesting, but when I got the chapters, I realized it was complete stupidity. <br /> <br /> Okay, the first 2 or 3 chapters are acceptable. and the series have a standard. But as the plot progresses, it becomes totally incoherent. The series tries to show some mysticism based on Christian mythologies, but it is total stupidity. It contains scenes of demons and stigmata ... Totally absurd. It seems that the series tries to seem deeply thought, complex or mythologically reviewed, but an observer with a few cerebral and cultural references will quickly realize that all the elements used do not really make sense: they are only there to impress IGNORING OBSERVERS !! <br /> <br /> The last chapters are filled with totally foolish elements: battles with demons with cat ears, references to an alleged fight between demons and demons that control time (for no apparent reason). The finale is totally absurd; an ignorant observer will see a floating finale that will give them a place to meditate; but the truth is this: THE FINAL AND COMPLETE SERIES IS A TOTAL INCOHERENT AND INCONGRUABLE INSPERENT.
