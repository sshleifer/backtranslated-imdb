No surprise, other than the speed with which ABC reacted to the bad notes. According to reports published (Variety), the show has obtained the worst ratings in the history of the ABC television network. <br /> <br /> And I quote: ABC's musical talent contest "The One" opened on Tuesday night to cancel. now ratings. <br /> <br /> The article goes on to claim that the show receives a "scandalously low score of 1.1 / 3 on adults aged 18 to 49 and a total of 3.08 million viewers." <br /> <br /> This makes it the first lowest for all reality shows on all networks and also below all bows in the series in ABC's history. <br /> <br /> From the first moment I saw the ad, I knew it would fail. We do not need another American Idol clone. But ABC should have given this show a chance to succeed.
