As bad as they get. This movie commits the fatal mistake of making the viewer mock what happens to the characters. The two women in this movie are so stupid that you start to blame the bad guys for it to end. <br /> <br /> This film is one of the few that was so terrible that I had to turn to another channel. <br /> <br /> This film lacks any likelihood. People, not even those in Ohio, simply do not act like that. Well, maybe the writers do it. <br /> <br /> There is not enough beer in the world to make this movie bearable. <br /> <br /> F903
