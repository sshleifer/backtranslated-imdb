In short, the movie is about a gang war in the 1950s. Leon, the leader of the Deuces, starts the gang after his brother OD is in "junk". He promises to protect the neighborhood. The leader of the rival gang has just been released from prison and wants revenge. <br /> <br /> The film did not really do it for me. The "good guys" were no better than the "bad guys". Very little has been shown to suggest that the Deuces really cared about the community. I guess the writers wanted realism here, but I did not care who won. None of the characters were friendly or even able to attract my sympathy. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, the court between Annie and Bobby had a lively dialogue, and the acting was well done.
