Summing up: A group of five young Americans, all that remains of a platoon hit hard during the Ardennes offensive during the Second World War, gets this mission as an advanced outpost and looks for enemy activity. They are in very bad shape, physically and mentally, and think they have found gold when their outpost is in an abandoned but once sumptuous mansion filled with food. But after a while, there is an enemy activity and it is very strange. Not hostile, but strange. It seems that there is a German team in such a mediocre state that wants nothing more than to surrender. Comments: Based on a novel and I guess the novel is much better, but the story does not seem to translate very well on the big screen. Indeed, it is a different war movie, much more focused on mental pressure in war than on fighting and battles. But I can almost feel that scenes that must have been suspenseful, uncertain and unknown, fall flat in the film. It's not suspensive, just different and in many ways absurd. People often act alienated, and the reasons are unclear or, at best, allude to it. <br /> <br /> Thus, when this mental pressure fails to be felt, the main building block of the whole story, I thought the story was against through. It was not good, it was not interesting, it did not keep me on the wire and it did not send a message. In fact, it did not give anything. <br /> <br /> The cast is interesting, many young actors have turned into stars at the beginning of their career. The acting is good, but not stellar, and some characters have also fallen into the absurd area. Much of that too, I think, is due to this story, these characters need the time, space and rhythm given in a novel, they can not be given here. And going halfway is certainly not enough. <br /> <br /> 4/10
