There are a few things about this movie. Everyone should see it. You see the Iraqi nation as you've never seen it covered by the media and shot in a perspective that is hardly considered by most Americans, where the film has its main audience. However, all these glorious things in mind allow you to take a look at some other facts of the film. 150 cameras were distributed to the Iraqi people, most of them considering the war and the enslavement of the occupying forces as a growing pain for the improvement of their country. And compared to Saddam, it's just a slight scratch to the skin. In addition, Netflix, as the main distributor, announced it before the fun election we just had by sending a mass email to his entire list to see the movie. Many, which should be labeled as opinions played as facts enumerated by the Iraqis interviewed are false. If we look at the Red Cross's records of Abu Ghraib's torture, Saddam's henchmen were not tortured, it's a perfect mixture of 80 to 90 per cent of innocent civilians and from 10 to 20% of people rightfully detained. It has never been revealed that any of these 10 to 20% are henchmen or violators of the curfew of Saddam. In addition, the Arab world has never really inscribed "democracy" among its opponents. It is more specifically $ 6 billion a year for Isreal, our military bases in Saudi Arabia and our interest in oil. I agree that the media is a complete distortion, but this film shows the same distortion. I fear that the Iraqi people represented by this film have been edited to speak with a Yankee voice. Yes, it is true that Saddam is vomit and that his resignation is well seen by many. It is true that some Iraqis do receive a good salary. Just as it is true that no Iraqi people have control over their most popular oil, unlike American companies. Nor does it mention that 20,000 civilians died exclusively from American artillery. Another 15% of the countries that once had running water and whose electricity is no longer the case. Nor does it mention that from 1993 to 2003, the United States government killed more than 200,000 Iraqi civilians with UN sanctions. Nor does it mention this democracy when people decide on government, not a massive war machine that sends the message, "Be killed or obey." I fear that the cutting room will have many Iraqis who are not so happy with the occupation. Just as the vast majority of the world was not for war. In fact, the United States, Great Britain, Spain and the rest of them do not carry democracy, they turned their backs on reality by seeing how their pockets could be filled. Hooray, Saddam is no longer in power, but I fear that no Iraqis are still in power. Companies are in power, the media in power. Read, do your own research and do not let them blindfold you.
