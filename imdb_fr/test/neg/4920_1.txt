Well, at least that was the last sequel I could find at Blockbuster, because this movie was just awful. I mean, I can understand how difficult it would be to get rid of an evil house. We are talking about lighting a horrible fire, destroying bulldozers, flooding, and so on. But a mirror? How can it be difficult to get rid of a mirror ?! It was the most horrible movie that could have put the title of Amityville in the picture! <br /> <br /> Well, a group of friends who are pretty much from the beginning are a bunch of monsters. One of them is a photographer and buys a haunted mirror to a scary homeless guy, he teaches me a valuable lesson, do not buy anything from this scary guy. Of course, this group is horribly murderous and murderous, although I can not imagine anyone missing them. <br /> <br /> Please, avoid Amityville. so I think it was a premonition. Do not look so crazy. : P But believe me, it's horribly played, not well thought out, and not even scary! I feel so bad for the original writers of The Amityville Horror, they have to cry every time someone witnesses this movie. <br /> <br /> 1/10
