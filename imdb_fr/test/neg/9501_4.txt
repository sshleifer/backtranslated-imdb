Underwoods tells the story of a young man (Arquette) who convinces his friends that they should kidnap Frank Sinatra Jr. (Nicholas). The film is written ridiculously, the direction is strange, the dialogues are moved and scrambled, the actors have not done justice too much, Arquette is still boring, Ian Nicholas was nonexistent, Macy was decent, but only because he was rather good actor and probably just did his best not to get out of this project with a totally embarrassing performance, he was at least tolerable. It's a stupid film to me, sometimes boring, not very entertaining, but a movie I would not recommend to anyone. Rating IMDb: 5.5, my rating: 4/10
