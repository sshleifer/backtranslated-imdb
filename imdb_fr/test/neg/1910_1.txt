I was looking forward to seeing this movie, but when I finally got the chance, I was very disappointed. I had to stop half-way (or was it a quarter of way?) Because of the bad script and staging. Not to mention poor distribution! Josh Hartnett is the only one able to act, and he is much more appropriate to be the hero of the story. <br /> <br /> Well, basically, the story is about a cowardly girl from the country who cheated on her a long time - an early friend only to have meaningless sex with a rich kid and spoiled. This film did not attract my sympathy, not even when the author wanted it. I wonder where are the moral values ​​going? <br /> <br /> The actors are so stiff that when I resume the film (a few weeks after interrupting it because of its boring nature), they still have not managed to make me pay attention. The spoiled couple can only disgust me! What movie! <br /> <br /> I think everyone involved in this production should sit down and see her together so they do not make the same mistakes next time. And next time, they might consider Josh Hartnett as the protagonist ...
