For me, this movie was a disappointment. In one way or another, I expected it to explain the reason for General Rommel's popularity and his success as a military strategist during the Second World War. But none of this, he deals with the last year of his life and tries, in a way, to whitewash. I must therefore assume that Rommel was above all an amoral and apolitical technocrat of the profession of conqueror and murderer, without particular charm or notoriety. Such people just do not make good movies. I'm almost sorry for James Mason, one of my favorite actors, who had to emulate a pretty wooden character. In fact, a good director and a lot of artistic talent were wasted in this movie ?? with the exception of Luther Adler who gives a truly memorable and strangely naturalistic portrait of Adolf Hitler. <br /> <br /> There could also be a cultural problem for people like me who are part of the German-speaking world. Famous British actors imitating Germans are simply not credible. Rommel, for example, is perceived here not only as a German, but as a typical "southerner" of Baden-Wuerttemberg. You immediately think of a certain dialect, a certain spirit, a certain way of seeing the world (for example a "Prussian junker"). I also think that the July 20 assassination attempt has mixed feelings. Many of those involved in the plot were not Democrats and simply wanted German troops to join the Western Allies against the advancing Bolsheviks (thus prolonging the war forever). ). <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the best portrait of an intellectual and intelligent military mind is still Patton (1970). Incidentally, General Patton can be seen briefly in the vast documentary used for this film, a low-angle shot when inspecting vehicles passing by. The open case and the revolver with mother-of-pearl handles are clearly visible!
