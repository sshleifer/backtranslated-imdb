Sorry to say but I was disappointed with the movie. It was very hurried, because I suppose you can understand a long version of Pride & Prejudice and I think a lot of the major scenes have been passed over just to tell the story. As the film is so in a hurry, unfortunately you can not really know and feel each of the characters. <br /> <br /> Not only that, this movie is boring. I say that with a capital B. A third of the way, I started to yawn and I could not wait for the movie to be finished. As I read the book and watched the BBC version, I knew how many scenes had to happen before I could finally leave the cinema. Mr. Darcy, whoever he is, in this film absolutely can not act. He also looks too young to play Mr. Darcy. Every word that comes out of his mouth is rushed as if he needed to read the script or something. Where is the accumulation? At first, he seems confused with everything. He's just weird! Everything seems to be on. <br /> <br /> I was trying not to compare myself to Colin Firth's version, but if you like this version, you'll probably be disappointed anyway. <br /> <br /> The costumes are absolutely shocking. Where are the corsets? I know that Elizabeth is poor, but I think she always knows how to dress in a feminine way, and that she was not raised in the galleys. Her robes indicate that she is perhaps the poorest peasant in England. <br /> <br /> I do not agree with some scenes of the film because I do not think it would be considered appropriate. in this society for men to do such things, honestly, Mr. Bingley, who has the wealth, should know better. Some things say that the sound is too modern for the period in which the film takes place, and not at all like Jane Austen. Bingley's character is shocking, but he behaves like a simple, not a character to love and respect. What about his laugh !!! Wickham is hardly present and Mr & Mrs Hurst and some other characters are totally absent. Keira did well, but it's just not the same thing.
