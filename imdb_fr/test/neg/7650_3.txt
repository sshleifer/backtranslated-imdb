John Sayles, what did you do? <br /> <br /> "Silver City" had moments where I could see the glittering hope of a good story, well-drawn characters, a stimulating dialogue. And then these moments would be quickly covered by layers of bad writing, awkward direction and abominable game. I really like almost all the work of John Sayles, but "Silver City" is dreadful. <br /> <br /> I get the impression that Sayles may have been working on the beginning of a good story involving illegal labor and corruption conspiracy industry, but then he rushed out and stuck the plot of secondary plot satirizing the Bush administration about it. The two stories do not really meet and the weakest elements of the political theme dominate the first 3/4 of the film, which makes me lose patience with the case. <br /> <br /> The other major flaw is the role of Danny Huston. His dialogue in each scene comes with a big smile, regardless of its appropriateness to the mood. At the end of the film, I hated this guy, after calling back all the bad actors of all the plays that I had seen in high school. Having seen Huston only in something else, I do not know whether to blame him or blame Sayles more. Anyway, it is the unfortunate starting point of a very unhappy movie. <br /> <br /> Until the last final scene of the sledgehammer-subtle, I was disappointed by "Silver City". Sayles at its best, or heck, even Sayles to mediocre, can be so much better than this movie. See NONE of his other works instead. This is not even worth a rental.
