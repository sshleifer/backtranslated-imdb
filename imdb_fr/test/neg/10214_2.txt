A new wrestling show paves the way for the most feared wrestler ever imagined, the giant Zeus. The president of the network, Brell, is doing everything in his power to attract WWF champion Rip to the squared circle and face him against Zeus for the title of champion of the 'tough guy battle'. But Zeus is unlike any competitor Rip has ever faced. <br /> <br /> Normally, I would give Hogan some leeway as a wrestler going into a movie role, but this movie did not ask the Hulkster to do a lot of stretching, he just asked Hogan to play himself, which he failed miserably. 'Tiny' Lister made a good effort as a mighty Zeus, but even in his work, there was something missing from the movie, namely playing! <br /> <br /> Watch this film, if you wish, with a grain of salt and a sense of humor, otherwise you will probably have to turn it off a little more than ten minutes.
