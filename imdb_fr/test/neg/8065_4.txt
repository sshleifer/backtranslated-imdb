This film is very similar to Cannibal Holocaust. Without the useless slaughter of animals in the name of "shock" ("Oh, look at us, we're hardcore, we've added a real death to our movies"), these movies would end up in my dusty classics shelf - I'm a big fan of cannibal movies and zombies. But in the current state of things, this is another example of shocking horror that clings to the last branches of the pile in a desperate effort to make a bad movie generate more hype. To summarize, a crisp film gore with limited appeal. A fan of 70's gore should try, but anyone with modern ethics and tastes should choose something a little better written for their popcorn festival.
