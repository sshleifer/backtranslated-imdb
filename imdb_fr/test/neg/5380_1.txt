Why???? What a disgusting joke of a so-called movie ... from the poster, it looked like a cute movie ... what a disappointment ... who the hell is the main male role? He looks like an old rejected cop, a retarded retiree ... I'm a cop and I can say ... the man can not act ... become a cop again ... no presence on the screen ... why did they show his face the ass then, as if it were Mel Gibson, the devil no ... put the filmmaker in bankruptcy ... this guy does not have to make a movie ... I doubt that gay men or women find it attractive ... whatever the cast the movie is a hack without talent that has not thrown any talent in mind .. it's great that we whites, always get Asian women, but why a white if ugly, why not Dean Cain or Brad Pitt as a white boyfriend .. why Asian women love ugly white guys or black guys in what I see ??? Do not get it .. must be low self esteem .. <br /> <br /> The only hot girl who can play in the movie is the Kate Holliday..Why was there a hot white chick among the rest of the naughty Asian chicks who think they are hot and can play ??? <br /> <br /> Only two actors in this film, the animator of the poetry at the end of the film and the hot white chick in the massage house .. TL Young and Kate Holliday should have been the protagonists of the film . <br /> <br /> The character from Asia was ridiculous. It looked like she was trying too hard to be a kind of ghetto / sexy black girl ... the key word here is "try" .. <br /> <br /> Gina .. you can not act and you n are not physically hot enough for this kind of role .. you have to play the role of the character and be more humble your self presentation .. <br /> <br /> I think the actress is Gina Hirazumi ... I I raised her on the IMDb and she is a great Asian actress ???? If that's the case, I do not want to see what the bad American actresses of Asian origin are. <br /> <br />. No wonder Hollywood does not have American actors of Asian origin !!! if it's the best they have had !!! they were supposed to win some sort of Asian movie reward? give me a break ... it looked like they had just made a movie for the sole purpose of putting a group of Asian girls in there .. they are not even hot ... Gina ... you do not are not hot ... stop trying ... play characters and improve your acting ... you are not a female leader ... <br /> <br /> If this movie makes money, pigs can fly .. sorry to be so direct but I feel that these actors / actresses need to improve or work their art: except for the two actors that I have mentioned and who should have played the main role. I say that, lover of all Asian girls in the movie, do what your parents say and go for it and be doctors / lawyers / and engineers ... and act on the side for fun .. hope that's what you are doing now .. I'm not trying to be mean, but I hope that it will be read and that you will push people to go better or will do another business .. there was not even an ethical message in this movie .. <br /> <br /> I would not be surprised if "Soap Girls" was secretly funded by members of the Ku Klux Kl a special American-American Klan hate propaganda department <br /> < Otherwise, Asians must hate themselves ... seeing this movie makes me grateful to the viewer for not being Asian ... your guys are pathetic. Have a little respect for yourself, the Asians.
