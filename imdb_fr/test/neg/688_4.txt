Following his role in the fine caper SEVEN THIEVES (1960) - which I have been watching for many years - Edward G. Robinson seemed to be stuck in the role of old types of criminal brain (aside from the sometimes juicy role as in THE CINCINNATI KID [1965]). Previously, I had already watched GRAND SLAM (1967), a nice "Euro-cult" effort and, apart from that, I still have two similar titles coming from Italy, one of which headed by the future Goremeister Lucio Fulci ! Be that as it may, it's the kind of international production - featuring American and Italian actors and a British director - that prevailed in the 1960s; it's harmless and easy to live with, but barely memorable and definitely too long - especially since you have to finance the heavy equipment needed for the hold-up (like an army tank and a plane!) , the gang involved must draw a variety The gang, of course, is an incompetent group led by an American (Robert Wagner) and his girlfriend bimbo (Raquel Welch) - the others are a black man "pacifist" Italian starving since always and diminutive English. They try to convince a former gangster (Vittorio De Sica) to bequeath his fortune to him, except that he is helpless ... but, under the auspices of "Professor" Robinson, he instead offers a caper worth $ 5 million platinum! Needless to say, gang members do not trust each other (Wagner asks Welch to seduce De Sica to get the name of his fence in Morocco - where they have to withdraw after the flight), or to create a difficult job ( mandate to hold a restaurant, the Italian can not help but sit at the table and order a multi-course meal for himself!). In a funny way, faced with similar failures, De Sica tries to show them how they used to do it. However, apparently brandishing a gas station, it appears that the owner is a nephew and he is just asking to borrow money! <br /> <br /> The central flight sequence is usually complex: while the gang, including Welch, "takes" the train carrying the platinum, Wagner kidnaps the pilot Victor Spinetti and his plane. When his work is finished, he intends to double De Sica - but neither his partners nor Welch herself are willing to accept that. He is therefore obliged to yield. Coming from the time when the crime did not pay, the gang tried to lose everything in the air when the doors of the hold of the plane were accidentally opened ...
