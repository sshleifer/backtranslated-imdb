Robert Lansing plays the role of a scientist who experiments with objects that pass through a solid material, but he goes too far one night and is involuntarily in four dimensions! The atomic age fantasy is rather charming in a very old-fashioned way. Perhaps it was considered a science fiction thought of in its day (with psychological nuances), but seen today, the film is slightly overcooked and naive; it's a custom-made camp-fest for the late night TV show. The wooden shows by Lansing and Lee Meriwether are barely considered one-dimensional, although Patty Duke (playing a lovable kid before "Miracle Worker") gets a colorful and memorable outing. <br /> <br /> ** from ****
