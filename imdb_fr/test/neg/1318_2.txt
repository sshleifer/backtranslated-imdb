There is something intriguing about disaster films. The simple and primal principle can lead to several great stories. While most disaster films tend to explore familiar territories, I can usually live with them. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Flood probably marks the lowest point in the history of this subgenus. Robert Carlyle is undoubtedly the star of the film, even if the time spent on the screen is shared between different places and characters. It gives a barely decent performance. Joanne Whalley is also very uneven. Veteran actor Tom Courtenay (he played in Doctor Zhivago for the sake of heaven) is particularly bad. I mean, his timing is completely out of sync and his characterization is extremely mediocre. What an embarrassing performance for this man. The rest of the cast varies from decent to very bad, with one exception: Jessalyn Gilsig, who, in my opinion, could be there as a plot / treat device for the eyes gives by far the most convincing performance. That does not mean much considering the gravity of everyone's problems, but it's always nice to see that she cares about her fate. <br /> <br /> The script is really bad, confusing and clich√©. Some of the worst lines I've heard for some time are delivered one after the other by the actors. You have seen this story a thousand times. It employs all the dramatic playwrights you've seen in "Outbreak", "Armageddon", Poseidon movies (original and remake) and many others. <br /> <br /> The direction is terrible. No sense of timing, nothing inspired. Blows are bland, dialogues and actions fail. Editing is bad, but how to edit such a mess? Without a doubt, this film has tried to rely too much on a CGI (rather mediocre). The human factor, the drama and the struggles of the characters are passed over in silence. The scenes where the characters really have to face the flood are rare and poorly realized. The sensation made for television gives nausea. Is a guy supposed to get off a rope from a helicopter? No problem, let's show it inside a helicopter, do a really poor editing / editing job and put the next picture with him safely on the ground, in the most obvious way possible. <br /> <br /> The score of the film is rather poor. Everywhere, no timing. <br /> <br /> The end is probably the worst I've seen in a while. Very good as they ran out of ideas. In case of problems, you can not miss something if you have never had one. Must lack budget. <br /> <br /> This is a really amateur job. I give it a 2 for using London as a location, which is a nice change, because Gilsig is really decent in a key support role and for the few CGI plans that were decent (those of the water that is getting closer to London and gates). <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and take a look at Day After Tomorrow or any disaster film before this one. This includes older classics such as The Towering Inferno.
