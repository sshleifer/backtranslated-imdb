A moderately interesting debut, some pretty scenes from Japan of the sixteenth century and a promising idea. But the execution? The comparison that comes to mind after about fifteen minutes is that of "Cannibal women in the jungle of the death of the lawyer". Really. A specialist in "oriental history" who does not speak Japanese, walks on a tatami without taking off her shoes and is usually as stupid as celery? Please. It looks like a student film: the sets are laughable, the acting (except perhaps for the main character) close to the wood, the plot quite arbitrary. At least "Cannibal Women" was funny! It's best watched by someone who knows Japan, just watch the disbelief creep up and down on his face.
