I am surprised to read all the positive comments about this movie. Even my 4 and 6 year olds were bored. Chipmunks are cute ... but the scenario is too obvious. Not recommended for young people with the least sophisticated tastes. <br /> <br /> We heard some laughter from the audience while we were there; but I wondered why. <br /> <br /> I never admit to being a fan of chipmunks, but I was expecting to be entertained. As far as I know, it's not even an "escape" movie. Simply a heavy sight of "success too young spoils". Britney Spears, et al., Have not seen enough? <br /> <br /> Do not worry.
