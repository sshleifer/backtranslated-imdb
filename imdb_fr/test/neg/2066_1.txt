I do not even know where to start ... <br /> <br /> It's not worth typing a comment, so I'll mention what another user has posted, because I'm totally 'okay with him, but I give him 1/10 instead of 2/10' I can not seem to find the words to express how bad I thought this movie was, the initial precept was promising, but to all In all respects, it was totally awful - let's go over the main points - Plot - good idea start but really awful development There were a lot of points where I thought "no, nobody would do something so stupid". was incredibly anticlimactic Characterization - all the characters were completely bland or grotesque caricatures Music that was not - maybe mother, but that's all Music - intrusive, inappropriate and generally terrible Direction - totally amateurish Cinematography - doubts that they have heard .. Camera angles / stability / zoom levels often very bad. I am totally confused by the way this movie has gotten so big. It's the worst film I've seen in movies for years, if ever. "
