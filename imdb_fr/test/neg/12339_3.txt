This film has its realism, you really feel that the writer James Slater has done his homework in alpine skiing while the director Michael Ritchie turns the film in a documentary style. However, the problem is that unless you're a big fan of this sport, DOWNHILL RACER gets little attention. <br /> <br /> Before anyone asks why I looked at it, I did it because it featured the great Gene Hackman in a leading role, but that's not a good enough reason to watch
