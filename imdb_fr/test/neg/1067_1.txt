The time I lost to seeing this movie, I ask to come back! I felt sick later, but not because it affected me in any way. It's pretentious, trying to get the audience to feel bad for the people involved, but I do not care. The characters are soulless and stupid. You do not get an explanation for certain scenes and this leaves no thought afterwards to propose your own explanation. All the students in the film have problems, but as you do not feel fervent, you do not believe their problems. <br /> <br /> If I could write better in English, I would never stop. But I can not, so I'll stop now. <br /> <br /> Do not look at that.
