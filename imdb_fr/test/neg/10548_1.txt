The Toxic Avenger ... <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​this film is that a person that the whole population would call this person more cowardly, and who, after being thrown into a barrel of toxic waste, became a superhero is completely disfigured sounded good even in 1985. This film is considered a horror ... I even heard about a following cult with this series .... <br /> <br /> Now, this movie was even given when it was done was so bad that I could not stop watching ... the acting is horrible even for an independent movie that I think was to be the part horrible from this movie ... <br /> <br /> Drug Trafficking, Sumo, Entrance Godzilla .... I'm all for movies that promote drugs ... Damn I even like Godzilla and sumo ... I'm not in it but I still think sumo's heights would like to give this film the slap of the hands and the salt ground in the eyes of the people who made this film ... Personally, I am almost ready to write to the film company that directed this film and to ask him the Plus or minus 87 minutes of my life. <br /> <br /> For me, 1 in 10 is too high, it is a pity that there is no zero (zero) or even negative integers to place on a film here. <In other words, this movie is JUNK ...... would rather watch the paint dry and face an explosive diarrhea than watch this movie again ... I would be the first person to use not only the packaging this film as a light, but I would be up for a good movie and a script burning.
