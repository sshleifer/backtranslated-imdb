I just watched Descent. Gawds what a horrible movie. From the start, they describe a lava geyser and a note indicates that it lies miles beneath the surface of Washington State. People, there are no geysers at the bottom of the Earth like that. They thought it looked cool and in the typical Hollywood style, they threw it in. And then there is this well that has vomited lava. He dropped a stone and I heard a splash. Steam would have cleared well before an explosion of lava could, if any. <br /> <br /> And the acting was very bad too. Micheal Dorn has sunk into a new wave of jobs. <br /> <br /> What a movie dog. I bet the vote is not more than 3.5 <br /> <br /> It was not obvious that SciFi Channel spent much more than having the pretty boy Perry to try to shoot.
