This espionage melodrama has a beautiful distribution, almost promising, and should have been very atmospheric; there is a will or a mood intention? and also a desire or an absence of will. <br /> <br /> Sheen plays a dissident who now plays the role of agent, he is a loner, beloved by women but haughty; Mrs. Fossey is his mistress. Neill plays the role of a gallant, generous and chivalrous Soviet agent. <br /> <br /> Sheen and Neill are essentially boring; Finlay makes a brief appearance, as do other well-known actors. Mrs. Fossey is hot; but again, she still is. <br /> <br /> I will be your true friend and I will break it - the film lacks suspense and excitement, it's banal and rather boring; What's good is that you can see Mrs. Fossey naked. Other than that, the exploitation of lukewarm derivative espionage.
