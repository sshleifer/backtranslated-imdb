Forget what I said about Emeril. Rachael Ray is the most irritating personality of Food Network ET Television. If you've never seen a 30-minute meal, you probably can not begin to understand how incredibly annoying it is. I really really wanted to say that you could not even embarrass yourself before seeing the show once or twice, and even then all the words and all the clever thoughts will miss you. The problem comes mainly from his manners, as you may have guessed. Ray has an awkward mouth and often imitates the parrot. If you like something or think it's "awesome" (a word it uses about 87 times per broadcast), just say it. And she always uses terrible and funny slogans such as "EVOO" (extra virgin olive oil!). SHUT UP! The worst is that Ray has TWO other shows on the network! I think it's a conspiracy developed by terrorists to drive us crazy. Give me more Tyler Florence! Ray is lame.
