I was expecting a lot more from this movie than I actually had. The acting was awful on everyone's part and the story was far from impressive. It took a lot of things that I did not even know to follow what was happening because it was so nervous. An example of acting is when Paxton's character, Vann, upset the South Vietnamese colonel, so he throws some of the sand off the "sand map". It was impossible to get an idea of ​​what he was feeling and his actions were robotic. To make matters worse, I have no idea what I'm supposed to feel about Vann. He is obviously presented as the protagonist but upon his arrival in Vietnam, he begins an affair with a Vietnamese English teacher. The only thing that mattered in the movie was that it was not particularly boring. I give it 4 out of 10 stars.
