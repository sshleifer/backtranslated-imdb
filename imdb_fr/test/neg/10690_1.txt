my friends and I watched this movie last night. it was pretty amazing. by all means, it was probably the worst movie I have ever seen. at first, it was tolerable. it smelled BAD IMPROV but it was still pretty funny, despite scenes too long and a terrible quality (the budget of $ 400 that I read above ... sounds pretty good) of the film itself. <br /> <br /> the biggest problem was the lack of script; With improvisation training, I know how difficult it can be to keep short, effective scenes. What happened in this film is that the actors were left to improvise the scenes and they did not know when to stop, they just continued for centuries on stupid subjects. At first, I thought it was because the movie was short and they needed long unnecessary scenes to flesh it out. As the movie progressed, I realized that it was really a bad movie. <br /> <br /> There were many parts where I could see that the filmmaker had a very good idea for a shot but not the resources (or talent !?) to succeed effectively. a lot of scenes were taken all at once (cause, you know, improv) for what seemed like a very long time. so boring! If you can endure an hour and a half of improbable improvisation, look at it. it's really funny at times but also really stupid and boring. the game goes from very good to absolutely terrible. it seemed that the only good games were those that really had nothing to do with the main plot; the little boy who swore a lot, the barber, etc. etc. <br /> <br /> but yes. painfully bad. like, I felt really bad. After about an hour, my friends and I just got bored and left.
