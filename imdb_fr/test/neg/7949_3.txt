Why redo the original "Assault"? "Assault" was in my eyes the real masterpiece of Carpenter. It contained all the elements that the good films of Carpenter contain. External threat on a small group of individuals. People take up the challenge because they have to do it. Isolation! Do not forget that the weapons in the original Carpenter produced no sound, so they were much more threatening than conventional devices. And now this remake. Concentration on the psychology of the "main character I" and on his relationship with the main character II (the evil but honorable). The anonymous threat in the movie Carpenter has been replaced by a rather conventional plot / conspiracy context. The remakers simply did not understand the main plot of the original. And so produces something quite ordinary.
