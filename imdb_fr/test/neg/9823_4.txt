Hellboy revolves around classic stories of the comic / action / superhero genre. Hellboy is essentially a kind of demon who found his way on earth. He was raised a child by a priest and in a government society and chose to protect the people of the earth from the supernatural rather than pose a threat (the normal career path of a demon). <br /> <br /> The staging of the story involves creative uses of history, combining Nazi and occult experiences. It's absurd, but the idea of ​​a devil wandering the streets is too. I find explanations about the characters, who they are and how they handled themselves very well. The sequences are relevant and very funny. In fact, the opening is the best part of the film, that's where the problem lies. <br /> <br /> Essentially, Del Toro, who both writes and directs this piece, bottles it. The film is absent from any tension or major conflict. Hellboy is essentially established as invincible in the first act and the rest of the film therefore includes scenes in which any conflict is automatically pretty crude, because we inevitably know that Hellboy will be fine and that the villain will die. I hear you cry that this is the case for any action movie / hero. Yes, that's right, but once we are trained in a well-done action movie, we can not help but think that the hero can die. Die Hard works because John Mclane has every chance of dying. It escapes death by the thinnest of margins. The stakes are high because his wife is also in danger, etc. Terminator and Terminator both work, because in both cases, the villain is far superior to the hero. The threat and the tension are constant. <br /> <br /> Del Toro is also guilty of using deus ex machina. The characters usually disappear and reappear as their skills are needed in the story. The villain is featured in perhaps three scenes. He has no motives. Occurs unexpectedly and inexplicably. In one scene, Hellboy seems to face a real threat (groups of monsters). A character unleashes his abilities: the screen disappears in white and the monsters are inexplicably dead, but everyone lives. A minor character set in an irritating and undeveloped love story becomes the key to the conclusion of the film. His character is so thin, his relationship so undeveloped. It is clear that it is nothing more than an accessory to advance the plot and give it meaning. I do not want to ruin the end of the film, but essentially a character who is dead is miraculously and incredibly brought back to life. <br /> <br /> The film suffers from a mediocre dialogue and a film that just comes Not smart or funny. After a while, everything starts to rage. <br /> <br /> In addition, Del Toro blows action scenes with uninspired images. And anyone who has made the creative decision to make hellboy's main weapon a weapon instead of his trembling arm should be fired. Essentially, the use of the gun weakens the concept of the film and reduces the fighting to nothing more than a one-way shooter. <br /> <br /> The few positive points are: Cinematography is very good. At any time, the mood is set by the dark light and the darker color palette. As well as the use of interesting sites. But maybe it's also the same thing. <br /> <br /> The use of CGI and FX is well done. We never have an overload. When the effects are used, they are well used and the realism is preserved. Rather similar to the way Nolan used FX in Batman. I much prefer this method to the effects that one often meets. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's a pretty poor movie. What is a pity is that (even if I did not read the comics), I found that the film had lost a lot of potential. Hellboy, as a character, has many fascinating dimensions that are totally unexplored. The film has a viewing capability, in the sense that if it is broadcast on television and nothing else is broadcast, it may be worth watching. But in any other situation, I would not care.
