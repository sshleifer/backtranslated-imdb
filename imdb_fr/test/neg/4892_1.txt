I must say this is the first film I review here and I have not finished watching. I mean .. I COULD "CONTINUE!" It does not matter how inflexible I am to look at things until the bitter end, "The Sad Coffee Ballad" did not give this viewer a single match Vanessa Redgrave plays the role of the strange woman in the city who does things like walking in the river with a full set of clothes anyway.Anyway, a long lost parent comes to visit him, he is a dwarf and Well, that's all I got, what was the purpose of all that? "" I did not even bother to wait until Michael Carradine came because I was already foolish by the combination of the slow script AND the fact of having to deal with a dwarf in a dramatic role.I call this movie theater cinema that appeals to some of you, but the others stay away.
