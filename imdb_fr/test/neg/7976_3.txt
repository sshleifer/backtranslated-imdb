Supreme Sanction is a film about a murderous woman who works for the US government. She has to kill a well-known television journalist, but saves her life when she realizes he has a little girl. Since she did not kill him, she became the next target of his employers. <br /> <br /> The scenario is not good, even though I have already seen some of the worst B movies. A killer with remorse, the government killing innocent people in the name of the fight against terrorism,. .. And then? Aliens saving the victim ??? No, Supreme Sanction will never win a reward because of the script. And the acting is not better, I'm afraid. Some well-known actors (Michael Madsen and Kristy Swanson), who clearly had a lot of bills to pay and therefore agreed to play in this movie, as well as other actors who probably do not even know what a camera looks like. Do not do any good to the film either. <br /> <br /> So why should you watch this movie? Well, if you have nothing better to do than watch an action movie and you're tired of Mc Gyver's 10,531st coverup or Team A, that could be the movie you want to see. Otherwise, you'd better leave him alone. I give him a 3/10.
