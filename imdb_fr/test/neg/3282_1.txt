Robert Montgomery-Myrna Stuffing about Loy (Irene) and her fiancé, played by Reginald Owen, stranded in Labrador when their plane crashed. (That's really what should have happened to this highly predictable movie.) Montgomery lives there while waiting for his fiancé. <br /> <br /> Surprise! Montgomery and Loy are soon drawn to each other. The scene with the bear is so artificial. We knew he was a tame bear. <br /> <br /> Complications ensue when Clara introduces herself. Loy wants Montgomery to tell Clara that they should separate. When he refuses, she wants to leave immediately. <br /> <br /> You do not have to be a rocket scientist to know how this will end. With all this snow, it's too cold for everyone!
