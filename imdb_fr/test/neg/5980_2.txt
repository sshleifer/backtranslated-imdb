Absolutely nothing in this film is funny, interesting or relevant. apart from two characters who meet at the end, nothing is ever solved, and there is no intrigue. and by the way, what's the problem with the DVD cover? he has a feminine ass in daisy shorts ... where was this scene in the movie? no one has ever worn dukes of daisies in this movie! Surprisingly, almost all the game in this movie is good, and black jack plays a complete song (could be a stubborn track of ... do not know if) ... these are the only values ​​that redeem, though. All in all, it's just a waste of time.
