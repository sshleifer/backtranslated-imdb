*** This comment may contain spoilers *** Warning: this contains spoilers. I saw some pretty lame movies of my day. And that makes sense that I see about 80 films a year. I must say that of the 80 films I see at the theater, maybe 5 are really good, 15 or 20 are not so good, 40 or 50 are good and maybe 5 or 10 are really terrible. Here On Earth falls into a category in itself. It's one of the most predictable, vehement and despicable films I've ever seen. It is full of unmatched characters, messy situations on special subjects after school and enough fluff so that YOUTH AND THE REST are like American BEAUTY. And I'm not unfair. It's an awful movie. <br /> <br /> This is the story of a rich guy, a poor girl, a poor guy and a little town who cooks fresh biscuits every day for everyone. Are you starting to get hot and fuzzy? Let me continue. One day, the rich brat comes to town with his new graduation gift that his father bought him. He insults the pretty girl in the restaurant, quarrels with her long-time boyfriend, then runs and destroys her. dinner she works at. So he is sentenced to a summer in the little town where he and his boyfriend have to fix the dinner together. This gives us plenty of opportunities to see Chris Klein without a shirt so we can understand why the dinner girl would crack. He has abs! Oh and he is rich !!! And .... he's the biggest fool with no respect for anyone. It's James Dean, it's a rebel who does not care !! He is rude to everyone in the city, he does not want to hang out with someone who tries to be nice to him and he acts like a rich and spoiled kid. But Leelee Sobieski always falls in love with him. No reason has been given for why she does it, she simply does it. Oh, forgive me, that's right, I forgot to mention that he loves the same poet herself. Well, if it does not get you wet, I do not know what will happen. <br /> <br /> Here On Earth also has some of the most predictable moments I've ever seen in the cinema. There was a moment when I left the theater to fetch popcorn and read graffiti on the bathroom wall and told my fiancee exactly what would happen in the next ten minutes . When I returned, she just laughed and said I was right, even when I said there would be a dance scene. And what's more, the illness she contracts suddenly is cancer. He is the most beautiful cancer patient I have ever seen. Have you ever seen a cancer patient die slowly? They lose weight, lose their hair, their gums begin to rot. It's not a beautiful picture. Sobieski shines after contracting cancer, as if she were pregnant. What an insult to those who have seen loved ones die slowly from this disease. And how do you contract knee cancer after a fall in the field? <br /> <br /> Now, I realize that I've seen too many movies and that my cynicism tends to regress sometimes, but it's ridiculous. There was not one thing to like about this film or the character of Chris Klein. He is a fool, he is odious, and he never tries to make peace with anyone around him. Here On Earth is not just a bad movie, it's an irresponsible movie. This received a 4.2 on the IMDb voting board, and it's way too high. It is an embarrassment for the writing of the screen and the one who gives the green light should not only lose his job, but also must promise never to approach a scenario. <br /> <br /> 0 out of 10, and that's being generous. This film should be shown in film schools in the form "How not to write and make a film. <br /> <br /> If you are bored and really need something to do and your choice is to To clean a farm filled with cow manure or to watch it film, choose cow dung cleaning, it will smell better and you will feel like you have done something good with your two hours.
