I recently went to a free soap girl screening where the filmmakers were present. before the movie, they were prowling, taking photos. I was excited to see them dressed in real life and I could not wait to see the movie on the big screen. <br /> <br /> During the film, the audience had laughter. it was clear to me that they were not making fun of the photo, but of the photo. it's purely a B movie without any logic behind it. Add nudity, blood and whala! you have a movie! <br /> <br /> After the film, I approached a group of filmmakers and asked them why they wanted to make this film. they all acted so seriously, as if they were serious filmmakers. they each told me something different: making a controversial film, a funny film, an edifying film, a socially responsible film. everyone mentioned something different. it was clear to me that none of the filmmakers knew what kind of film they were making and they were now trying to get their money back by making this film known by every means possible to get people to see it. <br /> <br /> Let me warn you: do not get carried away by the hype! unless you seriously do nothing else, it may be worth the time for a film student to study how a film should not be made. otherwise you'd better save two hours of your life.
