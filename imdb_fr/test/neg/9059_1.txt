John Candy and Eugene Levy play the role of incompetent security guards chasing a big gangster. Inept is really the right word for this so-called comedy ... some laughs but mostly moans and thoughts like "why am I looking at this c ** p?" Yes, it's Meg Ryan in this area too..which I'm sure she does not want to be reminded..a mess of a talented cast .. on a scale of one to ten ..0
