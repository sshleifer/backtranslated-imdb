GRUDGE (the original American remake) was amazingly able to do just about everything you could do right with a ghost movie. There was suspense, a dark and gloomy atmosphere, good shakes and truly frightening images. THE GRUDGE 2 tries all these techniques, but ultimately fails. It shows us only the old stuff we saw in the first movie, as well as a messy story that constantly shifts from Tokyo to California. It starts in Tokyo with schoolgirls entering the house, now heavily blocked by a police band. One of them finds himself face to face with a ghost-like girl with similar wide-eyed eyes as he is trapped in a closet. She goes out screaming frantically and they all run away. We then go to America where Karen's mother is sent to Japan by her mother to find her and take her home. We finally end up following a very familiar concept involving a curious guy and girl who are investigating the story of a mysterious house. We cut back to the girls from the beginning who disappear one by one as well as to a young boy hearing strange noises in the neighboring apartment at night, all leading to a very unsatisfactory end. The scenes of "scaring" are dull and ineffective. Like The Ring 2, avoid this terrible sequel of god ...
