I had the chance to read the book in advance and I know a little about Tudor in England. <br /> <br /> the writing of the production and editing of this TV movie was mostly horrible. I felt like I was watching a very bad drama doc about the period and then about a movie. <br /> <br /> First, there were too many cuts between the important parts. And leaving aside the important events that took place at that time, we can mention Henry's disagreement with Rome over his desire to divorce Katherine of Aragon, which led England to separate from Rome and to to found his own church. they have barely stuck to the book at all. I am all for creative freedom, but at a limit, especially when you use a well-written book as a starting point. in the book, Mary gives the first birth to the young Catherine, then she gives birth to the young Henry. Both their father is Henry the Eight. in the film, they first show Harry, then Catherine. And suggest that Catherine's father is William Carey. <br /> <br /> There are too many bad moments in the film to write them all. <br /> <br /> I will say however that the portrait of Jodhi May and Natascha McElhone as the Boleyn sisters were probably the best part of the film. <br /> <br /> If you have not read the book and know nothing about Hennry's 8 Court, I will recommend you to stay away from this movie. And for those who read the book, the film will annoy you for its lack of detail and its important plot.
