The problem with this kind of lyrical film is that you make either a masterpiece or a lemon: there is little middle ground. In a word, it's not "Berlin - symphony of a city" or "Man with a camera". Unfortunately, it's not a lot to look at either. <br /> <br /> The problem with this one is that it's simple and half-cooked, as if Michael Moore had come on board. He really has nothing to say, or rather to show us with images and sounds. Koyanisqatsi uses images cumulatively to propose a thesis. This is just a patchwork looking for a point. (Although, inadvertently, the film tells us more about Uncle Sam's spirit. It has something profoundly paradoxical in an anti-technology, anti-civilization, anti-media film, so deeply imbued with technology. "Do what I say and not what I do." You must love the Yanks, huh Tonically, this episode has something biting and misanthropic.The two previous episodes have experienced moments of lyricism and exaltation; This time, the tone is always dark, it just does not work for this duration, as Gustav Mahler will say. <br /> <br /> Stylistically, Naqoyqatsi is a mess, the hissing digital content is particularly bad This gives the whole thing a whimsical, over-processed look, and it also undermines the "realistic" nature of the analog "found sequence." (I mean, I'm sorry guys.) Part of the joy of Koyanisqaatsi was that it was a tribute to the use of optical film. Digital content often looks like video links from CNN or BBC World.) And with the "footage found", well, digital manipulation is often ugly, and usually just ridiculous, and the false color and solarization made me think to ... <br /> <br /> ... ahem ... <br /> <br /> Sequence of the James Bond title. <br /> <br /> Ahem. Strange as it may seem, there is also the possibility that the film was simply stolen by Yo Yo Ma's performance; it's about as discreet as a voice over from Lawrence Olivier. The images should be beautifully convincing to capture all this charisma. <br /> <br /> Philip Glass himself is in a strange form; I did not expect him to drop the Verdi requiem! (Made me laugh, which, of course, is not the desired answer to any part of this movie). There is even a piece of music that sounds like Brahms. (?) Maybe they have changed her pills. <br /> <br /> From our department "useless questions": Is Geoffrey Reggio really a Hopi Indian? Or did he just do a sweatlodge in Hollywood Hills? Oh, and are excerpts from fragments from previous "episodes" of the trilogy a commentary on how these films are also part of the global slush of the media?
