never before have I seen such a story of such talented hangers being so thankless that their golden goose has failed. these sperm monkeys are parasites and bad examples of friends. I felt sorry for Troy as he tried to get all his friends involved in Hollywood concerts, but as soon as things got worse, they all left Troy suspended. Overnight, an artificial effort of indulgent retribution to a man who rose up against the Hollywood forces to preserve the integrity of his story. The basic premise of Overnight is to try to convey the following message: "Look at this guy, he ruined everything", while he has many underground followers, that he has been hit hard by the part of friends and project leaders made in the way he envisioned it. Frankly, the only productive game played by any of these guys in the general shoot of Boondock Saints culminated as a mere extra body in the scene of the first bar room, after which all they did was lament why they were not more important based on the accumulation of their rancid efforts at the top of the troy shoulders.
