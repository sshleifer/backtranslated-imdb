A bad scam Quentin Tarantino, at least I hope that's what they were looking for, because at least I could then respect the director for admiring Tarantino. A scene of "singing" with Rose McGowan is far too great and great for this film and could only have been found by mistake by this director. So, in addition to her inspiration of Quinton and Rose McGowan and her good scene, this film was nil. Some of the craziest dialogues I've ever heard, I'm willing to bet on the fact that McGowan does not talk much, it's because of the quality of his dialogue. Try to be funny, never, try to be dark and not, try to be stylish and just bland. Who spent the money making movies like this, I hope it was all the directors, so someone else's money was wasted. If it's not for McGowan, the whole cast is awful and when McGowan is your best hum, I wonder.
