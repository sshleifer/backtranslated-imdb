I managed to do this throughout this film, but I was stunned by the total lack of entertainment. My friends and I are fans of HK, but WOW. This movie has it all, and I mean by all that a movie should not have. Underdeveloped and stereotyped characters, ridiculous special effects, nerdy special effects, talking robots, no less than 20 double-footed jumpkicks, impossible situations, unfathomable "gags" and "jokes", elementary school premises, blind murders, and also -long run time for hardware. Add to that that Gen-X Cops was a decent film and this movie becomes even more difficult to bear. Quite simply, if you plan to watch this movie, do not do it.
