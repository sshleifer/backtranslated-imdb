This film was awful, clear and simple! The animation scenes had absolutely terrible graphics. It was very clear to see that this movie had on the budget of my grocery bill !! The acting game was just as bad. I have seen better playing in pornographic films. I would seriously like to love the time and twenty minutes of my life back. In fact, I registered on IMDb simply so that others are not drawn to look at it as I did. Do not get me wrong though, I love sci-fi movies! It was more like the intro of a video game :( I'm happy to have spent only a dollar to see this one! The scenario reminded me of the black film, A prisoner on a ship Fleeing Escape Oh God God .. what are we going to do ??? I would not even let this game play in the background of my house while I was cleaning! of line, you can do better.
