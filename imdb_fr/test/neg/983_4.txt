This film would have been correct, if not probably excellent, if the directors had left the interviews and the concert sequences separated. "Into the Void" is a great song, and I hate the fact that this is the best part of a conversation between Marmonner's interview with Ozzy Osbourne. It should have been at the end of the film or in a feature film. The best part of concert DVDs is to put them on and let the music play, but "Black Sabbath: The Last Supper" is hard to put on and just let it play because the music is continually interrupted. Nevertheless, this film presents some strong points. the concert sequence, when it's playing, it's excellent. Black Sabbath returns to the stage after a long break without Osbourne and this film is a perfect illustration: Sabbath is a real bomb for fans. Of course, the fans have a nice advantage in the film because they see the band live, of course, but they also do not have to endure the incessant interviews that overwhelm the DVD viewers. Shame on Jeb Brien and Monica Hardiman (the directors) for doing that to the movie! In addition, Wyatt Smith should be ashamed to have made the film this way.
