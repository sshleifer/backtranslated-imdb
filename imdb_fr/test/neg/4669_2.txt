Like many people in my age group, I remember seeing this film as a child in 1998 and coming out of theater almost in tears. At the time, it seemed like one of the most important and inspiring cinematic experiences of our generation. Armegeddeon had everything to please, at once captivating, funny, heartbreaking and inspiring, and he had it all, right up to the catchy song of Aerosmith's theme and the teary shredder of an end. <br /> <br /> Sweet Jebus. What did we smoke? I watched it for the first time in years last night on one of the movie channels and ... I can not even describe it. It's really one of the worst movies ever made. Where to even start? Leaving aside the plethora of LAUGHABLE scientific errors ("staff trackers" on astronauts? Yeah, of course, thanks for that, Billy Bob), I would say the worst is the remarkable fact - dare I say unparalleled - in which he combined a crappy writing with a crappy action game. There are too many examples of this to even start enumerating here, but there is one in particular: the scene where Bruce Willis tells the feds exactly where to go to find each of his cool and charming team members tanker ('check all the bars in New Orleans', 'craps tables in Vegas', 'the only black on a motorbike in Sturgis' ... all this on the air of 'Come Together' ... it reminded me a little of the scene "NEWS TEAM! ASSEMBLE!" Anchorman, except serious). Ben Affleck proves once again that he is by far the most overpaid player in Hollywood, with less depth, reach and overall talent than anyone else in the industry. No more than Bruce Willis, Liv Tyler, or anyone else in this piece of garbage GODFORSAKEN, was much better being killed midway ... is this the only movie where his character dies? > <br /> Peter Stormare is perfect as the most STEREOTYPIC Russian COSMONAUT LESHAVEN YOU NEVER SCENE. (Again, Peter Stormare seems to have a knack for playing super Eurotypes.) It was really fun to see how, almost IMMEDIATELY after the stowage of the Americans with the Russian Space Station (what is actually called the movie ), Ben Affleck manages to explode the entire joint in a spectacular way in Hollywood. I also like the fact that in the end, Paris is the only place on Earth to be destroyed and nobody seems to care. And in addition to all this, it literally turns into simultaneous announcements for Lockheed Martin AND Kerr McGee. Oh, how proud I am an American. <br /> <br /> There is still a lot to tell, but I will not do it ... just say it's a really, really, really terrible movie. I'm ashamed to have really loved <br /> <br /> I give him two stars for the mockery factor.
