Jeremy Irons and Forrest Whitaker are good actors. But this film was badly written. First, during the hijacking scene, Irons is sitting too comfortably in his chair ... he seems to be reading something rather calmly too! The director may have shot the actor between two shots? In addition, the violence during the hijacking was a big disappointment. Slow motion, flying bullets - the way his wife and daughter were killed is just not that interesting and the tension is lost. His grief then lost another 10 minutes. Then he decided to "take revenge" and talk to all his friends journalists and ambassadors of the sector (he is a journalist from the stifling newspaper of the economist) and now, they give him advice on where to find the bad guys! How do they know? But what really drove me to put the film out halfway was when Irons found himself in a warehouse with bad guys hanging around - BUT NOT THE BADDIES WHO KILLED HIS WIFE - and carried them off anyway. so he's just a murderer. he walks away and, well ... I turn him off. I mean, I could not understand how his friends knew anything, and also I thought he was looking for the other 2 men in detention who were the original hijackers. Instead, he attacks their friends, I suppose, or all those who hang around in warehouses and leave automatic weapons in reserve. The suspense was just totally conventional and the dialogue was lame ("It's okay son, help crying," he says to his son, his son says "no, it's not the case" and his father says "You have reason .. that's not the case. ") Irons assumes dubious roles - like that dragon movie he did. He was excellent in Brideshead Revisited, a completely different animal from this lukewarm thriller.
