With the exception of Clara Evans's beautiful rack ... this show was pretty bad ... so why did I watch it? Too much coffee and had to relax before hitting the bag. Watch BB change in his most cursed Big Chief outfit, was at best fun, quite laughable at worst. <br /> <br /> I could have created a better Skeltor and special effects on my Dell. Boxlietner has seen better days, this guy is a year younger than me and looks more and more like the scarecrow of his early 1980's television series. The woman must now return to the theater school, although Evans size 40 and plays a young man of 17 years (she was in her early twenties, it was a stretch) .... the channel Sci-Fi has done better than that ... but for us people who do not do not go to much more bars, I guess we have to take what we can get ... after all that can elude you from the coverage by CNN, MSNBC and Fox of Election 2008 nowadays is a good thing.
