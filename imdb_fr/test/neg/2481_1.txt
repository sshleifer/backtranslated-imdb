When Las Vegas came out, one of the critics described this show as a quote "A piece of harmless plush". Needless to say, after watching a dozen episodes, I think this description is accurate. An assortment of pretty boys and model types play an assortment of all-paper stories, all the while trying to pretend to be serious businessmen. One-dimensional characters, in a one-dimensional framework, pursuing one-dimensional stories. That pretty much sums up Vegas. I still watch from time to time to see if the series tries to evolve and take themselves a little seriously, but alas in vain. Until there.
