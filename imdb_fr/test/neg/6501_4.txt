Avida is a play on words mixing life and passion, but I personally think that this film has been overtaken by its ambition and does not do justice to its title. It brings together a set of awkward characters united by incredible links. Moreover, the way everything is connected at the end is, in my opinion, a little pathetic. There was still a set of images ... interesting, but not enough to make a good movie. <br /> <br /> I think this movie is supposed to be a comedy, but I certainly have not noticed! The nonsense and caricatural nature of the film is actually the only benefit, but when it trails, it becomes unbearable. I must say that I fought to keep seeing him until the end, and I'm still not sure it was worth it ...
