A Chicago couple, Dillon and Dougherty, are falsely accused of killing their daughter. People start to wonder if they did it. Police investigate and find suspicious evidence. The couple is decried by the public and accused by the press. The cops assume they are Satanists and they murdered their own daughter ritually. They are accused and brought to justice. They are represented by lawyers seeking advertising who give them bad advice and charge them $ 100,000. The evidence against them is distorted or hidden by the police. Fabricated statements of sexual abuse are presented. Their other child is taken away and placed in a foster home. Dougherty is pregnant and gives birth to her abducted baby. Verdict, she did not do it but he did it. He goes to the slam with a 45-year sentence. <br /> <br /> In the last third of the film, with Dillon in prison and Dougherty wondering what to do, we now see people who have been antagonists in the defense of the couple. The witnesses admit to having lied. Other facts are uncovered that eventually lead to the release of Dillon. The killer has never been found, although the film presents us a complete whacko as a culprit. <br /> <br /> It's a weeper from start to finish. Nothing seems to be going for the couple. Oh, there are some happy moments, maybe a party where everyone is happy to be together and who is torn with joy, or a piece of evidence in their favor is discovered and people are hugging each other. But it does not take long before someone rushes to the door with new bad news and all faces are frozen in tragic disbelief. (Usually, there is a fainting to block.) There is not necessarily anything in moving tragedies, although I can not imagine the pleasure we have in seeing people suffer. Shakespeare is full of tragedies. I guess all we are interested in in tragic stories is how they are told. "Oh, but I'm a fool of Fortune!" Romeo cries after killing Juliet's brother. Here we have Dougherty running in his robe in a hospital hallway shouting, "Where is my baby?" There is no ambiguity or irony in history - as I am sure there must be in the real events on which it rests. People are good or bad here. Otherwise, they turn out well. <br /> <br /> The film is not meant to explore human quirks or the way things are going. It aims to tear off the tears of the public. Actors provide role models of the highest order. I do not remember the last movie in which I saw so many tears. There are streams of tears. Showers of them. Cascades of them. A real Niagara of them. A lake of these lakes. <br /> <br /> Well, I'll give an example of how effectively the film is designed. Dillon and Dougherty hire a Chicago police officer who works as a private investigator (Ed Asner). Asner is supportive, but he does not do much. He seems to be in the film not because of his importance to the case but because he can give the victim couple a kind of philosophy - "Learning to live with", which is good - and because he suffers We can watch him take his medication, suffer pain and finally disappear. <br /> <br /> What is frustrating in the film is that focusing so intensely on the suffering of the couple removes one of the most important issues it raises - the function of gossip in the regulation of privacy. <br /> <br /> Gossip is really a strange thing. If we call it "gossip", it's bad, but if we call it "public opinion," that sounds OK, at least. Of course, we all have beliefs about issues that may or may not be justified. (As I write, Michael Jackson is again being tried in court accused of assaulting a boy, and I wonder how many of us are excited about this news and presume he is a pedophile.) But gossip is not all bad either. It's like water. When properly controlled, it is an asset of the community. We need gossip to stay online. It helps us maintain public order. But, like water in a flood or tsunami, it's ruinous for a village when it's out of control. <br /> <br /> It's a good movie if you do not look too far. understanding of human nature. It is so well done that, given its purpose, it is difficult to argue.
