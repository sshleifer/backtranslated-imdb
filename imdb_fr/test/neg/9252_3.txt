"The Mill on the Floss" was one of the lesser novels of Mary Ann Evans, who wrote under the pseudonym George Eliot. I tried to read this dull and very turgid novel a few years ago, but I was unable to finish it. I will examine this version of the film solely on the basis of merit, because I do not know if it faithfully follows the original novel. <br /> <br /> The opening credits of the film are printed with an Old English font suggesting the medieval style. It is therefore a very bad choice for a film shot in the nineteenth century. (On the other hand, at about mid-way through the film, we see a close-up of an auction flyer, which is composed of authentic Victorian type fonts and seems * very * compelling. ) extremely convincing in his description of architecture and clothing of the early nineteenth century in England. The precise location of the story of this film is never revealed, but judging by the accents of the actors, I would situate it somewhere in the Cotswolds, perhaps in Warwickshire. <br /> <br /> The plot, what does it consist of, involves a mill that changes hands a few times (over a few decades) between two rival families, a rich and a working class. I do not agree with another IMDb critic who says that James Mason has only a small role in this film. Mason plays the most important and central role in this drama, as a descendant of the richest family. As a spoiled and petulant Tom Tulliver, Mason is dark and impetuous. His performance here belongs to a better film: it made me want to see the movie "Wuthering Heights" with Mason as Heathcliff. <br /> <br /> Being a multigenerational saga (something in which George Eliot has done well "Middlemarch"), several of the main roles of this film are divided between two actors: actors children in the prologue , adults in the main story. The prologue of this film features a very well written scene, establishing Tom Tulliver as a willing and brazen man from an early age and a young, decent and thoughtful Philip Wakeham. By hard work, Philip has earned half a penny: Tom tries to remove it, but refuses to take the piece by force: he wants Philip to give it to him. All the children actors of this film, men and women, have talent and are attractive. Unfortunately, all children speak with accents with a feather voice that is very different from the accents of actors and actresses playing the same role as adults. This discrepancy draws attention to the offset nature of the material. Unfortunately, none of the subsequent scenes are as good as this prologue. <br /> <br /> The apotheosis stages a crowd of workers during a rainstorm, much better punctuated and photographed than the previous scenes. But modern viewers (at least in Britain) can no longer take this kind of material seriously. To this day, virtually all British comedians have made a comedy routine "trouble at the head of a mill", parodying precisely this topic, so I had a hard time watching this movie with a flawless face. <br /> <br /> The character The actress Martita Hunt plays well in a small role, but the opening credits (in this font in English old) carries badly his name, which is called "Marita" . I'm going to award 3 points out of 10 to this boring movie: one point each for James Mason's performance, the scene with the kids, and the authentic Victorian typographic composition in this auctioneer's prospectus.
