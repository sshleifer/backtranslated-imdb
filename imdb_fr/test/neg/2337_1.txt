Some filmmakers take two and a half hours to tell a story, David Lynch puts two and a half hours to reconstruct scenes with "clues" and its quirk, but there is never a story. No land. No progression of the characters (unless you find that the illusion revealed is a "progression"). I'm amazed at how everyone can call Lynch's garbage "art", but if beauty stays in the eyes of the viewer, so be it. Lynch's work in movies and television in the 1980s appeared as "avant-garde" and "alternative", very much. 20 years later, a work like "Mulholland Drive" is a piece of masturbation David Lynch lasting two and a half hours. It's embarassing. I finally saw the movie taking my first place as the worst. At least, the people who shot "Godzilla" and "Rodan" did not pass them off as "art".
