One of the critics here wrote: "Good acting, good special effects, excellent <br /> <br /> location, even better ending." All I can say is "Ugh". This film was painful to watch. Let me start by saying this: I am a Christian considered extremely conservative by many people I know. So, what I am going to say is not biased by the "Christian content" of the film. I will not hit him because he's a Christian. I'll give it a 2/10 because it's a horrible film. The writing is bad - far too predatory, and much of the "preaching" is just out of place for the story. This is just for bad scripting. That I agree with the scriptwriter's beliefs <br /> <br /> is irrelevant - create a good scenario that runs well, stays on track and is credible. The acting game was at best amateur. But, when we name amateurs, we have <br /> <br /> amateur performances. Dirk Been may have been on "Survivor", but this show <br /> <br /> requires zero acting capacity. Playing on his name and reputation for selling units is in bad taste. Unknown casting that can play and you will have a much better movie. The effects were horrible. The scene with hail and the subsequent fall of the stars was embarrassing to watch. And why was the ending great? It made no sense. Yes, I know what Tim Chey was looking for, but he missed the goal. I bought this movie and I was expecting a lot more depending on the reviews and misinformation <br /> <br /> on their website. And, although I was hoping more, I had what I always have when I watch "Christian" movies - a piece of sub-budget ka-ka, poorly written, poorly executed, poorly produced. Maybe someday someone will end up speaking with an end-time film as well written and as well done as Gibson's "Passion ...". 2/10 stars.
