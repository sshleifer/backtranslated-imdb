Like most musicals of the time, you have to check the reality at the door. Broadway MELODY of 1938 is neither credible nor plausible, but rather amusing to the strange. This movie is really just an excuse to perform the talents of the stars. Some scenes unfold as if they were in a review, not in a plot-based movie. <br /> <br /> Judy Garland shines and it's a shame that she has so little to do unless there's a lot left to do in the editing room. <One of the most insane events is how Eleanor Powell gets a lead role in a Broadway show and Robert Taylor says it will be a job, a job, a job, from dawn to dusk. Several scenes are happening and there is no work, no rehearsals ... NOTHING. She needs money to win a horse in an auction. She does not have money. Is not she paid while she repeats? Taylor has to borrow money to help. He is supposed to be a big producer. He does not have money ??? Anyway, these are just two elements of this strange story. <br /> <br /> The musical numbers are quite wonderful, which prevents it from being a total loss. Broadway MELODY OF 1940 is much better than Broadway MELODY OF 1936.
