I really wanted to love this movie. A movie with zombie children coming out of a mine to kill people at night seemed like a great idea for a horror movie. Unfortunately, the film was one of the three least-watched films at a horror festival. <br /> <br /> A mother and her two daughters are trying to leave after the death of her husband / father from an illness that cost a lot of money. They have to adapt to their new environment. They end up struggling because of everything around them for different reasons. (The children of crazy zombies fall into this category) The film never gives sentimental attachment to anyone who lives or dies, the film does not produce fear or great moment, the film barely shows children do what they are supposed to do ... Kill! With a bigger budget and a better distribution, this film could have hope. In the meantime, pass it on. <br /> <br /> 3.5 / 10 in fact.
