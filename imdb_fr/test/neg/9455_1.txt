Bought for Â£ 1, Project Vampire is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The game of wooden actors, lame effects and a terrible story add up to a movie you have no reason to want to see. PV is one of those movies that does not even have the grace to be uncomfortable, but on the contrary, this bile seems to try to make itself as offensively dull, stupid and crap as it is humanly possible . <br /> <br /> A vampire has created a serum that he sells to seniors to improve his life, and those who take it fall under his control. A former lab trainee teams up with a nurse to try to stop him. Someone should have stopped the perpetrators of this garbage. <br /> <br /> Nobody has any reason to see this film, and I'm actually dismayed by the human race because at the time of writing this report, 2 people have already given it atrocity 10 of 10.
