The film is televised as I write. <br /> <br /> I just forgot how horrible it was to watch it in the movies. <br /> <br /> The very idea of ​​the film is imperfect. The fact that intelligent Europeans and Americans stranded in the desert forget any concept of morality and civilization in a few days is laughable. The madness of the lord of the flies was longer in the making. <br /> <br /> The boring details are numerous. One is the only African character resembling a god who mysteriously survives this horrible climate and has been doing so for centuries without losing his mind and he also does not seem to have any supply problem. Ridiculous. The same goes for the attempt to rescue the tour guide, an Indiana Jones look-alike, whose rescue attempt ends with a tragedy and death a five-minute walk from the cabin. Then there is the choice of Lear, imposed on the group by an artist's joke resembling a guru. He reminded me of my hippie art teacher in high school. <br /> <br /> The worst thing is the choice of Levrings. It is obviously an intellectual brain. It will never be clear to me. <br /> <br /> Positives are rare. It's a beautiful film, but it's never important. <br /> <br /> Intellectualism in high school. Weird for strange reasons. It's a complete waste of time, unless you like to shave unnecessary art films.
