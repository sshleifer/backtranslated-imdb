While I was always looking for the worst film of all time, my friends and I came across this little gem. It's hilarious from start to finish, especially if you do not know (as we did not know) that it's a sequel to another series of horrors. <br /> <br /> I will not bother to make the plot, except to mention that everyone is complaining about the horrible blizzard that was coming (it was as if the characters were screaming "FORESHADOWING!" In front of the camera and moving their arms), and that the snowstorm occurs. Budget problems, I suppose. <br /> <br /> Add this to a magic door that opens or closes depending on the terror effect that the director wants to create and electricity cut off until the sports teacher decides shower with a lot of soap. I will admit it; I could not breathe at times. <br /> <br /> The only decent part of this film, as it turns out, comes from the original movie Slumber Party Massacre. It's so much fun now that I know it. <br /> <br /> * SPOILER * The end, where it is revealed that the merchant did it because her drunk friends stumbled upon her and a friend in the train A friend driving on a train or whatever This is probably the origin of the funniest psycho-psychological killer ever created, enhanced by the fabulous use of blur and archival footage. I'm glad all the friends of the slasher have completely forgotten the incident until a flashback is needed. <br /> <br /> Run, do not walk, take this and see the hilarity. Of course, the editor of continuity should receive a price for all this, if only he was not stuck in this horrible snowstorm ...
