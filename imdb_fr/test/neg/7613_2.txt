I loved the Muppets. The Muppet movie, The Great Muppet Caper and The Muppets Take Manhattan are good family movies, cleverly written and fun to watch. I never thought I'd see the day they'd jump on the Hollywood steam train, but here it is: Scooter as a rave dancer in a cage, Pepe makes obscene and suggestive comments every five minutes. They are no longer Jim Henson's Muppets. <br /> <br /> This film on the theme "It's a wonderful life" has its highlights, but not enough to save it. I cringed at this with my children. I still have hope for their next film, but this one has certainly been a disappointment.
