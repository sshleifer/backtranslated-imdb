Hi all, Oh, my God ... This one is a lulu. There is really bad ambient music every time they can compress it. There are three bad guys who, I suppose, are the stars. They hit people, cut them into pieces and knock down trucks and bulldozers. Usual stuff. <br /> <br /> The woman who sends them on mission can not move her mouth when she speaks. It's a bit like watching a bad ventriloquist who is his own model. She walks as if she is holding an egg poised on her head. <br /> <br /> The wardrobe is a 70s leisure style for men and blah for one who is supposed to be a good nurse. The woman of bad mouth novocain is wearing red. A silk dress maybe, or maybe just a poplin windbreaker that's too big. <br /> <br /> I actually liked the end, even if it does not make much sense. This allows us to know what happened earlier in the film. <br /> <br /> The police are OK. Some bad, some good, all stupid except two. The two brilliant could have worked again in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> The film begins rather oddly and ends with a surprise. The middle is zero. The guy in the restaurant who gives a free hamburger to the star does a good job. He is like a character actor from the 1940s. Excellent voice. <br /> <br /> This one is a little too long. The lady with marbles in her mouth could have had just a few lines and the rest could have been told by a parrot. It would have been easier to understand a bird. <br /> <br /> His scene with a sword could have been treated by a well-formed spike. <br /> <br /> Tom Willett
