So it's a movie about space. But it's a small budget. You ask, "what about the effects?" The effects are sometimes good and sometimes very bad. I mean bad. And notice that I started with the effects. <br /> <br /> There is a story here, but it is told in what I think is the wrong order. I do not speak of a bad order to the Tarantino. I mean, it says in a completely absurd arrangement. It is largely a mother (in the future, because you know, it's science fiction) as her daughter says, which is mainly an exhibition made in a narrative way from the point of view of the girl. Once the first hour has passed and you hear Paul Darrow's voice as a computer, you realize how consistent the story would have been if he had read it. This story is so constant and inclusive that the actors on screen do not say a word during the first hour. <br /> <br /> There is also a lesson for future filmmakers: if you do not do 2001 and want to have an action (this one does), then, PLEASE, hire a good one choreographer of combat. Otherwise, your battles will look like what is in BATTLESPACE. And notice that the title contains the word "battle". Ugh. <br /> <br /> I think this could be the classic scenario of trying to make a movie based on nothing more than a concept. And some effects. My biggest surprise is to see the IMDb list of this movie cost $ 1.8 million. When you compare it to something like PRIMER, which works best on a budget of a few thousand dollars, you realize that in the case of making low-budget films, it's all a story. I did not expect much - but I was always disappointed. Two stars out of ten.
