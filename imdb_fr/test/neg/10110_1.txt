It must be one of the worst movies I have ever seen! The cast is international - an Australian claiming to be British, an American of the stage and a character with the English name wearing a "European" accent unrecognizable. The passable efforts of this motley crew are totally undermined by a conspiracy and a scenario of a particular inanity. The budget of this film was so short and the overall production so low that it would have no difficulty winning a limbo film competition. Over the last twenty years, we have seen horror movies and stalk'n slash thrillers of extraordinary quality (but not necessarily "high quality") that have not been made without a budget. Recent examples include the poor-quality but totally scary "Blair Witch Project" and of course - the most recent - the low-budget winner, SAW, with virtually unfamiliar leads before him. In DARKHUNTERS, it is shocking to find a known actor, Dominique Pinon and Jeff Fahey, in Hollywood, who are fighting valiantly to save the film. It's embarrassing to see the handsome first man (Fahey) with skinny makeup saying strangely bad lines. I would have rated this film 0 out of 10 if it had been possible!
