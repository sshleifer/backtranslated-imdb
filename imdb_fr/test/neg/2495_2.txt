I read about all the important books about the Manhattan project. Most people know what it was, but not many people understand the depth and breadth of the project. His field of action was immense - he may have rivaled the history of the United States only by the 1960s space program. <br /> <br /> There were - literally - MILLIONS of people involved in many areas (most illegal) across the country, each involved in a specific and different aspect of the project they could not talk to the person sitting in the booth next to them, let alone their family. The logistics are heavy, especially given the communications, security and transportation considerations of war in the 1940s. <br /> <br /> For example, my colleague's father was a carpenter who worked for the one of the companies under contract with the federal government for the Manhattan project. His job was to supervise a team of about 30 other carpenters, who were responsible for manufacturing concrete pourforms for the massive research facilities in Hanford, Washington. That's all he did, six days a week for almost two years. These carpenters needed food, housing, sanitation, hospitals and equipment, as did Oppenheimer and his crowd at the top of the pyramid. Think about it! That being said, it is simply impossible to do justice to the subject in a two-hour film. For Joffe's defense, however, I would say they had an impossible task, especially since he had chosen a diverse scenario with several intrigues, angles and characters. What was he thinking exactly and how could he be so arrogant to think that it would work? It's Hollywood, I guess. <br /> <br /> FAT MAN AND LITTLE BOY has so many flaws that it would take a book to list them all. Horrible casting. Terrible writing (and politically motivated). Bad science. The representations of Groves and Oppie are particularly inaccurate and downright disturbing. Despite the overly obvious agenda of the scenario, he is ALWAYS incredibly bland and sloppy. <br /> <br /> These flaws have been listed elsewhere on IMDb, but I was particularly struck by the fact that scientists had had so much time on their hands - softball, horseback riding, parties, semi-formal dinners, ballet, etc., not to mention romance, and of course political petitions in circulation. According to FM & LB, if these great brains had managed to free themselves from their belongings and had spent time in the laboratory instead of seducing Laura Dern, we might have won the war before D-Day. <br /> <br /> A final complaint - - FM & LB mentions that "Fat Man" and "Little Boy" were the code names of the two atomic bombs, but he does not mention that these names were a good-natured jab at Groves (" Fat Man ", for stature) and Oppenheimer (" Little Boy "for his small stature). Another reason why Paul Newman should not have been in this film ...
