What a desappointment. The story is so simple: "good people sometimes do bad things and bad guys sometimes do good things" - disguised as a racial context that makes them look smart, sophisticated and meaningful. It's not. It lacks any subtlety. <br /> <br /> Everything that happens is telegraphed and resumed in case you missed the explanation. <br /> <br /> For a film like this, convincing and moving the public must represent the ambiguity of the characters, their motivation and their actions; do not just present it as a series of 180-degree changes in the actions of each character. <br /> <br /> At the halfway point, I really did not want to waste any more time, but I thought I could stick to it in case it got better. ; big mistake I should have stopped then - it just got worse.
