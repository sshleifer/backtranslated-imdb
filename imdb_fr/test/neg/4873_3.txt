MST3K forage. It's so bad that it's really worth seeing for that reason. It contains hilarious elements, such as the mysterious device on which the villain is seen working throughout the film, which turns out to be this tiny helicopter that floats and carries a machine gun without trembling, but is shot down by a bag of balloons (the one they release during political conventions). Many other wonderful touches of this kind. Stars Charlie Sheen. There's a scene where he spends five minutes recording a conversation and then dropping the microcassette in the Potomac River by accident. If they had given Emilio Estevez a role that would never have happened.
