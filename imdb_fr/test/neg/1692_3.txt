I was 12 when this movie came out and I loved it. The song was inspiring and it made me feel good to watch it several times at the movies. In fact, I had the album of the soundtrack and I played the song several times. <br /> <br /> 26 years later ... I am ashamed. I sat down and watched it with my two daughters who loved it, but my cynic and bigger eyes hated it. It was very badly managed in many places and since it was Lionel Jeffries who directed, I really wanted to enjoy it. The animation of the character was so rough that the sets were pretty good. I remember the critics of the day who said it was a mediocre and horrified film, but I now agree. <br /> <br /> It's an old movie yes, compared to what we can get now, maybe that's why I thought it was fine then. But that does not excuse for his bad quality of action, his direction and his lack of spirit. The voice of the main actor seems to be doubled, which is also very distracting. I can not really see what they were trying to achieve when everything was becoming a weak movie.
