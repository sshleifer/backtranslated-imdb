"A lot of the movies I made would probably have worked as well 50 years ago, and that's just because I have a lot of old-fashioned values." - Steven Spielberg <br /> <br /> Some points .. <br /> <br /> 1. Although this film is a remake of "A guy named Joe", he also borrows a lot from "A question of life or death "and to" Wings of Desire ". <br /> <br /> 2. It was the second time that Spielberg was Frank Capra. <br /> <br /> 3. Spielberg often said that he wanted to make a "Frank Capra movie" in the vein of "It's a wonderful life" and "Mrs. Smith is going to Washington". Judging by his recent attempts to get a remake "Harvey", it seems that Spielberg still keeps this dream, the director rightly not satisfied with his last three adventures in Capracorn. <br /> <br /> 4. Critics at the time criticized "Always", claiming that the elaborate action sequences distracted from the romance of the film, but that it was not the problem at all. The problem is that "Always" requires a lot more special effects to distract us from the fact that Spielberg can not shoot any line of dialogue that does not end with an exclamation point. <br /> <br /> 5. The movie is filled with comedy that just does not work. Spielberg's comical tastes are not very sophisticated and seem to have been torn from 1950's bullets and Looney Tune cartoons. These exaggerated antics can work in a world of cartoons, but in a movie, it sounds like a strange wedding. <br /> <br /> 6. The main couple of the film is like a brother and a sister, not like lovers. Spielberg's films have always feared sex and intimacy, but this film goes a long way: she is a tomboy and an old man unleashed. They are more irritating than seductive. <br /> <br /> 7. The film contains a good scene, in which John Goodman argues with Holly Hunter, but for the most part, the characters in the movie are too annoying. There is no subtlety, every emotion is over-played, every joke is designed, every sequence is filled with useless stuff. <br /> <br /> 8. "Always" and "Hook" taught Spielberg how to conquer an audience. After their failure (and the two financial failures of "The Color Purple" and "Empire of the Sun"), Spielberg abandoned the delirious color cinematography of "Color Purple" and "Empire of the Sun" in favor of the most desaturated "black and "White Worlds of" Schindler's List "," Munich "," Minority Report "and" Save Private Ryan ". From there, "less light" and "dark cinematography" are assimilated to "serious subjects". <br /> <br /> 9. After the financial success of each "dark movie", Spielberg returns to his color cinematography and falls flat on his stomach again. "Amistad" followed "Schindler's List", "AI" followed "Ryan" and "Lincoln" will follow "Munich". These "color" movies are still being criticized for being too sticky, sentimental, cheesy and hokey, but the truth is, if you remove the desaturation, all those "serious" movies would have the same feeling. <br /> <br /> ten. Since the 1970s, Spielberg has tried to differentiate himself from other pack directors (Scorsese, De Palma, Coppola, etc.) by posing as an "optimist" and a "humanist". He himself stated this several times in many interviews in the late 70s. The reality, however, is that he is probably the greatest sadist of all these filmmakers, the very form of his films often undermining their content, their box office performance always proportionate to their dazzling carnage demonstrations. <br /> <br /> 11. The inability of Spielberg to connect with any of the characters in "Always", and the taste he shows, instead of filming forest fires, planes breaking, etc., perfectly encapsulates the rest of his filmography. People who run in front of dinosaurs, sharks, nazis, tripods, rocks, etc., are what Spielberg likes. As soon as his characters stop talking, everything is self-destructing. In other words, a film like "Amistad" failed because too few blacks died and too many whites spoke. <br /> <br /> 12. The film's flight scenes are not up to the standard established several years earlier in the mega hit "Top Gun". Of course, when your "enemy" is a forest fire, it's hard to make things cinematic. <br /> <br /> 13. Chess such as "1941", "Hook", "Always", etc. are often more enlightening than Spielberg's most successful films. They reveal the steel skeleton under the technique. They show what the amusement ride looks like when it does not work and reveal the void under the broken machines. <br /> <br /> 5/10 ?? There is a good sequence here (two actors in a piece, improvising simply), but it is mostly a boring picture with a predictable scenario. <br /> <br /> Worth a visualization.
