The film begins with a parody of Spiderman, which is your introduction to Rick Riker (played by Drake Bell of the celebrity "Drake & Josh", personally, I would have given the film to Josh who is much more funny) and the joke "Rick Punchers "is raised right out of the plane, the authors were already trying to find ideas for this film. Rick's class is on a scientific trip to the Amalgamated Genetics lab. It is here that we meet the name of the star of the film, Brent Spiner (Dr. Star in the TNG), interpreted by Dr. Strom. Rick is bitten by a genetically modified dragonfly from where his powers come from. <br /> <br /> We meet our next big names at Rick's house, his aunt Lucille (Marion Ross of Happy Days celebrity) and his uncle Albert (Leslie Nielson (plane, police squad and famous naked gun). we are introduced to Carlson on the merged board of directors (Dan Castellaneta of The Simpsons), who is then killed very quickly.We are told that Rick slept for 5 days and that he has cheap, rotten, sexually oriented scenes , designed to catch the attention of the male adolescent audience.The scene of Stephen Hawking's look-alike is painful to watch and is really a bad idea that does not work and that is not funny. <br /> <br /> We let's get another parody of Spiderman (Rick catching the girl and all the planets) but the movie should end where Jill was hit in the head by a bowling ball that broke her skull and killed the stone. the first powers of Ri ck emerge (ability and speed of grip), then his first rescue that goes very badly. We also have a reference to incest which is very bad taste. We have a flashback and a parody of Batman in which we discover that Rick is solely responsible for the death of his parents. Spiderman spoofing again Uncle Ricks is shot with Jeffrey Tambor (of Hellboy) playing the hospital doctor. Then we get an X-Men parody (very badly seen that Patrick Stewart is about as white as they come), Barry Bonds is played by another look-alike. <br /> <br /> We meet Invisible Girl (played by Pamela Anderson superb in her costume!). Ricks 1st outing in his suit (once he has solved his ability to see and breathe through it) is another parody of Batman. The clip of Tom Cruise's interview on Youtube is played by another look-alike (and not very good at that). There are many modern references such as Youtube, Facebook and Wikipedia, all of which show that the film is set in modernity. There's a very weak gay joke (it's never a good idea to do it) when Jill helps her Aunt Lucille prepare Thanksgiving dinner and the pissing scene is not very funny, but she is infantile. <br /> <br /> is not particularly funny, but incredibly childish. Someone who finds it funny must have a mental age of about 12 years old. She was killed and we have a very bad necrophilia joke (is there any subject that these people will not try to use to get a cheap laugh?) At her funeral, and the worst cremation joke. <br /> <br /> We receive the 2 worst look-alikes of the entire movie (Prince Charles and Nelson Mandela) at the awards ceremony and if you did not already know how stupid or stupid the child is the film is Landers wins the "Douchebag of the Year" award. Landers is revealed as The Hourglass (in a very bad scene where the same girl manages to pass twice in front of Jill in the same direction). <br /> <br /> Obviously, Hourglass is foiled, Jill is saved from certain death and the only fun scene in the entire movie is the last one.
