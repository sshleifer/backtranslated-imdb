I own this movie. And it's terribly hard to find. This is a small gore film, one of a kind, about a doctor looking for the perfect companion. It has the really humorous sense of low budget, and the gore is surprisingly good for what appears to be a $ 500 budget. The director is supposed to be the master of the gore. I would not go that far, but maybe it was his time. In total 6/10 on the gore chart.
