I do not hate Cary Grant, but I found his performances boring in enough movies to notice him. this, arsenic and old lace and raise baby. I do not hate it in North by Northwest, but I really find this movie incredibly ridiculous. On top of that, I find it annoying to talk endlessly about Grant's class. I have no idea what his class does for the viewers who advertise it. It does not do anything for me. <br /> <br /> In the background editing function provided with this DVD, Patrcia Hitchcock says that Grant was his father's favorite man; I think he was wrong. Jimmy Stewart was a better lead actor in a series of best Hitchcock films. <br /> <br /> With its ruined end, it's really a half-film and does not support discussion, and does not support the high ratings it receives. Even if the film had an end intact, there was not much to do. Fountain is a sucker completely unfriendly. She must remain numb, inactive and not wanting to contact anyone other than Johnny for the entire movie, no matter how late, for her schemes to work. It's not a lot to work with. Cary Grant starts each line with "Monkeyface ..." until I want to strangle him. He says it about sixty times. It's rewarding. Hitch's technique is incredibly superficial here. An endless succession of rooms / sets has a tin canopy projected onto the back wall as a spiderweb effect. And a light bulb in a glass of milk can excite fans, but she can not save a movie of this quality. <br /> <br /> Peter Bogdanovich should retire if he makes a new imitation of Hitchcock / Cary Grant a DVD. I think it's his entire career now. As soon as I saw him, I thought, oh shit, here's an imitation that only impressed him. Instead, there were two! Oh joy!
