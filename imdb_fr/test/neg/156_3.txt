"The Tempest" by Jack Bender is an adaptation of Shakespeare's play "The Tempest". Bender carries the plot of medieval Italy to Mississippi during the American Civil War. It includes the problem of slavery and the role of revenge in times of war. <br /> <br /> Prospero, renamed Gideon Prosper, is not the Duke of Milan, but a landowner in Mississippi. He learns voodoo magic from maid Mambo Azaleigh. He saves his son Ariel, who accompanies him thus in his exile. The island is not located on the sea, but in a swamp near the banks of the Mississippi. There is an alligator hunter, a so-called "Gator-man", who later tries to rape Prospero's daughter, Miranda. During the civil war Ariel wants to join the Union troops to help fight slavery. Prospero does not care about the war. He is only interested in his personal revenge on his brother Antony. When Antony and his accountant Willi Gonzo (Gonzalo) try to cross the river, Prospero sets off a storm. The soldier of the Union, Frederic, gets lost in the swamp and finally arrives on the island. Miranda and he fall in love with each other but Prospero does not accept that. Meanwhile, Ariel, turned into a raven by Prospero, discovers that Antony has pretended to join the Union but plans to betray them. Antony and Gonzo meet Gator Man in the swamp and conspire with him against Prospero. They kidnap Miranda and Ariel but Prospero freezes them and helps the Union to defeat the Southern Army. In the end, Ariel is free, Frederick and Miranda must get married, Prospero returns to the plantation and Gator Man recovers the island. <br /> <br /> Peter Fonda represents Gideon Prosper in a powerful and convincing way during the stay of Antony's rather flat character. It was not a bad idea to play the Tempest before the background of the Civil War, but the director may have been too risky. In some parts, the story seems constructed or comic. Gator Man, for example, simply appears without any explanation. The fact that he needs an abduction to bring Prospero back into his mind and that he loses confidence in his power shows that Bender tried to make him more human, but only made him a weak old man. without magic. The original authority and wisdom of Prospero are not clarified. <br /> <br /> ------------- End of part 1 --------------- --------- ----
