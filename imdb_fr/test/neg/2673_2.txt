This film is very bad. In fact, the only reason I gave him a 2 instead of a 1 was because it made me laugh. Without revealing anything, a man's head explodes in this film. It was so pathetic, I laughed. I do not think the scene was supposed to be funny, but it's nonsense. Complete nonsense. The original Halloween is such a good movie, it's a shame they had to do such a job.
