"You're in the Navy now" is terribly bad: most likely Gary Cooper's worst film. It's supposed to be based on a true story, but the incident that inspired this film does not seem to have enough intrigue to support a feature film. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie on local television while I was at home -sitting for my mother-in-law on Long Island, New York. There was a big snowstorm outside and I was literally snow-covered. If I had been able to go out, I would have definitely stopped watching this movie. <br /> <br /> There are interesting names in secondary distribution, including Charles Bronson (under his original name), Lee Marvin, Harvey Lembeck, Jack Webb and Jack Warden. Forget it. Everyone stinks in this movie. Even the very reliable Millard Mitchell is awful. Lee Marvin and Jack Warden are on screen so briefly that you are not watching them anymore. <br /> <br /> Gary Cooper plays the role of an obscure naval officer commanding a ship propelled by a new experimental machine. turbine: basically, the whole ship is a giant tea kettle. Cooper realizes that the mission is not a prestigious mission. If she were, she would have been entrusted to a better officer. <br /> <br /> Cooper was a good actor in dramatic roles, but he simply did not have the ability to play comedy. He made several bad comedies, and this one is the worst. Jane Greer has always bothered me and she bores me more than usual here. This ship fell to the ground and sank without a trace. Did I mention that this movie stinks? I'll note "You're in the Navy now," a point out of 10. Too! Whistle!
