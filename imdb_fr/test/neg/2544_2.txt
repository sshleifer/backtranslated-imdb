This disaster film is a remake of a film of the same title dating back to 1973 and based on a novel by Sakyo Komatsu. Japan is located right next to the Pacific Fire Belt (active volcanoes) and also on the edge of plate tectonics, the displacement of which will cause earthquakes and tsunamis (a Japanese word for tide). Naturally, this is a natural premise for a disaster picture, as in Hollywood with a movie day with films like Armageddon, Deep Impact and more recently, The Day After Tomorrow, which looks at how global warming becomes the catalyst for natural disasters that rage the world. <br /> <br /> But I must say this: The sinking of Japan makes all the films mentioned above look like classics. This disaster movie is a huge disaster. Watching my watch every 10-15 minutes is a sign that the film does not engage and gives the impression that it has not exceeded its execution time. <br /> <br /> The special effects are beautiful to watch. Spatial satellite-style images with vivid reconstructions of every conceivable natural disaster that can hit the land of the rising sun, the effects are the star of the show. However, the spectacular computer-generated graphics do not make a movie acceptable, but too boring. <br /> <br /> If you had seen the trailer where you are attracted by the effects and specific scenes of chaos and chaos, then yes, in fact, these scenes are just that. There are no details and everything is seen from a distance, in the manner of God. Things are happening like that on the screen, and the point is not to try to go deeper into the issue to look more closely at the problems. It's as if Godzilla were knocking down buildings, and it's as if there were no human beings or loss of life by this simple act. As morbid as it may seem, show us the victims! A country as populous as Japan suffers not only disaster after disaster with an extremely low mortality rate, not when filmmakers unleash chaos on such an epic scale. <br /> <br /> Trying to weave romance into the film, he stood out like a sore thumb. There are a lot of characters in the film, but each one lacks real characteristics, or humanity, and looks like wandering zombies, without expression, without emotion, and really very stiff and unconvincing. Heroes are stuck in generic control rooms issuing statements, instructions and form rules, and react to incidents as if it were a computer game, all set by pressing a button. button. <br /> <br /> If I can just use The Day After Tomorrow as a comparison, although there are fantastic effects, there is at least one attempt to provide a microscopic picture. view of the whole disaster from the point of view of different individuals. Many action sequences are also infused, large sequences like the disasters themselves and small sequences focused on the triumph of the human mind, which makes it relatively compelling. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately for The Sinking of Japan, this film should preferably be the lowest flowing and hopefully suffer a brief and quick death at the local box office to make room for better things.
