This totally disappointing film is so outlandish, pathetic and unrealistic that in the 90 minutes of total torture, I probably watched my watch about 70,000 times! Lucy Bell is so much higher than this shit and for her, driving this depression is pretty depressing. I have to admit that the whole audience I was in was laughing hysterically, but the majority was Greek or Italian, so I guess that humor will probably make them laugh but not me. This movie only makes you sick by watching all those idlers apologize for their stupid actions for 90 minutes. My God, and I will never be able to recover those 90 minutes!
