First of all, I must say that I loved Winnie the Pooh when I was a kid and that I really liked the Tigger movie, even though I was in my twenties. <br /> <br /> But this movie was so terrible that I was ashamed of I was a fan in my youth. <br /> <br /> OK, OK, I know it's a children's movie and it's not for people like me, but those are my thoughts on the movie for other people of my <br /> <br /> The main fall of this film is the heffalump itself, it must be the most boring character I've seen in a children's movie (maybe even more annoying as the young child of Monsters Inc.). He has the most annoying voice and screams around singing nonsense and making even more stupid comments. I know that Teddy's movies are not really up to scratch, but it was even insulting to the intelligence of a 2-year-old! <br /> <br /> - Where was the story? Winnie the Pooh's previous releases had at least one meaning in the story - yes, I saw that it was accepting people who are different from you in your heart - but it's really over and I felt like I had watched a 5-minute cartoon on children's television. <br /> <br /> I do not have any children to me but I intend to show them quality movies for kids like The Tigger Movie, Toy Story and Finding Nemo (although they are too much childish for me these days I can see how they would be very attractive to young children). This is not the case with this appalling movie attempt. <br /> <br /> Oh and one last thing: do not worry, Eeyore! He should have his own movie!
