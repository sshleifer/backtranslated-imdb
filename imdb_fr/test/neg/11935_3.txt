I guess I should now comment on a fourth film from the MAGNIFICENT SEVEN franchise; The sequences surprise or surprise me still by their deliberate and deliberate absurdism. They constitute or form a 4th way - not classical, not revisionist, not European - but a sleaze americana, close to the films of the 70's violent militant group, absurd garbage. This episode is also sumptuous, inexplicably awkward and even somewhat strange. <br /> <br /> Now, what worries me is that these suites do not only have their opportunistic fans; but that fans simply do not feel any difference between the style of the original and that of the suites. <br /> <br /> These suites are neither boring nor tasteless, but weird. They are of course very poorly written, with complicated scripts, worthless lines. This is completely crazy. in this slice each shooter gets several women ?? Van Cleef's young wife begs him to release a young prisoner; he finally does. The young man takes his life again, shoots Van Cleef, kidnaps his wife, rapes her and kills her, then joins a criminal. Van Cleef, who had previously refused to help defend a village, now gathers a small group and lodges a complaint against the criminal's hacienda; then the criminals accuse the village where Van Cleef is established. <br /> <br /> I liked the cast. <br /> <br /> Van Cleef is Chris; Stefanie Powers, very active in the senseless Westerns of the 70s, is the darling of Van Cleef. Callan, very unlikable, is Noah, a writer and Chris's mate. The other members of the aggressive group are Askew (one of only three survivors), Armendariz, Lucking, Lauter; Rita Rogers is really hot, fleshy beauty.
