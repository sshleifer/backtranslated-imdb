Joan Crawford is disfigured convincingly at the beginning of our story and, of course, she is getting ready. But she is a bad egg, exploiting one guy while living the anti-social philosophy of another type. All of this is happening in Sweden, which is really weird. This causes all that is memorable in the visual elements, which are no longer obliged to describe Anytown USA, but the viewer wonders why each redesign is weighed down and made nonspecific by the need to Americanize everything. There is a conspiracy, a conspiracy, a plot so complicated that you could drown in it, and make things worse is a framing device that adds zilch to the movie. Photography is sometimes enjoyable, with odd angles and well-integrated miniatures. But it's overworked without ever attracting you.
