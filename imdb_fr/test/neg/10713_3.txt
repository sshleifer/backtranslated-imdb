For three quarters of an hour, the story develops gradually to become a pivot. Although the film is overloaded with scenes that simply seem to be intended to annoy the viewer and draw him out of the plot, something happens. It's not a lot and it's certainly not easy. The combination of palace impressions and narrative scenes does not add depth or insight to all the characters. In fact, they keep them sterile because there is no development of character. Everyone remains whirling and centered around their own cliché and their own role - the pretty stubborn girl; the fighting woman, the snobbish aristocrat. The main male character does not seem to have any distinction at all, he has a superficial presence, which does not even matter, because he is present only because the storyboard imposed it - it would have been said that he was on vacation and got caught up. When it comes time to turn the page, the film is completely white for two minutes before becoming ridiculous. He resolves - or better, dissolves - with a book of Deus Ex Machina, more clichés and some of the most rudimentary plots and choices I have ever seen. That's the story, okay. The film is first and foremost a drama that is supposed to be comic, then it becomes a joke. The protagonists do what they are supposed to do and there are no surprises. The first series of serious antagonists, however, is replaced by a couple who was literally bored. It may have been a kind of nod to the public. <br /> <br /> This film gets no bonus from me for its underlying philosophical meaning (because there is none), nor for its technical realization. Animation and editing are equitable, as is sound mixing; but this is by no means exceptional or even superior to the average Japanese productions of the late 1980s. In fact, visual treats seem static, uninspired and unoriginal. <br /> <br /> Worst of all, it's totally lacking entertainment, even if you do not bother with characters and everything else. There is too little here, and the rest is cheesy at best. Get yourself a real Ghibli, enjoy and keep your fingers out.
