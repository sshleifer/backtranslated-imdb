Bill Rebane's "Bigfoot Capture" is one of the most horrendous horror films ever made. The owner of an avid sawmill, Harvey Olsen (Richard Kennedy) decides that he wants Bigfoot to be captured at all costs. However, local game warden Dave Garrett (Stafford Morgan) learns that the Bigfoot lives in peace, turned upside down by a geological expedition and strives to protect the creature. There is nothing interesting about this piece of shit. movie is extremely dull and is full of horrible songs and cheap special effects. No gore, no suspense, just a gigantic boredom. Avoid this horrible junk like the plague.
