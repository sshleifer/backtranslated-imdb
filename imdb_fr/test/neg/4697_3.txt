I just came back from "Comedian". It was good. This prevented me from watching the screen. It's just not the kind of thing I like to pay, to pay $ 7. <br /> <br /> Now, do not get me wrong, it would be a great HBO feature. If it was something I was watching on TV, I would be hooked directly. This gives an amazing look at what comics go through before and after going on stage. This will interest anyone who likes to watch comics. <br /> <br /> But when I go to the cinema, I like to be entertained. I am not here to be educated. Now I know what it's like to Jerry Seinfeld before he goes on stage ... awesome. But frankly, I'd rather laugh at his jokes than worry about it. <br /> <br /> One last thing: with the bad attitude of Onry Adams; I would expect to see him take my order from Burger King before seeing his special HBO show. He was not funny. He is the kind of person you like to hate.
