The film "KillShot" has many different problems. On the one hand, there are far too many coincidences. The husband is a hunter and is on the hunt the day the main killer shows up, with someone the killer knows. Ok I'll take that one. The child calls the real estate agency for which the woman works and asks for money to be ready when he picks it up. Ok, I'll take that one too. Before going to get the money, he decided to steal our killer, who does not kill him but decided to accompany him to work. It's starting to get really weak. Then they show up the same day the husband has an interview with his wife's boss. There is no one but the woman and the husband who decided to go to the empty office. They go to the office and the professional murderer simply assumes they are talking to the good guy. It's only in the first 15 minutes. <br /> <br /> There are many more holes in this film that I want to talk about. Why the killer did not just kill everyone at the real estate agency, I do not know. Why he did not shoot the woman under her porch, I do not know. Why did he keep letting this stupid kid make all those silly moves and mess around, I do not know. Why the girlfriend was even in the movie, I do not know. Why he decided not to put away the rifle and leave it on the counter, I do not know. Why did they even participate in the witness protection program, I do not know. What I do know is that the director of distribution did a great job, that the cinematographer did a great job, that Location Scout chose good places and that the designer of the production was worth it. I therefore advise anyone who chooses a scenario that will be so well worked by the crew to ensure that every attempt to kill someone by the killer is not thwarted by a ridge through an open window.
