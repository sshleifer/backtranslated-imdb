Vs Edge Michaels-Boring in general (liked the soft chin music in the chair) 4/10 Taker Vs. Heidenreich - One of the worst games I've seen, predictable to believe a match on 1/3 against the WWE - Why do I look at them, no one ever wins a rumbling championship, this is not the main event. It pleased when Show drove JBL through the wall. World Heavyweight Championship - A nice OK match, a little more beaten by Tripe H than a match, but I was happy to see him after seeing shit. 5/10 Royal Rumble-Good Rumble, I liked the confrontation with the brand, the trick Hassan and the end. 7/10 Overall still shit. Why is someone watching the roar ???
