No movie I've seen before has been as boring and silly as this piece of junk. And I have always been a big fan of B-movie. After watching this total crap, I can honestly say that it's not even close to a B movie. <br /> <br /> Nobody in this movie could act if his life depended on it. The scenario is so stupid that I have never heard anyone talk so about my life. The writer should spend a few years studying the real life of real people to see how they act and talk, even in this case they would not be able to make an exciting movie because it is so obvious that none of the actors of this film is able to direct the talents. them at all. <br /> <br /> I could make a better movie with a digital camera and monster toys. In addition, forget all the sexy scenes, the women in the leather outfits are so grotesque that you prefer to vomit than to get angry! <br /> <br /> Avoid this useless idyll unless you want to get bored!
