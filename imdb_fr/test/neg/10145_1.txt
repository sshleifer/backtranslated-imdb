It would be easy and accurate to say why Reba is in his heart revealing many "family-oriented sitcoms" to the extent that he's tearing himself away from other better sitcoms, but the truth is that the series is repetitive, full of stereotypes of more funny and more revolutionary shows, and the main star is completely out of his element. Although I'm sure Ms. McIntire knows how to sing and has a fan base that supports her, being in a sitcom tracing zingers and calling her the next Lucille Ball is far from reality. <br /> <br /> Reba herself has no presence here to establish the fact that she is referred to as the perverse woman on which her whole family is centered. Yet after watching a few episodes, there is no real connection to the character. I do not care about his adventures because his whole character seems to be MIA. Reba McIntire has no presence on the screen and doing a show around her seems to be a very revealing short-term vision of most "family-oriented" shows: creating a sitcom full of silly-male stereotypes / women-women who do not please anyone. but those who can not afford the cable. <br /> <br /> The show is a waste of time. The only good thing is that it has at least better production values ​​than your standard PAX scam ....
