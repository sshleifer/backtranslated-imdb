This film almost gave me a nervous breakdown. When I was recovering from appendicitis a few years ago, I had just taught in high school. The entire teaching profession was a little scary for a beginner, but to mentally prepare for my return to class, I decided to watch some pretty awful movies. The Flintstones was one of the movies I chose, then I shot "King Of The Streets" (the British title of "Alien Warrior"). Just before I finished, I found myself almost in tears at the total mess ... my life, the stock of movies, the Â£ 2 I paid for two weeks ago in the Blockbuster rental section, had to take to print the wallet, the efforts of the editors and musicians involved in the soundtrack (as negligible as their efforts have been) ... the list goes on. <br /> <br /> I like bad movies. Let me clarify this perfectly - I LOVE watching blockbusters shit movies. Me and my companion, Dan, used to sit and watch a lot, a lot of cheap horrors and make fun of them. But it was a different kind of movie. I do not think anything has come close to that, not even Tobe Hooper's "death trap" (which is probably my second worst film in the world). Making a car from a section of abandoned parts almost killed me; Repetition of music on any available occasion, regardless of the events on the screen all .... AAAGGHHHHHHH !!!!! I can not even continue with this "critical" dissection, my nauseated reflex started. The futility of this film, even now, three years after watching it for the first and last time, still makes me speechless (but I'm still able to type). The whole section "making a car from odd parts" had made me look at horrible things. <br /> <br /> I beg you, if you're interested in this movie, watch the cover of the video and imagine the worst. possible version of the summary of the story on the back. I can almost guarantee that it will not even be half as bad as this movie is actually. In any case, do not consider watching it for any reason. Not if you are a Christian and you want to see an allegory of Christ. not if you are a bad movie lover and you want to experience the real nadir of the trash; not even if you want your life to look longer (and believe me, every second this movie is going to look like at least a minute). Make no mistake, this movie is impious. This is the antichrist in video form. As Bo Cattlett said in Get Shorty: "I've seen better films on the teeth".
