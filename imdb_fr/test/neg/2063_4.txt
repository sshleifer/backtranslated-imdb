There are those who think that it is NOT opera, but they do not criticize either the CABARET film, which was not the original show either. All movies of musicals / operas are and must be "adaptations" or they do not work. With the original show, CABARET has taken more liberties than the PORGY AND BESS film, but it has retained its original integrity, reworking the material, and is considered an artistic success. The same goes for PORGY AND BESS, who turned opera into a dialogues / songs libretto, because the audience at the time loved musicals but stayed away from the few film operas. It would have been an economic suicide for Preminger to produce an opera film - that would have lost a fortune for Goldwyn Studios. <br /> <br /> That said, it's a nice adaptation. The acting is excellent, the performance of Oscar-winning Andr√© Previn is magnificent, as is the choral singing, and the individual vocal performances are incredible. Robert McFerrin (father of popular musician Bobby McFerrin) nicknamed Porgy and Adele Addison nicknamed Bess. While Sammy Davis Jr. was singing his own songs in the film, his recording contract did not allow him to make his voice heard on the album, so Cab Calloway recorded his numbers (dramatically) for that release. The bass / baritone of Brock Peters is extraordinary and Pearl Bailey is one of a kind. Diahan Carroll, although a quality singer, has the small role of Clara who required a great soprano, so old and reliable that Marni Nixon nicknamed her song. <br /> <br /> The Gershwin estate hates the movie and refuses to give it. musical rights, although dramatic rights are in the public domain. This kind of hate quarrel blocked CAROUSEL's video output for almost fifteen years (although in this case, it was the dramatic rights that were in dispute) and it currently prevents both PORGY AND BESS video streaming. and ANNIE GET YOUR GUN. <br /> <br /> Of all the scenic productions given to the cinematographic versions, it is these last two which constitute the only support of the video. Only a letter campaign at Gershwin Estate in New York could ease the reserve.
