I realize that a vintage piece is expensive to manufacture and that this type of shooting (shots framed close to the camera, moving camera, wide-angle shooting, blurred) can achieve such films at a great price. As a style, it has advantages and disadvantages like any other, it allows to create more pieces of time. Like any style, it has its detractors and supporters - there are probably even some who believe that this way of spinning has an artistic basis. <br /> <br /> If only a part of the money saved could have been spent on the script, whatever the style used, a film needs good writing and a good interpretation. <br /> <br /> The realization in this film is generally very good. Writing less. It is composed of a collection of bits extracted from the book. Much of what is relevant to the plot is left aside, making it a rambling collection of scenes with little or no continuity. <br /> <br /> If you have read the book, do not supervise it under any circumstances. If you have not read the book, if you are happy and if you have nothing better to do, there is no harm in watching it, but get ready to be disappointed. <br /> <br /> It could have been a lot better.
