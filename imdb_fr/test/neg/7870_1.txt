This film is nil. The acting is worse than in the movies we did when we were 10 years old with a camcorder, the effects looked like an 80s video game and the plot is worse than terrible. Even Van Damme's worst movies make this look shabby. The accent and vocal rhythm of the "bad guys" are so bad that it's funny .. <br /> <br /> I would not recommend looking at this unless you're a big fan of the actors. 1 out of 10
