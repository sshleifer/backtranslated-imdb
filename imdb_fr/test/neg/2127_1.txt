Yikes. <br /> <br /> I saw a lot of bad movies in my day, many of them in the company of Mike, Tom, Crow and the others of MST3k. This is the case of this one too and even though I found the movie quite funny in itself, it would not have been as much fun without the MST3k commentary. <br /> <br /> The film is an excellent example of really bad movies coming out of Europe in the eighties. A horrible music, a dreadful acting, a horrible plot (the little bit there is), a horrible dialogue and really, really, REALLY horrible editing. Cripes. <br /> <br /> We could call it a turkey if there was not the fact that it is not unique at all. It's about the same kind of film that almost every Italian filmmaker has written. <br /> <br /> Try to get the MST3k version. It's a pretty funny episode with Mike and his gang in pretty good shape.
