When I voted my "1" for this film, I noticed that 75 people voted the same way out of a total of 146 votes. That means that half of the people who voted for this film think it's really terrible. I saw that not so long ago at a film festival and I'm really impressed by its poor performance. Cinematography is unassailable, the sound is bad, the story is cut and pasted from many other movies, and the acting is awful. This film is basically a poor scam of three other movies. No wonder that was never published in the United States.
