What was it, a film of the Zucker brothers? I do not fear a bit of humor in my Holmes (I'm a big fan of Billy Wilder's "SH Privacy"), but this version of "The Sign of the Four" looks like an episode of Grand Guignol " Murder, She Wrote "(from the opening credits, the worst kind possible: a montage of scenes from the film) directed by Mel Brooks. Ian Richardson is a good actor, and he certainly seems to play the role (he is a deadly performer for these drawings of The Strand!), But his interpretation of the character is completely false and too humorous, given the silly smile that he frequently wears the drug that Holmes used was cocaine and not weed) to his expressions of comic rigidity in the carnival sequences. Not to mention that when he disguises himself as an old man, he is so eccentric that despite the beautiful make-up, we instantly recognize him. David Healy is an unchanging memory but, given the circumstances, acceptable to Watson, he is not too foolish ... at least not more than the rest of the characters. Cherie Lunghi (Excalibur) embodies Mary Morstan in an exaggerated style straight out of a vaudeville of the 1930s. <br /> <br /> In terms of history, there are unnecessary additions (like giving vampire teeth in Tonga, an appetite for raw meat and a carnival pit as a place of life, turning it into a rejection of Island of Dr. Moreau), and we are even denied the pleasure of discovering the mystery alongside Holmes, because we are well informed about everything before Holmes discovers it. And this is full of tired clich√©s: not only do we have the slogan "Elementary, my dear Watson" (which every Sherlockian will know, Conan Doyle never wrote), but we are exposed to common places as blatant as Hindi music come out of nowhere when Holmes goes to see a white man dressed in Hindi clothing. <br /> <br /> Result: In Great Britain, in the eighties, two rival television channels attempted to create a long series of adaptations of Sherlock Holmes. and produces first televised films as potential pilots. One of them played Ian Richardson, the other Jeremy Brett. Fortunately, the one who went through several episodes was the good one! <br /> <br /> 3/10. Misrepresenting.
