The film "A very long commitment" relentless and fanciful Jean-Pierre Jeunet has a facelift in the First World War. Jeunet's branding style consists of a mechanical narrative construction, almost like a clock, filled with sumptuous values ​​of chocolate box production and seasoned with dummy humor. It is an approach that worked well with her previous photo, the romantic fantasy "Amelie", largely thanks to the inimitable contribution of Audrey Tatou in the lead role. Applied to a much darker material, the method of Jeunet turns rather badly. <br /> <br /> Tatou appears here again in a variant of the same kind of slightly shifted character of Amelie. This is Mathilde, an orphan who lives quietly with his aunt and uncle in an idyllic rural setting, determined to trace what happened to his beloved child Manech (Gaspard Ulliel), several years after his disappearance in the war . Manech was one of five court martial soldiers who mutilated himself in 1917 at "Bingo Crepuscule". He was sent to the summit of no man's land as a punishment. He is presumed dead by all except Mathilde who keeps hoping to find him. The film follows Mathilde's relentless quest to find out what really happened and, as she explores her, she discovers a sad, even shocking, story of corruption and high-ranking inhumanity. Mathilde has to filter the facts from fiction from various contradictory, superimposed or incomplete accounts of what seems to be the last hours of Manech. <br /> <br /> All this should be poignant and captivating, but most often, it's confusing. the visual and verbal clutter with which Jeunet hits his audience. There are just too many activities at once, including intrusive narration that adds nothing to our appreciation of the story and characters. Without a moment's respite from the overload of information, I felt deprived of the space necessary to reflect on Mathilde's quest or the possibility of treating it on my own terms. The ever-busy camera of Jeunet spirals and circles, caressing all the surface contours of her exquisitely designed production, but she does not singularly penetrate the soul under the skin of history. The result is deeply uninvolved, and worse, grotesque. The First World War was a particularly dark time in the history of mankind. Imagine it being recreated as one of those picturesque commercials for a well-known Belgian beer, and you have the measure of this movie.
