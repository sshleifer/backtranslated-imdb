Blake Edwards has tried to change the image of Julie Andrews in this film. He tried to make her sexy without realizing that she already was. I think they were still a little upset that Julie was not chosen to film Camelot's success on Broadway and was not considered sexy enough. Unfortunately, they chose this vehicle to try to dispel this belief. It's almost funny to see Rock Hudson, who we all know is gay, kissing Julie every other minute throughout this movie. It seems now that they were trying not only to make you think that Julie was a femme fatale, but that Rock was straight. Unfortunately, they have absolutely no chemistry together and endless kissing scenes start to swell one. The other mistake they made with this picture is not knowing what kind of movie they were doing. It's almost three separate movies. There is Julie's drama as a German spy trying to get Rock's military secrets. There is a film about the air war with many images of WW1 era planes and stupid attempts at humor that Blake Edwards seems to think he has to insert into each of his images, whether it's appropriate or not, In this case, It was not. The only truly redeemed qualities of this film are the observation of the always charming Lady Julie and her hearing in a soprano with clear and crystalline colors. Of course, if you like it, you can forget the weaknesses of this movie just because of it. You can always tell you, afterwards, that it was much better than missing out on STAR!
