You know I only watched 15 minutes of this movie, so I can not really say how awesome it is. I mean that the concept alone is so original and intriguing that it did not let me go. Then there is the mass of academically honored people involved here as well as the director nominated by the Academy Award. You can not miss. I mean, imagine that we are in the middle of the night and you are not yet sleepy. This film comes. You look and are shocked. It's so great, so original and so great. You will have the impression that half an hour later, you turn off the screen, but when you go to bed, you will see that there are only 15 minutes left after midnight. ENJOY! <br /> <br /> 3 of 10
