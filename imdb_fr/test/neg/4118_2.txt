What a waste of great acting talent. It's a shame because with Catherine Deneuve, Mathieu Amalric, Emmanuelle Devos, Chiara Mastroianni and Melvil Poupaud (not to mention other less known in America), there is a lot of talent for acting. This film by Arnaud Desplech was a terrible disappointment. After enjoying his "Kings and Queens" and this movie, I got bored and frustrated to the point where I left before the movie ended. The film has wandered around its central scenario (involving Catherine Deneuve's illness) by being hijacked by each peripheral scenario and secondary character appearing on the screen. The film also gave us too little character development to understand why the characters hated each other so much (it was a story of family dysfunction), so the lack of coherent narratives became even more critical. Finally, the soundtrack (ranging from hip-hop to Mendelhson, Bach, and Mendelhson's Mendelhson's Night's Dream) contradicted the emotional temperature of the film and further masked any emotion the viewer should have felt at home. the time. Photography (the director often started with a mostly dark screen, where we only saw a small aperture, we felt like we were looking through a peephole, then grew larger) was also pretentious and impenetrable.
