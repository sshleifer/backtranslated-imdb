It's a silly movie with lots of songs and dances. Playing is average, but writing leaves something to be desired. Buddy Epsen presents memorable performances, as well as a brief but exceptional performance by Gypsy Rose as a bitter wife of a rich playboy. A totally incredible portrait of college life that ends with a superb ice-skating exhibition of Alice in Wonderland. Several parts are worth watching, but do not be afraid to move quickly in some parts of the film.
