Get the CD instead. The show is tamed, and the editing is nil. The crowd gets too much time on the screen, just like Till Lindemann. The cameras spend more time on the same child shaking their head in the same way (which makes me think it's exactly the same plan) than during Richard Kruspe's solo at Weisses Fleisch. The scenes change so quickly that it is impossible to tell where the camera is directed and the reruns are simply redundant. Not worth the tape on which it is recorded.
