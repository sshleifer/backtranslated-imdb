In the same way that Lamberto Bava was a facsimile of inferior quality to his father, Mario (an extremely overestimated director), Michele Soavi is a director of inferior quality in the mold Dario Argento. "The Church" has at least one thing to recommend - the incredibly detailed art direction - but nothing else. The film is long, full of one-dimensional characters and has almost made me sleep a few times. The line between "art" and "pretentious fool" is thin, and although "the Church" is not completely useless, you'd better look at something else. <br /> <br /> 3/10
