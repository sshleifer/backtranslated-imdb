I just caught this movie on TCM and I can understand why George Murphy is interested in politics if it was the best solution that MGM could serve him. It is so slow that the attempt to make a real black film effort does not succeed. There were two of my favorite <br /> players in Eve Arden (utterly devastated) and Dean Stockwell (the best actor in the movie), but what really struck me is that the great lady Frances Gifford has lived 90 minutes (it seemed longer!) without changing the expression of his face - his fainting scene was comical. John Hodiak did a good job, but the screenplay failed, as did the rest of the cast. I gave him 4 stars mainly because of photography. It was during the first half of the program that the double features were at the rendezvous.
