You know what? Family Guy started as something fresh, funny and original. Random humor used to be funny. In fact, I thought it was the best animated sitcom after The Simpsons. After watching the new episodes that have been aired in recent weeks; I got tired of seeing the show rely too much on random humor to be funny. South Park was right about FG when they mentioned manatees and balls of ideas. <br /> <br /> And watching the show as such, I do not understand why my parents love it so much; there is nothing good about it. The humor "Intellegent" is fun and would have been funnier if the show had not been based on chance.
