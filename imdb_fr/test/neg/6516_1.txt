If you have never read the book and you never intend to read it, check out the movie (6/10). It's a beautiful fantasy movie with a well-made CGI, a nice acting game, a beautiful environment and a fantastic story well above average. <br /> <br /> If you've read the book like me about 10 times or more and you really like it, do not wait too long (or better: do not wait for anything). The story is totally different from the original book. This may explain why the film was voted 1/10 by people 40 years of age or older (like me) and much better by people who probably never read the book before and therefore do not expect anything. <br /> <br /> Most of the differences between film and book are not really necessary and change the setting (in my opinion, at worst): <br /> <br /> - The magic of the book works with rituals for classic magical effects. (Change the time, create illusions, transform into animals, ...) In the film, the magic is more like "a school of medieval jedi" (wooden sticks instead of lightsabers). That the devil looks like Emperor Palpatine (after the third part) does not make it really better. <br /> <br /> - The mill in the book is not totally cut off from the world as in the film. In the book, the story takes place near Dresden, a visit that Krabat once visited with his master and in some neighboring villages on festive occasions. (This part may have been modified to reduce costs.) I also do not understand why, in the film, the mill is located in the hills while the nearby cemetery is located in the high mountains. <br /> <br /> - All that surrounds it is the average route of the fantastic mill of medieval style. A lot of mud everywhere, dirty faces, not an orderly kitchen, only very rough houses. The book never suggested such an environment. <br /> <br /> - In the book, the master tries to make Krabat his successor, but Krabat rejects him. Krabat is between admiration, distance and silent rejection. In the film, Krabat always rejects the master openly as a stubborn schoolboy. <br /> <br /> - The film takes place in 1647 instead of around 1720. It is therefore impossible for the teacher to tell stories of his youth probably around 170x. OK, the stories are missing anyway in the movie. <br /> <br /> In addition, some explanations given in the book would have been useful and would have cost less minutes: <br /> <br /> - In the book any work done during the day requires no effort and the night work is like a normal job. This explanation is missing in the film. Sometimes boys sweat and sometimes they are happy. <br /> <br /> - The book explains why only a few "Gesellen" try to confront the master: if the master dies for some reason, the "Gesellen" are free and keep their magical powers. If the master dies in the confrontation, all will lose their power forever.
