Five Fingers is so bad that I do not know where to start. So let me admit first that I only saw the first half hour. When the first finger had been cut, I thought sleeping was a more useful activity. I explained to my girlfriend the meaning of "five fingers" and she immediately followed my example. <br /> <br /> Could the producer, the director and / or the scriptwriter not consult a chess amateur? Like me? They should have used a digital and non-analog chess clock. This major blunder makes mental pressure put on Martijn just a laugh. How, when and why did Martijn go to a Moroccan girlfriend? Such an affair is very rare in the Netherlands. <br /> <br /> Trying to be late is of course an insult to anyone with a much lower than average IQ. In addition, to my knowledge, latecomers do not play chess. I do. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem is the script of course. Just compare the little movie Smart Hard Candy. To keep the viewer in a grip, the information must be revealed little by little. A nice rotation now and then help too. According to other reviews, I realized that there was a big one at the end of the film. Any intelligent person can guess what it is. Of course, this only raises other questions: why is the travel guide killed? Oh my God, why should I even care? The whole film focuses on one thing: the chopped fingers. The officials have not even learned the lesson from Hitchcock: it is exciting to blow up a bomb. It is more exciting to show this time bomb. But no, we will not see the paper cutter before the end of the countdown is impossible. I will not lose more words on this shit. Go see Hard Candy.
