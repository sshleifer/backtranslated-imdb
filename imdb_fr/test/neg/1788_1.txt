Oh my. Started with such potential - a group of pretty sorority girls walking practically naked, check. Then head to a bar where the cheese of the 80s is up a notch, check. Departure for a forest park the next morning, check. A group of girls and their teacher, bumpy bikers, a guy from the general store, and that "Live Live" dood that acts like a local drunkard - can count a lot of people, check (and talking about people, notice the strong resemblance on the cover DVD of the foreign horror movie - Body Count! (Camping del Terrore) A whacky Indian in the woods doing a ritual, hmmm, okay, I'll let him slip, check. And then, oh brother, all the descent from there, Terrible ... Lochness's monster head in the pond made me crack though.
