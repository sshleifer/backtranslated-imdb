I agree in many ways with the pretty thorough review already published on the subject of miniseries, and I agree that it has its advantages, not just its disadvantages. For example, the original film manages to truncate a large portion of the middle and final sections of the novel into a single montage, including the discovery of Gurney Halleck and the affair of Paul Atreides and Chani, who, reading the novel, is a parody. , probably born of cutting shenanigens studio whose other critic writes. This was one of the great flaws of the original film, and the miniseries, to his credit, includes many of the original intrigues that were cut out of the Lynch film because of the expansive nature of Herbert's novel. <br /> <br /> However, this in itself is a double-edged sword. Rather than completing a transfer of the celluloid text novel, the creators of the miniseries were tempted to create their own intrigues, missing from the original novel. Likewise, although this is undoubtedly a "more complete" account of Dune's plot, it is also a break with the original heart, soul, and vision - that of prophecy. Where are the internal monologues that characterize Herbert's writing and demonstrate what many different characters think, without the need to suddenly change their point of view, or to develop words and spoken idioms that are useless and elevated? Faded away. The original agony of Paul's decision to choose jihad or death, the choice to fulfill the prophecy or to depart from it, is undoubtedly the most interesting aspect of the novel itself (and which captivates people who are far from Science Fiction fans) is missing. <br /> <br /> Without prophecy, what is the purpose of Dune? It is simply a more educated and better learned version of Farscape or Andromeda. How sad that it is all we have. Lynch's movie was defective, yes. But a flawed film could lead to correction by another filmmaker, picking up some of the best points from Lynch's rendering and dismissing some of the most exaggerated aspects of the style while restoring the script. Now this story will probably never be translated into a movie, and I find it heartbreaking.
