Newly released on DVD in the United States; just stay away from there. <br /> <br /> I usually leave a lot of room for stupidity in horror movies; I'm going to settle for almost anything suspensive, supernatural, phantasmagorical, or even just vaguely interesting. This one just stinks. I knew there was a problem when Sara's "best friend" in college, who had plenty of time in front of the screen, was not even featured in the credits on IMDb! I was not surprised to recognize no actor, but this character ("Daysha" or "Day-Glo" or whatever his name) did not even exist! <br /> <br /> I'm so embarrassed that I actually paid rent for this trash; deeply, deeply ashamed ...
