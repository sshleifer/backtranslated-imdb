I'm usually a very generous voter on IMDb and I do not care to comment on movies I did not like, but it was just nil. In fact, I turned it off 15 minutes before ending, to look at "This Is It" (because my friend wanted ... I just chose the lesser of two evils). <br /> <br /> If you want to watch this movie: describe this movie as a collection of "horror" stories that are worse than the average, like "scary stories" you'll find in an issue of "Reader's Digest" "in the waiting room of your dentist. <br /> <br /> I did not expect anything special, nor terrifying, nor funny, I'm not the type "I want to see blood!", but this "film" is neither "Horror" or "Comic" or entertaining It's probably more scary / fun and fun to watch the "You've Got Mail" movie poster for 90 minutes while drinking chamomile tea. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: a "horror comedy" for 4 to 7 year olds.
