It could have been so much better than it turned out. Tom Pittman gives a good performance and some older players do well with what they have to work with, but it just does not work. <br /> <br /> First, the actors are way too old to play high school students, especially Howard Veit (Vince). He looks like about thirty years old. Second, it is difficult to sympathize with poor Marv, especially since Betty is not very hot, to begin with. <br /> <br /> ******* Spoilers ****** The end is so strange. It seems that the director has planned that the character of Pittman is shot, but there are no shots ... he just hit the cement, where he is lying until the ambulances take it and place it on a stretcher (face down!). What were his injuries? A broken knee? Dingo! Vince has just slaughtered his companion without any remorse, but he just pushes Marv on the ground and rushes in spite of the fact that he does not hide that he hates the child. And to make things even more ridiculous, Marv asks the police to tell his father he's sorry. (Duh, Hi Marv, we just hit, I think you'll have plenty of opportunities to tell your father that you're sorry ... in person). And this writer was not nominated at the Oscars? Ignore it unless you look at it on MST.
