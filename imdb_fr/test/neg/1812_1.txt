The movie Heart of Darkness is an insult to Joseph Conrad's book! To be quite honest, the movie made me want to fall asleep. However, the book was really amazing. I think the film omitted several key elements and omitted some of the main points of the book. In addition, the actors were boring and lacked originality and enthusiasm. <br /> <br /> The book, while neither an adventure story nor easy to understand, is full of hidden meaning and interesting twists in the plot. The book, although very confusing and complex, is amazing. When you finally understand it, you feel as if you have really learned something. The news, or news, had several key ideas like futility and madness, which the film has left behind. In addition, several key scenes were modified, which had consequences for the entire plot. Many scenes seemed to be very "agitated", in the sense that they did not fit together. In summary, the film seemed to be a misinterpretation of the book. <br /> <br /> I would only recommend watching this movie if you can not understand or understand the book, but otherwise, I would skip this one. It was awful and in disarray. If you have never read the book, do not look at the movie, because you need the basic information of the book to understand the movie. The film was a horrible derivative of an exceptional and detailed book.
