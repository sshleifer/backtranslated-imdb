This film is called "Solomon Kane". Which is not. The main character wears a hat, but that's all he has in common with Robert Howard's character, Solomon Kane, as we know in the early paper magazines and in many publications since those days. this. It's a fantastic movie, not really that bad, and it could easily have gone with a pretty good review - if it was not called Solomon Kane. The hero is a newly invented character who is certainly not SK. The story is not that of Robert Howard. <br /> <br /> As a fantastic film, it's another film that respects the traditions of the genre: simple story, poor CGI, mediocre actors, bad director. Still, it can be fun, you know: "the less expensive they are, the better they are". But since his name is Solomon Kane, I can not accept it. Imagine a Lord of the Rings movie featuring a hero, Bilbo, who fights the black wizard Saugalf with the help of his dwarf friend Aragorn and the beautiful heroine Shadowfax. And with one last fight where all three use a magic ring to kill the evil wizard who has turned into a Gondorian dragon. Imagine that. That's exactly what this movie did with Robert Howard's character, Solomon Kane. <br /> <br /> I would give him a 4 star review if it was a horror movie, but since his name is Solomon Kane, I can only rate it 3 stars.
