I am a fan of the bizarre style of Jess Franco and a lover even of his more trashy films, and my personal opinion is that he has, in addition to several very entertaining movies, also created some masterpieces, such as the brilliant "Paroxismus" aka "Venus" In "furs" of 1969. However, it is undeniable that the 180 films and more that this very prolific filmmaker has achieved during his career also include a group of great stinkies. " "Sadomania" from 1981 is certainly one of those stinky, just a totally bad and intriguing movie with the ability to annoy you despite the constant curse and nudity. <br /> Of course, the constant nudity you will entertain for 20 minutes, but as it continues, you may get bored after a short time.The only thing that really made me look at it was the intensity of sleaze, which is generously spoken, slightly fun. <br /> <br /> Ap As soon as a few newlyweds got lost in the desert on an island, they stopped a group of women with bare breasts carrying firearms, the guards of a local prison camp. While the husband is banished from the island, his wife is taken to the prison camp, a place of torture and sexual humiliation, under the reign of the sadistic nymphomaniac Magda and an extremely evil governor. The prisoners are, of course, completely hot girls, most of them blondes, the guards are fully topless women carrying rifles. <br /> <br /> The plot, so to speak, is extremely stupid of course, but who will look for a good plot anyway. The (only) interesting thing about "Sadomania" is the high level of exploitation, even for a movie "Women In Prison". There are probably two short scenes in the movie where we see a woman wearing a top, the sleaze contains all kinds of sexual perversions from rape to bestiality, and some of the torture scenes are really nasty. <br /> <br /> It is amazing that a movie with this extreme level of sleaze can be so boring. The sleaze will allow you to watch at the beginning, but after the first 45 minutes, I had a hard time not falling asleep. I also wonder why, among all pornstars, Jess Franco chose Ajita Wilson, who was, according to most sources, a transsexual born of a man (well, perhaps for exactly that reason). If you really want to watch this, make sure you have enough beer at home to watch it and only watch it for play and exploitation only (and maybe for the slight unintentional amusement). Do not expect to be very entertained, however, it's almost amazing to see a movie with such a sleaze level can be so boring. I am a fan of Jess Franco and I will always be, but "Sadomania" is just bad. 2/10
