I would not recommend it at all. It was like I was stuck in the middle of a theater row, so I could not leave and watch a partially porn movie (except that they did not undress - it was the body language and certainly the language). I must say that I was embarrassed. The filming was very small budget, no good dialogue. Yuck. Stinky actors except The two best characters killed (?) And they were David Carradine and Dennis Hopper. It looked like Kill Bill and that old movie with the two guys putting the dessert on their chopppers. You know what I mean. blah. The filming was grainy and of very poor quality. No one in this theater liked this film, and the people around me were younger and tattooed.
