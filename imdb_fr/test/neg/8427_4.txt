Last night, I watched the screening of this film on Greek television because of the upcoming Olympic Games organized by my city. Knowing it was an American film, I was already expecting him to focus more on the story of American athletes. And I was really ready for that. But what I saw was ... too much! I mean, when a movie has such a title ("First Olympics: Athens 1896"), even of American origin, it is not expected that this film will also be At the same time, unaware of athletes and efforts other countries. American athletes seem to have all the gifts of nature (strength, intelligence, generosity, kindness, politeness ...), unlike their "sin athletes". Games, which seem unable even to ... express their thoughts or express their feelings. The number of times the American anthem is played during the film must be a record in the filmography. Megalomania at its best! She even uses fictitious facts that ridicule the Greek nation, such as Greek citizens serving foreign marathon athletes with wine, in order to help nationals to win the race. With the Olympic spirit. <br /> <br /> Think about it.Being a Greek and giving a bad note to a film whose title is also Greek is something that does not make me happy at all.B According to what I saw, I can not give it more than 4 out of 10 (being quite generous actually).
