Just like all actors and the film crew, they know everything about making a movie. <br /> <br /> This film is about the adventures and tricky situations of a modern vampire cockney assassin, and about an old man who spits with a seemingly jaded vampire. lover. This plot in itself releases clich√©s and promises of boredom when a movie as small as this one, and that's exactly what you get. <br /> <br /> First of all, let me say that I do not reject any movies, they are B movies, in fact, some of my favorite movies are B, such as Jesus Christ: Vampire Hunter, but this one is missing a lot more than the target. <br /> <br /> Anyone with knowledge of low budget movies Know that acting is rarely captivating and emotional, but Razor Blade Smile creates a whole new dimension by blocking it on screen. Some of these so-called actors are incredibly bad, with characters spewing cheese lines that fall flat, and a speech expressing as much emotion and conviction as the terminator after two tranquilizers for horses. <br /> <br /> A vast Part of the film is also taken by the vampire characters, the protagonist in particular, unnecessarily waving the mouth, showing their vampire teeth ridiculously large and exhaling very strong. This must literally happen at least once in almost every scene, and has quickly become boring and useless, as if many looks of seemingly frightening relaxed faces and jaws were used to simply fill a little time and smother the rest of that sandwich of a film. <br /> <br /> Contrary to what some of the other critics think, I feel that this film (the director in particular) is really trying to take this film seriously in many ways. The impressive number of extremely dramatic action scenes and extreme close-ups seem to me to indicate that the director really wanted people to feel the film and legitimize it, without bluffing it, and it fails miserably. Attempts at supposedly good sex scenes are comical and ridiculous and the action sequences are sometimes just stupid. <br /> <br /> The end of this movie was also one of the weakest and most pathetic conclusions I have ever seen a movie, movie B or not. When movies such as this one require you to sit for hours before being rewarded with "oh, it was all a game", it's really disgusting. The conclusion of the "plot" seems to be an afterthought of the director he discovered on the last day of filming, as they had reached the end of their minimal budget. <br /> <br /> But I did not notice this film as a single star despite the overwhelming sadness, and this, because of the only positive point that I can really give to this film. Intentionally or not, it was funny. I'm pretty sure that the roles I found humorous are not meant to be, and I found that most of the efforts to make real gags were in vain, but when we look at them with friends, it's a good movie to eliminate mickey.
