Since this show has gone from TSS (the screensavers) to AOT (the attack of the series), it is in free fall. TSS with Yoshi and Kevin Rose Alex ... etc. Made the show awesome, then they were fired from TSS for some unknown reason. When the series switched to AOTS, it was less focused on computers than on games and magazines. He also promoted groups that no one had heard or cared about. Finally, I could not look at it once Kevin Rose was gone. He kept it interesting, but he left to do his own thing, which is good. Kevin Rose now has several online pods, shows, etc. on the REV network 3. Check it. REV3.com I think you can access it by going to www.systm.org. If you want a real tech show rather than TV, check out Kevin Roses' shows or listen to the tWit podcast. <br /> <br /> J <
