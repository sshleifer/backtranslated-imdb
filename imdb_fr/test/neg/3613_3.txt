I will not vote this film as a dreadful movie, mainly because I like it. I was one of those days of summer where I was so lame that I could not do anything and decided to rent a movie in the stupid section of the video library. In addition to that, I had not slept in the night before and the film woke me up ... Let's just start the autopsy, OK, the movie has a strange plot, first isolation, there has an expedition, they are isolated in an island because there is no gasoline on the boat, something like that, there is not a single convincing performance on the part of the actors (up to present), the main problem begins after the idea of ​​isolation, the POV of a snake, then another, ... then another, then snakes that change, then fake spooks, many of them, and when we think that the film is a good way to keep a suspense, because after ten or eleven ghosts, we are not worn far away, the only scene that resists everything is the scene where we attend a series of lesbians drunk watched by snakes that seem to dance. After that, it does not become a horror adventure anymore but a comedy-oriented movie, the adventure part is also rejected. /> <br /> For me, the problem in a film is the third act, it's the only section that leads The film is a conclusion already sketched, or if it succeeds, we do not notice, like a ninja who smokes in the eyes, well ... The snake's island has a bad conclusion, it ends up with a "pounding" ending, with a clash, a persecution and a sequence of escape, it was predictable at the moment I rented the copy of the dam. The other problem is the concept, which is a very important concept, which is why you believe that the dinosaurs come alive and that the corpse is full of stitches that just want to live, the main concept of snakes that want revenge after decades of torture by the human. civilization, well ... hmmm, it does not stick to the wall. One thing you'll enjoy (if you look at it with an open mind), it's the most bz sequences, the naked lesbians, some amateur camera angles, the homage to the man with the mower, the black guy does not die not the first, and that's all. ... if you want to see snakes, blacks and comedies and you prefer bigger budgets, go see "snakes in an airplane". <br /> <br /> The spectators of Hasta
