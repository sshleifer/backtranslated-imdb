Dakota Incident must be one of the strangest westerns I have ever seen. Not good, but really strange. <br /> <br /> A driverless diligence arrives in the city of Christian Flats with all passengers killed. It is expected that this will continue, but very few people for obvious reasons want to risk the Cheyenne on the path of war. But Linda Darnell, Regis Toomey, John Lund, Whit Bissell and Ward Bond each have their reason to continue. And Dale Robertson, who killed John Doucette in a shootout after Doucette and Skip Homeier shot him in the desert, is so eager to leave that he is ready to lead the team. <br /> <br /> Of course, the Cheyennes attack the intrepid group of passengers if forced into a dry wash for cover. Who will stay and who will die is the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> The Dakota incident took place at the very end of Republic Pictures before Herbert J. Yates put an end to the situation in his small studio. The Westerns were their specialty, but normally of the sort made by Roy Rogers. It would not have been a product of Rogers. <br /> <br /> In fact, it's amazing. The characters are in no kind of reality. Whit Bissell collects ore samples from his concession, but Robertson discovers that they are iron pyrites, foolish gold. Toomey is a cynic who plays the guitar and goes crazy with thirst. Darnell is after a director cheating on her, but really does not know what to do when she finds him. Lund is trying to bring in Robertson who has committed a crime for which he took rap, but has to bring him back alive. For that, he would need help, but he does not. <br /> <br /> But the worst is Ward Bond, a US senator on a mission for peace in the Cheyenne. In real life, Bond was an extreme right-winger and I'm not sure it's a kind of caricature of what he would perceive as a liberal. He's really a silly fool, but I think it might have attracted him to the role. <br /> <br /> I tried to get into Dakota Incident, but I failed. And the end was a weird fantasy. <br /> <br /> Give it three stars for the distribution concerned.
