If Jack Black had been designated as the main actor, I would have immediately removed from this film. Some of his films look good compared to this movie. This film should be shot as a cartoon for 3 to 8 years and it would have been much better. This is just a pile of the most stupid skits of other movies together to create a big mess. The film seems to have been shot in about a day without any thought behind it all. There are a few times where it seems that there may be a turning point and that the movie will actually have a plot or at least one storyline will develop, but the stupid skits inserted will ruin the entire movie.
