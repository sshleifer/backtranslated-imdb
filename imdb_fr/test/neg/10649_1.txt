The Critic Joe Cool - Hellraiser: Bloodline <br /> <br /> With: Bruce Ramsay as Phillip The Merchant / John Merchant / Dr. Paul Merchant, Valentina Vargas as Ang√©lique and Doug Bradley in the role of Pinhead in hell. From the 18th century to our time, when Pinhead meets Merchant for the first time and tries to break the lineage. (He's the only one who can stop Pinhead, you see) and finally in the future, in space, where Paul Merchant finally figured out how to send Pinhead to hell for good. <br /> <br /> Openers: This is a film so hated by those who did it, they said that fictional director Alan Smithee would be the credited director. They only take Smithee out of their craft when they really think they've made a dreadful movie, such as classics like Birds II: Land's End or Bloodthirsty Pharaohs in Pittsburgh. No, I did not invent that. How did I like it? You read this, so I'm sure that's what you want to know. <br /> <br /> The Good: This film is not as bad as you've been led to believe. Oh, I'm not going to coat it. This film was full of potential and ended up being a disaster, but it has some good points. Cenobites colder this time for beginners, such as twins and the angelic demon. Pinhead still plays a lead role and always has good lines ("Pain has a face, let me show you") and it's a bit of fun all the way through. Gorehounds will love the movie because of its unlimited offer. There is also some continuity with the rest of the series, although you have to look hard to see it. The Chatterer Chat is great. <br /> <br /> The Bad: But for a story about Hell against the damn Merchant lineage that could close the bridge forever, it was really complicated and held together with duct tape. Nothing was really explored to its potential and there were some really stupid things included. Pinhead kidnaps a kid and holds him for ransom! Random deaths just to present more blood (not always a bad thing, but not for the sake of history). Pinhead is at his worst here, he cries again and again, even when he is about to die! For the very smart demon he was, he was reduced to a Bond villain at best. If Hellraiser fans need a reason why he has been relocated to a cameo-like role, it's here. Bloodline ruined everything for us all. <br /> <br /> The Ugly: Gore is always mentioned here. This one has skin tearing, drilling, hooking, decapitations and more treats. The Chatterer Cat, although impressive, draws bad effects during the chase scenes. <br /> <br /> Final Verdict: This movie had the potential for something awesome, even at incredible levels of grandeur. But all this was wasted. Who knows exactly what produced this shit, but we can only blame Alan Smithee. <br /> <br /> Compared to the rest: This film is the worst of the Hellraiser series. For completists only. <br /> <br /> Rating: 1/2 * on *****
