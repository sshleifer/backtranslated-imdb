I had to be in a good mood to give this movie shameful, predictable and embarrassing even a 3. What's wrong with this movie? Let's start with free sex, although I admit that the rotation style of bonking was something that I had not seen (nor experienced) before. And I guess they also saved a few dollars by showing the same-sex scene three times. Then there are the inconsistencies. The "Oakville Tribune" seems to be in a green part of the city that it was supposed to be. (Hamilton Ontario ???) Still, in the rooftop scenes, it seems like it's in an industrial area with a steel mill that spits smoke and flames. In addition, the interior of the building - the press room - the stairs - seems much bigger than the outside. SPOILERS HERE Then, when our intrepid journalist was finally fired, she returned several times to the building, once after hours. Hardly likely. The end is also pitifully predictable ... the classic primer and switch in which the good turns out to be the bad guy. But my main objection is that this is a new film funded by Canadian and Ontario tax credits, which is ashamed of being established in Canada, proving once again that the Canadian film industry is crazy. and opportunistic. The films of a country must do more than provide jobs. They should reflect the culture. It is bad enough that American studios are using Toronto to replace New York. But it is embarrassing and infuriating to see Canadian producers (in this case, CanWest Global) do so with the help of the federal and provincial governments. In a word ... BAH!
