I work in an office on weekends and there is a TV that only gets a channel. So, I do not have the opportunity to move on to something better. I keep it however because it produces a little background noise. Sometimes I get a decent movie / show. Not today. Today, I have "Breaker Breaker". The city looks like a third set of rates (which of course is the case). All the actors and the bad guys have the impression of leaving the stunt school. I saw better drama during a carnival. The special effects (the flames at the end of the movie are more wrong than the masculinity of Michael Jacksons). Even the horse at the end of the movie was a terrible actor ... A badly played, poorly shot, poorly written film.
