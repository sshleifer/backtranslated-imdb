Recap: A solitary swordsman living in the desert and acting as an agent to other swordsmen, remembers what his life was. It started with the fact that the woman he loved chose to marry his brother instead, forcing him to leave his hometown. One of the swordsmen is Huang, who is himself at the heart of a complicated love story, where a woman wants him killed for running away from the promise to marry her younger sister. But the sister wants to hire a swordsman to protect Huang, and everything is set aside when the woman and her sister are really the same person. <br /> <br /> Comments: I saw the Redux version published in 2008 of the original that was published in 1994. I can not say how the two versions differ, but the Redux is very strongly stylized in the manner of Chinese Wuxia action. This is unfortunate because this style seems to me to have forgotten one of the most important elements of a successful and entertaining film. An understandable story. But true to his style, landscapes and visual elements seem much more important and more focused on the writer and director Kar Wai Wong. As a result, there are many beautiful, colorful scenes that have nothing to do with history. <br /> <br /> The editing and chronology of the story are also poorly managed. Much of it is left out in the scenes, the timeline is broken and reorganized in a confusing way. The slow, quiet scenes are suddenly relieved by surprisingly brutal and seemingly unmotivated fights, the mere fact of being relieved by something else and unrelated. The result is a confusing and very uninteresting film. <br /> <br /> Thanks to these brutal but very few fights, the film enters the kind of action. The poster and photographs also imply that, but could almost be considered false marketing. Only a few minutes out of the 90 could be considered as an action, the other could not be further away. The film as a whole is very slow, dull and therefore very boring. Even the rare scenes full of action are of no help, because they are so disconnected from the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> I could say that I am not a fan of this Chinese style, because they often seem to be afflicted. Among these same issues, the most important is that the visual is more important than the story, but Ashes of Time Redux is perhaps the worst example I've seen. <br /> <br /> 3/10
