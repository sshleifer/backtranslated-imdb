I was anxious to see this movie, but unfortunately I had to listen to my daughter's advice. It should have been a travesty, but it took a realism for which companies had a lot to answer. <br /> <br /> Jim Carrey, after all his work, is still Jim Carrey and his comedy gets no better, his co-star could not support him. Their son in the movie was invisible. <br /> <br /> The life of the crime was a wink, and it was the missing link in the film. The film showed 2 or 3 flights and they were richer than before, that's where it was lost. <br /> <br /> I mocked some parts, but the whole thing is not enough, I thought I could add some weight to the film. His character was not strong enough. There were just too many gaps to make this movie a smart and tight movie.
