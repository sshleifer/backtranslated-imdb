I came across this movie late at night on TV. My brother and I could not stop laughing at the terrible horror of this movie. The sound effects of shit every time White Ninja or Black Ninja hits, knocks or uses a weapon are hilarious. This film is almost the same level as the Evil Dead series, but you can only watch it once because of the shear-related sadness. I'm not sure if the director intended it to be so bad because he knew that idiots like me would buy it.
