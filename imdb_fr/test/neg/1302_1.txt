In addition to all the negative reviews: I was surprised to see that, on a hat trick, a CCTV camera was summoned to a very unlikely place, to show the team "crisis" ('Maaaaa Look' -aaam '') what was happening, especially near the Thames barrier, where the teacher is hit by a heavy object and then lives to tell the story. Otherwise, I could not get rid of the image of some actors as described in other films / programs: I said to my wife: "Hey, this is Neil, from The Young Ones" (Nigel Planer ) and "Did they call Hercule Poirot to help him?" (David Suchet) To add to the shame of this film (recently shown in two parts on ITV UK), ITV showed the Environment Agency phone number after each episode to an anxious public living in areas "at risk of flooding." How can you, as a broadcaster, treat your audience like this? What should the Environment Agency think? "(" Oh no, it's still Mrs. Jones from Hull, she says she was right all the time, she saw it on ITV ").
