It is now a veritable turkey of the director overrated Franco, who gave us classics such as "Las Vampiras / Vampyros Lesbos". Yes, I think bad movies can be very fun. I love the hilarious howls of Doris Wishman, Dwain Esper and Ed Wood Jr., but this turned out to be too much for me. This is the first film I rated 1. Where should I start? The scenario is idiotic at most. The dialogue is incredibly bad. The staging seems to be nonexistent. The best music (used repeatedly in this film) was taken directly from the movie "Der Hexer" (1964). And it's boring! Poor Shirley Eaton and George Sanders! In one shot, Sanders reads a Popeye comic while his henchman tortures a girl (this aspect is probably the intellectual highlight of this film). The only thing that bothered me was that Franco quickly showed female nudity every time I thought the film would take advantage of it - it's a real talent as a director! Even so, I'm afraid that a film in which actors claim to shoot with machine guns by shaking them is not worth it.
