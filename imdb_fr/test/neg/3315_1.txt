I had never voted 1 for a movie on IMDB, but for this one, I regret that the scale does not go down to -10. <br /> <br /> All I can say about this movie is that I saw in a preview, and it was my worst cinematic experience. Stupid jokes do not bother me. I can live with stupid history. But when I see these "main characters" who stupidly smile with their foreign pseudo-speech (only the Germans will understand what I'm talking about), I felt that I hated a little that I did not think I could do it. (If they had left them out, the thing might have been acceptable ...). <br /> <br /> There is not much to add about this one. You can laugh once or twice, because it's so ridiculous, but it does not make it better. It's certainly not funny. <br /> <br /> If you live outside Germany, be happy and rejoice that this horrible work will probably never reach your cinemas. <br /> <br /> If you make it live in Germany, avoid this movie at all costs.
