Although this film is globally inaccurate, some elements may be true. He was certainly a wild character in his youth, after making jokes to his fellow West Point cadets, almost expelled several times, getting his last degree in his class (out of 34) and often reckless during his civil war. But history may have made him a scapegoat for Indian wars. Certainly, he did his share of cruel things, but how much was he under orders? In addition, it is proven that he testified before the Congress (at considerable cost to his commission and command) that he had discussed the fairness of the treaty violation with the Indians and that, if was an Indian, he would also fight rather than live on a reserve! <br /> <br /> As a character in Room 1776 said to the question of what the British would say about the loss of the war of independence, the character states that "history will do what she's always ... she's lying. " Who knows how bad Custer was? He was certainly not the sympathetic character described by Errol Flynn and later by Ronald Reagan. But I also doubt that he was completely naughty as it will be described later.
