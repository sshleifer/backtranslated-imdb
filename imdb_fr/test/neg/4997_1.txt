Hey, I'm a fan of bad movies, but Rise Of The Undead is not that bad. It's so bad and that's it. No cheese that redeems, no involuntary humor, nothing! - Boring apocalyptic zombie (The "Undead": some people with little makeup) nonsense with lame special effects (if you can call these effects), a silly plot and annoying actors. They also have the nerve to scam and cite other (best) movies (Resident Evil, Dawn Of Dead and Comet Night) and managed to fall asleep apart. However, it was Rise Of My Eyelids once the end credits were recorded. My advice: save your money. It's not even worth a rental unless you want to sleep and / or put some people to sleep, then go for it and try it out. You have been warned;)
