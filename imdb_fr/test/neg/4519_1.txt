This is nothing like the WWF and the WWF Era Attitude. I have always been a fan of WWF and have never seen competitors. Now, I regret the day I wanted the WWF to take charge. At least, the WCW would try something new and radical all the time instead of remaining a mask of the real intentions of the series, which is also true for ECW. WWF has always been about Hulk Hogan, Andre The Giant and other old wrestlers like this, and "Attitude Era" is just catching up with the radical ideas of the competition. WWE is the same garbage it was before the Era Attitude era. The wrestlers are terrible, the shared mark divides the mind, and the scenarios and stipulations are nonexistent. The WWE is so bad that it even stops being an old shell by pushing characters and wrestlers into the main event while maintaining the barriers of creativity. Of course, the series shakes the brains of gentle, innocent, easy-to-brain-wash children, and lean, ugly, pariah, silly people from the Internet Wrestling community who regard society as something good. Anyone who shudders and rests on the thought that this show and this product is good can go straight to hell.
