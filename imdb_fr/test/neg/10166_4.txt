This review is for the UK three-disc DVD cabinet. The first disc is called Taken in the Act and contains the typical behavior, Chasing Jamie and Fast and Curious. Record Two is called Bedroom Fantasies and contains Blue Plate Special, Toming in Lust Again and Love Potion No 10. The latest album is Anything Goes and contains Chatroom, She's the Boss and Legally Yours. The reason why the other four episodes of the series are not included is a mystery because there is surely enough room on the disks for much more material. <br /> <br /> Each episode opens with the hotel manager, Chloe (Lauren Hayes) reading a letter from a satisfied customer. We then have the chance to see the story unfold as guests sign up at the hotel. Blue Plate Special is the exception because this story is that of a waitress. The authors should have the merit of proposing a good variety of scenarios. For example, Model Behavior is about two models competing for the attention of the photo team. Falling in Lust Again is about a man and a woman who broke up and revived their love when they found themselves at the hotel. She's the Boss talks about a mad secretary / dog man who shows that he is more of a man than his wife realized, much to his delight. All episodes lead to a lot of nudity and sex. <br /> <br /> It is not surprising that all the characters in this hotel are beautiful women and handsome men. Even geek secretaries transform themselves by removing their glasses and dropping their hair. The sexual action is abundant but seems to me too frenetic and false. The work of the camera could also have been done with a little moderation, spending too much time getting closer and moving to capture everything, and as usual, we have loud music during the sexual action. Finally, the end credits mention the Palm Canopy Hotel in Singer Island, Florida, although my Florida map shows no island to Singer. The landscape certainly looks more like Florida than Utah or Las Vegas that some people have mentioned. It's a very good effort and it's a shame that the second series is still waiting for the release of a DVD in the UK. 4 stars.
