Maybe it's better. I would not know I spent the first twenty minutes or so before cutting him off and going into a period of mourning. It was obvious that the plot itself was familiar. A man, Paul LeMatt, entymology professor at Columbia, goes with his dog to a small town in Ohio in search of his ex-wife, Diana Scarwid. There he meets people who do not know him or who are hostile. Oh, they can smile, but something is happening underneath. <br /> <br /> This kind of arrangement is a breeding ground for filmmakers and viewers, and it is full of possibilities. You can achieve a successful commercial success such as "Bad Day at Black Rock". Or it would have done, and probably made DID, a nice episode of "Twilight Zone". <br /> <br /> The distribution also includes seasoned artists as well as well-known names. Kenneth Toby, a veteran of science fiction, is the superficially kind motel manager. Diana Scarwid can give an impressive performance, as she did in, for example, "Silkwood". For some others, their scope is limited. <br /> <br /> But it is badly directed and badly written. <br /> <br /> Example of mediocre direction. This LeMatt dog is hated by Kenneth Toby from the start. So when LeMatt goes out into the street, Toby sneaks into his bedroom window, glances at the dog and something zaps. Cut to LeMatt in the street. He hears his dog howling. Then, a POV shot assuming that the dog was spinning to LeMatt and then passed him as the wind blew and LeMatt gaped at the camera. Same cut - from the other direction! Whatever the camera represents, what LeMatt looks at is never shown. Maybe it was nothing, because suddenly the wind stopped and LeMatt is alone in the street, looking a bit puzzled. "You should never have brought this dog in the first place," remarks a smiling Toby from the porch. Question: What is this scene? <br /> <br /> Example of shabby writing. Well, two examples. (1) If you had to sit down and write a stereotypical waitress at a small town restaurant, without practicing any trade, you'd have an expressionless baby with hair piled on your head and chewing gum, strolling around the tables. Right. (2) Everything that looks like credibility is thrown out the window in favor of special effects. LeMatt's car stops, then explodes, waiting to be repaired at the garage. Chugging at a standstill: credible. Explode: supernatural. Even Edgar Allan Poe would not approve of such an event. <br /> <br /> And the invaders themselves? Think of a modest masterpiece like "Invasion of the Body Snatchers". Something is wrong in the little town of Dr. Kevin McCarthy, and it takes half of the movie to solve the mystery, and all the while the suspense goes up and doubt grows. Here, twenty minutes after the movie starts, a stranger enters a motel room and tears off his plastic face, revealing a naked, pulsating brain emitting light. The pregnancy is interrupted. <br /> <br /> I will not tell you the end because I do not know what it is and I do not care. I guess it has something to do with insects, why would Paul LeMatt be an entymologist? (By the way, who runs his classes?) But I'm not sure if any bugs were involved. It is quite possible that the bug trade was fortuitous. The writers may have made him an insect specialist, and then completely forgot about him. That would not surprise me.
