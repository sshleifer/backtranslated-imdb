Is it just me or do most of the actors in this adaptation have a bad age? <br /> <br /> Jemma Redgrave, although a top actress, seems to want to join her children instead of falling asleep on the couch. (I would have liked to see Brenda Blethlyn in this part, despite her link to the latest issue of Pride and Prejudice.) Spirit and Performance. All the others seemed confused or moved. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, I do not know Dr. Who very well (I have only seen a few episodes), otherwise it would definitely make things worse. <br /> <br /> Too bad that Mansfield Park has not yet seen its due on the screen (big or small). This novel requires the talent of a Robert Altman to successfully balance all the complexities of the characters.
