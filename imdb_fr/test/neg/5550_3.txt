Say what you want about the film "Wizard of Gore" of the movie, Herschell Gordon Lewis, it must be admitted that since his first films ("Blood Feast" trash of 1963 and the massacre of "Two Thousand Maniacs" of 1964 , "The Gore" from 1972) "Gore Girls"), the man remained faithful to his muse, happily carving the body of young men and women for the delight of the camera.In "Gore Gore", for example, someone mutilated Tops & Bottoms' pasty, pasty-skinned strippers and the uncomfortable ex-detective Gentry was hired by a stunt reporter to help with the affair. remarkably boring and repetitive background, terrible lighting, abysmal play, disgusting characters, problematic sound AND, of course, some of Lewis's patented crude-out scenes, so one stripper has her face buried in the air. boiling oil, one with open head another has his face ironed and the nipples cut off; and yet another has tipped his buttocks with a meat tenderizer until his entire back is covered with what appears to be Buitoni tomato sauce. (I could be wrong here, it could have been Ragu.) The film also casts a rather lame humor, although some of the lines are rather funny. For example, we learn that the real name of the deceased scraper, Suzie Creampuff, was ... Ethel Creampuff! A bottle of acid on which is engraved "Made In Poland" (I do not know why, but I found it funny). And some of the lines of Henny Youngman Striptease Club owner are, of course, fun. Still, it's NOT the movie to show to Aunt Ethel or Sister Agatha. This is one of the sickest you've ever seen, with a single reassuring and cheering moment: the title card at the conclusion of the film that reads: "We proudly announce: this film is over!"
