I watch "LOST" with my family since the first episode, it was great. Last season, it was very disappointing, it seems that the authors do not know what to do with the series, so they continue to try to catch up by cutting a story in an episode. The current season, which I have decided to look only to see Rodrigo Santoro, and with a little hope that things would improve; was a disappointment after another; my husband and son even stopped watching. First, he (Santoro) only appears 30 seconds per episode. But the real problem is the scenario, there is really nothing happening, each episode can be broadcast in 15 minutes. We watch every episode waiting for something that never happens; I do not ask that all secrets be revealed at once, but what about variations in the stories? During the first and second seasons, we had different scenarios, we saw the story of the characters, a little action, a little romance, it's now a big event that takes the whole episode to unveil. It's almost tiring to watch it, when it finishes, you have the feeling that you have wasted your time. Now, it's important to note that the actors are always great. I can not believe they killed Mr. Eko (Adelawale ...). He was great. Jack (Mathew Fox) is always amazing, the perfect hero, so kind, magnanimous. , courageous. Sawyer (Josh Holloway), the "bad boy" is a little softening because of Kate (Evangeline Lylli), but it's cool. Sayid (Naveen Andrews), Sun and Jin (Yoon-jin Kim and Daniel Dae Kim) miss me, they are all an important part of the plot (or should be), but we hardly see them. I hope that Paulo (Rodrigo Santoro) will have an important role in the series. if not, why did you make such a big deal of his participation in the show (Access Hollywood, etc.)? Sorry if I grumble too long, but I feel cheated by this show. When I started watching it was great, I got used to it, and now it's very disappointing to see how it goes. I'll be there, hoping for improvements! Katia
