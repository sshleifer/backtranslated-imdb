This show is very nice and fun to watch, it's an excellent Disney channel and sometimes entertaining shows. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed the first season but I hated the second and third seasons. This show has completely changed around. In the first season, it was more about science and animals, all that has now disappeared in the season and the third season. Its more about his life and dating. Since this gay kid (Ben) has arrived, this show has been nil. The writers took a very good children's show and turned it into a rotten teen comedy. Disney has turned a corner for the worst. I can not stand watching the latest episodes, they are all garbage.
