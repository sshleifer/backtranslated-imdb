"Congo" is based on Michael Crichton's bestselling novel, which, in my opinion, lacked the charm, the usual intelligent characters and the punch of Crichton. Sorry, but the same goes for the movie. <br /> <br /> Here's the plot: <br /> <br /> Greed is bad, this simple story of morality warns. A megalomaniac C.E.O. (Joe Don Baker) sends his son to the dangerous African Congo in search of a source of diamonds big enough and pure to function as a powerful laser communication transmitter (or is it a laser weapon?). In case of loss of contact with his son and his team, his stepdaughter (Laura Linney), a former CIA agent and computer maniac, is sent in pursuit. In her quest, she is accompanied by awesome gadgets and some eccentric characters (including a mercenary (Ernie Hudson), a researcher with a talking gorilla (Dylan Walsh) and an insane type of Indiana-Jones in search of the mines of the King Solomon (Tim Curry) After narrowly escaping from surface-to-air missiles and African animals, they all discover that what we want most is the source of our downfall. <br /> <br /> > Actors Dylan Walsh behaves like a pathetic crybaby, especially in the end, Ernie Hudson is unconvincing (is not it amazing that he then goes on TV?) And Laura Linney is nothing special. Declare without fear that the only talented actors in this film have very small roles: Joe Don Baker and Tim Curry, an always nice actor (although sometimes marked for life by constantly reminding his days "Rocky Horror Picture"). /> This film also had some other pr oblasts, including the terrible leadership style, cheesy dialogue and a just-boring plot, which was completely chopped up compared to Crichton's novel. <br /> <br /> Not even the creature effects of Stan Winston could save this movie from being a disaster. I am deeply disappointed by this film. there was not even a campy quality to redeem himself. It was just awful, old-fashioned, boring and ridiculous, and proving to be one of Crichton's worst film-to-film productions. <br /> <br /> 2/5 stars - <br /> <br /> John Ulmer
