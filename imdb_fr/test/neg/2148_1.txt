You know you have a bad movie when you hear that the soundtrack is played entirely on a single cheap programmable synthesizer, with no melody or sense of rhythm. <br /> <br /> It's hard to see how anyone could take this film seriously, even giving it a bad review. This film is well below the 'bad'. <br /> <br /> The continuity of this film is upset. In a fight scene, the hero (dressed in bluejeans and undershirt) turns a corner with two revolvers in his hand; he doubles his back, only now he has two semi-automatic in his hands; he turns another corner and now he has an automatic rifle in his hands; he runs in and out of a hallway (suddenly dressed in the standard fatigue jacket of the army) with a shotgun; after which he leaves the building with yet another automatic rifle. Or here's one for books: a bus hits a car at high speed; the car takes off, projected by a gigantic explosion - cut off in the bus which is totally unscathed from the same explosion? Narrative continuity suffers from an equally unreal sense of unreality; the bad guys really want to kill the hero - obviously - but every time they knock him out or put him in a vulnerable position, they suddenly decide that they want him to "live to see that!" Huh? One of the most amusing moments of the film is when the hero is released from his isolation because his lawyer came to see him. then the bad guy decides he will not let the two meet after all; and this despite the fact that the villain, the hero and his lawyer all know what's going on anyway, then the hero writes a note to the lawyer and then we see the note being passed to the lawyer by another prisoner, even though we never see the hero give it to him. (This lawyer, BTW, has full access to the ATF offices in California, including his confidential computer files.) Huh? Well, but it's a stupid action movie - so how are the action scenes? Not bad, surprisingly; unfortunately, they stole about a dozen Hong Kong films made five or ten years ago. The opening scene, a shooting in a Junker garage, actually contains plans that are stolen directly from "Hard Boiled" - so plainly that it's amazing that John Woo did not sue for plagiarism. <br /> <Other stolen Hong Kong movies include "Prison on Fire", "Island on Fire", "Burning Paradise", "Police Story" I, II and III (aka "Supercop"). I thought I recognized some clips of Sammo Hung here too. In other words, the action scenes are exciting only to the extent that they are a successful duplication of action scenes from other movies. <br /> <br /> There is nothing we can do with this film if we do not make a clich√© and just need it. unnecessary visual stimuli. <br /> <br /> A very funny movie, for all the wrong reasons.
