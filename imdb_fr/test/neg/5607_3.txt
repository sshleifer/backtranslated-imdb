Fans of Rutger Hower Do not Be FOOLED - he only plays a cameo in this movie and that's it. This film loses an extra point for this scam. I think Rutger Hower has a total of about 2 very short scenes and 2 very short voiceovers. <br /> <br /> The main actress of this film is well above this mediocre material in appearance and talent - she is awesome, this film is a dog and she is fed up. The story goes that a lawyer hoping to be able to form a partnership one day within the company would be obliged to transport the boss's niece throughout the country. They meet several times on the road several strange balls. It is the ideal vehicle for a variety of sketches. The guy playing Napoleon Dynamite is a secondary character for good measure. <br /> <br /> a road trip where the extreme circumstances put our repressed hero to the test and he finally relaxes a little before the end of the film, ah is not a great love, yadda yadda. . <br /> <br /> Watch this movie only if you want to see an annoying hottie for a dork in a truck for an hour and a half.
