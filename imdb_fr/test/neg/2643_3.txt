If it was the very attractive Jennifer Jostyn in the lead role, I would have disabled "Milo" after the first 30 minutes. However, as sweet as it is, it is not enough to save this movie, not for a long shot. <br /> <br /> Milo begins with a group of young girls accompanying a "young boy" in a yellow shoe in a house in the woods where he shows them embryos in jars. Apparently, the agreement was that if he showed them the jars, old Milo would have the opportunity to perform a gynecological examination on each of them in return. One of the group members volunteered to be Milo's "first patient" and he drove it behind closed doors. Moments later, the blood runs under the door and we are taken away today. Enter the beautiful Jostyn who plays one of the girls all grown up nowadays. A substitute and unsuspecting teacher whose closest friend seems to be a goldfish, she receives an invitation to return home for a friend's wedding. Yes! You guessed it. Return to Miloville. Milo, who drowned years ago, seems to have a dilemma to remain dead and begins to terrorize and murder girls he has not "examined" all these years before. <br /> <br /> Milo, the character, reminded me of one of the mutants of "The Brood" from Cronenberg. It could have been scary, but how scary can a villain wearing a yellow raincoat be? The plot merges itself and the conclusion let me want my 90 minutes back. I send Milo, an inept slasher film, in the corner!
