Tom Selleck plays an absent son to Don Ameche "pop" senile and exhausted mother Anne Jackson, offsetting his indiscretions (we suppose) and taking them after Ameche burned his mobile home; Meanwhile, the F.B.I. remove Selleck's work, his assets are frozen, his wife and children are leaving him and his hateful sister and children have come to stay. The comedy of the brightly colored evils is as far removed from reality as the old Scots dodder of Ameche. Perhaps a serious first draft (with scenes like Ameche walking in traffic with two young children) has it been incorporated into a second or third more silly version (Selleck gets poked, jostled, hurt and eventually lose a toe and a testicle!). Anyway, it's a painful experience and Selleck's sudden devotion to his father makes no sense. he walks and screams in pain, but keeps his heart of mush. This film is in ruins. * from ****
