There is something frustrating about watching a movie like "Murder By Numers", because somewhere in this Hollywood formula, it's a good movie that's trying to come out. However, by the time the credits are up, you can not save them. The "police" side of the story tells everything. The characters of Sandra Bullock and Ben Chaplin embark on a delicate sexual history that takes place in a delicate sexual relationship that becomes more and more commonplace as the film progresses. Although Bullock is strong in his role, it's not enough to save the dull script and lazy stimulation. Ben Chaplin's talents are lost in a forgotten role (he did a lot better at the beginning of the year in Birthday Girl), just like Chris Penn, who has such a small role that you feel sorry for a talent like him. Anyway, the plot is not even a factor in this movie. The two teenage killers played by Ryan Gosling and Michael Pitt are the only real reasons to see this movie. Their talent and chemistry work pretty well and they play pretty well each other. Too bad they do not do much better in a full movie. Barbet Schroeder is too safe for such an experienced filmmaker. Bottom Line: If you're a fan of the genre, it's worth renting a rent, but everyone else will live a fulfilling life without even seeing it, except perhaps on network TV with convenient commercial breaks.
