The only reason I watched this movie was to see the "beginning" Kim Bassinger. That, and the fact that my TV guide said it was a "thrilling suspense", and that it was rated three stars. The note must have been attributed to the man who wrote this sentence because the only suspense in this film was whether I would finish it or not. Robert Culp turns in what must be the "disaster" of his career as a police officer who is not even credible. At one point, EVERYONE is a suspect, including a frail elderly woman. If you want to deliberately watch a poorly written, misdirected, badly played movie ... then go for it. This may make you appreciate the beautiful movies by comparison. I would like to have that hour and thirty-six minutes back.
