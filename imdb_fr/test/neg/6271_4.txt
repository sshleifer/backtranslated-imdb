One of my favorite actors, C. Tom Howell, plays the main role in this warm remake of WOTW. It turns a lot, while a machine resembling a spider generated by CGI circulates and kills everyone. The budget for this one was obviously very small. It was also one of The Asylum's productions. Have you seen any of these? Yuck! I'm not sure why anyone would have done it when the big budget version of Spielberg was slashing them at the box office. And to tell the truth, neither version is so hot. George Pal's 1950s version remains the best representation of the novel, primitive special effects and all those of H.G. Wells. Maybe because Gene Barry was much more convincing than Howell or Tom Cruise.
