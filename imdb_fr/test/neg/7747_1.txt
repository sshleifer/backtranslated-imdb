In the 1960s, those of us who were bad fans of cinema thought that "Plan Nine From Outer Space" was the worst film ever made and that it would remain forever. To put things into perspective, however, we also thought that $ 3,000 represented a significant cost for a new car. <br /> <br /> As we grew older, our innocence was gradually reduced to nothing when we were exposed to movies like "Hercules in New York" and "Overdrawn at the Memory Bank", which completely redefined the genre. "bad movie". In this context, last night, my son and I saw "Alien From L.A.", which pushed the envelope to an unimaginable extreme just a generation ago. Calling this movie "bad" (or unfortunate or execrable) does not do it justice, like any other existing label in English. Even if there were words to describe this film accurately, it would have no consequence, as it would be banned in a civilized society. <br /> <br /> The alien mentioned in the title is played by Kathy Ireland, who apparently took time to model swimsuits for Sports Illustrated, to launch her film career. His casting may seem like a kind of recommendation, until you see the movie. Make-up artists have made their money by giving Kathy such a dull and unappetizing appearance that you would not want to touch her with the end of the broom, which is not an easy task. Frankly speaking, in this film she has a face that would freeze Medusa. Worse that his look, however, was his voice, which was so hoarse that I could not credit it as being from a human being. Throughout the film, I found myself wanting a painting to slip my nails to cover the thrill of his dialogue. At the end of the movie, Kathy gets a makeover and finds herself in her beloved swimsuit. I suggested to my son that the film would have been better if he had put it in a swimsuit at the beginning of the film, so at least we would have had something to watch. My son pointed out that if they then removed the swimsuit and stuffed it in his mouth, the film would have been significantly improved in two respects. I rely on the pure brilliance of his observation. If you have doubts, compare this dreck to "Barbarella", in which a competent filmmaker shows how to exploit the assets of a leading lady in the fantasy and fantasy genre. <br /> <br /> Intrigue, there is little to comment because there was so little evidence. It is said that if a million monkeys typed continuously for millions of years, we would eventually find "Hamlet". By the process of elimination, the rest of the time, they found something approximating this scenario. Imagine, if you like, a modern-day Alice falling into a hole and dropping 500 feet on a slab of rock, after which she gets up, strips off and starts looking for her long-lost father in the city. Kingdom of Atlantis. . Once on Atlantis, she spends most of her time running, fighting or climbing stairs and ladders, and essentially tries to stay away from the hands of a general who does not seem to have soldiers. to do it and that would make Tiny Tim appear. Macho. This summary, as short as it may seem, is probably longer than the filming scenario. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, when you revel in the values ​​of the production and you take everything you can from sets and costumes to Smoke and Misty, you realize that it's a movie in which you can actually see on the screen where are spent every 20 dollars of the budget. <br /> <br /> The idea in my head was that filmmakers should not have access to drugs and alcohol while they're filming, or maybe before, if that gives results of the type "Alien from LA", even if, in all fairness, I must admit that I do not know if they were indeed drug addicts, or were simply dead brain at the beginning of the project.
