What a bad idea was to redo a movie worthy of an Oscar ?! MOSTHLY MARTHA is MUCH BETTER, deep, finesse and so on and so on: a wonderful and talented actress in the lead role (Martina Gedeck). It's a joke and ugliness with the handsome Aaron and the whole atmosphere ... again a ridiculous Hollywood effort. There are more and more remakes and movies are full of projects. Is there anyone who can create a new scenario? Or is it a security solution for making remakes or movies from cartoon characters? The movies are getting a lot less interesting nowadays. Oh yes: If you want to see a very good movie, look at the original. It's really worth the effort.
