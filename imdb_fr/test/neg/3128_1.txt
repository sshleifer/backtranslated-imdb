It must be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> We are supposed to love and encourage an arrogant bank robber, I know it all, in the bank, played by Dale Robertson, and Linda Darnell in a red firefighter dress. She had to be sewn into this bodice! <br /> <br /> A film senator thinks Native Americans and Whites should try to get along, but bigots win the day. I could hardly sit in the endless dialogue of bigotry coming out of the mouths of other characters. <br /> <br /> Apart from Wounded Knee and Dances with Wolves, few films give a positive image of American Indians and very few old westerns do. This one is exceptionally bad in this respect. <br /> <br /> The love relationship between Robertson and Darnell bit me to the teeth, as he swaggered, forcing her to kiss him as she played the old hard game. <br /> <br /> There are scenes that are unintentionally humorous, such as characters who obviously do not really rise in a diligence on several levels. <br /> <br /> A strangely humorous incident in history is Linda Darnell's character goes to great lengths to buy tickets for the stagecoach, and then asks a horse to come up, a few minutes later, without apparent reason. <br /> <br /> Another humorous scene is one where stagecoach reaches a screeching stop at the sight of a cowboy hat lying down the road, and not just that, but ALL passengers hurry to watch. See more. <br /> <br /> 1 star.
