It's a shame that quality actors like Baldwin and Booth have to succumb to unhealthy stories and scripts just for the money. But, hey, it's a cruel world ... <br /> <br /> This is an example of a long line of murderous thrillers that use all the usual narrative twists to try to make it more appealing than he is not. Of course, there are good locations, it's smooth production, there's good camera work and editing, and it's pretty rhythmic overall. <br /> <br /> So what's the real problem? Quite simply, the premise is totally unbelievable. However, instead of spoiling a rotten story, I'll let you find out what it's all about, if you can do it. I did it, but only because I love Baldwin and I kept hoping it will get better. <br /> <br /> This has not been the case. And, he had one of the most anti-climatic endings I've known for a long time. In fact, maybe never ... <br /> <br /> But it's a harmless pleasure, I suppose, if you have nothing better to do.
