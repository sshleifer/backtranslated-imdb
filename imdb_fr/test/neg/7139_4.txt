The Grudge 2 ... Let's see. Do not get me wrong, I'm neither a Japanese horror movie nor a horror or grudge movie. I loved the first and the original Ju-On. I think a lot more justice could have been done for this one. Aubrey only existed to clarify what had to be "discovered" in the end (which, if you've already seen Ju-On before, you already know the whole movie) was a complete remake of Ju-On, followed by more near that The Grudge. Although everyone thought the arrival to America was a little interesting, it was planned, as the burning house at the end of The Grudge left the 2nd thirsty for a new plot. <br /> <br /> Save $ 6.50 and wait for it to come out on DVD, rent it, watch it, then decide if you want to buy it. This film is good for falling asleep at 2 o'clock in the morning. But all in all, I would say a 4 out of 10. Sorry, Grudge fans, it's just ... They just failed this one.
