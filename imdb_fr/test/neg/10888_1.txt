This film must be classified with "Welcome to the Jungle", "The Hitcher" and "Dream Catcher" for pure horror. You have the most irritating heroine in the history of the blood who spends most of her time crying, moaning and screaming - all the time in the most horrible of the rest toilets ever filmed. Why she spends so much time in this horrible bathroom of hell is never explained. Even when the usual killer truck driver tries to kill her, she refuses to leave the store. When a police officer comes to his rescue, the driver of the killer truck passes over his legs while the heroine looks. Instead of taking her weapon to protect herself, she drags the poor penny into the crapper and locks the door. Then the cop orders him to blow his brain because of the pain. She does it - moaning, sobbing, and getting angry - and hurts herself in the back of her head. Then - the cop, still alive, begs her to shoot him again because he is still in pain. He says that while the entire back of his head is on the floor. The heroine in tears and tears pulls him again. The film continues like this, it makes no sense. The heroine is so unfriendly that you really want the killer to take it off early. I saw this movie on the Sci-Fi channel, so it did not cost me to watch, but I watched it anyway, fascinated by the way a film could end so badly.
