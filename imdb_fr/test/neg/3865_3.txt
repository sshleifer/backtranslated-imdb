It was such a dreadful film, almost a comedy of a film noir. The budget was low compared to a blockbuster, but still higher than most others.But that's where they decided to cut costs, which is totally bizarre.Some less competent players, while others seem being dragged into the street. One of them being the main actor, he is so awful that I collapsed every time he said something (he speaks through the film ENTIER). At the beginning of the film, all the characters wear clothes from the 1930s. They drive a classic car, but the background is a state-of-the-art modern wind farm. And the costumes and some sets continue to follow the theme of the film noir of the 30s. Then, BAM leads a new escalation with rims of 24 inches .... WTF. Same thing when a guy has a night-time riflescope on his rifle, you get a shot.Hes aiming for a guy with a mp5 and tactical gear on.In an even stranger contrast, the locations are shining and seem like the camera is taking very well the angles of view and shows these places brilliantly in the scenes. The director has a watchful eye for a beautiful picture, but does not know how to do otherwise. . <br /> <br /> People who should be shot for this film ▼ <br /> <br /> The author The director The casting agent The costume designer <br /> <br /> People who should be tortured Death for their monotonous and monotonous nails with chalk voice. ▼ <br /> <br /> Anton Pardoe - lead actor, screenwriter, producer If you've ever seen the movie Hostel, I'd like that to happen to this guy, but he does not escape.
