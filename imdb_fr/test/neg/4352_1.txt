It's the slowest film noir movie I've ever seen. The very weak scenario only gives Jack Palance and Rod Steiger the opportunity to perform exceptionally well the lines prepared for an interim hearing. Palance and Steiger claim to be serious actors, able to describe their respective roles with power, emotion and drama. The story itself advances at an incredibly slow pace, taking place mainly in a living room. The director has obviously shifted actors into a rhythmic circle to create a succession of exhausting feature films, so that the slow pace is not perceptible to the audience. The action does not begin until the last ten minutes of the film. If you want more depth in a crime drama, it does not suit you!
