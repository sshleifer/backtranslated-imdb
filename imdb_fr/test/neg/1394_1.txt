Yes, it's true, it's without a doubt the worst show in the history of television. If you'd like to witness a comical humorous, lonely and humble comedian attempt to entertain the masses with half an hour of pale and tired social gossip that your slightly delayed cousin commented at the Thanksgiving dinner table, it might be the show for you. This is presented as a comedy edgy my friends but to be honest it makes Tim Allen look like Richard Pryor. Avoid at all costs. Unless you are a masochist.
