This film does its best to be a movie "action", but it fails miserably. <br /> <br /> Steve Guttenberg plays at the head of an elite counter-terrorist team that fails (?) in his attempt to keep a mysterious group from stealing a deadly nerve agent. <br /> <br /> The story ... the acting ... the special effects ... ALL IN AUTUMN !!! <br /> <br /> It is absolutely necessary to avoid that! !!!
