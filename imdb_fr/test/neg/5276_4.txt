German regional radio station WDR showed "The General" and ODC. Saturday, I saw "The General" and I thought it was not very serious, but not very good too. But yesterday I saw ODC and turned it off after about an hour. Although Kevin Spacey was the main actor, the movie was totally confusing and seemed hectic. "The General" told the story directly and ordered, but ODC just wanted to be cool. There is a reference to Guy Ritchie Movies' "Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Cannons" and "Snatch" movies, but it does not have the freshness of these films. <br /> <br /> So, in the end, I would evaluate it 3 out of 10!
