A complete zero out of four. A worse summary Ajooba: awful. In fact, more words come to mind: ridiculous, third degree and terrible. It's one of Amitabh's worst films to date, it's throbbing in a cheap leather jacket and a fashionable Zorro-style mask just as cheap as garlands, with what looks like wings on the sides. <br /> Persia or Arabia and is typically not historical for an Indian movie. As mentioned above, a K-Mart leather jacket with velcro straps did not exist 400 years ago, unless all my history teachers were mistaken. <br /> <br /> Rishi also makes his travesty patented in this film. Far from being funny, it's very embarrassing to watch. What could the son of the legendary Raj Kapoor have to erase the memory of his house this way on screen? <br /> <br /> As for the benefits, if you want to laugh, check out this movie. Flagrant inconsistencies in plot and costume do not weigh in the face of awful dialogues and mediocre games.
