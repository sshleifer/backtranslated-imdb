The costumes are outrageous and the Australian outback landscape is fun to watch, but there's an advantage to this story - a middle benefit - about drag queens. I particularly noticed this in the character of Terrence Stamp, "Ralph Bernadette Bassenger". It may have been appropriate because Ralph-Bernadette and his group of "queens" are not "gentlemen". <br /> <br /> Once again, we have the strong liberal tendency that says that everything is allowed and that if you are not "with", or in this case, favorable to homosexuality, you are a homophobic. (Gasp!) <br /> <br /> What's really disturbing is the end when a young boy leaves with his "alternative" father and embraces his gay lifestyle, not because he fits the story, but because it fits the agenda of the people who wrote the script. Pitiful.
