It is actually a terrible movie with some features that may or may not use it for you, depending on your desires. In the "opening" of the Red Green Show for the big screen, the filmmakers cast off the rustic charm neatly pinned for a decade of episodes unfolding in and around Possum Lodge in favor of a bland "road movie" with a horrible "fat" fictional Hollywood music score and deeply boring scenario that is not embellished with enough gags to make it as entertaining as the poorest episode of the TV series. <br /> <br /> Having designed a screenplay that keeps the members of Possum Lodge off the screen for most of the movie and forces almost everyone involved to be scornfully naughty to the lovable Harold (who is the movie's hero) The usually dreadfully crispy Red being relegated to this incarnation as Patrick Harold and Peter Keleghan, as Harold and Ranger Gord, deliver satisfying large-format versions of their characters on a small screen.
