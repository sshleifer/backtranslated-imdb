With a lot of expectations, I went to see this film, the contribution of Spain to the Oscar race this year. The film is too long, totally useless, banal, pathetic, poorly written, edited, played and directed. He fails to transmit the "message" he tries to convey, he fails in his narrative narratives, his clumsy historical contexts and, above all, in his pace. There are such extreme misfits that I have not seen in a movie for a long time (the story of Lucas whose dead sister lives in his head, the divine revelations, all these absurdities of lizards). The Spanish-speaking public around me was yawning and was quickly losing patience. Some of the comments I heard were whether members of the Spanish Academy had taken drugs before choosing the film for the Oscars.
