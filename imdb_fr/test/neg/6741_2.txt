I have watched a lot of television over the years. So much so that when I start seeing new shows that look like old shows, I get insulted. Fortunately, I'm not too sensitive because all that Hot Properties does is update the cast of "Designing Women" and drop them in New York instead of Georgia. <br /> <br /> TV-14-ish jokes, but that does not improve the show. The only thing this show has proven is that Nicole Sullivan is so good that she could have done a show like "My Mother the Car" a classic. Her comic skills are reminiscent of Lucille Ball, even more funny today. Unfortunately, the rest of the cast is flashy and sexy, which could be good for brainless soap, but they are just not funny. <br /> <br /> Fred
