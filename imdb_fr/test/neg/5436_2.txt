The book, although not particularly great, was decent, but this film completely changes it. Many elements of the story are coherent between the book and the film, but the character of Dr. Ross goes from a written creative character who lives for the money and ends up causing the volcanic eruption with his greed to a heart crazy. - a damsel in distress who will not do anything if she catches the slightest hint that he could be less than noble. When movies change the book as much as they do, but keep the same name, it should be a crime.
