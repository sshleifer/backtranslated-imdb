One of the worst movies I have ever seen. Completely ridiculous. The story is bad. The animations are completely childish and displaced. The physics of holograms is hilarious about how completely wrong they are. OMG, I even want to believe that this movie carries the Disney label. Yuck. The actresses are a bit beautiful, but there are so many good movies with amazing actresses that have much more value to see than this one. Last remark, bad movie. Do not bother to watch. If you're looking for movies to see with your kids, consider other solutions such as Ratattuile, Monster Inc or An Enchanted Story (on theaters). Seriously.
