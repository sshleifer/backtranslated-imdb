Give director Stanley Tong of Super Cop Jackie Chan and Rumble in the Bronx, and what do you get? You receive a series of kung-fu fights and a lack of madness similar to that of Magoo. <br /> <br /> The limited plot that Magoo (Leslie Nielsen) has put in an international plot, where he steals a world-renowned gem. Of course, he has no idea what he's doing. In fact, he has no idea he has the gem. <br /> <br /> In thirty minutes, you could be bored a lot by watching this. There are some very fun times, like when cooking chicken. You want to be as shortsighted as Magoo. It's a fun movie to watch but it's a disaster! You have to love Leslie Nielson because he made some very funny movies. This is not his best, but he does a good job playing Magoo. I thought it was a funny movie and it should be recommended to young kids as they will probably think it's very funny.
