I loved the blood and gore. The kind of violence is what Alien and Predator movies are and nobody is spared. That really answers the question of how it would be if extraterrestrials were on Earth. The answer to this question is simple. We are screwed up. The effects were beautiful. However, there are real problems with it. <br /> <br /> 1) The acting was awful from the human characters that almost made me sleepy because of the drought and boredom that interrupted the flow of the movie and was very boring. The writers could have done much better SOOOOOOO. The good part was the Alien and Predator acting game, which, in my opinion, was very well done. <br /> <br /> 2) The size of the Predator ship was much smaller than that of the first AvP movie. It scratched my head <br /> <br /> 3) Predators with their masks in place while they were still in the ship. It annoys people and I do not understand why. It's not a plot like most people do. So I tell you, people, calm down. It's not a big deal. If this helps you feel better, remember, they had a bored face mask in the storage, which could well explain why. <br /> <br /> 4) The Predator fires with its plasma launcher inside the ship. I thought it was pretty stupid on the part of the predators. But then, I started to think that if it was a young panicked predator. <br /> <br /> 5) The hunter and his son arrived almost instantly at the crash site after a few kilometers of fall. At least they did not bother us by showing them running through the woods for 30 minutes. so be happy with that. <br /> <br /> 6) Why did a single predator go? I thought it was strange. But then, I thought it was because he thought it was a single Predalian he was attacking, not an epidemic. <br /> <br /> 7) Why are the ship's Predators not self-destructing? Well, if people were attentive, we did it, but he was killed before he could activate it completely. <br /> <br /> 8) The unlimited blue melting layer. I thought it was pretty stupid. <br /> <br /> 9) A predator conceals evidence with the sticky substance but gives the name of a policeman. It was also stupid. <br /> <br /> 10) The power failure. Come on, people, an Alien and Pred fought in a power plant. <br /> <br /> 11) Predalien being half-face / queen. It really ticked me off. I am a fanatic Alien and Pred. I know that aliens do not! Just as they do not give birth like a human does as they showed in Alien4 !! Of all the comic books, games, books and movies 1, 2 and 3, clearly shows their behavior. They need a queen for laying, the eggs hatch in the infected host of the face, the parasite appears and kills the host and turns into a drone if it infects a human, a Predalian with a predator and a runner with kind of animal on all fours. And then, after living for years and years, they turned into Preatorian (a mini-queen who does not lay eggs), I can go on and on, but I will not do it. But this scene alone almost ruined the film for me. If the directors are clever, they would edit this by creating a face that would infect pregnant women. <br /> <br /> Anyway, if you go see this movie, go see it for aliens and predators. And when the scene where Predalin infects pregnant women appears ... Close your eyes so you do not have to see this insult to the Alien and Pred universe.
