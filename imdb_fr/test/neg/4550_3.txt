If you like the soap series, you may like this movie. I recommend this film to fans of Dutch soap operas such as GTST, Westenwind or even American movies like The Bold & The Beautiful. If you do not like it, stay away from this movie. He has the same visual style, the same quality of actor, director and writer. The film was a huge success on the national territory but has not been sold anywhere but in Holland and Belgium. Strange enough for a commercial movie like this. <br /> <br /> Maybe it says something ....
