Perhaps the worst movie I have ever seen. The person who shot this film probably never learned not to film directly in a bright light. You can not see anything in this movie. It's night. The parts where you can see something that the camera is directed directly to a light source so that you get large flares of lenses. So, you still can not see. This film should have been a radio play or something else. Some parts of the film are actually turned upside down to create a shitty effect. Low budget movies can be made so much better than that. And the small budget is not an excuse for that. A publisher should have said something when he started editing and saw that you could not see anything. Maybe the manufacturers should have spent some of their small budget on a preview monitor so they could see what they shot. The only good thing about this movie is so dark is that you can not see the terrible actor. It also covers the shit sfx. In beginner film schools, people make better films than those. Movies shot with camcorders much prettier than that.
