I find it disconcerting that at a time when satisfying and fulfilling spirituality is unknown and that we are all scattered throughout the spectrum of possible beliefs, a charlatan and a fraud of the caliber of Gurdjieff (as a charlatan, he is exceptional; can not deny it's a pity that he abused it, although the enlargement of his wounded ego, feeding on the adulation of imprudent sheep who were his orders and who admired him) can inspire adherence and credulity as extreme. This film presents an idealized version of Gurdjieff's largely fictional and fantastic narrative of his training and "waking" (which I would describe as his discovery of the extent to which he could influence the spirit and will of certain types of sadly disoriented people). See, if you dare to have an unpleasant revelation that we are unfortunately deprived of true religious leaders, as far as a clown like Gurdjieff could inspire such dedication - and make sure your blood pressure medicine is within reach of hand if you wish. are one of those who still hope that a healthy religion will emerge from the ruins of Christianity, as a supreme example of cinematography at the service of the locals and the pretext of a dysfunctional cult.
