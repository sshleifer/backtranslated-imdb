I note that the majority of comments so far have been, if not too positive, at least positive. I can not understand that. The only explanation I can find is that the people who commented have something to do with the movie, because it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen. "Boggy Creek II" and "Mutant" look like horror masterpieces. The acting is at best fragile, and horrible for the most part. The entire film is almost black as pitch, probably to be able to shoot the film in the same place. The monster looks like one of Roger Corman's worst movies. And the plot ... well, the less we say, the better. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs.
