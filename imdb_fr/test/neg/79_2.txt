No, no, no, no, no, no, no! It's not a movie, it's an excuse to show people dancing. It's just not good. Even the dance is slow and not as entertaining as the mediocre 'Dirty Dancing', not to mention any good dance movie. <br /> <br /> Is it a love story? Is it a musical? Is it a drama? Is it a comedy? It's not that this movie is a bit of everything, it's that this movie fails everything it tries to be. The film is even more meaningless as the film progresses. <br /> <br /> The role is terrible on all sides, the scenario definitely tries to tell us something about the relationship but fails miserably. <br /> <br /> SHOW FOR THE MOMENT - When Patrick Stewart comes on the scene and you think the film could improve, it lights up the dull atmosphere. For a second.
