A long time ago, in a distant galaxy (its familiar), water became the most valuable good (it must sound familiar) and a small minority control its distribution (what a surprise, just to have a heart attack and die of this surprise). A group of ice pirates (renegades on the water? Wet bandits? ... oh, wait, the latter was used) trying to find the way to an unlimited source of unlimited water with a princess lovely but droll (Druish?) and a group of idiots idiots in pursuit. <br /> <br /> This film has the potential to be a great comic parody ("Star Wars", "The Dune" by David Lynch), but not handled properly. I think the term is "low humor". It does not really succeed to be so funny, which is a shame, because it includes Angelica Houston, Ron Perlman and Robert Urich (hence the three stars) who are not really slackers in the department of actors. <br /> <br /> Definitely a rental and definitely a drink.
