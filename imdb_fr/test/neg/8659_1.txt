It's the worst movie I've ever seen and what disappoints me the most is that it's a yash raj movie, so in the beginning, when you see the promos, you think that is definitely another hit of yash raj. I am disappointed that the plot is stupid and stupid, we have often seen him get married and fall in love with a girl blah blah blah. If you see this pathetic film, do not go with your family, there is too much exposure and scenes of kisses. I do not even see why you would go see him yourself. all in all, it's a disgusting outrageous and all that is bad and that starts with a movie d do not go see it, you end up hating the movies yash ji and yash raj
