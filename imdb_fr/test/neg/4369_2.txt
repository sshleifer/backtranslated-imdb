I've never seen the first Killjoy movie, and I've never heard a good thing about it. So I see Killjoy 2 in the local Blockbusters, pick it up and look in the back. With Trent Haaga and Debbie Rochon, she boasts. As a big fan of Troma I am, there is no way I do not rent this movie, how is it possible that it's bad with these two? Oh, how wrong I was. Even Trent and Debbie can not save this movie excuse from being as bad as it is. Trent stinks frankly like Killjoy, although this is probably the fault of the writers, who give him some of the worst one-liners in the film's history. Debbie makes a strong performance but that is not enough. The killings are terrible, as are the effects of blood. For example, check when the guy is supposed to be impaled on something. And to top it off, this ending is one of the worst I've ever seen in the history of cinema. The movie does not even work so badly that it's a good level. Avoid like the shot. <br /> <br /> 2/10
