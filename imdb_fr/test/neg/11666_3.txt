This is without a doubt one of the worst movies I have ever seen. However, he is also one of the most hilarious involuntarily. I like to compare that to Plan 9, in that it can be so terrible, so horrible, so stupid and so useless that I find myself laughing out loud. <br /> <br /> One of my biggest problems with this is a Robin Hood scam, and I say Robin Hood with Errol Flynn and Robin Hood: Men in Tights. But let's see things, forbidden love between Peck (who blames him definitively, even if in all fairness, it was still a few years before the masterpiece To Kill a Mockingbird) and the female character (who is so much forgettable, apparently, I forgot his name.), At the final scene where the gentiles disguise themselves as monks to deceive the wicked screams "ROBIN HOOD" all over it. <br /> <br /> However, I do not think the film is worth watching. On the contrary, I think it's one of the funniest movies I've seen in years, even if it's unintentional.
