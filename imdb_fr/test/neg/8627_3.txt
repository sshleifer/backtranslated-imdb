A real insult to the original "Spoorloos", which is one of the most disturbing films (and I intend to congratulate him!) That I have seen in recent years. <br /> <br /> Where the original is cool and awesome, the remake is flat and even boring, especially the final "happy ending" removes the little suspense that reigned in this film. <br /> <br /> While such a distortion (including "happy end", which did not exist before) is quite often the case in "Hollywood", and could have been expected, the biggest disappointment lies in the fact that this inept disorder was created by the same filmmaker who made the original "Spoorloos" ... <br /> <br /> Why me, Mr. Sluizer decided to spoil his masterpiece of this way, it's beyond me. <br /> <br /> Avoid this abomination at all costs, as it may spoil the original even if you look * after * that, let alone the opposite ...
