Rourke plays his usual role as a grim, vindictive, Neanderthalian, ferocious and diabolical jerk, in the same mold as in "Picture Claire", "Out in Fifty", "Get Carter", "Double Team" and the rest of the trash in which it is located. <br /> <br /> He has very few lines. <br /> <br /> Of course, all this is a junk, undervaluing Rourke, lowering it, and that does not matter for his qualification of actor.However, after seeing " To Prayer ... "," Johnny Handsome "," Barfly "," 9 1/2 weeks "," Year of the Dragon ", etc., etc., for several years, I considered Rourke as a remarkable man, intelligent and intelligent. I think he has changed since. <br /> <br /> He looks callous, calcined. <br /> <br /> "He walked with dark looks, / Despair dwelt in his chest / And made man a perfect pest." (Belloc, "The Example"). <br /> <br /> I had absolutely no other reason to watch this monotonous movie except that Rourke was there.
