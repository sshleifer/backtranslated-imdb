CRYSTAL VOYAGER is a strange documentary about an eccentric surfer living in Australia. A native American, George Greenough, has been surfing and photographing himself, with friends and recently with dolphins, in Australia for 35 years. He uses all reinvented cameras that he attaches to his back, his boat or his boat. In the mid-1970s, he teamed up with David Elfick, editor-in-chief of Surf Mag and aspiring filmmaker, to create this visually interesting tale about this life and photography. CRYSTAL VOYAGER ran for 75 minutes. Even in the '70s, the audience was a little disconcerted by this movie, or surf movie, or surf movie, because George is swimming on a zipped board for kids, not a real surfboard .... that compensates for the drone tedious George (sometimes It's funny or funny that it's actually funny ... like to get almost on fire or fall on something) with a spectacular "you're there" slides through a wave that lasts 23 minutes, on bottom Pink Floyd. In 1974, during the opening of the Sydney Opera House, it also contained a cinema. Crystal Voyager was booked there as an artistic and sporting photo, and by default, it became a success: as "opera tickets" cost far more than a movie ticket, the public flocked for to see this film as an excuse for Sydney Opera House '... So the film recorded business as a low-budget attraction for locals and tourists who wanted to tell neighbors that they had seen a show "out there" . This created the myth that the film had attracted a lot of people and the reputation spread. As a result, he was associated with the fantasy cartoon FANTASTIC PLANET and had a thrilling run across the UK and Europe in doubles. I ran it in a coastal cinema in the 70s and the crowd was rather disconcerted. Recently, George re-emerged in the style of Lord Of The Flies with another well-photographed marine adventure called DOLPHIN GLIDE that offers viewers a dive and a swim with the wild dolphins of Byron Bay. It's an eccentric short film of 20 minutes with an even more eccentric short film of 20 minutes. The media and the public both met with a collective yawn in January 2005 [...], making CRYSTAL VOYAGER a joke "you must have been there" a long time ago. However, during a special Oz Surf evening in an open-air cinema last year, 2,000 people came forward ... but then, every night, there are 2,000 spectators to see anything during this summer season of movies ... office frenzy. How many people really enjoyed the debate? Once again, they were more than likely puzzled by this crazy movie with an astonishing reputation. Since 1975, however, Elfick has had a successful career as a producer and director of many acclaimed Australian and international films. Look for NO WORRIES, STARSTRUCK, UNDERCOVER or RABBIT PROOF FENCE or LOVE IN LIMBO for clear and present applause on his exploits. George, however, still floats somewhere there, somewhere purring and looking for something else to film or drop off a camera.
