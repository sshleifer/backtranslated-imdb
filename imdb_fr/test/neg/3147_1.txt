I did not watch this show a lot when I was little. And I think I only watched an episode about the railways, I think because I loved trains and still love them. Even then, I thought it was a baby show. I mostly watched Arthur. The songs are pretty strange too. And I do not think it's that educational. They just sing some silly rhymes. It's a silly show, all the adults who love it are crazy! If you want good kids shows, watch something like Arthur, Mister Rogers Neighborhood or even better Pee-wee's Playhouse. I thought Sesame Street was boring when I was little, but even better than Barney. Believe me, this show is pretty stupid, there are other shows for kids that are better than this one. I can see a lot of criticism here that a lot of people do not like this show. Now, there are mature people. I hope they will soon come out of this show.
