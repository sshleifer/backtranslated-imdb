*** GREAT SPOILERS! *** "The feast of the flesh" of 1970 is a conclusion more than unworthy of the career of the great Veronica Lake. This has the vast reputation of being a terrible stinker, and rightly so, I must say. As a big fan of Horror / Low Budget Exploitation, especially from the 70s, I nevertheless chose to watch it, mainly because of the very cool camp photo on this site, but after watching it, I had to admit that the picture actually had nothing to do with the movie. The photo here on this site is the cover of a DVD collection entitled "Flesh Feast" containing four films, including "Mountain Of The Cannibal God" by Sergio Martino and "I Eat Your Skin" by Dal Tenney. What the collection does not understand, however, is this boring turkey. "Flesh Feast" is not only camp and ridiculous, but mostly quite tedious, which is even more pathetic in that the film only lasts 70 minutes. Also, do not be fooled by the title, the movie is not gore at all. However, it is observable, if only for its faults and especially for its extremely stupid end, but so somewhat amusing. The film follows a ridiculous plot about Dr. Elaine Frederick (Veronica Lake), an ingenious female scientist who can somehow rebuild youth with flesh-eating larvae (do not ask how). A group of criminals (or terrorists, or other) paid by a radical political group, instruct the doctor to restore the youth of a "mysterious" commander. After an endless hour of absurd fighting, it turns out that the mysterious commander is actually Hitler himself. It was pretty obvious before, but I still had to laugh because the movie's finale was incredibly stupid and unintentionally hilarious ... It's a film that is very inadequate like the latest movie of a great actress and former queen beauty like Veronika Lake. Except for Lake, performance is ridiculously bad, even for zero-budget production like this. I can easily forgive bad performances in movies like this one. What I can not forgive, however, is extreme trouble. The last five minutes make viewers unconditional to the camp stuff, but I would still recommend avoiding them.
