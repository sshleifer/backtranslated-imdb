This is not a new movie. This is a cover of "Emmanuelle, queen of the galaxy" of 1994, which has been greatly truncated. Be careful: many characters appear in the cut credits of the film! <br /> <br /> If you want to see this one in its original form, get yourself "Queen" - avoid it at all costs, the cuts make it even more agitated than it was at originally.
