If this film had been in English, all critics would have rejected it. The language is extremely bad, the scenes are terribly directed and it's not funny at all. After the movie, I thought that this film could have been written by an 8th grader, at least if one considers the lack of credible characters and the fixation of certain parts of the body of the man. (oh, about the dogs too ...) The story is simply absurd compared to the more mature Vingar av glas, which started almost at the same time. Of course, the public chose Jalla! Jalla! while Vingar av glas had little attention. <br /> <br /> What really bothered me was that the movie looks really bad. This is probably because the director Josef Fares, for the first time, used a really cheap photographic equipment and then decided to play with, for fun, I suppose. The result, however, is a film that can easily be divided into 12 short films with a new directorial style in each of them. It was very frustrating. Maybe Josef Fares should have stayed with his shorts because that seems to be the only form of art he can master. <br /> <br /> Another disturbing fact is that history does not hold. Several times in the middle of the film, the story must happen very quickly and the characters then meet in a way too incredible. <br /> <br /> And then I did not mention 2-dimensional characters, especially those of secondary roles. <br /> <br /> Even though I consider it to be one of the worst and most overrated Swedish films of the '90s, it is quite understandable that the public liked it. I mean, bad taste has always been the hallmark of the masses ... <br /> <br /> I am more surprised that critics have appreciated it. They should have known better ... <br /> <br /> 2nd year out of 10 <br /> <br />
