* SPOILERS INCLUDED * <br /> <br /> The brilliant and innovative adaptation of Robert Bloch's novel by Alfred Hitchcock was an amazing film, one of a kind. Every shot, every camera angle, every shade was PERFECT. He did not just break the rules, he created new ones. <br /> <br /> Here is the fin: there is absolutely nothing new, different or original in this film. Gus Van Sant does not just pay homage to Hitch, he pulls out all the ideas and does it in a less original and more conventional way. I had nothing against Gus Van Sant before seeing this movie. I liked Drugstore Cowboy and I thought My Own Private Idaho was a very interesting movie. The burning question in my mind regarding Psycho's remake is, "Why did you do it, Gus?" <br /> <br /> In my mind, there are only two reasons to make a remake: 1) The original was a good story, but the movie was nil. 2) The original was a good movie, but someone thought of a new approach to the material. None of these factors are present in Gus Van Sant's version of Psycho. Apart from the fact that it is in color and that there is a scene in which there is a montage of troubling images concerning the possible dialogue of the main character (which I found useless), there is nothing new here. <br /> <In addition, I found that the casting left something to be desired. Anne Heche was as good as Marion, but she lacked a certain vulnerability that Janet Leigh described in the original. I did not feel as much sympathy for her character as the choices she faced seemed much less limited as a woman in today's society, as opposed to the choices she would have faced as a single woman living in the early 1960s. Vince Vaughn had some laughter with his interpretation of an incredibly naive Norman Bates, but I think Anthony's nervous and haunted timing and timing were far more frightening. The only performance I liked better than the original was the character of Lila Crane, played by Jullianne Moore. As usual, she was excellent and brought new strength and intelligence to the character. <br /> <br /> To be honest, there is some very nice camera work, especially during the famous "bathroom scene" in which Van Sant takes advantage of his use of color to show the murder in vibrant shades of purple. And yet, throughout the movie, I had this frustrating feeling of deju vu. Have not I seen this somewhere before? Oh, wait, I already saw that somewhere! Almost every scene seems to have been copied, taken for shooting the original. We almost feel that the director made this film as a school project. "See, I can also make a Hitchcock movie!" <br /> <br /> If it's not already done, go see the original. He has been delayed over the years and beats this little mediocrity hands down. You will not be disappointed.
