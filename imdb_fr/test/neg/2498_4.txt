Well, since his name is Porno Holocaust and Joe D'Amato realizes it, I started this film in the hope of losing it ... and even if I understood it a bit, Porno Holocaust Was a huge disappointment because it's so damn BORING. The title suggests that the movie will feature porn, and it's not fake - Porn Holocaust is pretty much just porn, and most of them are identical, again and again, I was moving fast before the end. The first sex scene takes place between two women and that gave me hope, but after that, it degenerates into normal porn, and the rest of the movie (during the first hour!) Consists of lyrics, and you can imagine to what a fun point that is to get through! The plot focuses on a desert island where, whether or not a strange thing is happening. Naturally, a group of people, made up of a few men and scientists, who happen to be all sexy women, will soon arrive on the island. They have sex a few times and strange things happen, then over an hour later they are attacked by a mutant zombie creature with an eye for the ladies ... <br /> <br /> That had to seem like a good idea for an original porn - a zombie who likes to do it, but no surprise it does not work at all. The film is only two hours ahead of ten minutes, which is far too long for a film like this. I do not know why the pornographic holocaust is as long as it is; if they had just cut one minute of each sex scene, the film would have lasted less than 90 minutes, which would have made the movie much more bearable! The zombie takes what seems like an eternity (it's quite a long time before there is a long enough sexual break for them to go to the island in the first place), and when it finally appears, is a huge disappointment! I realize it's a budget B-movie bag, but D'Amato would surely have been able to try a little harder and come up with something better than this one! I will not even bother to mention acting, the atmosphere, etc., it's useless. Holocaust porn is basically just your average dull porn movie with a slight pinch of horror, and I can not recommend it!
