As Ms. Frank's faithful, I remember being so excited that the piece was redesigned for television. Until I see it ... This film is an excellent example of the importance of casting and how staging plays such an important role in creating motivation. The casting of any role of CENTRAL is CRUCIAL for a production of this kind ... shows like AUNTIE MAME and MAN OF LA MANCHA are totally dependent on the charisma of the main actor. And in the cast of this film, everything is destroyed by the dreadful casting of Melissa Gilbert in the lead role. There is not ONE MOMENT that Mrs. Gilbert has even lived in Anne's sensitive and mature mind. Mrs. Gilbert is a "white bread" throughout the film ... the only time I was on the verge of tears was during the reading. Anne's most obsessive sentence: "I still believe, despite everything, that people are really good at heart" - this is said by Mrs. Gilbert so hasty, so lacking in conviction, that she may have succeeded and managed to do the same. effect. The legend of the film and dance Marge Champion was the coach of the dialogue for this production. She should have paid back her salary! Although Ms. Gilbert ruined DIARY, other performances are mostly satisfactory: special congratulations to Joan Plowright for Edith, Scott Jacoby for Peter and Clive Reville for Mr. Dussell. Maxmillian Schell does not have the soul and soul deeply rooted like Otto, unlike the creator of the role on stage and the movie (Joseph Schildkraut), but that's fine. Doris Roberts and James Coco as The Van Danns are relatively superficial - they are sharp and dazzling, but again, they are only superficial. This could be due to the fact that the pace of the project is far too hurried (as stated in previous comments) - this film is timed 45 minutes less than the movie version - the difference due to breaks for a dramatic effect, which is apparently necessary to propagate the appropriate MOOD for the story. This viewing is NOT mandatory, especially for young people who are new to Anne Frank, stay tuned for the original version of the film and, best of all, ANNE FRANK's TV production: THE REAL HISTORY starring Ben Kingsley. capture the rifts and reality of Anne's never filmed situation! Note: The fact that Melora Marshall, who plays Anne's sister, Margot, is NOT included in the opening credits, as well as all the other members of The Secret Annex ... is particularly appalling ... she is listed in the post-credits with the actors who play Miep. and Mr. Kraler. If I were Mrs. Marshall, I would have SUED!
