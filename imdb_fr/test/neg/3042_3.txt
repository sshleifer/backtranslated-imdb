While guarding in an isolated Colorado home, a teenager is terrorized on the phone by an elusive murderer. <br /> <br /> Remake of the semi-classic horror film of 1979 takes essentially the first 20 minutes of the original film and stretches for a duration of 87 minutes! It is therefore useless to say that the plot of this remake is quite thin. There is little originality or interest in this film. Many Camilla Belle wonder about a dark house wondering who calls him and who meets all sorts of false fears. All of this becomes repetitive and routine after the first 30 minutes and never manages to collect a lot of suspense or chills. Admittedly, it never reaches the intensity of the original movie, especially since it disappears and changes an important point of the plot compared to the original. I think we have to thank PG-13 for that. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, there is an impressive scenography and a dark atmosphere. Unfortunately, there is not much around for this remake to be avoided. sub-para. Belle's performance is also pretty mediocre. <br /> <br /> It's just another awesome remake. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 on ****
