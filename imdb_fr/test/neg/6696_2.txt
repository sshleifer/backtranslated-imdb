A bad basketball movie. A gruff coach with dubious backgrounds arrives in a small Indiana high school basketball team in the 1950s and trains the boys to victory by "breaking them down first and then strengthening them." <br /> <br /> subjugate. OK photography. But the plot is totally predictable. No real subplots. Nothing has been added to make the film exciting. You know what will happen from the beginning. Suitable for 4th graders.
