Sorry, I could not disagree more with the latest comments. Frankly, I thought it was worse than Carry on Columbus, enough said. The last, usually awesome, movie of THE, Charles Hartrey, which seemed to be out of place while the humor had gone to the very spiritual level in the buses, movies at the same time, was frankly more fun. Barbara Windsor was embarrassing, character as one of your dragote friends of your mother who still thinks to be 18 years old, on vacation with a non-scotsman, Rab c Nesbit is not him. The series miraculously dragged with duffers like Carry on Behind and Carry on England. Carry on Dick was not bad, but really with this movie the end of the series was close, shame because until this movie I can not think of a bad movie before that?
