To be honest, the movie was so horrible that I liked it. Never in my life have I seen such a terrible movie. I was shocked. I mean, I do not even know what to say. <br /> <br /> The characters could not even keep their weapons, the minute a guy had an M16 and his friend had a MP5, and at the next scene they traded weapons. (Do not ask me, trust me, I know my weapons) And I'll never understand how they went from a place that looked like Vietnam, to an Arizona highway, to my back yard, to a factory of chemicals in California, that's what I took advantage of. <br /> <br /> Why would you be afraid of a guy wearing a Halloween mask wearing a garbage bag for a cloak and shooting you with plastic arrows? How is this scary? I wanted to swallow the arsenic halfway through the movie. I love how "the skeleton man" randomly decided to make a murderous party that day. But hey, whoever made this film should be shot in the knees and fed a mound of fire ants. <br /> <br /> Have a good day.
