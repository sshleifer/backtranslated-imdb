I mean, come on! Now my compatriots have started making westerns! Is not it enough that our cinema is already afraid? You must now infect English-language movies with acting in Polish and without any sense? Please, stay away from this movie, do not lose sight. A 5 year old baby could make a movie that makes more sense. I come from Poland and I am ashamed of you watching this title. Please, I beg you, do NOT watch this film and if you do, do not judge Polish and Polish films based on what you see there. We had good movies in our history and we had bad ones, but this one - it's not worse than I've seen in my life. Keep away!!!
