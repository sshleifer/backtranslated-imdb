I rented this film in the hope of knowing the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and the beginning of its independence from Belgian domination. I was excited to get acquainted with the characters involved in his story, mainly Lumumba and Mobutu. I wanted to see how the new Congolese government was trying to bring together the various groups opposed to the colonial power, the political motivations of each, the reasons that motivated Belgium's decision to give independence to the DRC, as well as the way in which the states States and the former USSR were involved. Unfortunately, all my questions remained largely unanswered. My belief is that this film was made by people who, passing by the history of the struggle for freedom of the DRC, saw a story full of drama and emotion and decided to exploit it. They then tried to incorporate all the drama points into a scenario, briefed them with a dialogue, went to the set and filmed it. I could be wrong, but if so, it's a lot sadder, because the creators simply had to be too keen to put everything in place and ended up ignoring all the details in order to create a story overall. Whatever the reason, the fact is that the film could be a chronology of long sentences of sentences and facts printed on the screen. The film reviews each major event and gives the viewer a main idea of ​​what's going on, smoothing out the details in order to better understand the big things. For example, Lumumba is captured by the increasingly rebellious army controlled by Mobutu. In this situation, the soldiers have three possible points of view: one who sympathizes with Lumumba, one who will defame Lumumba and one who stands in the middle, sympathetic while obeying orders. Correspondingly, three soldiers speak in the scene, stating lines that shamelessly show their points of view. Then, in order not to have to deal with the real tensions created by these opposing points of view, the writers simply inserted random shots, more soldiers of the army present themselves and eventually hit everyone. This is the extent of the reflection of the film. Most of the time, each character simply states his basic motivations, the other characters respond with theirs, and that's all. There are few things told through actions; even the things they say are directly painful. It is hard to believe that the people represented really acted in this way. Moreover, as part of this direct trend, tensions such as political tension between factions are reduced to mere recognition of the fact - we never know what these factions are, what they are fighting for, their power, if not their existence. The characters are also one-dimensional and flat; Unfortunately, I do not know if Lumumba was in fact a freedom fighter passionately committed to the ideals of Congolese unity, but after about an hour of the film, I certainly did not trust his will anymore. The DRC, like many developing countries, has a complex and important history, especially in the period before and after independence. But telling these stories will only be useful if we recognize the complexity of the situations. Lumumba does not pay enough attention to these details and ends up saying little to the viewer, with the exception of the more general outline.
