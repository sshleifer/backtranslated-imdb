There are places for political commentary in movies, but "Masters of Horror" is not one of them. I get enough of this information from Newsweek and all the other editorials of the newspaper. Now, I have to watch this in horror movies? Let's go there! All I wanted was a good schlock zombie movie, not another "Bush is bad!" blow of mouth. If Joe Dante wants to express his policy, let him go on Air America. And if you have to insist on making a movie "message", be a little more devious about it. This gave the insinuation of being slapped in the face with a dead fish. <br /> <br /> By the way, Joe, do you really want the Left Electoral Bloc to be associated with dead zombies? Perhaps we would like to think about it before making another political horror film (God helps us).
