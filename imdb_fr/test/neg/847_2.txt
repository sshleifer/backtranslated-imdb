I was looking forward to this film. After reading a number of reviews before the release, it looked like a really cool movie, very well filmed and with an interesting cast (Nicholas Cage, Penelope Cruz and John Hurt.) <br /> <br /> it was maybe all these things BUT it's so boring that I challenge almost everyone to watch all this and keep the attention. In addition, Cage's attempt to speak with an Italian accent is embarrassing. He is such a good actor that I got caught every time he spoke in this movie. <br /> <br /> "Disappointing" seems to be the word most often used by critics to describe this movie, and I totally agree with it. <br /> <br /> I guess it did not take long. word to say how bad this movie was because, like Cage's focus, he did not do well.
