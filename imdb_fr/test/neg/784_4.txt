First of all. Should Cameron Diaz be allowed to act again? Calling it a bad performance would be an insult to poor performance. It was a historically horrible performance. Any chance that Diaz had to be a serious actress is now completely over. It's ridiculously horrible. <br /> <br /> Two, the movie was extremely boring and did not cause any thought at all. I can sit and meditate on human nature without having to look at terrible actors, to tell a terrible story. <br /> <br /> Third, there was not one sympathetic character, and even worse, it seemed like it was done by design. You were not supposed to like or feel sympathy for any character. It was quite effective. I wanted them to all die to be honest. Extraterrestrials included. Kid included. Everyone was just a big mope in this movie. Everyone literally ran a race, and they called it a movie. You could hardly distinguish the "employees" of zombies with ordinary people, as they all seemed to be zombies. <br /> <br /> Finally, nothing really makes sense. From the reactions and emotions of the characters to the story, it just seems random. It's just a very bad movie, disguised and designed as a "thinking man movie", which is supposed to be confusing. Leave me alone. A bad movie is a bad movie. And this movie was bad.
