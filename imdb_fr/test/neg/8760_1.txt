Always enjoy classic horror movies, however, this movie was really a big waste of time and if it was not for John Carradine playing crazy doctor who is able to control humans through his experiences. This film was shot during the Second World War and John Carradine was a German Nazi who was working in search of a human weapon against the world. Bob Steele played in many roles as a cowboy or gangster and in this picture, Bob seemed to be bored to death with his role in this film and acted as if it were his first film. Mantan Moreland, (Jeff) gave an outstanding performance with excellent comedy that kept the audience's attention. I hate to criticize a film made in 1943, but it's really a big disappointment. If you love John Carradine and his roles as Count Dracula in many movies during the 1940s, you might want to watch John do his best.
