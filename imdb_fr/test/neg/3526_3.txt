** SPOILERS ** The killer in the movie does not wait a second because we see him sneak into the shower of a girl and hack to death, taking his arm severed and bleeding as he escapes. We then get this official-looking prologue, as if we were looking at a true story, stating that a number of atrocious murders were committed in the late fall of 1985 in a small mid-western collage. <br /> <br /> Hearing sheriff Ron Delboys is confused by this murder and, later, when the murders of local female college students, all women, continue to race for the senator, he is in danger to interfere with the investigation each turn. There are at least two occasions when Delboys says it will never be another murder while he is involved and a few minutes later another murder will occur. <br /> <br /> Find a golden amulet at the scene of each murder committed by the sheriff girl, the collages librarian, Tina finds this reference book on Withcraft, indicating that the amulet is the symbol of a witch cult born in the early 1700s, right after the Salem Witch trials. The purpose of this cult was to avenge the 19 warlock defendants hanged by the city's inhabitants in 1692. They went out at night to kill men and women of authority and flew away with a body part. When body parts form a complete person, they are burned during an occult midnight bonfire ritual. <br /> <br /> You never understand what's going on in the movie "Blood Cult", not just because it's totally disjointed. history, but it's increasingly outrageous and the graduate level is particularly interesting, especially by Charles Ellis who plays sheriff Ron Delboys. Having himself more problems than the killer on the loose could have brought him in. The dilapidated Sheriff Delboys ends up having his head broken and almost burned alive after being dismembered. The only reason he was not there was that he seemed to have imagined everything under the influence of a powerful, unnamed drug. <br /> <br /> There is a sequence of strange dreams in the film that suggests that a number of respected members of the community are members of the witch cult responsible for the murders perpetrated by the sorority. The film does not at all want to explain if the dream of drugged sheriff Delboys was a dream or a real experience on his part by abandoning everything as if he had been cut from the film! > <br /> Getting out of the hospital and taking care of the sorority house of collages, while nibbling a bag full of McDonald's cheeseburgers, sheriff Delboys finally clashes in front of the murderer. Shefiff Delboys discovers to his shock and astonishment that he does not only know who he is, but is also ready to let the killer run away! <br /> <br /> The very first film directly in video shows. Not only would nobody be crazy enough to pay for admission, at least with the video you can record on it. Thank God, see this disaster, but no movie house owner would dare to look at her on the screen without the danger of indignant customers, in a justifiable demonstration of indignation just, tear the place!
