I became addicted to the premise that the show was about demons. From hell. And a door to hell. What I did not realize was that I would see guys running in tunnels chased by young kids who might not be demons during the whole movie. There were certainly some dialogues and beautiful underground landscapes, but the lack of intrigue, developed characters, twists or developments in history was sorely lacking. Oh, and out of interest, there were no special effects. The entire budget was spent on actors' salaries, sets and a lot of time running with an underground camera. <br /> <br /> The end was one of the boring endings that makes you say "I endured this boring movie for that !?" If you want to see demons and a gateway to hell, I promise you that you'd better watch the Hellgate: London trailers, which, though shorter than this 5-minute movie, contains more dialogue, character development, action, plot and satisfactory conclusions than this one. <br /> <br /> The second star is for the effort, but overall a low score for failing to make a film that stands out, and for having promised in the slogan much more than what was delivered .
