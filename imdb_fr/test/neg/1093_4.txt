I do not know if this exceptionally boring movie was supposed to be an unofficial sequel to "The French Connection", but it has many of the same drawbacks: the screenplay is so confusing that the viewer remains indifferent and feels excluded. and the direction is so cold, so lacking in energy, that even the great chase sequence can not enliven things. (* 1/2)
