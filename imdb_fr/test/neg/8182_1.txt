This film is strange, even for a silent movie. Basically, it follows the adventures of an engineer in post-revolutionary Russia who dreams of not going to Mars. In this film, it seems that the producers KNOW that the Communists really screwed up the country, but also seem to want to give the impression that they have accomplished something good. <br /> <br /> Then we come to the "Martian Scenes", where everyone on Mars wears zany hats They have a revolution after being inspired by the Men of the Earth, but are quickly betrayed by the queen that accompanies them, except that everything is a dream, or is it. (And since the Russian revolution finally led to Stalin's dictatorship, one wonders if they were allegories only. <br /> <br /> Now I've seen good Russian cinema, for example, Eisenstein's Potemkin battleship is a good movie, it's just, well, silly.
