What's frustrating with a film like this, with real potential for greatness, is that it almost likes being tough. We are talking about allegory, metaphor ... but the truth is that there is no doubt that there is no plot or real character. <br /> <br /> At some point, we know who the people are. are ... even if you never understand where they are going. Pure pretension has worn me out every time I tried to grab a truth in this movie. <br /> <br /> Call it beautiful, awesome and awesome ... I call it just "cheating". All style and without substance. Of course, it's a matter of taste ... but I would never take a confused pastiche of modernist symbols and locks on the spiritual clarity of Jean Cocteau or Renoir. But if it works for you, I'm fine for it. Art is a personal thing, I suppose.
