I like this movie and have watched my copy twice since it was acquired a few weeks ago. But you have to see it in the right context. <br /> <br /> I did not check the dates, but I bet this film came out after and certainly about the same time as the popularizations of Collier and Walt Disney the vision of space flight promoted by W .Von Braun. This is reflected in the attempt to appear factually correct and scientific. However, while some ideas are correctly expressed (step-by-step amplifiers, for example), others are totally hilarious. <br /> <br /> For example, we are told that a rocket rises to an altitude and then rotates 90 degrees. enter the space ... like reaching the top of a staircase and heading for the landing! We are then told that by turning in the direction of rotation of the Earth, the total speed of the ship is increased accordingly. <br /> <br /> This is a hilarious misunderstanding of what is really happening. Most space launch centers are located as close as possible to the equator, where the Earth and everything on its surface is about 1,000 kilometers an hour, including any rocket going to the space, in a direction east (identical to the rotation of the planet). ). Of course, if the ship were heading west once in space, its speed in relation to the Earth's surface would be greater, but it would not add to the real speed of the vehicle. Described in this film as "the speed of the air"! <br /> <br /> Similarly, we are told that travelers only feel free fall when they reach thousands of kilometers from the Earth, outside the gravitational field of planets. Again, comically incorrect. Most crewed spacecraft do not cover more than two hundred kilometers, but as long as they travel (and their contents, crew included) at a speed sufficient for their momentum towards equilibrium orients the attraction of the gravity inwards, they orbits in free fall. Of course, traveling far enough from the Earth and even a slow object will move out of Earth's gravity, but to leave the Earth in Earth orbit, outward (towards the Moon for example), one must reach the "speed of flight, "about twenty-one thousand. miles per hour. So the vehicle will already have reached "orbital speed" (and "weightlessness") by definition. <br /> <br /> But the movie has a lot more hilarious things. Someone decided that it would be more fun to miss the moon because of a technical problem, to fall asleep for a few days, then to wake up to find that they accidentally went to Mars! The captain ruminates while it must be a divine intervention! At this point, any scientific claim is torn into small pieces like confetti and projected against the wind in the merry dance of an increasingly wacky plot. <br /> <br /> The strength of a film like this one is actually illustrating "how far we have come". Not less in attitudes towards women. The condescending conduct inflicted on the female member of the crew is both hilarious and shocking. To think that such attitudes were so "normal" recently "." As I said at the beginning, I find this movie very entertaining. In the late evening, the lights are unleashed in the romanticism of space travel, from the point of view of previous days. An antidote to the cold routine of spaceflight as it has become in the twenty-first century. <br /> <br /> I will not reveal the end. It is both courageous and shocking for a film of this vintage and this character.
