Yes, it's true that Jessica Alba led me to this film, because without it, I should never have chosen it. <br /> <br /> But I find it long, dull and above all, without originality. All along, I thought the story was full of clich√©s and that the staging was very boring. So it was a surprise to see that the director and the writer are the same person. I notice that I will remember to avoid all his next movies. <br /> <br /> Too bad, because all the good things were at hand: Malaysia is a beautiful jungle, it was the British Empire and the distribution is beautiful: Jessica knows it. how to open her soul and for once, she found a suitable movie for that. Bob Hoskins shows great experience and he should have won a prize for this role. <br /> <br /> The only good thing is that it allows me to open a map of the world to locate this island, because if you guess that this is happening in South Asia, you do not know where exactly! Ah, the little airplane flight with red lines in the Indiana Jones movie !!!
