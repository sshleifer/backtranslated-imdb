Some secondary actors are really trying. And the shots in the desert are pretty beautiful. Otherwise, this movie is horrible. <br /> <br /> William Shatner's character, Harvey, is an amateur screenwriter. He is also a psychopath, a man who literally escapes from a psychiatric institution. Is the purpose of this film that amateur writers are psychopaths? Harvey will do everything to have his script read and filmed, even if it means hijacking a film crew. Are amateur writers ... crawling? Maybe yes. <br /> <br /> The configuration of the film is much too long. We do not go to the point of the story until the end of the second half. The first half takes place between several characters. <br /> <br /> "Shoot Or Be Shot" is presented as a comedy, but I found it totally not funny. The dialog contains no subtext. None of the characters are credible as real people. These are all figurines that perform "actions" that look like cartoon characters. Indeed, the film is essentially a cartoon for adults: idiot, idiot, insane to birds. <br /> <br /> I can understand why some actors are part of this movie. They need money or exposure. But what do the insiders Shatner and Harry Hamlin do here? Maybe Shatner wants more comic roles. Is it the best he can do? Is Hamlin desperate for money? He was a respected actor. What happened? <br /> <br /> Even if the story is supposed to be a satire, it seems more like a reprimand of amateur writers. Maybe it was not the intention. But that's certainly how the movie can be interpreted. As such, the script was very, very poorly written.
