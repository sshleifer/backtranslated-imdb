I checked this video hoping to like it. Want to like that. I love foreign films, I love beautiful cinematography, I know that critics have liked this movie (including my favorite, Roger Ebert), and I have no objection to watching "slow" movies. <br /> <br /> Well, it's beautiful. That's about the best I can say. The plot is very thin, the plans are very long, the looks are very significant, the actors are very sincere, and it looks like a very long film. I fell asleep halfway, I woke up, I rewound the tape, tried again. It was an essay, but I came to the end. I did not like her better for that.
