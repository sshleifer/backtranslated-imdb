Carole Lombard is the star of this film in transition. This film is a typical example of a very old "talkie" (the first practical sound movie was "The Jazz Singer", 1927). Overall, the game in this film tends to be extremely broad and very melodramatic. <br /> <br /> The viewer can easily see that the actors continue to "play" for a silent movie, which adds to the over-pronounced, overly serious dialogue (it seems most likely that a diction coach -drama-drama has been widely used to teach "silent" actors to talk), creates rather comical scenes that are not at all comical. <br /> The great acting ability of Carole Lombard is almost unrecognizable under all the broad gestures, melodrama and earnestness. <br /> <br /> Mainly interesting as a historical curiosity of this period, and for a totally unexpected comedy. camp value.
