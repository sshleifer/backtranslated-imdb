I rented this film for the first time the infamous day of September 11, 2001. Since then, I have seen it many times. My only complaint is that it's too short. "Strangeland" would have been a complete horror work of art in two hours. At the moment, the race time is only an hour and a half. <br /> <br /> Dee Snider, former member of Twisted Sister, wrote, produced and performed in this shock festival in a small town in Colorado. He plays Carleton Hendricks, a crazy sadist who has psychotic ideologies about human evolution and a love for near-death experiences. Hendricks is not child's play, it's a "modern primitive" inflated by six feet. Someone who tattooed and pierced his body to the extreme. When he makes his first complete appearance in the film, it's a really terrifying show. <br /> <br /> Hendricks's main hobby is to share his "spiritual awakenings" with his kidnapped victims. He visits Internet chat rooms under the name "Capt. Howdy" and then invites people to his home. They believe they are going to a party. Instead, they find themselves in a house of pain and suffering. Hendricks closes his eyes and mouth and tortures them by sticking blades and hooks in many parts of their bodies. If it sounds sick, it's because it is. <br /> <br /> One of Hendrick's victims is Genevieve, the teenage daughter of Detective Michael Gage. Gage succeeds not only in saving her, but also stops Hendricks. Four years later, Hendricks is released from a psychiatric facility completely rehabilitated to the disapproval of the community. A group of rednecks led by Freddy Krueger himself, actor Robert Englund, decides to kill him. They fail and Hendricks recovers his old personality. <br /> <br /> I leave you the rest of the film, to tell you that the conclusion is satisfactory and will leave you chills. With the exception of Snider, the acting is not very good, but it is fixable. The management is good too. "Strangeland" contains humorous passages very amusing. I also liked the soundtrack, it's great and worth buying if you like rock. Overall, it's a movie to watch. If you like low-budget horror movies with a sense of humor, go for it. You will probably like it.
