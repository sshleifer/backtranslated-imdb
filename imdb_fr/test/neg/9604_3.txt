Well! A hybrid B sci-fi / horror / action directed by Jim Wynorski and in the final scenes we see a cyborg with a smashed metal head killing several people! As with any Wynorski movie, he adds many crazy ideas and secondary intrigues that, for the most part, lead nowhere. But "Storm Trooper" looks more like a type of two-movie accord for the price of one. On the one hand, we have the dramatic / thriller part (as such of the movie) with Carol Alt killing her unbelievably annoying and ungrateful husband (a plot that simply leads to nowhere). And on the other hand, we had the "Night of the Undead" style of the "escaped cyborg unleashed". Carol and the Cyborg are the ones trapped inside the house and a group of PO / special bounty hunters playing the role of zombies, trying to break into the house. Needless to say, this movie is not among the best. Zach Galligan (from "Gremlins" -fame) is particularly painful and Corey Feldman (in a small side role) is completely lost again in this movie. Wynorski even ripped up one of his own movies here, since I'm 99% sure that he used footage from his previous movie "976 EVIL II" (the scene with the exploding truck and the bike). Yes, it's so bad and so much fun. This is strictly for fans of Wynorski. And I am one of them, in case you do not know it already.
