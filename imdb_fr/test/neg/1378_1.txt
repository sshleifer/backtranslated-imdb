From time to time, I accidentally leave the television on after "South Park" and I end up catching some of the train wreckage of college humor that is "Mind of Mencia". This is the only time I would have liked my room to be cleaner because I could find the remote much faster. The truth is that Comedy Central needed a replacement, "Chappelle's Show". What they got was a show that attracts idiots who miss Dave so much that they cling to a minority variety show or are content with nature "Mexicans love tacos," says Carlos Mencia shovel every week. I must understand, though, that there are people who actually find Mencia * shuddering * funny. I firmly maintain my words when I say that I believe that these people only exist in the myth. However, if you are really there, I only ask you never to enter my housing district and read these major differences between Carlos and "Chappelle's Show": <br /> <br /> 1) Dave was funny . You may want to emphasize this one. <br /> <br /> 2) "The Chappelle Show" was FIVE TIMES as demanding as Mencia could hope for. However, every time a promotion for his little show is broadcast, everything revolves around him, pointing out that he has never seen anything like it. You're right, Carlos. And not in a good way. Chappelle did not need to tell people that he was pissed and funny. We all watched the show and discovered it for ourselves. <br /> <br /> 3) Chappelle actually had racial jokes that plunged into the depths of different cultures - things that some people did not know. sure. Like his game segment "I know blacks". The grand prize was a hair cream that blacks use. It's deeper than Mencia would ever dare to dive. So, how dare he be called upset? If Mencia had written this sketch, the grand prize would have been fried chicken and kool-aid. And my accusations have merit. A few days ago, I saw a promotion for his show (which I affectionately called "My TV monitor, it takes thirty seconds") and it was a stereotypical sketch of the Olympics, which I confessed to a pretty funny concept. Then I saw that the Mexican who won the award received a green card. That's all?! It's as close to the fire as you want to go? Who could NOT think of that - back in grade 7? For fans of the show, if you ever watch and miss one of its lines, it may be because you and your friends have discussed the fact that "Duh-De-Durr" never gets old and in no way part of the joke. where someone funny would have something smart to say - remember that there are anyway only five possible choices for hitting lines: green card, tacos, border jumpers, lawn mowers and, of course, duh-de-dur. Remember, no matter what it was, it was shouted. Enjoy it! <br /> <br /> 4) Relative to number two. Whenever he says something that makes him laugh, he pauses to tell people (laughing at his own joke) that he thinks he's "gone too far with this one". So do not say it for God's sake. Or let people decide for themselves. He and Comedy Central keep pushing my throat to say he's more than controversial about The Da Vinci Code. You are not. You'll never be. <br /> <br /> I have never been offended by the content of the show. I would never give him so much credit. I am upset that Carlos Mencia has thirty minutes to scream unnecessarily. Yeah ... I'm really offended by this fact.
