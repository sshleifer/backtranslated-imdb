I saw this video on video with a few friends as part of a teenage comedy triple head, alongside Dorm Daze and Going Greek. Of course, we were not aiming for quality, but aerial entertainment and coarse gags. In general, we got what we wanted, but Wild Roomies really stood out: for its horrible character. <br /> <br /> First impression first, the cover: The Norwegian cover page shows hidden breasts and a lot of "crazy" in appearance. roommate in the background; Take pictures of drunken half-naked teenagers doing loads of fun stuff, do not you? - The roommates "crazy" on the cover did not even appear on the picture. And the funny things you suppose they will do? - Absent too. <br /> <br /> This film had the title of comedy, which is a bit strange in that it is not even funny. The relational drama would be more precise. <br /> <br /> In summary, the film is about a young couple who inherit a posh house in LA and have to find roommates to make ends meet. These roommates finally tested the patience and relationships of the young couple because they were so "wild". The problem is, they are not. And here is the problem of this film: the protagonist couple is so retentive by the year and neurotic that manages to generate zero sympathy. You will find yourself looking for antagonist roommates midway through the movie. Add a mediocre game, a lame dialogue and a boring direction and you get a movie you do not want to see. <br /> <br /> See something else.
