You get a good deal of Steven Seagal's environmental fears and breathtaking views of the mountains as well as scenes of cowboys (or you can also use parts of the HORSE WHISPERER remnants). You then add a big chunk of OUTBREAK virus or similar (watch out, it must be more lethal and at least Biohazard Level 4) wrapped around a big group leader of the militia. You add a teaspoon of martial arts, and a zip of explosions and shots for the taste. Add classic red Indian herbs for extra taste. Serve immediately. <br /> <br /> What is the name of the movie you get ?: The Patriot. Perhaps the worst film of Steven Seagal. I'm sure Seagal tried to say something in this film, except for his usual I-am-a-cook (but also an ex-seal), but his recipe was confusing and his taste was awful .
