This movie is a load of shit. It's quite disturbing to see that anyone can say it's one of the best movies of the year. What can I say? Bad acting, bad action scenes that become really comical in the end. Forgive me if it was a comedy, so I did not understand it. If so, I regret to laugh at the tent scenes! Do yourself a favor - go to bed instead of watching this! Good night!
