It seems that the people involved in this film fill the urn to increase his ratings. The good news is that only 18 people have seen it. I guess that makes me the 19th. I have no involvement in the film and I do not know anyone who did it. I am a longtime user of IMDb (check my voting report and reviews for the last 7 years). opinion. This comes from a 30-year-old horror fan who has also appeared in two low budget movies himself. <br /> <br /> Except for some interesting video effects, "Frankensteins Bloody Nightmare" is incoherent, boring and technically imperfect beyond all reason. It was apparently shot on a silent medium and the audio was then dubbed; most sounds seem to have been recorded with a tin and a piece of string, anyway. More than three quarters of the dialogue is inaudible. <br /> <br /> I watched it from start to finish and I have no idea what the story was, or even if there was one. It seems that the director is impressed especially with long panoramic shots of the corners of the table and dead black spaces that only hide the film. It would be a problem if we actually developed a plot and made a film that had a sense of stimulation. In this case, however, the rule does not apply. It does not matter how the scenes are shot because they do not add up. <br /> <br /> Watching this video is a futile exercise at all levels. Whoever has worked on it and is trying to influence the ratings here on IMDb, it's just a tedious bad thing. <br /> <br /> That's the honest truth. If you are thinking of spending your money or your time on it, think again. It is easy to find something better because you will not find much worse. <br /> <br /> And that's the unbiased and unvarnished truth.
