I had nothing to do before going out one night so I did not want to watch something too heavy, I chose the perfect movie. It must be a gift that Barrymore gave to someone she slept with. The director Raja Gosnell has done nothing but stupidity and the writing of it is atrocious. In which high school can you register without the presence of a parent and without proof of age or previous schooling? They let the kids come to the prom without shirt, with tight undershirts, shorts and a girl dressed in Eve wearing only fig leaves? She announces that she is 25 years old and that her brother is 23 years old, but there is no retaliation on the part of the school, parents or legal proceedings of any kind whatsoever against the newspaper for fraud or spying? The director of the newspaper wants to catch the teacher in a juvenile sex scandal but does not realize that the teacher is going to be 25 years old, so any case would be trapped? They allow a camera to enter and record private conversations with minor children? I wonder if I hired my younger sister to return to HS with a camera and that minor girls are filmed for my staff, I would not have trouble ??? NAHHHH No problem. Did she not need to go to the gym or go to the bathroom at some point? The secondary characters in this film looked like cardboard cutouts of what students think of high school and everyone was stereotyped. Jessica Alba is simply embarrassing to want to be caught by the camera on every occasion. In which world do parents not become suspicious when their ultra-geek daughter is miraculously invited to go out by the school stud to the prom? And they do not ask the guy inside to meet him like every other parent in the story. If a guy in my school or another school had rotten cursed her with my sister and threw her eggs in her ball gown, he would have been in a cast for the rest of his life. This film is so artificial and predictable that it's nauseous, and why in the end everyone (including Alpo girls) cheers for this chick when two days before she hates her ???? ???? STUPID.
