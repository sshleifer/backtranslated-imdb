I saw this at the theater a few decades ago, and fuzzy memories suggest that I liked it. However, when we see it a second time, two things emerge: (1) very mediocre in the role of Michelle Johnson and (2) very bad music overall. <br /> <br /> It's not that all the music has been bad. Brazilian music was going well, but the theme song and the others that were making their way were reminiscent of the worst of 80s pop music. <br /> <br /> Johnson's voice sounded totally wrong, maybe even doubled . It was distracting. <br /> <br /> The positive side: (1) The story is not bad, (2) It's interesting to see such a young Demi Moore, (3) Valerie Harper has never been so beautiful , and (4) Johnson looked quite attractive at various stages of helplessness.
