Stephen King's television movies can have 5 or 6 games and no one complains, right? So why give Stooges only 96 minutes? I do not ask for a PBS mini-series, but would a partner have killed someone? The film survived events that should have been mentioned and events that might have been missed. I want to salute the performances of the stars ... they had a hard job because they did not really look like Stooges, but the spirit was there. After watching the movie, I released a cassette of American Movie Classics that had the real deal and mocked me. The film was quite emotional, especially after Curly had a stroke and Moe needed to keep going. When Curley started crying, I lost it ... As I said, the movie was good, but could have been and should have been much, much better. Maybe it was appropriate ... The Stooges were scammed in their lifetime and now, 25 years later, this is happening again.
