** Spoilers ** Three young people on the wrong side of the law have the opportunity to change their lives and become useful members of society by becoming cops infiltrated in The Mod Squad, a hit series of the TV series The ?? 60's, directed by Scott Silver. Julie Barnes (Claire Danes), Pete Cochran (Giovanni Ribisi) and Lincoln Hayes (Omar Epps) can go where other police officers can not. are invited by Captain Adam Greer (Dennis Farina) to infiltrate a dark night spot suspected of being a front for a prostitution ring. For starters, Julie finds a job as a waitress, while Pete and Linc "spend time" to find out what they can do. Julie quickly finds an old friend, Billy Waites (Josh Brolin), who turns out to be involved in drugs, which is related to shady deals at the bar. Before it's over, the "platoon" is up to the neck, while facing a group of bad police involved in the drug, and therefore related to their investigation. From the beginning of the film, you have the impression that you arrive late; as if it presupposes that you know what was happening with regard to the origin and functioning of the team. You get here only brief biographies of the three people who give you a glimpse of their past; there is nothing about how all this really happened. It was probably thought that by doing this the story would come into the story more quickly and move things along. Although this is true to some extent, adding background would have made the texture of the story a bit more interesting; the manner in which this has been done only belittles the credibility of the whole procedure. The plot is initially marginal and all the time devoted to the development of the character would have been worth it. What is delivered, and not very imaginative, is an unconvincing story, filled with one-dimensional characters. The performances are satisfactory, but the actors do not receive any help from the script, nor apparently from Silver; The Danes, Ribisi and Epps are about to give life to Julie, Pete and Linc, but given the time allotted to them, combined with the lack of support, they still can not give life to these people . Farina, a good actor who deserves better than he has here, is nothing but a caricature of the "good cop". One has the feeling that everything was given once in this film; certain details and nuances would have considerably increased the stock of it. The secondary actors are Richard Jenkins (Detective Mothershed), Steve Harris (Briggs), Larry Brandenburg (Eckford), Lionel Mark Smith (Lanier) and Sam McMurray (Tricky). It's a shame to see the acting talent involved here also wasted. it would have taken a lot more thought and planning for the making of this film. As it stands, it looks poorly designed and executed. The Danes, Ribisi and Epps look like the Major Leaguers who got stuck playing for all the balls at the local sand court; instead of trying their luck in the title, they all got dry. As Terry says in "On the waterfront", you were my brother, Charlie, you should take care of me. "Well, it's obvious that there was no Charlie to watch them here, and after" The Mod Squad ", they can all hope that something better will happen next time. 1/10.
