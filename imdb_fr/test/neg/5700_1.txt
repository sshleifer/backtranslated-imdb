It's been a long time since I've seen such a bad movie. I must say that it's really hard to make a realistic and / or realistic film about the air disaster, but this film was a waste of time and money. Also, I think this is an unofficial way to try to get a bad reputation from Airbus. First, the cockpit is very similar to an Airbus cockpit, then you have a stick, the third uses computers to control the rudders / elevators / ailerons via "fly by wire". When I saw this movie, I thought the intention of the movie was "do not fly with computerized planes like Airbus, use Boeing instead, they have a direct connection between the steering and the rudders." <br /> <br /> All I can say: Bad story, horrible acting (most actors), worst film tour ever ...
