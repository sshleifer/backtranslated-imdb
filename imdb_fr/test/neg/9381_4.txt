Although supposedly autobiographical, this film shows very little knowledge of both the psychology of the protagonist (resulting in a flat and fragmented characterization) and historical processes on a larger scale, and my hope to learn something new or different. to improve my understanding of contemporary Iran has remained unfulfilled. Instead, I found my sensitivity softened somewhat by the succession of bearded Islamist villains succeeding, mocking, torturing or killing a prototypical Iranian middle class victim of revenge whose Western cultural sympathies were manifest (and whose film blatantly seeks to understand that the film seems to demonstrate is that of the mass media market, insofar as it serves to feed popular Western popular ideologies (ie a "pleaser of the crowd") What made the film no longer boring was its creative animation - truly minimalist images that, despite everything, always kept the screen rich, expressive and unambiguous - not a little party for which I give him stars.
