This movie was not very good in my opinion. Although it was not a total loss of an hour and a half (thankfully, I did not have to pay $ for that), it was just not very scary. There were passages where I jumped and some scenes were not violent / bloody, but overall, only an easily frightened person would consider this film scary. <br /> <br /> The writing and acting of the actors were very weak. The characters have never evolved or grown up as people. Even at the end, the leader, whatever his name, did not stand out and had to be saved from the fire at the last minute. The plot also had inconsistencies. The policeman who was killed was NOT murdered the same way he died in action. The October girl mentioned that to kill the evil demon, one had to read something in the correct text. It's funny how they never bothered to do that and still managed to escape. The kid from Malcolm-in-the-Middle died in the game but did not die "in real life". In addition, playing the game by itself was a very weak writing. The death of the brother would have been enough, just to make him play again. But you are supposed to play a video game and stay alive. Three people die before replaying ... why do you even need the game? If you like movies like The Ring and it's scary and fun, watch this movie. If you know someone like that, you can watch it with laughter, do it. If you like "horror" movies that make you laugh and you have the opportunity to watch this movie for free, do it. Otherwise stay far, far away.
