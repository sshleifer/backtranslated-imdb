How many monster movies can you see in a lifetime? Well, I'll say one. This movie is best viewed late at night, with a pack of 12 of beer, the cut sound and your friends making you dialogue. <br /> <br /> On a Pacific island, a young man is sentenced to death for dating "evil Americans" (his loving wife slept with the witch doctor and they put him to death so that the doctor 'can be king). Well, he promises to come back and take revenge. <br /> <br /> Before you can shake a stick, clumsy natives run to the hut of American scientists, shouting "Tobanga, come on!" <br /> <br /> It seems that the young corpse acted like Tobanga, the monster walking. Yes, his revenge is terrible (just like this movie). It seems that these natives can not flee in front of a tree, so he throws them into shifting sands, rolls them in hills, etc. Very soon, the new king wants to trade his wife or his kingdom for an ax or a chainsaw. <br /> <br /> The general problems with this film are numerous. The comedy relief is an unpleasant woman with a Cockney accent (as this movie needs comedy). You want her to die on her first appearance. The main woman is whiny. The main man is a boor. The acting game is wooden (pun intended) The dialogue is steep and heavy. The natives have Brooklyn accents. The monster costume is a giggle. <br /> <br /> Although it's a bad movie, it's still fun to watch.It gets a 3 on unintentional laughs alone Your dog can give a slightly higher score, but only if the tree does not. is not mobile.
