A huge tree trunk, waddling and grimacing threatens fake "natives" on a "Pacific atoll" (strangely resembling southern Australia ...), provoking havok and revenge. Unlike the silly strains of "Navy VS The Night Monsters", the Tabonga is actually a full-fledged tree. Well, grown in 2 days: most stung on these ears Miracle Grow ... Anycow, this does not come from hell, but from the grave of a fake native, Kimo (Greg Palmer, "The zombies of Mora Tau "), murdered by the ancient natives for spending time with these terrible American scientists. Scientists include Dr. William Arnold (Tod Andrews, "Hang 'em High", "Under the Planet of the Apes") and Professor Clark (John McNamara, "The War of the Colossal Beast"). Linda Watkins ("The Parent Trap") interprets the obnoxious role of Mrs. Kilgore, the obvious comic relief clearing a false cockney accent. A stellar cast indeed !! Anyway, because his wife Korey, empty and pasty, amateurly played by Suzanne Ridgeway ("Love's A-Poppin '"), helps him prepare, Kimo declares his revenge on her and all the old . Then, the doped American scientists uproot the tree, bring it back to life "in the name of science", and allow him to walk SLOWLY on the island, killing all those who have wronged him. Of course, we all know that evil monsters carry beautiful girls, so Tabonga seizes the scientist Dr. Terry Mason (Tina Carver, "Hell on Frisco Bay") and the dandy. Vine-allly, a good blow with a Remmington strikes a knife lodged in the Tabonga, and he falls dead in the moving sand. This ridiculously stupid concept is one of the cheese screamers of all time. The Tabonga is arguably the slowest monster in world history, with the overbuilt and clumsy robot of "Monster Robot Against the Aztec Mummy" and the evil monster of the "Scary Terror" rug. Try not to laugh while watching the Tabonga throw the fake natives into the quicksand, dodge the spears and slowly walk the "island". The fishy writing, the wooden performances and the sandy orientation indicate that this pulpy fertilizer has much more bark than bite. This heap of warm wood chips was the latest sunshine of Dan Milner, editor-in-chief turned longtime director, who quickly faded into the well-deserved darkness following this film. First, you go through the vineyard of MooCow: "From Hell it Came" is a classic compost !! : ??
