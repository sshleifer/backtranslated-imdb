The year 1983 was an exceptional year for the Stephen King books that went on the big screen. Christine, The Dead Zone and Cujo were all released a few months apart. While The Dead Zone was easily the choice of the pack, Christine and Cujo were both pretty bad, and it's a tight affair as to which is the lesser of the two. If asked for an answer, Cujo would be the weaker of the two. <br /> <br /> Donna Trenton (Dee Wallace, freshly earned after being Elliot's mother in "ET - The Extra Terrestrial") is a mother whose marriage to her husband Vic (Daniel Hugh-Kelly) is suspended to a thread. She has an affair with a local worker and is now looking to leave her husband or not. The young Tad Trenton (Danny Pintauro), son of Donna and Vic, is a young kid with a chronic phobia of black that often leads to serious panic attacks. Donna and Tad take the family car to a nearby mechanic's yard for repairs, but when they arrive, their car stops. The situation gets worse when they discover that the mechanic, Joe Camber (Ed Lauter), is not there (he was savagely killed by his pet dog, Cujo, a gigantic Saint-Bernard recently bitten and infected by a rabid bat.) Soon, the dog trapped them in their car and tried everything to enter the vehicle to tear those two unfortunate victims. The weather is torrid; not a living soul knows that they are there; the car does not start; and the dog seriously wants their blood ...... <br /> <br /> Cujo has the potential to be a really tight seat thriller, but it never goes into high gear. I read the book and it is quite disappointing - certainly for King - so it is not surprising that the movie version is so incomplete. On the printed page, King was at least able to generate some tension, but the film is seriously embarrassed by the fact that a St. Bernard is just not very scary. The "visual character" of the film support constantly reminds that Cujo IS a Saint Bernard. In the book, it was possible to forget that. In the book, Cujo sometimes seemed almost like a monster. Even with the relatively short turnaround time of an hour and a half, Cujo becomes a tedious and demanding experience for patience, sometimes fun and unintentionally funny, and certainly never as exciting as she would like to be. They even omitted the cruel end of the book and replaced it with a conclusion "everything is fine that ends well" so that the public can return home in a good mood! Chalk this one as yet another lower king adaptation.
