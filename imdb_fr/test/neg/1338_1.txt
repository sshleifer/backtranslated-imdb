No! no no no! All my being is rebelling against this awful remake of a classic movie. I knew we were going to get in trouble from the moment Meg Ryan appeared on the screen with her hair and silly clothes - literally looking like a scarecrow in the garden she was digging. Meg Ryan playing Meg Ryan - What's tiring ?! And it got worse ... so much worse. The horribly clich√©d lines, the stock characters, the growing feeling that I saw in the spin-off of "The First Wives Club" and the ultimate in the delivery room. How many times have I seen this movie? Only once, but it's like a dozen times - nothing original or expensive about it. For shame!
