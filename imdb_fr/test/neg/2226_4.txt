The social responsibility of Warner Brothers at its height, with sermons every five minutes or so about how we are American, we do not run into trouble, we assume our responsibilities. It also suggests that if you are willing to perjure yourself to protect your family from clearly deadly gangsters, you are not American. Walter Huston, looking bored, is the frustrated DA, and the "average American family" includes faces as familiar as Sally Blane (who looks a lot like her sister, Loretta Young) and Dickie Moore, an allegedly adorable moppet. Both are routinely chased out by Chic Sale, when they were only 47, but they played the role of a veteran of the Octogenarian Civil War, jumping heavily and shooting "with amusement" on the flag Prohibition and moralizing the way we are Americans, dag nabbit. His old man performance of St Vitus Dance is a boring schtick; it's as if Walter Brennan had based his entire career. William Wellman runs efficiently and quickly, much like his previous "Public Enemy", but the screenwriter and himself neglects to show what happens to this family after the merry erasure - that is, they would probably erased by the crowd.
