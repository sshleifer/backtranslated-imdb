I wish it was "Last Dumb Thriller". But thrillers are like that. They are like children: many, illogical and often annoying. They so desperately want to be taken seriously, but what should be taken seriously about the behavior of a child or the plot of a thriller? Having seen this particular child - I mean ... thriller - I understand why critics call him a "Hitchcockian thriller"; they might as well have called it "silly" because that's what "hitchcockian" means in the movie's dictionary (look for it, if you do not believe me). Even the soundtrack is an old Hollywood school, which is a mistake: it is not suitable for a film of the late 70s and gives it a fake appearance. In addition, how dare they steal De Palma's idea of ​​stealing Hitchcock ?! The story is absurd. Scheider's wife is killed and her killers are never a problem. Instead, his former employers follow him first, then decide to kill him. Why do they decide to kill him? No explanation. Perhaps because the FBI is a dark organization, "X-Files" ("X-Files") who is very happy to be able to eliminate his former employees for reasons related to pension funds. Or maybe because it's fashionable to want to kill Scheider in this movie; everyone seems to be after him. And while the poor unsuspecting spectator tries to solve the mystery by logically assuming that there is a major plot, in reality the murderer is ... Janet Margolin! Yes, the woman occupying the residential quarters of Scheider; the one who briefly hinted that she was "depraved". Why is she looking after Scheider at a time when his wife was murdered and he feels paranoid - and followed by his own former employers - and not a few years ago or soon after the murder of his wife? A pure hitchcockian (search again in the dictionary, in case you have forgotten what it means): a coincidence. And what about his brilliant motive ...! Her grandmother was forced into prostitution as a virgin in New York, then aged 15, and was syphilized by a group of excited Jewish men, one of whom - tah-dah! - is Scheider's grandfather As a result, Margolin played a prostitute during her free time (among other things) to kill all the descendants of men who so cruelly syphilized her once virgin grandmother. How is hitchcockian (look at it)? The finale then shamelessly removes the Mount Rushmore scene in "North By Northwest", except that love is a killer and is not saved. <br /> <br /> The film also offers skeptical dialogue -kilter and some less well played. Discover the stupid and obvious way in which Napier follows Scheider to the cemetery. And let's not forget the stupid plot of Napier who grabs his jacket and holds his hand with great distrust - but it was not a gun! It's awesome! Napier in the tower: There is now another set of illogical behaviors. J. Demme was, is and will always be a director without style, without flair, and the man who directed "Philadelphia". Give him another Oscar!
