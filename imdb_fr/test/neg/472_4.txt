The man with the screaming brain tells a story of greed, betrayal and revenge in a small Bulgarian town. William Cole, a wealthy industrialist, ends up having part of his brain replaced by that of Russian taxi driver Yegor. The two could not be more different, but they share one thing - both were killed by the same woman. Brought back to life by a mad scientist, William and Yegor form an improbable partnership to find their common enemy. <br /> <br /> Bruce Campbell returns to the horror B movie genre that earned him cult status, but this time not only in front of the screen, but behind the lens. Unfortunately for the moment, the laughs are not giving anything and Campbell must resort to what he does best to try to fill the void in this film. <br /> <br /> As a fan of Campbell, who has the movies, books and figures, I was hoping for another success to add to my collection. Although, having seen this movie before buying, I am happy not to have the "pleasure" of adding it. <br /> <br /> The movie is mistaken first in the story, which at first sight seems like a harmless pleasure, but turns out to be a boring dribble. Which is sad to say because it was written by Mr. Campbell himself. The comedy never really hits, it only makes us scratch our heads. It seems that Campbell is running out of fun stuff and giving the audience what we've already seen ... fighting against himself. <br /> <br /> Ted Raimi, the brother of the director of Evil Dead, Sam Raimi, is undoubtedly the highlight of the film. It brings a freshness and an entertaining moment when the film really needs it. It's useful if you're a fan and you follow these Evil Dead addicts at Xena. That's why I felt obliged to love this movie. <br /> <br /> Campbell's experience as a director, from making episodes of the television series Hercules is apparent. Campbell makes sure that the movie works pretty well, even on a small budget. In the end, there are not as many activities as one would hope for, but Campbell's fans will stay behind all that's left, unfortunately for this fan ... I will not do it.
