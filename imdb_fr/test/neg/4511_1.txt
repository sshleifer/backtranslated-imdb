It's really a redesign that should never have come out of the team. It has two castes that act in totally different layers. Joan Plowright and Maximillian Schell are in the foreground. Every nuance of the Franks is in sight. Melissa Gilbert and Doris Roberts are at the bottom. I can not imagine how Schell and Plowright manage to play so well when Gilbert and Roberts work their anti-magic. Gilbert ruins all the scenes in which she is. It's as if the Father knew better than anyone in the ghetto. She is the light Ann Frank. Her career at Helen Keller was skinny, but not terrible. It's sacrilege. Doris Roberts makes Van Damm just annoying. It is an entirely inappropriate choice to play the sexually hungry woman whose flirtatious and unsatisfied presence has caused so many problems to het Acherhuis. It had to be played by a woman who could convince us that she remembered at least what it was to be voluptuous. His weight is not the problem. Joan Plowright could have played this role beautifully. Roberts was at the peak of his career when this was done, getting a lot of press and many opportunities. Her performance here shows her weaknesses as an actress shamefully. <br /> <br /> James Coco and Clive Reville have most of their scenes with Gilbert and Roberts and, although they are, they are completely unable to repair the damage. done by their partners. Reville is a crafty actor capable of the kind of iconic performance given by Ed Wynne in the original movie. He does not receive any support from Gilbert. It drains the color of each scene. <br /> <br /> I read with dismay the comments of those of you who grew up watching this version, full of dedication to these performances. It's a lesson on how the version you see first attaches to you. This makes me reconsider my attachment to some inferior products that I loved in my childhood. I encourage you to watch the original. He has very few weak spots and his head and shoulders are above this mess.
