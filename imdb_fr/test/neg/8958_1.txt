Well, what about Actium Maximus ... <br /> <br /> There are bad movies that are so horribly horrible that they revolve around awesome. There are bad films that suck on their own. There are good movies, mediocre movies and fun movies. Then there is Actium Maximus. You can not create a spoiler for this movie, because for that you have to understand the action enough to be able to comment. This particular movie is worse than Turkish Star Wars One and the rest too. These movies are so bad that they spin in circles, and make you feel drunk even if you are sober. Actium circles go from bad to awesome, but then it does not stop there, you have to make another trip to Badville, then "again to awesome", then finally, he installs a small feudal kingdom at the "Bad" border and "archive footage drying while a harpy screams incoherently." If you like to punish yourself, this movie is for you. Your brain will suffer.
