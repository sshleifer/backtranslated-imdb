<br /> <br /> Well, great costumes and a wonderful "feel" for Italy before the Second World War. But what happened here? <br /> <br /> Great Actors ... Kristin Scott Thomas, Sean Penn, Anne Bancroft, James Fox, Derek Jacobi ... if you can not get memorable performances from this "list", then the problem with this film must be attributed to a pitiful direction and an inadequate scenario. I rented it on DVD after loving "Angels & Insects" (1995), also directed by Philip Haas. <br /> <br /> Yipes! I can hardly believe how boring this thing was. He just dragged on and on and nobody was able to save the poor thing. It's not even a good movie for intriguing chick-strangers-dudes-and-young-in-nice clothes! <br /> <br /> "Tea With Mussolini" Gone Amuck! <br /> <br />
