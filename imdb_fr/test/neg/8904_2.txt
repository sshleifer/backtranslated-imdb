This film has its heart in the right place, but unfortunately, it's not really a movie. It's more a documentary under the cover of a story. Bamako is basically a newspaper article on celluloid. However, your well-researched opinion piece is far more convincing and concise than anything presented here. The filmmaker tries to relay to the viewer the difficulties of African life, especially the country of Mali, because of the unethical practices of the IMF, the G8 and the World Bank, using a sham trial against this. who is before. There are another 10 minutes scattered in the film that make an unenthusiastic attempt at a narrative plot, and a bizarre Western shootout scene in Hollywood, where the director seems quite pleased with his own intelligence (hence the Frequent comparisons of Godard). <br /> <br /> Of course, at the beginning of the film, lawsuits and trials are never explained, but as we know now, the French refuse to feed their audience with spoons. <br /> <br /> There are many passionate arguments, but they are often long, delivered in a sharp monotone (one that becomes easy enough to tune out after a while), and very clear on the details. The last point is the most frustrating of all because there is a very well-argued case against the institutions under trial here. Unfortunately, all we have in 2 hours is that the IMF and the G8 are evil oppressors and should forgive third world debt. From time to time we are only given an indication of the specific reasons why the organizations judged are guilty, but never a clear case. The arguments of the mock trial and the images of the surrounding village clear up the suffering of these African residents, but we wonder why we have to sit for two hours, while a much more precise article could be brushed into a 20-minute article from Newsweek, or the episode of Bill Moyers. In the end, there is something very important to say about this issue, it is simply not presented very well, or very clearly, in this pretentious and indulgent article.
