All I could think of watching this movie was, "Is it going to end ?!" It was unbearably boring to watch. I was hoping I could turn it off, but I wanted to do this justice review, so I fought the good fight and resisted the torture of watching this movie all the way through, so that you, the good reader, did not do not have to bear that pain too. <br /> <br /> This film seems to give a good idea if you read the hypothesis on paper. However, the film does not hold on this principle at all. <br /> <br /> The opening scene features a mine shaft in the early 1900s, where they force children to carry dynamite in tunnels that are too small. for adults to integrate. This seems to be the basis for an interesting movie. But after 4 minutes, it becomes clear that this is not the case. Adults who have committed these crimes are never punished; there is no consequence shown in the film for their actions. The opening scene is much better than the rest of the movie and totally out of place. The last time an opening scene gave such a cruel image of a movie was the 28 days later, which was the only good scene in this movie. Wicked Little Things / Zombies (such a crappy movie that they changed the title to try to hide their hogwash and resell it) is exactly the same thing in this regard. The opening scene is the only scene visible in the entire movie. <br /> <br /> Instead, the movie blinks to today. An unmarried mother and her two bratty children, with impetuous mouth. This is where it would have been wise to press the STOP button and never approach the film again. <br /> <br /> In the first hour, the zombie kids are barely seen. They may have 3 minutes of screen time in total. All they do is kill a pig, that's all. The rest of the time is spent showing the mother and her idiot children that they buy stuff at the local store, hang out in the forest and have a crazy conversation between them. This silly teenager will go out with other idiotic teens and smoke marijuana with them. <br /> <br /> There would be no reason to worry if the zombie kids were sending someone in this movie. Each character is both stupid and boring, with no redeemable quality. Not to mention the one-dimensional image and cliché. <br /> <br /> This film would have been * significantly improved * if the mother and her idiot children had been sent in the first 10 minutes by the zombie children, while they were driving to their new home, then the rolled end credits. This right would instantly change the score from 1/10 to 10/10. Honestly! When the mute mother leaves the road with her eyes and almost blocks herself against a pedestrian, her daughter scolds her: "You almost killed us, mother!" Of course, any sensible person knows that if the mother had hit a pedestrian, it would be the pedestrian who would have died - not the secure people * inside the car. I suppose this line was inserted into the film to show for itself that the total stupidity of the main characters knows no bounds and runs in the family. <br /> <br /> Wicked Little Things / Zombies lasts 1 hour and 34 minutes, but it was really 5 hours or more for me. Trying not to fall asleep was a big challenge. It's only after one hour and 34 minutes that the zombie kids take the trouble to kill someone. Then the scene shows stupid teens drinking beer, getting into a car and saying, "If you want to put me back in my pants, you better start the car and get me out of there now. " Seriously, it's textually from the movie. Teenagers are so clichéd, unidimensional, misbehaving, stupid and annoying that when the zombie kids end up hijacking three after one hour and five minutes in the movie, it's a party motive. Of course, the daughter of the "main character" smoker of beer, "Princess", deaf-mute, smokes without smoke. What a buzzkill it was! She was on the screen longer than the others and therefore the most boring of the 4 of them, and the most deserving of a pickaxe in the head. This is another reason why it should have been sent within the first 10 minutes, as indicated above. Staying beyond 1 hour and 5 minutes is totally inexcusable. <br /> <br /> The reason is of course that feature films must be stuffed for at least 1 hour and 30 minutes. So, by keeping her alive for a long time as she should, they have 27 minutes more to play with the movie with her and her mother running in the woods. After one hour and 22 minutes, this is the second * time in the movie that the boring girl is stuck in a vehicle where the engine does not start while the zombie children come looking for it. <br /> <br /> The zombie kids are completely generic. Never say anything. No character development for any of them. <br /> <br /> Finally, the 3 main characters boring and idiots live. Which, in my opinion, is the way the filmmakers give a final gesture to the bird's gesture. In my opinion, the filmmakers surely know that they impressed all those who had the great misfortune to watch the entire film. Why not rub your face by not even giving them the satisfaction of seeing one of the 3 main characters who should have been sent in the first 10 minutes, dying. <br /> <br /> Avoid Wicked Little Things / Zombies like bubonic plague.
