I am almost 20 years old and I am a human who has been reading comics most of my life. I'm not a big fan of the Fantastic Four, but I know them pretty well. In 1994, Roger Corman (legend of movie B) produced the first feature Fantastic Four. The result was so pure that he had never been released. Yet copies exist, mainly on the net and at conventions. If you are laughing and can find a copy, do yourself a favor and take a look at this thing. <br /> <br /> The film tells the story of the origin of the FF and a meeting with Doctor Doom and a villain named The Jeweler. , essentially the Mole Man with a penchant for petty larceny. As in the case of these comics, everything must be related to everything. The FF therefore plays a vital role in the creation of Dr. Doom. He and the jeweler play a vital role in theirs. <br /> <br /> First, I would just like to mention that despite all that went wrong in this movie, I sort of liked the guy who played Doom. He does not receive many worthy lines, but when he does, he hits them. The armor is very pretty too. <br /> <br /> For the rest ... it's a dirty mess. Bad conspiracies, bad acting, bad effects, all bad fundamentally. Boos especially to Jay Underwood, bringing a new meaning to the word too acting like Johnny Storm. He is not too active, he is ultra-light. <br /> <br /> As for the FF, they all look good and Sue is portrayed by a very attractive actress, but they just do not look like a real team. On the one hand, they have no reason for Sue and Johnny to go into space. In the first part, Ben and Reed will visit both. Johnny is 8 years old and Sue is about 12 years old. This will only make their future romantic couple a little more scary. Thing's costume looks more reptilian than anything else, not very rocky, and the only time Human Torch is really a Human Torch, it looks like Silver Surfer tinged with red. <br /> <br /> I could bang for hours, but I think the scene that best sums up is a climax encounter featuring the aforementioned not-so-human torch. He runs a laser beam and finally destroys it with a punch. Yes, a punch. A laser beam With a punch. Then he flies and goes "Yippeee!" many, as a result of which the camera switches and it flies back towards the Earth. Obviously, the intellectual Reed forgot to inform Johnny that fire does not exist in the void of space. This scene and many others work the same way as Looney Toones. If the character ignores that they are above a cliff, they do not fall. <br /> <br /> I laughed, I cried, I was happy that it never came out.
