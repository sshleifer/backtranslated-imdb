Badly acted, badly written and badly directed. Special effects are cheap. The best performance is that of Yvette Napir, but that is saying little. Story is a confusing mess of corporate greed that leads to the sabotage of a space station and an attempt to rescue people on board. <br /> <br /> There is little suspense and even less action. There is a car chase that is not bad, but the rest of the movie is just a waste of time for everyone.
