Okay, I felt a Mormon movie about Mormons would be an imminent disaster, but I did not know how painful it would be. A little known fact is that Mormons have always made propaganda films of exceptional quality. The Church's official film campaign produced rare and enduring jewels that transcend the Mormon community, including the wonderful short film "Cipher in the Snow" which eventually toured as an educational film in the late 1980s. 70. There is also the disturbing movie of Neil LaBute .... <br /> <br /> However, the success of these films largely depends on the fact that they do not focus on Mormons or on a specific Mormon theology. Instead, they choose to focus on a universal theme and treat it on a fundamental human level. "The Army of God" abandons all pretense of universality and throws itself headlong into the raised and shortsighted world of the Orthodox. While it may be enough to alienate anyone except the most devoted Mormon, the incompetence of director Richard Ductcher and his juvenile approach to storytelling are sufficient grounds to judge the "Army of God" unassailable at all levels. <br /> <br /> Dutcher's appalling wooden acting set sets the tone for his army of the least interesting Mormons you may encounter. Of course, Dutcher's pathetic scenario does not help the distressing performance of the cast. It should be credited for not avoiding some of the most controversial aspects of the Church, but, as one might expect, it exposes these controversies in a favorable light. Nor should we be surprised that most of the responses to the darker side of the Church are addressed only with faith. At one point, a black couple reproached an African-American missionary for joining a church that was segregated until 1978 (about ten to twenty years after almost all the congregations in the most degenerate areas of the deep south had already done). Instead of taking an interest in the actively racist history of the Church, perhaps the most painful point in Mormon theology that even Church leaders no longer defend, Dutcher's troubled character evokes murder instead. of Joseph Smith - an obvious and perhaps scandalous allusion to lynching. Complete this syropatic evening with jokes about third level lepers, which are a comic pretext. You have good reasons to revive silent films. <br /> <br /> If you knew little about Mormons before watching this movie, you might become inclined to avoid them at all costs. If you are Mormon, this movie offers absolutely no pride.
