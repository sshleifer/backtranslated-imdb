I'm currently browsing the Horror Classics 50 film collection and THE MAD MONSTER is one of the movies in the series. <br /> <br /> I'm sure George Zucco was a good actor; but it was only the second film in which I saw him, the first being DEAD MEN WALK, in which he played two roles. However, even a good acting game could not save THE MAD MONTER. <br /> <br /> Zucco plays the role of a mad scientist, Dr. Cameron (banned from academia because of his unethical and inhumane experiences). He believes he can control evolution by bringing out the characteristics of one animal in another. <br /> <br /> In this case, like so many others alike, this is a blood transfusion of wolf (I suppose) in humans. His goal is to create an invincible army, which he can control through the antidote. The subject of his experiments is his leased hand, a retarded gardener, whose dialogue slows down this frenzied classic. <br /> <br /> Beyond his experiences, Dr. Cameron is also trying to take revenge on those who have discredited him, using his transformed gardener. However, he loses control of his subject, which begins to transform without the transfusion - yuck! <br /> <br /> Werewolf transformations are classic Hollywood stop-action / make-up effects. No doubt they were revolutionary techniques of the time; but in today's digital age, it's hard to imagine an audience frightened by that.
