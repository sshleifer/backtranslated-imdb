There is the thrill of a low budget black film. And there is the frustration of sinuous and uninteresting films made for cheap. This one enters the second category. <br /> <br /> The Spot is the name of a nightclub. The film is about a policeman whose father was killed by gangsters. He goes to look for them. <br /> <br /> Maybe that was the bad impression. It may be me. But I have the feeling that I have seen this a hundred times, most of them better than he is here. <br /> <br /> It also promises: the policeman is fascinated by a woman who plays records she shows on juke boxes. They meet next. Now, although it was done long before I was born, I saw that kind of juke box. And it's incredibly fascinating: when I was a teenager, I went for a walk in a bar that still had such a device. I've always loved jukeboxes, bars and dinners. But this one was different. You spoke about it and a female voice with a stifling voice answered you! This is discussed here but fell into the general stew, without interest. <br /> <br /> The film has a goal: the small role of Anne Jeffreys. What beauty she was and is probably still!
