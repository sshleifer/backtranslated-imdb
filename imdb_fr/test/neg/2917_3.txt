This sound film of Harold Lloyd drinks without laughing, and one wonders if this Lloyd is even the same who made all these delicious and hilarious silences. <br /> <br /> Lloyd's childlike sympathy becomes magical when we hear him speak, a slow, sober rhythm replaces the zany antics of his silences. Lloyd plays the young son of a missionary who grew up in China and ended up in the contemporary city of New York without having any idea of ​​life outside his Chinese village. He finds himself an unlikely winner in a mayoral election and quickly fuels the anger of all government organizations because he refuses to turn a blind eye to rampant corruption. When he tries to kill him, he decides to play as dirty as everyone else and staged a false execution of every scammer in New York as a tactic of fear. This dark, satirical ending is not appropriate for everything in the film, but it's the only part of the film that comes to life in a distant way. Everything else is boring. <br /> <br /> I do not like having to admit that a Harold Lloyd film fails, because I love it so much, but I have no choice with this one. Grade: D
