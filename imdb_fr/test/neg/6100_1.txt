This short subject is a remake of the movie "What's the Matador?" From 1942 Three Stooges, which deals with the boys' trip to Mexico and their adventures of bullfighting. Although the original short film was made during the peak period of the Stooges, it's not memorable and I think it's one of the most mediocre films with Curly Howard. <br /> <br /> Having established it, I believe that "Sappy Bullfighters" is simply pathetic, like all the other short films by Joe Besser. Bessy should never have hired Moe and Larry because her moaning, almost feminine character was completely wrong for the violent comedy of the Stooges. His 16 films with Moe and Larry marked the nadir for the team, and these short films are annoying to watch. This short film was released in 1959 and was the swan song of the team with Columbia. Maybe Besser was a nice guy, but he was wrong as the third stooge. <br /> <br /> I will not go over the Besser shorts again, because I would only give the same scathing criticism again and again. Do yourself a big favor and do not look at it. Instead, try to catch "In the sweet pie and tart" or "Hoi Polloi".
