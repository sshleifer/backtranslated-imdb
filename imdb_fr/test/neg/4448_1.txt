This film was by far the best of all time ... I think the one who shot it with Sony's handheld camera was a genius and the special effects were spectacular, especially the heart of a chicken breast ... thank goodness, this movie only cost me a dollar to rent .. Also the dump of poisonous green breasts was amazing ...... I could have shot this movie with my friends in high school. .................................................. .................. I would not recommend this movie to anyone ... you might want to kill yourself instead of watching it ..... I also think that c was a gesture for pornstars trying to find a place in the legitimate film industry ............ give it to him Larz
