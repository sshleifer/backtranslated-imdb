Tarzan, the leader of environmental awareness, faces four trappers who, according to the most unorthodox method, remove animals to bring them into zoos. Tarzan has a bland but sexy woman with an impeccable hairstyle and a child. No one should blame Tarzan for being hurt by the evil acts of hunters. <br /> <br /> This film by Gordon Scott Tarzan is one of the most ridiculous, completely stupid and without reason; for one reason or another, the team found nothing charming to support the film, so it's just hogwash. Tarzan and his family are threatened by a group of evil trappers, because Tarzan's environmental conscience has brought him into open conflict with the criminals. The child and the chimpanzee, both belonging to Tarzan, are kidnapped by the malicious trappers; Tarzan then calls the jungle animal forces to free the kid and the chimpanzee, with Tarzan leading the way. TARZAN AND THE TRAPPERS is stupid, unattractive, utterly uninteresting. Maybe, child, I would have liked it? Now, you have to be too mean - as wickedly evil as those pathetic trappers punished by Tarzan - to ask a Tarzan movie not to be stupid; that's what I concede. But we are also entitled to ask these Tarzan films, as ridiculous as they are, to have and show taste - a little taste - even a little bit of taste. Some kicks, excitement, fun. Now, the failure of Gordon Scott Tarzan is too silly, that is to say that there is no taste at all, that it misses all excitement. (Yes, I liked the sequence of the jungle beast eating a snake.) What a beast? Watch the movie, kids, now I just gave you an excuse to do it.) For one reason or another, the villains look somewhat pathetic and provoke mercy rather than virtuous anger. <br /> <br /> The books give the impression that Tarzan seemed very bright in his own way; and if finding an honest bodybuilder or other sportsman who looks smart enough to play his role might be too difficult and almost impossible, Gordon Scott was still too far from achieving that ideal. <br /> <br /> The wife reprimands Tarzan for the contempt of the books. <br /> <br /> The script suggests that Tarzan was uneducated, almost illiterate and harmful to learning; but the book says the opposite, and we know that Tarzan has studied a lot, all alone, using the books of his disappeared family, even before meeting whites. <br /> <br /> And I did not like that cry. <br /> <br /> (My dear children, he's supposed to be a real scream, not a yodeler missed.)
