Let's face it, this atrocity is not Plan Nine or Cat Women. It's bad, simply! Performances range from theater to theater school (Marla English) to the walk "we do not care" (Tom Conway). Photography (even in a good print) is so cloudy that sometimes it's hard to see what's going on. The real problem, however, is the aimless plot, without purpose, almost without plot and the lead-free direction. After 77 minutes, it always seems endless. <br /> <br /> The scenario is particularly inept. There are two lines of history that intersect only at the very end of the image. Tom Conway is trying to create a super race, using voodoo and modern science (though there is little scientific evidence) that he can control telepathically. He keeps his wife prisoner (without discernible reason). Meanwhile, two small crooks and a guide of the white hunter type try to find the village in which he works, waiting for gold and jewels. When they finally arrive, Tom Conway decides that one of them, the woman, is the ideal subject for his experiences. She is transformed into a monster, kills Conway (natch!) Then returns to normal. She sees a gold statue half drowned in a boiling pool, tries to recover it and falls into the water and apparently drowns. The white hunter saves the woman. In the last shot, we see the woman supposedly drowned again become the monster; threatening of a sequel (now it's really a scary thought!). <br /> <br /> The producer of the AIP, Samuel Z Arkoff, in a conference included in the DVD, prides himself on spotting the niche market of teenage girls and satisfying it for ingenious movies on a budget. However, it's hard to see how anyone would think this rancid mix would please everyone. What call do they think this could possibly have? The monster appears so rarely that it could hardly be called a horror movie. The action in the jungle is tepid and tedious. There are no teenagers in it or characters with whom teenagers could relate. <br /> <br /> Producers exhibited 77 minutes of film, but they did not shoot a movie. It's a trap and Arkoff should be ashamed of his association with her.
