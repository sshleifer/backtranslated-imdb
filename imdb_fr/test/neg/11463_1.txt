I realize that most people do not know who Solomon Kane is and that the film is for a much larger audience. But then why bother calling it "Solomon Kane" in the first place when the name has no market value? The characters certainly have nothing to do with the R.E. Howard character. Except he has a big hat. This is where the resemblance ends. <br /> <br /> It's always a bad sign when a superhero / fantasy / sci-fi movie lingers on an original story, but when you invent a complete garment like this one for a character who did not have one at all, you have completely missed the point. Kane is not even the fanatical Christian warrior of stories, but rather a former villain who tries to save his soul (this part is in the opening scene). <br /> <br /> With the most basic character elements altered or simply ignored, the use of the Solomon Kane name is simply confusing. Is it just so that they can say "Conan's creator" and hope to connect to an upcoming franchise if the new movie "Conan" is launched? Ignoring the complete departure of the stories, the film is competent if it is generic for the first half, but then becomes pure stupidity in the culminating scene that involves several super villains (think of three "boss levels" at the same time), none of which is the least interesting or threatening. <br /> <br /> If I was not a fan of Kane disappointed to have completely ignored the source material, I would probably give the film 3 or 4 instead of 1 Even for the (majority) viewers who go come here without knowing anything about Kane, it's a pretty thin oatmeal.
