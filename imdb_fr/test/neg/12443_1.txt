My mother brought me this movie on a DVD. A guy in a rental recommended it. But in fact, it's maybe the worst movie I've ever seen. You know, I did not expect much from this movie, but it did not have a good story, it was not even funny and it was nonsense. I was anxious to see Christine Lakin in this film because I loved Step by step. Even she was a huge disappointment. The story was completely unreal. One of the guys at the party is dead (he was not dead actually, he woke up later), the house seems to have exploded a bomb and there are 2 guys who have 3 hours to manage everything. But then comes a homosexual, a policeman ... There is a total waste to the end and the guys managed to clean and all that lasts like 15 minutes ??? Come on, be at least realistic. Waste of money. Really...
