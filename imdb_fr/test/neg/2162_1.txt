This film was given to me by my uncle, who had it free with a magazine on DVD. It's easy to see why he was so eager to get rid of it. I understand now that it is a B movie and that its budget is not the same size as the big films, but they would surely have been able to spend their money better than doing this trash. There are some pretty good performances, namely Jack, Beth and Hawks, but others are ridiculously bad (assasin droid for example). This movie also contains the worst fight scene I have ever seen. The amount of nudity in the movie makes it more like a porn movie than a sci-fi movie. <br /> <br /> In conclusion - Awful film
