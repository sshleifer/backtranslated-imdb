Maybe I'm alone here, but it's a crappy show. I'm sorry but I was attracted when I learned about Lil 'Bill O'Reilly (I did not know he was coming out of this show several months later and I honestly lost it since) but I gave the series a free kick. . Spike strives to do something he is not, that is, he tries to be human. Fox did not even bother to hide the strings when they took him out of the box he had entered. His sketches are too difficult, he is not funny himself and writers struggle to write for an animator without talent. There are too many good TVs out there to waste your time with this show, and Fox ..... Fox we had a good time, but you have to organize your actor together and come up with something original to the square. to try to be just another "Me-too" network.
