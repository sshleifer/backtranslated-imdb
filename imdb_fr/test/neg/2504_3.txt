One of the few films shot at the Coronado High School in Scottsdale, Arizona in the late '80s, as well as the excellent Just One of Guys, Bill and Ted's Excellent Excellent and Just Perfect (segmented Mickey movie) Mouse Club.). is definitely for kids as the previous reviews are absolutely right. <br /> <br /> Coronado has undergone a restructuring in the last two years and many of the buildings seen in this film have now disappeared. The field where they play wrestling is adjacent to the football field, one of the few places still there. The internal scenes near the lockers, I believe, were in the old building 200. <br /> <br /> Unless you play late at night on the Disney channel, it can be very difficult to find a movie. How they have never done so is beyond me.
