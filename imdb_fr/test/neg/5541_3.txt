I realize it's a small statistical sample (8 votes to date), but 5.9 out of 10? I give this film a 3 and even it's generous. I tried to watch this film three times now (the first Saturday evening at SciFi and the Saturday night at the replay Thursday night) and I fell asleep three times before the end of the film. Which leaves me with a laundry list of unanswered questions. For example, does Lance Henriksen run out of money and must continue to play supporting roles in these awful "Pumpkinhead" sequels? Is Henriksen forbidden to make films other than "Pumpkinhead"? Could not the creators of this franchise be better than a monster that looks like a geriatric and emaciated "Alien" who walks as if he had a stick stuck in his a **? When will the hick characters in these movies realize that handguns and rifles do not hurt the "Pumpkinhead?" Why do not they try to jam another stick, but rather a **? Finally, do the writers of this film have a creative challenge to the point of being able to propose more original names for the two families in conflict than Hatfield and McCoy? While you're there, why not write a scenario about a fictional president and name him George Bush? One day, I may have the mental stamina to watch this movie without falling asleep. Until then, if someone has the answers, let me know.
