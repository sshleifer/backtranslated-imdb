It's a little disconcerting when a studio refuses to project a film for the press before its release in large format. What many movies fear is not surprising, but when a studio itself admits it in advance, the filming process becomes a kind of passion game. Think of it as an anticipated Christmas present from Hollywood, while "Aeon Flux" is not an affront to taste and modesty that one would expect, given the above. Although finally overwhelmed by his faults, he has at least one idea with which he can play. Too bad, director Karyn Kusama seems to have little clue as to how to do it all. <br /> <br /> It's the future. There was a plague. There is a dictatorship and rebels. These are known as Monicans and, far from being a worship of the beret or tennis fans, they are trying to overthrow the old regime called Goodchild. The regime is sometimes naughty with citizens, which is more than Aeon Flux (Charlize Theron) and his friends can handle. Thanks to a kind of biochemical virtual reality technology, Monicans receive the orders of their dear leader (Frances McDormand), a mystical priestess who seems to have been mixed with a carrot. It's up to Aeon to focus on futuristic and well-fitting spandex outfits to execute High Carrot's orders, which are of course a "destroy the regime" version. Years earlier, she had seen her sister being liquidated by the Goodchilds. She does not need to be convincing. <br /> <br /> It is not surprising that things get complicated. The Goodchilds might not be what they seem to be, and Aeon herself might have an unexpected story with them. Although sometimes confusing, the film's central conception (of which I will not speak any further) contains some interesting notions about the nature of human existence and survival. There is room for a much more in-depth review that the film does not take advantage of, but the ideas are there, at least. The big problems of "Aeon Flux" are technical. Kusama made the disconcerting decision of filming almost all the action so closely that we can rarely follow what is happening. To make matters worse, it is published in a series of jumps that leave us completely lost. This results in a serious spatial disorientation that invades the film. The aesthetic of "Aeon Flux" is that of an elegant suit, an architecture with strange angles and agile characters. Much of the action takes place in minimalist open spaces that require uninterrupted plans that could convey the grace and athleticism involved in the foregoing. Instead, we have half-seconds of flying limbs, broken glass and sound effects. <br /> <br /> There is a very good movie that is trying to get out of Aeon Flux quagmire. Entrust this task to the Wachowski brothers, for example, and the results could be very different. Anyway, I had the impression that "Aeon Flux" was driving me away from a movie I wanted to enjoy. This film is devoid of all its strength. As a novice poker player who has received a royal color, he finds a way to lose despite his potential.
