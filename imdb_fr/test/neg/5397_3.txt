"You have beans, beans are good, you eat them and you leave." I could not help laughing at this piece of dialogue. Beans are the musical fruit, you know. The more you eat, the more you go, toot, toot. <br /> <br /> Hmmmm ... OK, I can understand why the actors were in this situation because they needed paychecks to pay their bills, but I'm not too sure of the director's intentions and the writer. Even after watching the making-of documentary in the DVD supplements. <br /> <br /> Mike Rooker gave this performance that he really did not deserve. I've seen it in other movies MUCH better than this one. What would have greatly improved this film was to throw everything away, keep Rooker and make another entry into the franchise "The Substitute". Rooker would have been an excellent substitute for educating naughty and mentally retarded youth about the error of their behavior and how they can become more useful and productive members of society. <br /> <br /> Casper, you really should not. 'Do not just cross the undergrowth like that, because you could get poisoned oak. Oops. It does not matter. I guess the poisoned oak is the last of your worries. Well, at least this time, your croaking was not done by the tail of a giant python. Few things are as awkward as getting the giant snake stuck in your chest. At least the scene of death in this movie had a little more dignity. As well as a more liberal smear of karo syrup and red food coloring. Nothing says a sad and tragic death like the liberal use of karo and red dye! <br /> <br /> The first time I see a monster wearing a shiny rayon cloak with a fur collar. First time for everything, I guess. Just to be fussy, though, if it was an Indian ghost, how come it looks exactly like a monster from European culture and folklore? Would not the monster have been more Indian? <br /> <br /> Although I have looked at the credits, I do not realistically believe that I can recommend it in good faith to others.
