Two films: "the fifth element", "armageddon". The same subject: save the world. The same main actor: Bruce Willis. One difference: "Armageddon" is much inferior to Luc Besson's film. Some spectacular special effects fail to hide a laborious and conventional scenario on a global scale. Several parts of the film show it. I'm thinking of the president's speech and more specifically about Willis's relationship with his daughter, "Grace". At the beginning of the film, he tends to neglect and over-protect, which makes him tired. Then, at the end of the film, it is true love and understanding that shine in him. On the other hand, the film falls into the following trap: Michael Bay takes his subject too seriously. Of course, the film tries to be funny, but the result does not work because the humor presented in the film is often rude and low enough whereas in the "fifth element", the humor was wacky, involuntary and him side seriousness of the action. The film suffers from two other handicaps: it often falls into ridicule (the Russian astronaut) and almost all actors are misused. Bruce Willis is the opposite of the character of his "fifth element". He plays the he-man, he does it and sometimes he is unbearable. The other actors are barely credible in their own roles, especially the Willis sinking crew. It seems that this crew is here to have fun. One of them is taken to be very qualified, but he looks like a fool. And poor Liv Tyler! She is at NASA just to be decorative. <br /> <br /> When the film was released in France in August 1998, Bruce Willis expressed his weariness to save the world. His fatigue was probably justified by this spectacular but mediocre film.
