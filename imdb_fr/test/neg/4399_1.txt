National Lampoon's Dorm Daze is by far the worst film I've ever seen and I saw the movie Kazaam. Anyone who reads this and thinks this movie is good in any way has no idea what a good movie is and should never watch another movie again because they are really so stupid . to name everything that's wrong with this movie. First of all, the plot is omnipresent and can not very well follow all the many "misunderstandings". The acting is, to say the least, horrible, and the whole thing was badly done. Anyone who has worked on this film should not be in another movie from a kid Ever Again! <br /> <br /> It is too difficult to summarize this film in a paragraph or two, because it is so bad, but for all who read this, please, DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM !! If you want to watch a good movie, go see something else on TV. Even the United States has better movies than that. <br /> <br /> _friend.
