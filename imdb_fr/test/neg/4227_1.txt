Although this film has a slow, dreamlike, almost mesmerizing, and interesting, but perhaps not entirely accurate, description of the practices and criminal investigation personnel of a French police officer in rural settings, I finally finds it impossible to recommend. I think this film is simply a centerpiece to advance a person's - the director, he assumes - the disgust of heterosexuality. Certainly, human sexuality in all its forms can have its revolting moments, there is no doubt! But choosing the wrong uniformly at the expense of good, as this film does at every turn, suggests a distorted sensitivity to work. In short, if you like to watch homo-eroticism pretending to be compassionate and portraying heterosexual love and the woman in a hideous and degrading light, then this film is for you. I did not, and it was not.
