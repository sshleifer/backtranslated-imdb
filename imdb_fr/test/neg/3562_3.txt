This film tries to say something profound. I'm not sure what it was. In the end, I have too much to solve so that I can understand the basics. Some scenes really ask me what's left on the floor of the cutting room. I do not think the wall was very well developed, I never understood what was going on there. When the mother finally reveals it, I simply can not establish a link with the boy's silence. What was the purpose of the boy not to speak? Was he just delusional or did he get some kind of power? What was the scene with the burned girl? Another power that the boy has or what? I do not understand how this developed a character or moved the plot. I had a little bully, but what happened to the dog? Did the dog come back or did mom get rid of Fido forever? <br /> <br /> There were several additional parcel items that were more cumbersome than the use. Like the radio show in the background about the war in Iraq. I think it was supposed to create a sort of comparison with the grief and insecurity that Mother and Addison felt, but for me it was distracting and difficult. I did not buy the link much. I also found that the teacher was going too far in Addison not to say "here" for the call. The mother who saw the doctor was useless, how did he serve the plot? Was it to show how desperate the mother was, or was it drugs that I did not have? Was it the father who came back in the last scene, or just a guy? So, did writing on the wall work? What happened to the dog?
