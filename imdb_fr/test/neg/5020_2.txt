First of all, I want to say that I have a liberal political position and that I found the film offensive. I managed to look at all the shame of a movie. This film brings a weakness to the original ideas. Yes it was original so my 2 stars instead of 1. Our writers are they so creative that they can only come with that ?? To play was horrible, and the characters were for the most part incomparable. The main woman of the story had no quality. They turned her into some kind of bad guy and I did not see her at all. Maybe I missed something, I do not know. He was the most realistic and relevant character in the film. I did not pay money for this waste. I almost hope that PETA comes to the rescue of this horrible offensive film and organizes a demonstration. Disgusting, that's all I have to say!
