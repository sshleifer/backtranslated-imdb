(Synopsis) In 2055, the rich are able to go back in time and hunt a living dinosaur at an exceptional price. Sonia Rand (Catherine McCormack) has developed a machine capable of bringing people back in time. Charles Hatton (Ben Kingsley) adopted this technology and opened a company known as Time Safari. Anyone with this money can go back millions of years and shoot a dinosaur. Dr. Travis Ryer (Edward Burns) leads his team with the big game hunter on a floating walkway to a place where they can kill the dinosaur. The travel protocol is that they must stay on the sidewalk and not disturb the earth or anything that surrounds them. Unfortunately for the human race, a hunter advances and kills a butterfly. This insignificant act has major impacts on the Earth's climate and creates new species of animals. The course of evolution as we know it is changing in waves of time. Travis and Sonia try to stop the process of change before it becomes permanent and the man does not go out. <br /> <br /> (Commentary) exaggerated. The death of a single butterfly causing enormous changes in the atmosphere and the evolution of the world is simply ridiculous. They changed Chicago's skyline to look modern, but the new cars of the future were ridiculous. You can wait to see this fantasy on DVD. (Warner Brothers Pictures, Duration 1:43, Rated PG-13) (4/10)
