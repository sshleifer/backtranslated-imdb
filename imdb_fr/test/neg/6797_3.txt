It was an abominable show. In short, it was about this kid named Doug who was guilty of a lot of guilt. Seriously, he might feel guilty of killing a fly, then guilty of having been guilty of killing the fly, etc. The entertainment was rude and unpleasant and the jokes cheap. <br /> <br /> It was broadcast here in Sweden as part of the show "Disney time" and I remember to have loved it, but I was 13 years old. <br /> <br /> I never understood why some of the characters were so green and purple. What was going on with that? <br /> <br /> Really a horrible show. Apparently, this has spawned a movie I have never seen but I do not expect much from this movie.
