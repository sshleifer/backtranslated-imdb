This roaring ... <br /> <br /> That sullen look ... <br /> <br /> The acts of random violence ... <br /> <br /> The guttural voice ... < <br /> <br /> The fetish clothing ... <br /> <br /> This shaved head ... <br /> <br /> It can only mean one thing ... <br /> <br /> GRACE JONES IS BACK! <br /> <br /> My sources tell me that the lead role in Blade was not played by the 1980s diva, but by Wesley Snipes. <br /> <br /> it's not an improvement. <br /> <br /> The blade is an adaptation of a comic character; In a way, in the passage of the simplistic and two-dimensional world of the printed page, it has become even more simplistic and has lost some dimensions. <br /> <br /> The plot is confusing almost beyond belief and adds nothing to the kind vampire, in fact, a bit like Nosferatu, it seems to suck the life of the public. In short, a mobile vampire up wants to become more powerful but runs into Blade, half human, half vampire, all annoying. Everything is at its height with Blade in a vampire juice press, some bad martial arts and the most pitiful CGI since 1968. <br /> <br /> Blade must be the least empathic character since Dolph Lundgren's Punisher ( also a comic adaptation, maybe there is a trend here?). Is the audience supposed to be on the same side as the "hero"? And even if a vampire can be a tragic character, this is not the case with Blade, he is always cruel, scornful and no better than the bad guys. <br /> <br /> I guess Wesley Snipes has a 'acting career' for the sole purpose of being able to compare favorably all the others. As he makes his way through his movie, you find yourself in search of a stake, even a ballpoint pen, to put Blade in the grave. <br /> <br /> As a piece of narcissism, Blade is pretty much unbeatable - we are treated to endless endless shots of a cool Snipe like the gym, for no reason. Similarly, no other player has the opportunity to give a reasonable performance. Steven Dorff * CAN * act, but they have to play the supporting role after the tedious performance of Snipes. <br /> <br /> Kris Kristofferson used to appear in good movies, here he is reduced to a sidekick you just know is not going to get to the last reel. And what happens when Blade discovers it? Yes, you guessed it, he rushes onto the stage to take revenge in the underground giant underground den. <br /> <br /> Why can not the domination of the world take place in a quiet country house? They always go to underground cathedrals where Albert Speer would wonder if they were a little grandiose. Many of these plans could be stopped now if local councils were paying more attention to basement expansion projects. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie is just as dull and unimaginative, there is nothing new to add to the genre. The vampires have been destroyed and maybe they should be allowed to rest for a while - at least until someone finds a way to make them interesting again. <br /> <br /> Finally, there is * a * grace The vampire Jones movie is called Vamp and is about ten times better than this one.
