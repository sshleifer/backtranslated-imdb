A great gangster movie, with brilliant performances of well-known actors with big action scenes? Well, not this one. <br /> <br /> It's pretty amazing to see so many well-known comedians, who have a lot of good movies in their filmographies in such a movie, this can probably be one of the worst that they may possibly appear. <br /> <br /> First, the plot is consistent with what you expect from your average gangster biography, nothing new, nothing extraordinary. The way it is said makes the film much longer than it is (when I thought the two hours should be almost over, I was pretty surprised that only 45 minutes had passed). <br /> <br /> The action scenes are very similar to those of the TV series of the 80s - the A-Team, for example. It's just that in the 80s (especially with Team A), these scenes were much more sophisticated than those of "El Padrino". It's especially fun to see the guys point their guns up and touch something else (not to mention the people behind the car doors who look like they were shot down later). <br /> <br /> to act corresponds pretty well to the action. Either you get the same reaction to everything that's going on (Dolph Lundgren style), or it's so overworked that you might think it's a travesty (but unfortunately it's not). <br /> <br /> My advice is to stay away from this movie, any other gangster movie is better than this one.
