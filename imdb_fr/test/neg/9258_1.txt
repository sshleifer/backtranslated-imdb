Staten Island filmmaker Andy Milligan is well known in the horror community for being a director even worse than Ed Wood. And with that as a weak example of his production, I agree with them. In "The Ghastly Ones", three couples argue in their childhood home (located on an isolated island) to recover an inheritance. There, they are killed one by one and the events unfold in the manner of a murder / mystery with a delayed and marked butler, added to make you lose a loop. The film is in such bad shape that it seems that someone just passed through a dishwasher, the sound is horrible, the dialogue is from another world, there is a primitive gore mannequin (plus some dismemberments and guts) and it is technically inept in every way it can be inept. But is it nice in a bad movie? Kind of. It is unbearable to watch but curiously entertaining in the manner of a train accident. Approach with caution. If you're not a fan of horrendous movies, prefer six.
