Seven pioneering children fight independently over many kilometers of Indian territory and through harsh weather to reach Oregon. <br /> <br /> History has shown that young soldiers who have traveled alone long distances, such as the Children's Crusade, have been manipulated and exploited while being abused and sold as slaves. these children are tough enough and try to do their best to achieve their goal of creating a family property in the west of the country. The film is sometimes a little too syrupy, but good for fans of "The Waltons" and "Little House on the Prairie". <br /> <br /> Dean Smith gives a nice performance as "Kit Carson".
