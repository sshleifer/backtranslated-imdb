SKELETON MAN was not a problem for the first 5 minutes, but as soon as the so-called "special force agents" came on the screen, he went down faster than a big boy on a sled. <br /> <br /> The opening allows us to think that we might have a horror movie that is both cheesy and fun, but no ... the filmmakers ruin any hope that "special agents of the force " occur. I want the screenwriter to take a different route and ask the "skeleton man" to pursue some weak-minded teenagers until one of them finally gets the upper hand. Instead, the "skeleton man" chases down some "weak special-force agents" and pushes them back until their captain finally gets the upper hand. <br /> <br /> I know all the "harassment of weak-minded teenagers by a killer" This has not been done before, but it would be better suited to a movie like this. <br /> <br /> When "skeleton man" finally meets his "so-called" death, in a building exploding, a police officer outside the building asked the captain agents of the special force ":" What happened there? " My answer to this question: "Who the hell cares?"
