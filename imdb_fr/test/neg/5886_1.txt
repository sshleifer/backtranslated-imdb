The baby boom was bad enough, it's worse than a series of all male nightmares. Yeah, I noticed that some of them made me feel better after a bad day, it reminded me that it could be worse. The guy was rich, single (intelligent man) and frequented celebrities, singers and actresses. Then, his fault with a cousin cost him his biggest mistake. In fact, it would have been directly from the host family, I'm sure, it was really a chic series. Oh, and what's going on about the change of baby, most of the time it's probably a doll at this age, it's nothing more than an accessory anyway. <br /> <br /> In any case, I'm glad it did not last longer. one year.
