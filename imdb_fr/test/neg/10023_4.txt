Everything everyone has already said sounds good when it comes to "The Prey". Endless film, bad acting - Apart from these elements, this is a movie that slasher fans can watch and which, in some cases, is considered a cult classic. </ P>. There is also a three-minute banjo solo that shows Bostwick's talent behind the instrument. Not too bad if I say it myself. <br /> <br /> The last ten minutes of the "film" are his saving grace. The end still haunts me to this day. This can also have an ephemeral effect, as these are the first effects of John Carl Bucheler. Some may know him in films like 'Troll' and 'Friday the 13th part 7 - He made these two films). In short, this is not a movie where everyone will find something that redeems. can be ranked among the most amateurish companies, but for this handful (but very loyal) of slasher fans around the world, even the bad actors and the atrocious images of nature can be forgiven.
