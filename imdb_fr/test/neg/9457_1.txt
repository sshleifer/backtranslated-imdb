Just the director's juvenile fantasy comes to life. This "film" is nothing more than an excuse for the director / actor to play kissy in front of a seductive young woman who would otherwise never give him the time. <br /> <br /> The plot is simple, the direction is nonexistent and the film drags while the actor / director / writer / narrator tells. Do not trust the 'X' rating, there is no nudity and minimal gore.
