Ok, so maybe the acting was not bad, but I tap this criticism as a public service in order to prevent anyone at the intriguing beginning of this TV movie from losing two hours of his life waiting a plot development that will never happen. come. The chief investigator has the strong feeling to suppress the missing naval officer (Guy), and there are few people who do not interfere with the witnesses and the accused who seem to dispute it. So, what's the point of staying with this drama? Beats the heck out of me. I thought (or hoped) that there would be some sort of conspiracy or revelation, but nothing was done. In summary, I can not think of a single reason for watching this useless TV movie, based on a true story or not.
