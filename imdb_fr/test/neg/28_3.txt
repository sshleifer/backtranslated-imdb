Rita Hayworth plays a Brooklyn nightclub dancer named Rusty, specializing in cheese chorus reviews; she manages to make the front page of a national fashion magazine, but her imminent success as a solo (with romantic offers all around) hit the boss Gene Kelly. A piece of technicolor cotton candy that is terribly tired, with immutable musical skits (the two worst of them are unrelated flashbacks from the 1890s, with Hayworth representing his own grandmother). As always, Kelly dances well but acts with a false sincerity. when he is serious, he is unbearable, and the rest of the time, he flies on adrenaline. The scenario has a head start, without even Phil Silvers and Eve Arden, all support players, have good replicas. * 1/2 of ****
