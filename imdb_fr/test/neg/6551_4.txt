Another of these fragile stories associated with the most forgettable music numbers. Powell and O'Keefe as conflicting publicists are completely forgettable. However, there are two brilliant moments. Hubert Castle is the incredible tightrope walker you'll ever see - his "Drunk Walk" on the wire must be the most spectacular balancing piece ever recorded on film. You have to see it to believe it. The other is Sophie Tucker who makes a turn towards the end of the film. Her magnetism, her professionalism, her great talent for being herself - well, the charisma is not learned - you have it or not. A good lesson for all potential cabaret artists. A sad note: W.C. Fields in his latest cameo is completely forgotten.
