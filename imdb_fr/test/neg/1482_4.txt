I was Stan in the movie "Dreams Come True". Stan was the friend who worked at the factory with the main character and ended up getting broken in the machines and was screaming (where was the ambulance?) The actors in this film were mostly quite poor with primarily local players from Fox Valley, Wisconsin. I saw the movie on the big screen. He played 2 nights in 3 theaters and was something special to see on the big screen. I may be biased, but overall, I appreciated. The soundtrack was also the Spooner group, which later became Garbage. My brother, Steve Charlton was also in the movie. He played Swenson the man who comes to the door on crutches to talk to the police.
