This film has ALL the clich√©s of all the movies of terrorism or crisis of airliners. <br /> <br /> However, it is not totally unbearable, thanks to the good performances of Rowland, Loken and Smallwood (and perhaps Enberg). <br /> <What is incredibly bad, though, is the computer animations that they try to pass off as live action scenes. Little boy, little boy, the scenes in computer-generated images of "The Last Starfighter", filmed in 1984, are better than these (filmed 17 years later). The feeling of cheepnis makes you really cold in the back. <br /> <br /> Too bad, it could have been a much better movie with a little more budget and taste.
