If you are at home on a weekend, you are very bored and you do not want to move, you can not do anything better than your life in the next few hours. The acting, the screenplay and the movie in general are not that bad, that's why it's possible to get through. It's really a film they would show in high school health class to teach the dangers of premarital sex. Or they could also show it to teach the dangers of a very lame music - the rock band Brian Austin Green is really terrible, I think it's a much bigger threat to society than unmarried parents.
