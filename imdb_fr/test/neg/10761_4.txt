It pains me to see how much everyone can give a high score to this film. It's not a euphemism to call it exaggerated. How did the guy manage in such a short time to build a wooden labyrinth of underground rooms is pretty ridiculous or perhaps he was the greatest carpenter since Jesus. The obese sheriff played by Hoyt Axton looked like a refugee on Jerry Springer's show, and I found blonde girl Jennifer Jason Leigh rather sober. In the United Kingdom, we have the expression "sheep reconstituted lamb" which suits him perfectly. It was not so bad though, I liked it a lot when the end credits were recorded and "The End" was brilliant enough for this TV movie which, if it was an cinema, would have been put on video in discount stores in no time.
