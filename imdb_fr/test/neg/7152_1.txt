If this film arrives in a theater near you, consider it a threat. I had the misfortune to see this film here in Tokyo. Since I was Dutch, I was surprised to find a Dutch film playing in a metropolis like Tokyo. I thought it must be something special if a Dutch film went to Japan. So I went there with friends and we were happy to tell the theater staff that we were Dutch and that we were so curious about the movie. It turned out to be one of the most childish, stupid, stupid, worst movies, with the worst English spoken movie I've seen in a decade, and I left the theater to try to avoid the staff, because I felt almost responsible for this disaster movie. Sometimes you get the impression that you know what the director was aiming for: Lola Rennt, Trainspotting, a bit like a movie. Instead, it was more like MacGyver, who used drugs with outdated breakbeat music. But if I did not feel too bored, the movie was involuntarily quite hilarious from time to time, as it showed Holland to the smallest.
