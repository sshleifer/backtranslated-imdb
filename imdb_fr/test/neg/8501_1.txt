How did this film enter the Berlin Film Festival? I understand that it fits in the Panorama section, but still. <br /> <br /> This film presents: <br /> <br /> 1. No ground. 2. Act horrible. 3. Excruciating videography. 4. Some of the worst graffiti ever recorded on video. <br /> <br /> One of the decisive factors that explains the greatest number of its meanings to the festival is the presence of this old waiter: homosexuality. Indeed, the only thing that happens in this movie is that a graffiti artist does it with another one and jerks it off. Then he feels weird about it and they have a boring old "break" conversation that you can expect to hear from your first crush in college (with lines like "You kissed me first, dude." ). Oh, and by the way, it's not a game of tears ... you see the gay angle coming in the first ten minutes of the movie. Apart from that, it is mostly bad labels, under-dressed "undercover" policemen, skateboarding and a train ride. <br /> <br /> If the subject is about everyone, I recommend you to watch on the web underground graffiti videos made by real graffiti artists. There are many ... and they are much more entertaining than this shit.
