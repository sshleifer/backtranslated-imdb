Granny is without a doubt one of the worst horror films ever made in the history of cinema. <br /> <br /> The scenario was diabolical, so bad in fact that I almost cried laughing about some of the things they came out of. The acting was almost as bad, they would have done better to throw traffic cones to play the roles (they would have done a better job). The killings were laughable, the suspense was nonexistent, the work with the camera was ineffective and the "major" intrigue of the plot in the end was disgusting, it was getting worse and worse. <br /> <br /> "The grandmother" is probably one of the least threatening "bad guys" filmed, she looks like she's wearing a cheap supermarket mask (nylon hair sparkles) endless laughter) and a rustling nightgown. Would you be scared by that ??? I certainly was not. <br /> <br /> If you like watching bad movies (see Manos, Troll 2, Michael Bay movies), it's a must. Those who do not like bad movies and who do not like laughing at a shocking dialogue, avoid like the plague.
