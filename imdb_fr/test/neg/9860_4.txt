I was disappointed by this documentary. I thought it would be the second match between Grandmaster Garry Kasporov and Deep Blue, the supercomputer designed by IBM computer experts to beat any human player. Kasparov was and still is considered the greatest chess player of all time. .the film brings us back to 1997 when Kasporov had agreed to play a rematch against "deep blue" after beating him a year earlier. but instead of focusing on the game, it focuses more on what happens before and after. There are excerpts from the game, but not much. Many films revolve around Kasporov's paranoid obsession that the match was rigged as part of a conspiracy theory and he lost the match unfairly. The film also includes interviews of people who are not in any way interesting. they even talk to the manager of the building where the match was played. Who cares? I also found it very dry and very slow.Finally, this film was not satisfactory. It's just my opinion, of course. If you like conspi racy theories, this movie might interest you.For people who are not interested in theories of the game or conspiracy theories, this film would probably have no value.I am a fan of chess and I do not I held that for that.I gave "Game Over: Kasparov and the machine" 4/10
