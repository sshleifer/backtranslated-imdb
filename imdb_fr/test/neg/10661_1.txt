This film must be the worst film of 2007, it was really bad and I do not think I have ever seen a film that is so bad, I mean that Hollywood movies do not really bad ?? Hamish should really stick to singing instead of acting because he absolutely can not act. God, he was so bad. I mean, he was so bad in the movie that he made Mallika Sherawat appear as a better actress than him. her performance, she plays the same role in every movie, god it's so boring to watch her, I mean what men see in this woman? Yeah, she has a god body but where is this talent ???? I have not seen it yet and at this rate, I do not think I'll ever do it. <br /> <br /> Anyway, Hamish falls in love with Ria. This 15 year old girl can act, my god, she was the best. actor in the film and she does not look at all, for me she is about 21, but her performance was brilliant in the film. bless her she was really good, I hope to see more of her in the future. So Ria falls in love with Himash, but her father wants to marry her with someone else, a typical Bollywood movie, but there is a hiccup (this can only happen in a Bollywood movie) and the two are finally married. Well, I would give the music 10/10 it was superb, it made the movie a success, the songs were really amazing and brilliant. Anyway, the only thing I can say is go buy the music and not watch the movie.
