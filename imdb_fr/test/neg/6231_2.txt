I like most Jet Li movies (except for Romeo Must Die) and I bought this movie in a very inexpensive pack of three with "The Master" and "Twin Warriors". While Twin Warriors was very impressive and it intrigued me a lot, and that the master was a little "Karate Kid" but also nice, I thought this movie was horrible. I do not say that just because I'm used to better movies. I say it was almost there with "Kazaam". The fighting scenes were terrible (blurry cameras and no real combat) and the plot was your "stupid kung-fu plot". If you're going to have such a stupid conspiracy (see 'Man turns into a woman to become all-powerful, then he falls in love with Jet Li'), it's better that you engage in big fights. If you are looking for an original movie from HK Jet Li, I suggest you rent "Shaolin Temple 2" (aka Shaolin Kids).
