The Forgotten (AKA: Do not Look in the Basement) is a very cheap and very old horror movie. <br /> <br /> The story is very slow and never reaches something interesting. /> <br /> The asylum patients are strangely amusing, especially Sam and the old woman who always quotes an old adage to everyone. (Pay attention to the song as it gets closer to the camera, tell me you can look without laughing!). <br /> <br /> Now, the gore is very poor in appearance. does not really deserve its place on the list of bad video !. <br /> <br /> Overall, if you are not looking for a fantastic horror movie and you have some free time, then it's worth a look.
