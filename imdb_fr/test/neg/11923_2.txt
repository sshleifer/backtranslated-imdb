I got to know ÆON in the early 90s via TV and I loved ... <br /> <br /> What did you like? The grumpy drawing style? The flawless artistic action involved? The absurd and dead-end communication between the characters? All the layout of the surrounding future world? No matter what you liked ... <br /> <br /> The Aeon Flux film of the end of 2005 has nothing of that. <br /> <br /> Karyn Kusama, the so-called "director" of the film, was desperately overworked by transporting original content to a new film. If you are not familiar with the original series, you will not understand anything during the first 60 minutes of the movie. The story is impenetrable and the tasteless characters do not develop during the movie. <br /> <br /> Kusama's trying to improve the scenario by implementing rather weak explanatory conversations between the main characters is not only a lame attempt to conceal his faults as a storyteller, it's simply unworthy from the original concept of ON. <br /> <br /> Charlize Theron could be an attractive woman, but she can not imitate the character of ÆON. Even if she was tied to chains during action scenes, her lack of talent for physical movement simply ruins the action sequences of the movie. The result is a huge amount of hectic image slices to cover the lameness of his physique. <br /> <br /> Forget everything else, it's not worth the talk ... <br /> <br /> I give 1 point for Ms. Théron showing her breasts and 1 point for the beautiful architectural photograph of the film. That's all.
