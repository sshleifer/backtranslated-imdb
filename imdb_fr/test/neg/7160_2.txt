This film was highly recommended by a friend and, being a big fan of Brando, I ordered this movie from Harrods and waited for it impatiently. I have rarely been so disappointed by a movie. Brando was good as a German officer, but the rest of the movie was simply unbearable. You will never appreciate or pay attention to characters (except Brando, perhaps). The acting game was OK. History, what story? Maybe that's the point. It's war after all, but I've seen much better war movies. (Lawrence of Arabia, Apocalypse Now, even Star Wars) It was so boring to watch my watch ... <br /> <br /> Overall, this is one of the worst movies I've seen. Please do not waste your time and money on this. May I also add that this is the first comment I wrote, it was enough for me to make known my feelings about this film. <br /> <br /> By the way, my favorites of all time are: Casablanca, The Godfather 1 & 2, Flying Over a Cuckoo's Nest, Pulp Fiction and Amadeus. If you have not seen them yet, spare yourself the time to do it. And Amadeus MUST be widescreen 2.35: 1
