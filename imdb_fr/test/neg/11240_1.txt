I just gave a 10 to Thieves Highway, I mention it for two reasons, one to prove that I'm not an idiot who gives only bad reviews, but two because the theme of the film has the same thread , namely, falling in love with a woman. of the night. <br /> <br /> We all know that pretty woman is a female film but you can not avoid them all, they will end up having you. Pretty Woman for me does two things, two horrible horrible things. First, she describes prostitution as a career closer to that of a dancer. You know, with absolutely great friends, leg warmers warm up and make up each other. You see in the reality of Pretty Woman the prostitute and this is a prostitute we are talking about here, the prostitute has a wonderful life, she is healthy, happy to have only occasional groans to explain her predicament. My feeling is that this protagonist type 'Happy Hooker' is much more acceptable than a character almost realistic, which begs the question if you make a film about a type of person but you are too afraid of chicken to decorate this player with the familiar features to this role so why do it? If I make a film about a chef but I do not want him to cook, talk about food, or wear a white hat, why make a film about a chef? By bailing out and turning the heel into a respectable dancer, the story completely misses out on the question and therefore never lets himself answer any moral or social questions he might have, which cop would come out, really lame . <br /> <br /> Second, "Pretty woman" insults love, Edward Lewis interpreted by Richard Gere has no idea how to seduce or seduce this "lady" without his plastician friend, do not quit the house especially if you are a fool in a costume that has no imagination. 8 out of 10 of his romantic moments involve spending money one way or another, even when he meets her for the first time, it's the Lotus Spirit turbo doing all the work, necklaces here, diamonds, limos there, money, money, where is the charm? Where is the charisma, do not mention this piano attempt please. <br /> <br /> The girls who love this movie will also be the girls who love to shop more than anyone else. The guys who love this movie will not even realize that old Eddy has less charm than a calculator, as they probably did not do it either, so he will not register. More importantly, those who love this movie will hate 'Thieves Highway', a wonderful story whose part is based on the same subject. <br /> <br /> I will end on a song: <br /> <br /> Pretty woman haunted in the street Pretty woman of the kind that I like to treat Pretty woman, I do not believe you You are not the truth Nobody could spend as much as you Do mercy <br /> <br /> Pretty woman, will not you forgive me Pretty woman, I could not help but see Pretty woman, and you're as pretty as you can lacking imagination, just like me <br /> <br /> Pretty woman, magazines a moment Pretty woman, talks a while Pretty woman, sell me your smile Pretty woman, yeah, yeah, yeah Pretty woman, look my way Pretty woman, say that you will stay with me..and I will pay you..I will treat you well
