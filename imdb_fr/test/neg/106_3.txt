Dr. Stephens (Micheal Harvey) runs a psychiatric asylum. He has a different approach to the madman. He uses unorthodox methods of treatment. He treats everyone as a family, there is no lock at the patient's door and he lets some inmates simulate their twisted fantasies. He lets Sergeant Jaffee (Hugh Feagin) dress and act as a soldier and Harriet (Camilla Carr) play the role of a mother for a doll, including letting her put him to bed in a crib. Dr. Stevens is outside letting Judge Oliver W. Cameron (Gene Ross) cut a log with an ax, which turns out to be a bad move, because once Dr. Stevens returned, the judge planting the ax on the shoulder. Shortly after the nurse Charlotte Beale (Rosie Holotik) arrives at the Sanitarium after arranging an interview with Dr. Stevens about a possible job. She is greeted by Chief Nurse Geraldine Masters (Annabelle Weenick as Anne McAdams) and is offered a track position. She gets to know and is very appreciated by patients. However, things are finally starting to get worse, the phone lines are cut, an old lady named Ms. Callingham (Rhea MacAdams) has her tongue cut off and she starts to get the strange feeling that things are just not going well . Then, one night, all the secrets of the shrines of the sanctuary are revealed with violence. Produced and produced by S.f. Brownrigg, this film has a great central idea that ends with a nice end, but it's finally a chore to accomplish because of its low budget and Tim Pope's rather slow storyline. There are just too many boring dialogues between inmates and not much going on before the last twenty minutes. The film has no real visual quality, as it takes place entirely in the Sanitarium and its terrain is actually a big bland house in the middle of nowhere. There is no gore graphics in there, some splashes of blood here and there and that's it. There is a bit of nudity, but not much. The acting is strong enough, especially Holotik and Weenick. The photography is flat and uninteresting, and I do not even remember the music. The twist ends well, but it takes a lot of time to get there. A film that had a lot of potential and was probably hampered by its budget. Okay, I guess, but I think it would have worked a lot better if the story had been turned into a half-hour episode called "Tales of the Crypt".
