Lame. Lame. Lame. Ultralame. Should I continue? There is a * scene * amusing, I repeat, in all this anti-amusing feature film: a fat father: Fares Fares's fat father spills someone with his beer gut. That's all. The rest of this shocking, mediocre pile of nothingness is made up of the usual bored-looking Swedish actors, delivering a dialogue that goes from one ear to another, a mundane story, a sloppy direction and, finally, nothing else to mention. A nepotist distribution of Fares Fares is as charismatic as a chartered accountant and his nose is comparable to that of Adrien Brody in terms of enormous ridicule. Torkel Petersson should work only with Lasse Spang Olsen. Fortunately, the rest of the cast is easily forgotten, while the gigantic and titanic nose of Fares will haunt me forever in my dreams. <br /> <br /> Josef Fares helps ruin Swedish cinema. Do not stand it and its absurdities. Jalla Jalla is to the comedies what Arnold Schwarzenegger is to the characters, Kopps would have been much more respectable if it was a Youtube video without budget, and Zozo was simply the most pretentious pseudo-touching trash ever unchecked by a Swedish director. Wake up and smell the roses: Swedish movies can be so much better than that, so stop pretending that Fares's movies are worth watching just because they're "good for being Swedish". Please.
