The goal-less teenagers who are spending summer vacations in a small Ohio town find no worthwhile way to fill up their time. Some plan to drive to Chicago; others are content to drink and intimidate their peers. In an act of arrogance fueled by alcohol, bullies mistreat a homeless man and steal a strange book. The handwritten text contains archaic spells designed to summon demonic forces. A night or two later, one of them reads a mantra and is quickly possessed. He turns into a vicious killer and begins to attack his old comrades. <br /> <br /> "Demon Summer" is an amateur production with a microscopic budget. Production values ​​are low, but filmmakers were smart enough not to be ambitious. Few special accessories or filming locations were needed. The game of actors is particularly weak and there is practically nothing original in the scenario. On the plus side, special makeup effects are surprisingly good compared to low-budget movies. Despite this, the blood is minimal. Aside from the effects of make-up, this movie has few benefits even for fierce hunting dogs. Not recommended.
