*** MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS **** <br /> <br /> I was super excited to go to Blood and Chocolate with my friends. I could not wait because the book is one of my favorites. But as soon as the film started, I could not believe how different it was. At first, I thought, "Okay, so both of her parents are dead ... maybe everything will be fine. But then came the rest of the movie. In the end, I was furious. Nothing was correct except for their names and the fact that Vivian fell in love with Aiden. At the end of the book, Gabriel was my favorite of all time ... and then the film passes and turns him into a heartless idiot ?! The film also showed young men, or werewolves, these nasty evil creatures as the book shows, simply wanting to integrate and protect their bag. They would never kill humans for pleasure. <br /> <br /> If they wanted to make a film like they did, they should have given it a different title and named the characters differently. Because then I would go look at it again and buy it, but when I think about it, I see only the bad. You could not pay me to go see him or buy it.
