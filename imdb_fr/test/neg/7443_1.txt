The violent sequel to RoboCop was directed by Irvin Kershner (Never Say Again, the Empire Strikes Back) will never be as good as the original, as she is almost devoid of humor and extremely nasty and should have received note NC-17, due to scenes involving children involved in shootings, people threatening to brutally murder very young children with real automatic weapons, and even scenes with a 12-year-old man using many blasphemies explicit, giving the drug to a lot of random people, pulling and pulling graphically and killing police and SWAT officers, open fire on police officers when a lot of small and young children are present, and a whole bunch of children uttering a loud profanation and hitting the store owner (who is a very old man) from an electronics store and stealing and destroying a lot of items there. This film gives a new meaning to the term "appallingly nasty", but the effects and action sequences are exceptionally incredible. Overall, a movie OK.
