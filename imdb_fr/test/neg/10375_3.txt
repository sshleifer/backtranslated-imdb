I just saw this at the Castro Theater in San Francisco and I struggled to stay awake during this incredibly repetitive and uninspiring little movie. It is a 75-minute film, approximately 175 minutes long, with about 20 minutes of modestly engaging content. This is not offensive, it only repeats things that have been said over and over again and in a more interesting and provocative way. With few exceptions, the interviews are constantly buzzing, establishing little emotional or contextual contact for the whole topic. It's more like a "How to" guide for something that can not be done anymore. I was alive at the time but I felt little connection or nostalgia for what was being presented.
