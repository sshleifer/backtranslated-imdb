I speak badly of G.I.J.T.Mr. especially because I think there was something missing that G.I. Joe had. Yes, there was something that G.I. Joe did not like the celebrities of Don Johnson and Burgess Meredith, but I think G.I. Joe: The movie lacked passion for the characters that the G.I. Joe TV series had. Most of the voice-over artists really sounded like they were dead and they were going to die at any moment. It's a good movie but I would not say it was the world's greatest movie I.M.H.O. :) <br /> <br /> Although violence is what GI Joe was built on I would say that the fact that Serpentor hit Duke in his chest is not the best way for the Charlie Adler character to come out . Golobulus also did not remind the cobra commander why he had been chosen to lead the cobra forces and then be transferred after failing to deliver what Cobra-La believed to be theirs. Exactly. <br /> <br /> It was not the best way. for the GI Joe series to go out but it's better than nothing. :)
