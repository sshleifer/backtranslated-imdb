Granny, directed by Boris Pavlovsky (who?), Sees eight friends experiencing a night of terror when a psychological killer dressed in an old rubber mask and a nightgown interrupts their evening. <br /> <br /> They say you can I do not judge a book to its cover, but it seems that is not the case of DVDs: I was in the mood to watch a horror movie REALLY bad, and since Granny's cover features a title killer image swinging an ax, terrible typography (they even use the Sand system font, a definitive design no-no!), And absolutely no one's featured credits which I had heard about, I thought it would be pretty ugly. <br /> <br /> It was the case! <br /> <br /> When a film arrives in less than an hour, you really must not waste too much time before taking action; Granny, however, spends the first 20 minutes or so with her unimaginable group of friends indulging in useless games and extremely banal conversation. Anyone who stays with the film long enough for the murder to begin (and I doubt that most sane people would bother him) will get several terrible death scenes featuring an amateur gore, loads of dreadful actors and a surprise ending without surprise. (If you've ever seen April Fool's Day, then you'll guess what to do before revealing it.) <br /> <br /> Granny is not inspired, it's not exciting and it's almost impossible to watch. To avoid.
