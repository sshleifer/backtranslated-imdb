I did not understand those who had rated it above 5. I think it's a horrible movie in every way. Plots, game, art, dialogue, music, whatever! A small budget does not bother me .. However, you must get a point. Wandering, wondering .. useless ... then two boys started kissing in bed. horrible, just horrible. I love independent movies, do not worry it's slow. However, this film disappointed me from all perspectives. Even the graffito, not artistic. <br /> <br /> I was wondering what kind of people would like it. I am a woman in her thirties. Is it for teenagers who have some kind of loneliness about life, or do not understand? What did I win then? Wasting time! Please go for others.
