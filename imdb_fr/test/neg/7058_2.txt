At 13 years old, I was lucky to find this movie. It was part of an endless Danish series of really tacky stuff. It's the most cherished cheese I've ever owned - but I guess I sold it, too bad. Well what to write ... Better than "Manos: the hands of fate" and worse than "Critters 4". But it's certainly an hour and a half since it was done by people who wanted to do it. The acting is not that bad compared to many other rubbish from the 80's - actually, I like the old man even though he did not look at me as an Indian. But I guess you can not have everything ... Do yourself a favor and look at this ...
