As other people have said, this is a ridiculously horrible movie (NOT a movie!). It's not bad in a funny way, just painful to try to endure. Do not waste your time. <br /> <br /> Erika Eleniak is very hot, but there is a scene where she is in a bathtub and you can see the film covering her breasts under the bubbles. In addition, she gets bigger. <br /> <br /> The fighting scenes are so crazy that they are unassailable if you know the martial arts, or even a decent choreography, and that the editing / effects are abominable. <Br /> <br /> There is no reward, it's not going anywhere, and it's scary to go there.
