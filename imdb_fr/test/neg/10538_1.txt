My Take: Steven Seagal is obviously too boring to be a main role in an action thriller, even totally boring. <br /> <br /> Remember Steven Seagal? You do not? Do not worry, there is not much to catch up with. After playing in enjoyable films that appeal to the crowd, such as UNDER SIEGE and EXECUTIVE DECISION, Seagal tackles the shoals of the abyss of the bad movie. Now he plays in low-budget B-level action vehicles, some of which are "Film of the Week" starters designed for television and have lost their way to the big screen. HALF PAST Dead is among these, shall we say, dead action movies. A strong and ugly action movie, misdirected and lazily written (and worse, badly played). It's one of those bad movies that I do not have to watch until the end to know it's bad. I did not have the courage to kill all my brains by losing my time with that. If it's that kind of bad movies you're aware of, those other movies you hate are not bad after all. <br /> <br /> The plot (and place) is completely lifted from a similar image, Michael Bay's THE ROCK, though similar may not be the word to describe it. Both films are summer movies and should not be taken seriously. But in comparison, even THE ROCK (which is not as important in the writing department as in sound and light) has better characters, a more convincing plot, better action sequences and, in together, a more entertaining atmosphere. Even though there are action scenes in HALF PAST DEAD, none are exciting. All these tasks are sometimes tedious and predictable. <br /> <br /> Although predictability appears to be a valuable asset in summer action movies, predictability has never had a more sour taste for movies that are not fun, and really fun, often it's just a pain in my head (hearing the bad rap music all through this film makes me want to aspirin every second I hear them). The acting is horribly mediocre, the plot is derivative, without any convincing or attractive character. The character of Seagal, an undercover agent sent to Alcatraz to stop a criminal brain (Morris Chestnut), a very annoying villain, should not excite us. The character of Seagal is also endowed with a sidekick (played by the rap star Ja Rule) and a group of hardcore inmates, and no chemistry takes place here. <br /> <br /> If you play in a series of other forgotten action vehicles (What were those movies?) permanently killed in Seagal's career, HALF PAST DEAD is exaggerated. And let the public be warned: you are invited to feel the pain. Tip: Avoid it at all costs. <br /> <br /> Rating: 0 out of 5
