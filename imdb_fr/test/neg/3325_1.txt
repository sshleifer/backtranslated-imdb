This film was basically set up for failure by the studio. One, Anne Rice (author of the book), proposed to write the screenplay but was refused by the studio. Two, they tried to introduce two novels in depth in a two-hour film. <br /> <br /> I maintain the only way for these two books - Vampire Lestat and Queen of the Damned - to work live. to be through a mini-series. First, Lestat's only vampire is from the 1700s to the 1980s and has a plethora of characters essential to understanding the main character, Lestat. The entire book Vampire Lestat describes the events of the second part of Queen of the Damned. Without this complete understanding, the premise of a film is destroyed. <br /> <br /> Lestat was neither cruel nor vicious for all, he did not want to follow Akasha's plans, Marius did not do Lestat, Lestat did not like Jesse or make him, Lestat could not stay unscathed from the light, Marius was not after David nor the other way around, each character was completely wrong, BASICALLY the same names different story. <br /> <br /> If they wanted to make a vampire movie, all right. Even if you wanted to be inspired by these novels, well. But do not go back to the movie theaters after the success of Rice's great novels and characters, just to destroy what his faithful readers loved. <br /> <br /> If you have not read the books, you will not be able to understand the movie really, if you have read the books, you will be insulted. That being said, I'm such a fan that I had to see the film knowing full well that it was going to be the case and that I was still. Catch 22, must see him, will hate him.
