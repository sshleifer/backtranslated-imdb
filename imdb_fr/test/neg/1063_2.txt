... said that the advertiser of the continuity of TACTICAL ASSAULT was about to be broadcast. After seeing the first two minutes, I started thinking that Rutger might want to get a new agent. After watching the next ten minutes, I started thinking that Rutger might want to retire, saving a potential audience of all his performances. <br /> <br /> Yeah, it's a really terrible movie. I was not expecting much and why should I if the name Rutget Hauer appeared in the credits, but a few seconds after the opening title credits that featured NATO fighter jets bearing USSR bombing Bosnia, I realized that I was going to be force-fed with an inedible turkey three months after Christmas. <br /> <br /> Attention to detail does not exist. NATO aircraft bearing the USSR marks then learned that Hauer's character had spent six years in an Iraqi prison, which would make the scene definitive in 1997. Which NATO bombed the Serbs in 1997! I guess the producers did not think that the public would have noticed this ridiculous inaccuracy, but I know I did it. The producers probably hoped that the public would not notice the lack of continuity, such as aerial fights with Iraqi jets that suddenly passed from Migs to F-4 Phantoms, but that was my return. Even unknown characters would take off in the F-16s, and then when they returned to the base, the jet would become a Mig built by the Soviet Union. <br /> <br /> Oh, and if you're waiting for a silly action movie, you're only half. because it's silly, but most of the plot is centered around a BASIC INSTINCT vengeance plot. I'll give a little credit to the producers (the word credit may be too strong) because after seeing parcels representing nurses hell, police officers hell, roommates from hell, we now have a pilot hunting hell, which means every occupation of the 20th century figured in a hellish type plot with perhaps TATICAL ASSUALT being the worst movie of the lot
