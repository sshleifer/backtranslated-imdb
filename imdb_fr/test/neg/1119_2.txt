The only reason to see this movie is Sung Hi Lee, the beautiful Korean model / actress who plays "Muka Laka Miki" (give me a break) in this rather rotten film. <br /> <br /> It is given a fairly substantial part in this film and seems to manage it well, even if none of the parts are really interesting or well written. Even for a National Lampoon movie, it's really stupid. Stupid humor is one thing, but stupid is another. I may have laughed once, and it was probably just because I was polite. <br /> <br /> Warning: Watching this movie can be bad for you for two reasons: 1) This is completely nil. 2) Sung Hi Lee is so beautiful that she could blow your head at first sight. <br /> <br /> Do not say that I did not warn you ...
