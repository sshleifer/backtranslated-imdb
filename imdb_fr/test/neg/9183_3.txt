This movie is stupid and very short to be a funny movie. The unfortunate "Orientals" are not happy to be in the West. so they hire a drunk wagon master (John Candy) to bring them back to the east. The visual gags were just not fun enough to wear this one. And Richard Lewis gets on your nerves very quickly; but honestly, I do not like it at all. Ed Lauter is hilarious like the mean executioner. <br /> <br /> The movie was dedicated to Candy. He died of a serious heart attack ten days before the end of the film. A stand-up and a digital improvement allowed to see the character of Candy in the final scenes. Candy was a very good comedian and gave us real slaps on his knees and laughter in his career. This movie just was not his caliber. <br /> <br /> You will also recognize in the film: William Sanderson, Gailard Sartain, Ethan Phillips, Ellen Greene and Rodney A. Grant.
