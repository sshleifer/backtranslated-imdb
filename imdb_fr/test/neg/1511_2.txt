(As a note, I would like to say that I saw this film at my annual church camp, where the whole group of young people laughed at it, I bought it when I saw it on a shelf a year later, if only for humor I come from a bad attempt to make an evangelical film.) <br /> <br /> Lay it Down does not meet the expectations of many film fans on several different plans. Most of the problems are in the impersonal game. Regardless of the beautiful cars in the film, or the truth in the sacrifice of Christ for you, as a movie tool AND witness, Lay it Down hardly holds water. <br /> <br /> Most positive opinions about the films are supported by Christians in keeping with the message. Although it is easy for a Christian to accept the points raised, the public is hardly witness to life outside of a clich√©. The fight scene between Ben and his brother is horribly doubled. And there are at least three glaring typos in the subtitles. <br /> <br /> I encourage anyone to watch the film a second time with the director's comments. This really helps you understand why the movie was written as it was. The director's views on secular society are virtually opposed to those who would satisfy the needs of the film buffe: he shows a pedantic understanding of non-Christians, as well as some points of religious conflict; most of the drafting, he admits, was hasty, but "satisfactory"; he thought that transitions and overused themes were effective; and was completely happy with the acting game. <br /> <br /> He also inserted motifs of which he was rather proud: -All (read: most) names are significant. Ben Destin = "been destined", Gus Pelman = "man of the Gospel", Nicky D = Nicodemus. -The car donuts is symbolic of the nothingness that surrounds it that is a life without Christ. -When Ben leaves on Pete's bike, he crosses his crutches to form a "cross". <br /> <br /> I do not invent any. He throws around things like this between the words "while street racers" and other players "hurts his head with rifles", and how "God controls all your baby and your death". Yes, it was not a typo. He really said that. <br /> <br /> I have (little) forgiveness reserved for this film. The "cool cars" and the "good message" do not do the right thing to make this movie good. However, the film was made from a group of non-professional individuals with a budget less than 1 / 100th of "The Fast and the Furious", and the time limit was unforgiving. In this spirit, I give it a score of 2/10, instead of 1/10 that I feel so deserve.
