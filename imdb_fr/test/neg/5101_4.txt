This is the TV show of the 1990s and not the film of 1979. It is three episodes of a total of less than 90 minutes. Before I looked, I thought it was one of the versions of the movie and I immediately noticed that there was a TV show Feel. I did not care too much about that. I just felt that the story was not there, and there was not much excitement or drama. I looked at the time elapsed frequently on my reader I also thought that some of the dialogues were, to put it politely, not good. Plus, I thought the acting game left a lot to be desired. but it's just me though, it's good, clean and healthy family fun. There is certainly nothing offensive here. The kids are probably going to enjoy it. For me, The Black Stallion is 4/10
