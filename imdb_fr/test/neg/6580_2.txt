I think Tom Hanks is a good actor. I loved reading this book to my children when they were little. I was very disappointed with the movie. A character is totally boring with a voice that gives me the impression of having nails on a blackboard. There is a totally useless stage of train / roller coaster. Some characters and scenes seem scary for the little kids for whom this movie was shot. The scenes of the North Pole with Santa and the elves could have been cute and charming. There was absolutely no heat or charm for these scenes or characters. It does not usually turn a short children's book into a feature film. This film scares me a lot.
