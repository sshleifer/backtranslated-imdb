The plot here is simple. A farmer, Lem (Farrell) goes to town to sell the wheat crop, falls in love with a waitress, Kate (Duncan) and marries her, bringing her home to a hostile father and a group of hungry reapers. There are nuances of what they knew what they wanted and smiled and the men here. The court, which takes place in two long sequences in the restaurant, consumes the first half hour and is rhythmically lethargic. Lem is so weak that he allows his father to mistreat his wife, to whom Mac (Richard Alexander), one of the reapers, offers to go with him. Duncan and Alexander are the only good things in this tedious cauldron, which lacks the insight and cinematic beauty we expect from Murnau. Farrell's character does not have a spine, so we end up looking for a "real man" (Mac) to take Kate away from it all. With the sympathy of the distorted public, the film loses its narrative progression. The conversion of the father at the end of the film is unrealistic and incredible, which makes it an artificial denouement. This movie is for star fans and director - the general public does not have to worry.
