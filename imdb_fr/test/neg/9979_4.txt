"Caligula" shares many of the attributes of the "Fellini Satyricon" of 1970, with bizarre images, monstrosities and depictions of sexual excesses, all inscribed in the "glory" of ancient Rome. But Fellini is not ... First of all, it's not so entertaining. Too much time on the screen is devoted to McDowell with animal eyes and rubber face in the lead role. His performance is far too bland and campy to convince. The representations of Jay Robinson in "The Robe" (1953) and David Cain-Haughton in "Emperor Caligula" (1983) are much more convincing and credible, the latter being the most nuanced. The relief could have been provided judiciously by developing more completely the surrounding characters. As they are, they are little more than cyphers. An example is the role of Macro, played by Guido Mannari, who plays an important role on the screen, but remains largely in the background. The only positive elements to emphasize are the skilful use of some of Prokofiev's and Stravinsky's themes in the score and the inclusion of some of the despots' unpleasant yet precise actions. These two factors are, however, much less than what is necessary to alleviate the boredom that reigns.
