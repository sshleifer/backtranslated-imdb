Hollywood has had a long love affair with fake Arabian Nights tales, but few of these products have stood the test of time. The most memorable are Jon Hall's films, Maria Montez, which have long since become a camp. This one is filled with doubled songs, anachronistic slang and slapstick. It is a really abundant harvest of Mesopotamian corn and today almost intolerable. He was nominated for his imaginative special effects that are almost imperceptible nowadays and consist mainly of an artificial photography. The only outstanding positive feature that survives is its beautiful color and clarity. Sad to say, among the many films made in this genre, few are joining Alexander Korda's first "Baghdad Thief". Almost all other Arabian Nights movies are superior to this one. He is a loser.
