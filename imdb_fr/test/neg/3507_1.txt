I agree with what so many others have said about the superficial and offensive nature of this film's examination of racism. It is puzzling to me that so many people seem to have been deceived by his claims. I want to comment on the character of Matt Dillon as an example of what is most annoying in this film. We have here a man who - contrary to the message underlying the film, "we are all a little racist" - actually rapes a woman in public, cruelly humiliating her husband and deliberately encouraging him to act, knows, will lead to his arrest or even to death. He does all of this after the couple is overthrown without any legal cause but because, as we understand it, they are black and rich and he is a wounded boy who is now the police and can do what he wants . This behavior is not a bit racist. This behavior is diabolical. It is disturbing to me that this extreme racism is opposed to the behavior of another character - giving him paranoid stereotypes about gang violence - to illustrate that everyone is a SMALL racist. Later, we are fed tripe spoon on Dillon's poor old father and on the way the blacks drove him into the poor house. Is this supposed to explain, or worse, excuse this behavior? And is Dillon's character supposed to redeem himself by committing the absolutely uninspired and unbelievably ridiculous act of saving the woman he sexually assaulted the night before? Please. The fact that so many people seem to feel some kind of admiration for this film makes me sad about the depth of our understanding of racism and our apparent lack of commitment to condemn and stop it.
