Wow, um, it was a very different type of movie. It's called a comedy ... but it was not really funny to laugh. It was crazy. If you are willing to accept that 3 people survive a global calamity, why not 4? or 5? ..... and why did it suddenly end without anything happening ??? They could have improved things a lot by simply integrating another element into the plot, for example a female for the ugly dude or something ....... zinc, ridiculous ... ahh <br /> < i dunno..watch it ... it was not so bad ..... kind of funny sometimes ... i guess ... <br /> <br /> schneider
