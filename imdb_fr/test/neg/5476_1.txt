This filmmaker wanted to make a movie without having a story to tell - and did it. Really horrible mix of unlikely / unexplained coincidences and an unidentifiable plot, all without character or clear motivation. <br /> <br /> We get snapshots instead of characters. One of them is the very handsome and small crime leader, who projects an exaggerated "tough guy" character and casts an intimidating cartoon shadow over the hard guys who have been working for her. No wonder in the movie except for one shot where the boys hit the road and one of them carries a tiny suitcase (the smallest of a full set of American Tourister) in a blue bright sky, without explanation or excuses. Otherwise, it's visually standard - another exception is a convincing shot of a beautiful CT bridge.
