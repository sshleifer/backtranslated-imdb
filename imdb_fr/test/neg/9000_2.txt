Problems: 1) Although portrayed as "a loving tribute to Poverty Row," most old movies are not even Poverty Row movies - most of them are from the movie "The Most Dangerous Game" of RKO (1932), with the silent version (!?) Of "The Lost World" (1926)! <br /> <br /> 2) Much of the old sequence is simply used as a charge (the old sequence on board the ship) or as silent shots (eg, Bela walking, looking or looking) is often repeated; <br /> <br /> 3) Where is the pantheon of the Pounds Row (Bela, Boris, Lon Chaney, Jr., George Zucco, John Carradine, Buster Crabbe, Tom Neal, etc.) theaters of Poverty Row? the "new" character jokes (like in Woody Allen's "What's up, Lily?" or Steve Martin's "Dead Men Do not Wear Tiles")? Even Mike Nelson's faint comment on colorized "Reefer Madness" is funnier than that. <br /> <br /> Highlight: The long but extremely rewarding lecture by Gregory Mank, which inspires you to give back respect and admiration to Bela, John Carradine and George Zucco. This is worth the price of the DVD alone!
