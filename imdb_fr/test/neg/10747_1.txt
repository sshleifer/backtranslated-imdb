The last sentence of this review is a major spoiler. <br /> <br /> I appreciated the work of Joe Dante since Piranha. He has done a lot of different genre parodies, both funny and honest. <br /> <br /> But it's pure shit. It's the kind of satire - like Thank You for Smoking - so literal and straightforward that it does not let anything to) make you laugh and b) let the audience think. <br /> <br /> It's a shame, because the plot and the material are so rich, timely and ripe for intelligent comment. By the way, there's absolutely no reason for the main character to pull on Ann Coulter's character. end of the film. It's just ridiculous.
