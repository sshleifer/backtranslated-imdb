Movie critics of the world, I'm sorry. It is your job to advise the public of moviegoers so that they can choose wisely. But I ignored your advice and was deeply hurt. However, my decision to see "The Cat in the Hat" was not taken at random. You see, three years ago, all your critics said that we all had to avoid the "calamity" known as "How the Grinch Stole Christmas". Then some of my friends took me to see the movie, which turned out to be a colorful, fun and almost hypnotic treat. So when the critics unleashed their fury against "The Cat in the Hat", another big budget update from Seuss with a big star in the lead role, I thought it must be the same old song. As I was wrong. <br /> <br /> For five minutes, I thought everything was fine. The opening credits are intelligent, the children are charming and the production values ​​are excellent. Then the cat showed up. There are a lot of problems from that point on, but the most important has been Mike Myers' bad broadcast. Where "The Grinch" was saved by Jim Carrey's inspired cast, "The Cat" was destroyed by Myers. It can be very funny when his energies are applied to their proper place, comic skits. Every movie he did that was really funny was really just a comedy skit from "Wayne's World" to "Austin Powers". So he's trying to do the same thing here, it's just that these comic skits look more like stuff they stick to at the end of SNL, not funny, but painful. It's not that the writers helped him. After the charming prologue, the film turns into an hour of repulsive body mood gags, poorly synchronized encryption and insulting attempts at hip humor. This film was the most discouraging film experience of my life. Period. So much talent and work went into something so vile. I know that the adult stars of this film will be relatively spared by this mess. I only hope that the wonderful Spencer Breslin and Dakota Fanning will have more chances to show their charms in much better films. If you are a parent, avoid this as the plague. With movies like "Elf" and "Brother Bear" currently in theaters, you have better choices.
