After avoiding seeing the movie at the movies, but buying the DVD for my wife for Christmas, I had to watch it. I did not expect much, which usually means that I get more than I expected. But 'Mamma Mia' - total, absolute **. I like ABBA, I like songs, I have old records. But this movie is just terrible. The show looks like a kind of musical, but this race is punctuated by songs that follow in a hurry, no characterization, the dance numbers (which have been heavily choreographed according to the extras of the DVD) are simply thrown with only half of the bodies. still on screen, the choir of North European dancers appears at will on a small Greek island, while the composition and composition of the numbers would have disgraced the musicals of Cliff Richard in the 60s! Meryl (see me, I play) Streep can not even make his usual aggression effective in an overflowing musical! His centerpiece - "The winner takes everything" - is Meryl at the Met! Note to the director - it should have been shot in peace, the camera slowly showing the distance between Streep and Brosnan! Some songs are awful karaoke during amateur parties. The camera can not stop moving like a bad MTV. You can never settle down and just enjoy the music, the excitement and the characters. But what is even worse is how this piece of sloppy excess has become the most profitable film in the UK and the best-selling DVD. Blair, Campbell and New Labor have really reduced the UK to zombies - critical faculties anyone ???
