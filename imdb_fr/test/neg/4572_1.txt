I would not call myself a big fan of the inventive silly kind, so I may not be the best audience for this show. Even though, being critical, I have a sense of what I like and do not personally like, this being the latest. <br /> <br /> The lack of humor is a major drawback in comedy, things can be catchy, cool and perky for about 4 minutes and after that, you start to get bored unless it's the badger animation of a few years ago (?). boring to be subjected to. Unfortunately, its market is very large and its potential significant. <br /> <br /> A waste of time.
