Do not be fooled by the plot as described on the cover (at least the Swedish version). The story about it seems rather interesting, with hints speculative. Nothing can be further from the truth. It's the saddest cinematic experience I've ever had ... it's clear, right, AWFUL and should not be sold or rented to anyone. If you still think the plot seems intriguing, think about it: phones can move, run and kill people, like any other electrical device. He can throw you objects, haunt you and chase you. PLEASE DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM, it's a shame for the kind of horror ...
