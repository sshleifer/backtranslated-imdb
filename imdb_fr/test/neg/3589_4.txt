I know, it's a movie. But when it comes to portraying real life (in any matter), it should be as faithful as possible. I'm sorry, but "El Misterio Galíndez" is not as accurate as it sounds. Nor is the Dominican Republic represented as it is. In fact, it shocked me to see that the location of Santo Domingo was actually Cuba. And what is quite incredible, films on Cuban themes (Havana, The Lost City, Bitter Sugar, The Godfather II) were shot in Santo Domingo! So what happened here? Why did they shoot the film in Cuba instead of the D.R. The Spanish dialogues with the Cuban accent are horrible! They are not Dominicans! Historically, Galíndez was never hanged. He could just as easily be shot, beheaded or die of the inhuman torture he had suffered. Then threw his body into the Caribbean Sea. But Trujillo would never have ordered death by strangulation. His sick mind would not have allowed it. <br /> <br /> The acting does not go as planned. Harvey Keitel appears to be expecting a salary. I prefer the main actress of "Deep Blue Sea". The rest of the cast would have been excellent in some Cuban films, as well as for the selected location. <br /> <br /> I suggest "La fiesta del chivo" (best-selling author Mario Vargas Llosa, directed by his cousin Luis Llosa.It is a little more realistic with the Dominican history.The character of Trujillo is very well described and the Galindez incident is treated very briefly in this film.
