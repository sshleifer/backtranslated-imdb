I had the odd chance to see this on Mystery Science Theater 3000, four years ago. I must admit that it was not as badly done as some other sci-fi / horror movies of the time. The plot concerned an astronaut who came back to earth with an extraterrestrial embryo inside him. Now the plot is quite strange, well, if you can even call it a plot. (See a space program unfold in a building and an old truck is deadly funny!) I admit it was horrible by today's standards (and 20 years ago) ... but I see myself 43 years ago watching and being charmed by this film. It's not even close to the meanness of the invasion of Neptune Men, Manos: Destiny or Future War. <br /> <br />
