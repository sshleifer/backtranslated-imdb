For several reasons, this film is simply awful. Other posters have listed some of the historical errors of this film. Well, I have a secular knowledge of Roman history and even I found the flagrant inaccuracies. I usually forgive mistakes in historical films because I understand that the goal is to entertain and not to educate. And to reduce a long saga to two hours requires a license, let's say history. But this film goes well beyond the simple rounding. <br /> <br /> There is worse. To tell a story from a distant time, the film uses flashbacks that make the story even more confusing. Unless viewers have prior knowledge of the period, they will be quickly lost. In addition, the film was obviously shot simultaneously in Italian and English, various actors are then dubbed. Sometimes the actors feel like they are playing in completely different movies, which were then edited together. In fact, it is not far from the truth. The actors were obviously stuck on an ancient Rome generated by computer. <br /> <br /> The only reason I leave this annoying mess to all stars is because I always find Peter O'Toole entertaining. But that's not a reason to praise it. If you are curious about Roman history, better films are available.
