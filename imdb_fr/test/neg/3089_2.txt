I wanted to love this movie so much ... I really liked it. But it was a terrible disappointment. <br /> <br /> I read Jennifer Egan's novel in 1996 and was captivated by the story. In fact, it remains one of my favorite books of all time. Mind you, the book was much deeper than this movie, intriguing and emotionally resonant. It made you care about the characters. It portrays a complete picture of Phoebe, unlike the very poor description of the girl in the film. <br /> <br /> Although pretty and offering some * promise * in her fledgling career, Jordana Brewster was as flat and hollow as this was the script. And Christopher Eccleston (Wolf) was a terrible choice for Wolf's role, both physically and logistically. Which couple looking clumsy. Wolf should have been a dark character and more physically attractive, as in the book. In addition, the chemistry between the two actors was painfully forced. <br /> <br /> Cameron Diaz, however, deserves praise for his performance. She took an incredibly mediocre screenplay and gave her character life, a real spirit. She is simply beautiful and her careful manner makes her very believable as a hippie. It's a pity that his talent was wasted in this forgotten film. <br /> <br /> In the book to film category, it's a terrible translation, almost as bad as Kevin Costner's Message in a Bottle. But do not get me started on this adventure ... <br /> <br /> I'm not usually that severe in my reviews, but I was so disappointed here because I really wanted to make history and I wanted it to see told. right. He did not deliver ... <br /> <br />
