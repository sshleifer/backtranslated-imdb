After watching this film, I could not help but notice the parallels between this film and another film called America 3000. Both were very bad in the mid-80s, after the post-apocalypse celluloid disaster. Of course, both films have fake sets, wooden actors and stupid monsters. The only difference between the two is that the main ugly here (played by Angelika Jager) has a very thick accent. Avoid this one unless you look at the MST3K version. Joel and the bots have barely saved this turkey.
