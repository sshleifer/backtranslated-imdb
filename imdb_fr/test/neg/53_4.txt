I do not understand! The teenager at the head of "Horror Star" is supposed to be a horror enthusiast. Yet when his favorite idol (Conrad Radzoff) dies, they dig up his dead body and do all kinds of disrespectful maneuvers, like disco-dancing in the house. and throw the leftover food at it. It does not look like something that horror fans would do, so now? I am a big fan of horror and I love immensely missing icons like Vincent Price, Peter Cushing and Boris Karloff, but it would never come to mind to ridicule their memory. No wonder Conrad is coming back from the dead ?? certainly, after a session ?? to erase everything from the surface of the earth! Mr. Radzoff was not already known for his kindness in life, since he occasionally kills administrators who disagree with his visions and, even after his death, he suffers from a huge ego. Even inside his grave, there are video messages to scare potential visitors, and the group of teenagers will be keen to experience the fact that he also loves murder outside of his movie sets. "Horror Star" (like "Frightmare" and "Body Snatchers") is a pretty lame horror movie of the 80s, but there are a handful of strong and gory moments to savor. The film suffers mainly from its own stupid plot, since nobody ?? not even a film student? is stupid enough to steal a recently buried corpse and think that he will do well, and there are too many tedious moments to struggle with. Conrad's videoconferences from beyond the grave are too talkative and definitely undermine the tension, but his methods of murder are pleasantly inventive. One teenager loves to be cremated alive and another (Jeffrey Combs in one of his leading roles!) Loses his head in a delicious decapitation sequence. In the most messy sequence, a poor girl's head is crushed by a coffin. Writer / director Norman Thaddeus Vane wanted to pay homage to vintage horror cinema and it was obvious that the film had to be made sinister. The locations and scenery are excellent, but Vane lacked the necessary funds to ensure his film continuity and editing work appropriate. The acting performances are generally correct, with Ferdy Mayne (imitating Christopher Lee) and Jeffrey Combs offering the most memorable roles. "Horror Star" can hardly be called a must-see movie, or even a good movie, but it's worth it if you're a fan of B-horror made with enthusiasm.
