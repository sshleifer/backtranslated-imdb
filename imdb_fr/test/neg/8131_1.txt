Without wanting to, I entered this "trap" movie. <br /> <br /> If I could go back in time or get a refund, I would be happy. <br /> <br /> It was 7:30 pm and Cinderella Man did not start until 10 pm, so I rushed to the cinema to see the movie that started at 7:20 pm ... and I dare say that God reached out (or retracted it) and allowed me to punish myself for my film. gluttony by attending this movie. <br /> <br /> It can be unfair to criticize a film that does not target my cohort of heterosexual men, however, there is no excuse for ugly editing and sound. This film was at most worthy of a high school project budget ... and I think I saw better in these French shorts that we used to do with Louis Laloupe. <br /> <br /> Maybe that's because I'm Canadian and this movie was for LA's fudge-packing team and their friendly ladies. Woe to me when I realized that a whole public was saving me from all the jokes and all the conversations. I understood perfectly the mood suggested ... but I just could not understand. <br /> <br /> This show does not show me, supposedly, how gay men frequent and build relationships. However, even if it was the subject of the film, I feel that the "gays" were too focused on ... humanity seemed to be lacking ... but again, it was perhaps the goal ... just avant-garde ... and to make a sensation. <br /> <br /> I guess with a reduced budget and poor equipment, you have to make your film as "strong" as possible to attract crowds and bring in money. I really wish I could just read my Sheldon Van Auken instead. Hehe ... I was totally the bad public.
