Oh, man, I hated this movie. While the location of the sites was great, it's pretty much the only positive thing I can say about it. Now, I will say from the beginning that I am VERY critical about how weapons, especially firearms, are described and manipulated in movies. As a war movie, the performance was good, but the manipulation of poor quality weapons in the film would NEVER have been tolerated by a real SEAL team. The game was more wood than my first sailboat, the transported material (or lack thereof) was laughable, and the dialogue was missing, say, all that was interesting. Well, except for the journalist, who was actually prescient. Watching this movie was comparable to watching "Palmetto" with Woody Harrelson, where each scene was so bad that you could not turn it off, because you had to see if it could get worse with the next scene. Like Palmetto, they certainly did. The scene in the water where, after shooting down the first enemy, they BLOW DAMN'S BOAT, thus facing a possible drowning, made me laugh so much, that for a millisecond, I almost thought that it was worth the wait for movie for. Then, Charlie Sheen decided to drag the surviving enemy into the depths of the ocean (the way it was filmed, with the many cuts in the camera, it would appear that they fell to an altitude of about 80 feet, nice continuity over there ...) the throat was so stupid that I was stunned. Once again, the whole movie was screwed up. I enjoy action movies, but not this one. NOTE: The version I watched was a TV, pan & scan version. I can not imagine that it made a difference, except to shorten everything!
