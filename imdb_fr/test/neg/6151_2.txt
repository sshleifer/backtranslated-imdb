I saw this movie when it was released at the cinema. We all looked forward to seeing Mark Hamill revive his career, but we went out wishing we had not bothered. Many people have come out after about half an hour - I wish I had too. The basic principle seems correct, but the plot was ridiculously complex and tortuous and runs out halfway through. It's completely immemorial, and it's not a movie you want to pay to see. If you're really bored and it's on TV, it will help you kill a few hours (or help you fall asleep!). 2/10
