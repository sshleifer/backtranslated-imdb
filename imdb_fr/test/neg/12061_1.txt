I must first mention that, as a group of friends, we often find entertainment in movie films that are known for their comic value, hence our location of Camp Blood. <br /> <br /> Camp Blood was the first film we rented what was shot on what looked like a camcorder, and we were so depressed that it would not even be funny. <br /> <br /> The DVD has been returned and a refund has been requested, with the additional suggestion of some sort of quality control being put in place to prevent such waste from being stored. <br /> <br /> Do not do what I did and let curiosity defeat you, it's so bad that it's not even funny.
