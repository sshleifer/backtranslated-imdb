As a chess addict, I can not wait to see a documentary about Garry Kasparov's 1997 rematch versus IBM's Deep Blue supercomputer. I was hoping to see the game in depth and a lot of what Kasparov had to say. The boy was I was wrong and lost by a mile. This documentary looks a lot like many modern documentaries - there is a lot of flash, but no real stuff. After watching it, I'm sad to say, I felt like I was wasting my time. One of the most boring aspects of documentary is that it does not stay in one place for a suitable period of time. It has typical MTV type editing, where the camera shows different images and fast sound clips of people every five seconds. It is very unfortunate that film making has been reduced to the level of attention of a 10 year old child. <br /> <br /> I understand that it's hard to make a movie about chess, but that does not mean one should make it flashy. Game Over, however, had some interesting ideas. This has led to the idea that computers can think of themselves as human beings or not; if computers have reached a new unique level. That's what Kasparov thought after the match, but this film does not go far enough with this idea. In addition, this film tries to introduce a bizarre theory. He tries to imply to the paranoiac that a human being was moving with the help of the computer. Kasparov had suspicions about it, but still so far, there is no evidence. Towards the end of the film, the film tries to make Anangoly Karpov believe that it was perhaps the human being who secretly took the steps with the help of Deep Blue. Interesting to think, but I do not know how plausible or realistic this is. I would not recommend this movie, even for chess addicts.
