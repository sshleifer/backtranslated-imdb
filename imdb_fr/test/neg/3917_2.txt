Dennis Hopper must have been very hungry to make this movie. Terrible special effects, very mediocre writing, nerdy dialogue, bio-robots killers looking stupid. No matter how blatantly disregarding science. The embarrassing scene with the 2 young sons undress. The best part of this movie was the cyber-penis to shoot the cyborg pirate captain. 2 stars out of 10 because I'm in a generous mood.
