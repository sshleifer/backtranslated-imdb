Rather bad. This film is about an old graying prospector (and frankly stupid) and his dog 'Shep', that is to say Lassie, as well as an annoying child whose name I do not remember. At the beginning of the film, the old prospector plunged DELIBERATELY into sand so that the poor dog would have to dig it up. Why? Did he hate the dog? Anyhoo, one way or another, this idiot has managed to find gold and will tell his partner. But the man is dead and his other lousy partner is happy to help old Jonathan recover the gold. The geezer trying to leave is a dog with the son of the deceased, but even the delayed pooch does not want to stay with this kid. There is an old picturesque preacher (for a picturesque reading that smells bad), and the oily guy finishes the old man (surprise, surprise) and tries to steal all the gold. In addition, he poisons the dog and tries to kill the kid. So I guess it's good that a Lassie..err ... diabolical and crazy ... SHEP does it in the end, although it's quite disturbing in what is basically a children's movie. There are stereotypical stereotypes (at the point of racial insult) of "Native Americans" who speak without using verbs (as in the Make Camp Fire speech). And that's about the full extent of the distribution, because apparently Lassie's salary was too high for them to hire anyone else. A little dull. not very interesting and a bit too dark. It's not a good movie.
