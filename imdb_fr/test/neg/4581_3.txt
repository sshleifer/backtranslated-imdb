Living in Edinburgh and having a great thirst for history, I was very discouraged by the "libertys" taken. Bad breed of dog to start !! The owner of Bobbys, Old Jock, was a single old man who came to Edinburgh and died poor in housing, not at all like in the movie. For all those who come to Edinburgh and hope to see the movie, you will not find the cemetery at Princes St Gardens !! There were a few moments when tissues would have been great. The actors were fantastic at writing a rather fragile scenario. I do not think poor little Bobby had enough time on the screen, maybe because he was "lost" at some point. That said, the movie was fine and every 8 years will appreciate.
