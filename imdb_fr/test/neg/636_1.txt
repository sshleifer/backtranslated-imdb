The way this script was sold is well beyond my production and distributed well beyond me. The dialogue was so bad that it was disgusting. The train and helicopter scenes seemed to have been made on flash cards by high school students. Lou Diamond Phillips must have hidden under his seat when this --- this "movie"? was shown at a private screening after which he probably left by the back door. The only emotion he aroused in me was the pity for the cast, they had to "bite the bullet" to get through this one. I could not bear watching everything, it was so predictable that it was funny. Who knows, one of the networks might understand him as a comedy of the situation.
