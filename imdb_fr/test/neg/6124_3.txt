The dominant conflict is between two excellent actors (Huppert and Dutronc) to the horrible scenario. Obviously, the actors lost their heads, since the director / screenwriter Claude Chabrol finally forced the couple to follow the letter to this morbid sickly. Fortunately, the powerful performances of Huppert and Dutronc greatly improve the overall quality of the film, which miraculously gains depth and humor. As for Chabrol's persistence in keeping the film bland and illogical, he reaches his climax in the final scene, which is so incredibly poor that you'll wonder what pills he's taking himself by realizing it.
