After seeing this show several times; As a woman, I am deeply offended by the fact that there are so many stupid women who fall in love with this bullshit. I'm a bit more mature than some of the "players" on this show, but I'm still dismayed that the whole game of dating is like a game show: Crazy guys can score points in their attempts of assailleuses. If young people look at this and use it as a textbook: no !!! Spare your efforts and hire a prostitute if all you want is a piece of ass. Maybe there are girls who share the same state of mind, but others in my opinion do not think so.
