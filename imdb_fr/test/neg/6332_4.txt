I must say that I am a big fan of these "last house of the left" scams, even the ones that most people seem to hate are often held in high esteem by me; But one of those movies I did not really like was Aldo Lado's "Night Train Murders", and unfortunately, it seems that the trains and The Last House on the Left are not mixing, because Terror Express is another tear dull of. Something this kind of movie really needs is a villainous villain; and while Terror Express offers three potential candidates, none of them becomes this villain, leaving the gap in the most important area. It actually starts well as three young men in a passenger train start to slightly irritate the guests on board. This suggests to the public that there is more in store, but unfortunately, once the scene is ready, it is never really. From there, the trio ends up "taking the train" and using its new power to terrorize guests and rape women. <br /> <br /> It must be said that there are a lot of rumors in this film. the film, which will appeal to many viewers; but there is almost no blood. The director Ferdinando Baldi seemed to think that he could refrain from replacing the blood with sex scenes, and he may have escaped; if he could film a brutal sex scene. The idea that these men took the strength train flew away once she went to sex, because the people you would expect to be powerful and energetic seem to want to show their women a good time, and Nevertheless. A very tamed "sandwich" sequence, no sex is particularly interesting. As much of the film is taken up by these sex scenes, it becomes a huge problem. Movies like this often lack style, suspense and credibility; but you know that you are watching one that bothers you. As you can imagine, none of the actors do anything; and the three centrals in particular are distinguished by waste. Management lacks style and there is very little tension or suspense; which makes it difficult to worry about what will happen. All in all, this is a pretty shabby example of an exploitation movie, and I can not recommend it.
