The Other is a so-called "horror" film made in the 1970s. It should not be confused with the same title entitled THE OTHERS, starring Nicole Kidman. <br /> <br /> The plot is this: a woman with strange supernatural powers teaches her twin grandson what is called "the game". One of these twins - Niles - is supposed to be "good". The other - Holland - is supposed to be evil. <br /> <br /> The idea seems quite interesting as abstract concept and the film was adapted from a novel. I only hope the novel was interesting because the movie was incredibly boring from start to finish. <br /> <br /> The execution of this film is very much like a TV movie of the kind that the people of the United Kingdom could see on Channel 5. In fact, this film was designed to be the next film. noon during the day for this TV channel. A light cut in one or two scenes and it would be a U-rated film of the kind produced by Disney. But even the youngest children are more likely to be bored than to be afraid of the OTHER. <br /> <br /> No need to check the director's CV to understand that horror is not his forte. <br /> Mr. Mulligan relies heavily on the characters to lead the story. This is obvious from the start. I have not seen any of his films yet, but KILLING A MOCKINGBIRD is a hit crime movie on this site. Unfortunately, in THE OTHER, the characters do not have enough to do and the complicated script prevents the movie from really taking off as one might expect. <br /> <br /> The direction is as bland as possible. Almost all scenes take place during the day! Think about this - a scene shot in the open nature of rural America during the day with the camera focusing on a vast area. Does it sound scary or atmospheric? Believe me, it's not. It's more like an episode of LITTLE HOUSE ON THE PRAIRIE than a horror movie. And yes, the aforementioned TV series and the OTHER were shot in California. <br /> <br /> The obvious absence of danger or malice makes the whole exercise quite useless. <br /> <br /> The end was clearly supposed to be very disturbing and perhaps influenced by another film of this period. I will not reveal which film but I will give two clues: a young boy was a main character and the film is well known. And I will add that the concept has been used much more effectively in this last movie. <br /> <br /> The acting game is actually quite good and is the only reason I awarded 2 stars. The actors who play the twins, as well as the actress who plays the grandmother, all try with the wrong equipment given to them. <br /> <br /> Diana Muldaur is completely lost in a thankless role as the mother of the twins. Do not be fooled by its high rating on the list of actors. She spends a very short time on the screen and her presence is a ploy to take advantage of her long career on television to attract viewers. <br /> <br /> I paid particular attention to the presentation text of the back cover of the DVD cover (from the Region 2 version in the UK). Comparisons were made with THE EXORCIST, which, in my opinion, was a complete insult to this film. There is no comparison. THE EXORCIST had everything this film had to contain but did not contain - suspense, tension, ironic humor, extremely disturbing content, great content, good acting, superb characterization and spectator involvement. Ironically, THE EXORCIST was only made a year later, but in terms of style and execution, it seems decades are ahead of the bland drama known as "THE OTHER". The OTHER appears as a work that would have seemed tamed in the 1950s, not to mention the 1970s! <br /> <br /> The 1970s were a great era for horror movies with classics such as THE EXORCIST, THE OMEN, THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE, THE LEGEND OF HELL HOUSE, SALEM'S LOT, for to name a few in the course of production. It is for this reason that the OTHER is even more disappointing. <br /> <br /> If someone finds the summary of the OTHER interesting, they may want to read the book or do a little more research on its contents. I would advise everyone to skip the movie.
