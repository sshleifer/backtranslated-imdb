Now, I like the bad old skifee movies as much as most people. And I understand that a budget is a budget. That said, the planet of dinosaurs is as bad as a bad movie can have. The thing has no actors, and only an attractive woman that they kill two minutes after swimming on the ground. There is literally no quality that buys in this pile of lost celluloid. The only thing that was not wasted was the paper ... the script should not exceed four pages. It is certain that no one has really written such a useless dialogue. I am constantly amazed that such films have never been made, let alone gone out. I am only happy not to have paid to see this waste of time. It's 75 minutes of my life that I will never come back.
