Anyone who likened it to RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK certainly knew what he was talking about. He might also have equated this with some of the adventures of the paper heroes that followed. "Kay Hoog" evokes both Lamont Cranston (The Shadow) and Clark Savage (Doc Savage). (The Shadow, the mysterious man par excellence - and the very first "Dark Knight" - was also considered a certain Kent Allard.If we take the name of Savage and add Kent, we end up with - Clark Kent: Funny, innit?) Like Indiana Jones, Hoog has nothing less than stealing the artifacts of an ancient civilization (though his flights are often more blatant and less "nicely naughty" than Jones's). Unfortunately, this two-part publication is far removed from later (all time) series in terms of overall quality. One of the first indications that something is wrong in the cinematographic narrative is a scene where horse-riding desperados literally breathe in his neck, just watch Hoog escape their clutches in a hot air balloon. The reason they do not bother to shoot the ball is just one of the many mysteries of cinema that undermine these two films. <br /> <br /> The second half of this two-part publication is even worse than the first. Admittedly, this is one of the very first serial publications and, as such, should be a little lax, but there are even limits to tolerance. (At one point, the capture of the hero is performed not on the screen, but in the narration itself! Talk about cutting corners ...) Fritz Lang happens to be one of the greatest filmmakers in have never made movies; Unfortunately for those of us who admire most of what he has done, THE SPIDERS is a bitter pill to swallow.
