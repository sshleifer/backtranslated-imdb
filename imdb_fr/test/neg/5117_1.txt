What can you say about a movie that gives "The Erotic Witch Project" the style "The English Patient"? Again, the plot and the characters are secondary, but the plot is almost an exact copy of "TEWP". <br /> <br /> Four sorority big sisters and a clumsy male guide enter a forest to search for the naked girl, and women become sexually responsible. The naked girl leaves porn devices and an explosive doll, as in "TEWP". They get lost, the crowd gets lost and the girls find their way back to their hotel. They find the end of the "Blair Witch Project", while the cameras are dropped and the guide plays hopscotch, a game in itself in the plot. <br /> <br /> At least three of the sisters here have abnormally large breasts, full of dimples and stretch marks, and some obvious surgical scars. The "natural" gal here is humiliated by the director. In a final segment of credit very little funny and excessively long, scenes where she could not get a straight line are played again and again ad nauseum. <br /> <br /> Julie Strain appears in a scared wig to play the naked girl. This scene seems to be added later, because nobody could be credited in the cast with the shoot. In the background, while the women are straying and caressing each other, you can see someone's palisade. This may be the home of director Jim Wynorski. <br /> <br /> It's just bad. Lesbian love scenes are quieter than those of "The Erotic Witch Project". Most lovers consist of four women crushing their eight collective breasts. I think they are trying to form a silicone life form that would save them If this imitation is the most sincere form of flattery, the creators of the "Blair Witch Project" should be really crazy. <br /> <br /> This is an unclassified question that is sweet. physical abuse, profanity, female nudity, sexual content and sexual references. <br /> <br />
