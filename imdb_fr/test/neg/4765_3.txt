Bob Clampett's "The Hep Cat" is a moderately average cartoon only remarkable for the fact that it was the first Looney Tune color (previously, the Looney Tunes were all in black and white while Merrie Melodies was in color ). The story of a singing cat trying to seduce a cat and a dog to catch the cat, "The Hep Cat" lacks the energy and rhythm characteristic of most Clampett shorts. To be fair, Clampett does not have many things to work with. Warren Foster's screenplay is extremely thin and if he has turned straw into gold with other cartoons, Clampett can not do it with "The Hep Cat". It is often said of Clampett that one should not confuse one's drawings with someone else's and that's usually true, but 'The Hep Cat' is an exception. There are flashes of genius Clampett, like the hunting scene in which the cat stops to ask the dog "Hey, you follow me?". When the dog confirms his presence, the cat simply says "Oh" and the hunt resumes immediately. Unfortunately, there is very little of such brilliance here. Knowing who directed it, "The Hep Cat" is a bitter disappointment. We all have days off and it was clearly one of the Clampett!
