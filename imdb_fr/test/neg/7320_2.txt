I had high hopes for this one after reading the back of the DVD: "In the spirit of American Pie and Animal House ..." After enduring this, I realized that I had just spent 2, $ 50 to rent it. This movie started slowly and slowly ... short and fleeting moments of lightness proved that it was in the spirit of American Pie if you hear "spirit" as a dead thing. not very entertaining or fun! Do not be fooled like me and expect anything to watch because this movie will depress you more than just entertain you. "Need to fill three more lines for this stupid movie that does not deserve the effort ... what a stupid piece of ignorant crud.That movie provoked, even the brief nudity was nil!
