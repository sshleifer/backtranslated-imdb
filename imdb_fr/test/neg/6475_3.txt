Chris Ricci was sleepwalking for most of the time, but quickly took on an air of boredom and disdain, just as I did when I looked at them. Without it, it would not be a cheap children's movie, but at least it adds an air of quality. There are few more striking and charismatic young actresses in the sector, if they are visually striking. <br /> <br /> There is not much wrong with that as long as you accept it for what it is - a cheap re-fabrication Disney aimed at very undemanding kids. I could watch Ricci all day, so I'm probably not aware of many shortcomings in the film, but unless you're also a fan of Ricci, a cat lover or a very young child, I doubt you'll find it's very funny.
