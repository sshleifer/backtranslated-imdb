When I saw this DVD for the first time in a bargain box for three dollars, I really could not believe my luck: a Christmas movie starring Tori Spelling, William Shatner AND Gary Coleman ??? Needless to say, I immediately seized it and considered it a profitable investment. <br /> <br /> The film itself was as bad as any movie that combined Christmas and the three aforementioned "celebrities". The dialogue was foolish, the characters were only one dimension and Carol's arc of character was totally incredible. The film itself was a boring, lifeless piece that refused to finish and made me feel like a human being when the end finally came. <br /> <br /> My advice: Do not watch this film without being obliged to it and only then under the influence of some serious holiday chicken eggs.
