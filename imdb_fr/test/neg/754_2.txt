Sometimes changes to novels when they are made into movies are not only necessary, but are a good thing. However, in the case of Northanger Abbey, it is a very, very bad thing. Not only is the story itself torn apart, but satire is almost totally absent from the film. His mixture of romance and intrigue does not even touch the scathing comment that Austen wrote in his work. It can not be amusing or satirical, but rather transform the fascination of the character for his imaginary world into a drama. <br /> <br /> It also affects romance. It's sinuous and aimless. Chemistry and interest are never established. The reasons why Tilney is attracted to Catherine are totally absent from the film, which leaves the public in pain to wonder what he sees in her. <br /> <br /> Hopefully, we will soon have a more faithful version of the situation. if Austen is a satire.
