It was the worst movie my wife and I have ever seen. The only concession is that we did not pay to see it at the cinema since we rented this on DVD at the video store. Quite simply - no intrigue to mention (I only watched it 5 minutes ago and I already forgot), boring characters misinterpreted by two-bit actors and if this was a Comedy, I'm still waiting to laugh. In fact, the only laugh we had in the movie was that we joked that we agreed it was really awful. <br /> <br /> In other words, this film was quite pathetic and I invite others not to waste their efforts. time. A parody of the name of Lampoon National, Rating 0/10.
