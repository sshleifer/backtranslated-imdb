I never really started watching the show until it was canceled and started showing rebroadcasts. In fact, I enjoyed it for the first to third season. Once I saw the fourth and fifth, I began to get angry. The first problem was that they had made this irrelevant scenario, a story scenario that was repeated (having a child like his parents). The second was to be where everyone was paired with someone (eg Katie and Franklin). The third was when they made Jr even more silly than before, which was getting boring and frustrating to the point that I wanted to enter the T.V. and beat him until he was unconscious. The fourth was to be that zealous dork that Clarie claimed to be his boyfriend. The fifth was to be Katie, she was starting to be too good for herself and was treated like her "boyfriend" Franklin as the spearhead he was. Last but not least was Noah Gray-Cabey !! Franklin, Franklin was just scary. It was like watching a terrible combination of Urkle and TJ Henderson, but even more annoying !!! They seriously jumped the shark when he came to the show. There was little or no realism in his character and his way of laughing was a sign of obvious strength showing that Noah could not act. Eveytime, I saw this kid just made me want to slap, he's silly. However, B.F. (before Frank), this show was funny and very entertaining.
