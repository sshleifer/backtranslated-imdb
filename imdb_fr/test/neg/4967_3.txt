All the boys seem to be sexually excited by Mandy Lane. All the girls seem to be jealous of Mandy Lane. But nothing seems to become, and this viewer wonders why? Mandy is beautiful and attracts all the boys she meets, but we never know Mandy or any of the characters in the movie. Mandy accepts the invitation of her student friends to go to an isolated ranch. Three boys and three girls are drinking and taking drugs. In the film, teenagers drink alcohol as water and take drugs to live a psychedelic trip. And, there is absolutely no sex. In the meantime, the teenagers disappear one by one. But, the others are all drunk and bred. No one, not even those who watch the film, cares or cares about it Nobody, including the public, seems to care about anything. Emmet, a classmate, is the instigator of the whole event. There is a security guard, Garth (Anson Mount), who keeps and protects the ranch. In the middle of the film, the killer is revealed, the tension is suddenly released like air coming out of a balloon. The events are quite predictable and the film disappears completely. Mandy meets her match, but you never know why - and at the end of the movie, there's still no sex. Does Mandy hypnotize boys or does she carry all boys and girls to death? This absolutely confused viewer can only conclude that Mandy wants to get rid of female and male competition - by killing manipulative girls and bad boys. <br /> <br /> Does Mandy deserve all the attention? The director (Jonathan Levine) seems to think so, but not the viewer. The talented filmmaker (Darren Genet) delivers stunning images but, in fact, he seems to be focusing on Garth, who is quite awesome. All the boys do not like Mandy, do not they? If you want to get bored enough to know how this film unfolds, my advice is to sleep half-way, until you see the curved fork of the temptress Mandy and Garth. But do not wait. Yes, you guessed it. Mandy is a virgin and there is still no sex. I rank this movie 3 out of 10, but not because of Mandy. Why? Because all the girls like Garth and all voyeuristic looks seem to be on Garth in a compromising position. Unfortunately, girls and boys, this film never seems to exceed a disappointing and incomplete sexual fantasy. Mandy goes to an isolated ranch and nothing sexual ever happens. The public is horrified on a ranch - and can not do anything, but wonders why?
