I do not mind the strange art film. But when they are immersed in an arcane symbolism and a troubled dialogue and it is obvious that they were made for the filmmaker's ego rather than for the benefit of the viewer, I am upset. I'm not a stupid person but I just did not understand what this movie was trying to say. Or do it. The film is a magnificent form of human communication. Why do some filmmakers use it to hide their images?
