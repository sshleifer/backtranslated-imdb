I only came here to look for another title at the Terror Hospital so I knew what not to get. Not only do I receive the original title, but I discover that Terror Hospital is one of seven other pseudonyms. It's a real clunker. Movies like this can usually be forgiven for a number of reasons, mainly unexpected consequences of the function on all levels of production that result in at least a mild form of entertainment, mainly entertainment. That's none of that. Instead, the viewer attends a useless redundant exhibition that is far too convenient for the situation and drawn scenes of characters moving cautiously from room to room, all of which make up half of the movie. Also, forget about trying to find out where someone is (or who he is) during darkness or at night. you probably will not care, anyway. There is also a random sequence of car chases that seems pretty dull compared to some movies of my old driver that I hide ... uh, I mean sitting and watching since high school. In reality, we are talking about mysticism, possession and a killer on the run here - it's not a bad recipe for trashy cinema. Unfortunately, there is nothing here that can make garbage even "good"; Once associated with the foregoing, the mediocre effects and those that are not so special are just that - bad effects and that are not so special. This one is purely and simply pure. Leave it on the pawnshop stand or in this box at the yard sale. There is a reason for it to be there ...
