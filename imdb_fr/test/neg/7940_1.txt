Assault on Precinct 13 is the most stupid movie I have ever seen since Charlie's Angels 2. The shame lies in the fact that they have a good cast and a good base of work. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS ......................................... .................... I know they said that this movie was a remake of Rio Bravo, but did the screenwriters of this movie watch Rio Bravo? Besides the fact that Rio Bravo is a Western classic, the film was based on the principle that the sheriff (John Wayne) should prevent a prisoner accused of murder from being released by his brother and his gang. No one wants to free anyone in Assault on Precinct 13. They want everyone to be dead. So, my first question should be, WHY DO NOT BURN ALL THE PLACE SINCE THE BEGINNING? Why "attack" the place at all? I know that the complicated scenario was supposed to be smart and shocking, but it made no sense and / or was presented correctly. If the veteran policeman was there from the beginning, why do you need all this film? If the veteran policeman suddenly had a market in the back during the siege, how was he lucky? As soon as he appeared at the door, he would have been hit and they would have had their point of entry. It's just FUBAR. <br /> <br /> What part of any city can an all-out war take place in a police station (with helicopters and massive explosions) but no one notices? However, as soon as a fire breaks out, they must "leave before the fire department arrives" ?????? How did they plan to hide the chaos going on outside? The police are throwing bullets into the walls, sockets, footprints, the use of equipment and the fact that there will be no bodies of "bishop soldiers"? How about these snipers of the police? How could they miss so often so often? I like the fact that when the two detainees tried to run, the snipers were pushed back by two tiny mounds of snow. As if it was not possible to fire a high-powered rifle through a pile of snow. <br /> <br /> The staging was interesting although ridiculous, but the film simply sank in the cliff when they decided to kill that particular character with a bullet in the head for no reason. I know that the directors of the film were shocked, but disgusted with the public's cruelty and anger. Do not you think the box office bombardment is partly because everybody is talking about word of mouth if everybody is telling friends and family to stay away from it? This particular scene must be a big part of this word of mouth (and the fact that every plot turns is more dumb than earth). The conclusion is still stupid as the villain pauses to deliver an Austin Powers rant instead of killing the helpless people he has finally captured. I know several people have spoken about the closing scenes in the Detroit woods (> snicker <), but why did Ethan's character simply walk in the woods? He's not even looking to see if the SUV with the secretary and his friend is leaving? They just cut it by lurking slowly in the woods, pistol in hand. Gack. I could go on but will not do it. All I can say is that you want to avoid this stupidity at all costs.
