The whole exercise is useless. Why make the film at all? The lighting is terrible, but the sound is just a joke. Like a high school production. Whoever prepares the budget of this film must be selected and divided into four to authorize it to achieve without the appropriate budget for sound recorders with equipment worthy of registration. the lack of proximity of the microphone. The economy should have been made on any other field. All the production is lifeless and just LAME with such a semi-ass amateur production. It lacks warmth, clarity and has no design.
