Okay, I had high expectations for that. The controversial subject was a good concept. As a horror fan, I admit to being fascinated and very excited about it. <br /> <br /> It turns out they had a good idea, but it's terribly executed. Let's see. This movie seems to work in 3 modes: Happy, Sex and Black. The problem is that the film never decides what it wants to be. I think the "happy" parts were supposed to contrast with the "dark" parts, but that does not work. The soundtrack is one of the reasons. <br /> <br /> The film goes very badly between these 3 modes, I can not even begin to say how the realization and editing are null. There is sex in the least attractive and meaningless way. I do not complain, but even for the Horror standards, they were useless and complicated. <br /> <br /> The characters are all incomparable except for Paula (Potente). Her friend from Munich is a slut and maybe one of the most boring characters I've met recently in movies. <br /> <br /> There is a little plot that I will not go into detail ... It's not stupid and in more talented hands would make a good movie. There's even a nice twist and a cool conspiracy going on. Do not try to understand everything because there are giant holes in the plot. <br /> <br /> Everything is so bad that you do not care about the victims, the culprits, whoever it is. And think it could have been great. I can say ONE good thing about this: the film highlighted the unethical medical procedures of today. With advances in genetics and controversial science, this could have been a great philosophical film that raises and discusses these issues. But you will not find that here, but just a series of scenes stuck with people and things that do not interest you. <br /> <br /> Jump this step and go watch Flatliners instead, you're welcome. <br /> <br /> 3/10
