A forgettable pilot who never really explains why Nostradamus is really important to the plot of this film, but Rob Estes plays the role of a hunky cop who happens to be Nostradamus for some reason and who fights the journey through time . fire to start the apocalypse. Oh yes, there is also a sexy FBI agent who is a pyschic and tries to make Rob believe everything before it's too late. Too bad they can not predict a better plot. Yawning. <br /> <br />
