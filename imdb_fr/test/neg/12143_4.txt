I must pay tribute to Billy Dee for trying to achieve this. Knowing it was a film of blaxploitation, I started my DVD with a certain expectation. I knew it would be a small budget ... the mediocre interim ... but I was hoping some gems would be scattered everywhere. If there were diamonds or precious stones sprinkled in this film, they were buried successfully under tons and tons of coal ... or maybe too much. As an actor and filmmaker, I often feared when potential poignant moments were ruined by atrocious performances. Still, I must admit that I could not look away. I do not know if it looked like a car wreck from which you can not look away, or a mysterious power in the film that held me back. This film is a good example for an excellent story poorly told. If Walter Kronkite were to tell a joke to the "aristocrats", it would be a total failure, although the joke itself is hilarious. Let Dave Chappelle say it and we all laugh on the floor. This film needed a "Chapel". That said, if you have the opportunity to buy this movie for the dollar I made, do it. It is well worth the money. Maybe I'll take another dollar, buy the rights to this movie and do it again. Who knows ... it may not be better, but it's certainly not worse.
