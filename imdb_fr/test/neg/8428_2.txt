Historically horrible. Almost no specific moment in 4 hours of ridicule. You can not keep track of inconsistencies by looking. As with all track and filed films, no one cares about asking for track consultants. Events and techniques that were not even created before the next century are presented. From the shots of runners running 400 meters to the overweight actor describing the winner of the high jump and the long jump, there should be absolutely nothing to know about the track to entertain, even slightly. Probably gathered in 1984 in tribute to the games just before the Los Angeles Olympics.
