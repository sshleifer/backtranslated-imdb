I watched this film with a group of Nazis, a French archaeologist and my ex-girlfriend on a small island in the Mediterranean. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the recording, myself and my girlfriend were tied to a wooden stake at the end of this cave as a zone. I told him to close his eyes and whatever happened to not open them. The Nazis and the archaeologist did not close their eyes and started screaming after a few seconds. The faces of the Nazi melted and the archaeologist's head exploded. <br /> <br /> After a few seconds, the videocassette came out of the video recorder and returned to its box and the top closed. My girlfriend and I were not hurt. <br /> <br /> Following this experiment, the videotape was placed in a wooden crate and stored in a huge warehouse of identical wooden crates, never to be seen again.
