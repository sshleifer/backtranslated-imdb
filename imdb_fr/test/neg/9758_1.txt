Watching this movie, I felt like a plastic bag was closing slowly around my head. The game was horribly stuffy, and it was Bad Acting. The most brilliant piece of the film in the whole movie was the guy who was playing in a coffin. I only felt relief when everything was over. I was expecting this film to be a real tragedy, with a profound psychological plot following. All around, it was stupid, no beginning, no climax, no end, nothing but a fight, and the plastic bag was getting worse. Let's be realistic here. It's a horrible film.
