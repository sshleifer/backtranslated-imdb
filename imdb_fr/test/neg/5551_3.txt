I've had a lot of discussion about how to rate this movie, because it's my least favorite Herschell movie, Gordon Lewis, apart from The Gruesome Twosome, but it has the best game I've seen in a movie of Lewis. However, we all know that it does not say much. Once the film was finished, I was happy because I felt like sitting for 4 hours, even if it only lasted 82 minutes. I'm trying to see all the HGL movies and that's probably the only reason to see this one. <br /> <br /> The gore is good as usual, the only thing Herschell seemed to be right. The acting is as bad as ever, with one exception. This exception is Frank Kress. Now, can I say he's a good actor? Not at all, but it is good compared to all the others. The story is boring and flat and goes nowhere and in the end I did not care what was going on as it was ending. I know it's a cult classic, but I did not like it very much. I hope you will do it.
