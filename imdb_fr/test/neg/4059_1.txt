This is without a doubt the worst sequel I have ever seen, and I have seen a lot to draw this conclusion. The plot is simply ridiculous. I can also catch a ball and run in a field. Why can not I play Superbowl? Yes, I know this movie was for kids, but there are just some intrigues that even kids can realize are totally stupid and unrealistic. The first movie Air Bud was very good, but this one was a total crash. Disney is losing it. If I controlled who won the Razzie Awards, I would give a couple to this one. Have a good day! =)
