I have never seen the first three, but I know they are all better than that ... trash. This is a child who is organizing a party. Sensational. It seems incredible (sarcasm). Is this NOOO! It all starts with a child lying in bed and is woken up by his mother. So the kid pretends to be sick so he does not have to go to school. He goes to his uncle's house, gathers people and organizes a party. I did not laugh at all looking at this basket. I can not imagine someone sitting and writing this dialogue thinking: "Man, say! @ # # Is gunna be big, yo!" I wonder if they even had a script for this movie. I watched this knowing that it would be bad, but watching a bad movie is good for me, because it gives me something to make fun of. It just disgusted me. Two kicks!
