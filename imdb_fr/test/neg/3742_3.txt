This film had some fun elements, but most of the time, I thought I had to change DVDs and look instead for "Malibu", which I had in my own collection. At least I would know that there was something fun to come and give me something to hope for. <br /> <br /> I was disappointed by this film with a very small budget. And I do not judge a film by its budget. It just lacked originality and was too predictable. I would not rent and watch this movie anymore, and I'm usually a repeat offender. The actors were forgettable. The story was half thought and left me an insatiable desire to laugh. I ended up watching Jamie Kennedy's White Boy Gone Gangsta to scratch the itch.
