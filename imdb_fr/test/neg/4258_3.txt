Nishabd means without words. This must be the condition of the script before the start of the filming of this film and so throughout this film appeals to the content. What you will do is an unusual love story between a 60-year-old man and an 18-year-old girl, and what you get are very common, very common events that do not excite or surprise you. All that remains is the picturesque locations of Kerala, brilliantly shot by the director of photography Amit Roy, and scenes of histsics of the new identity Jiah Khan, adapted to the cameras. This does not cover the lack of a concrete script. Producer and director Ram Gopal Varma, who has such a good track record in films, has to get up. As for Mr. Bachchan, I do not want to talk about it in the context of this film. <br /> <br /> Reading again, I feel a loss of words. I remain speechless rather than mute! <br /> <br /> Personal opinion: This film can be compared to an equally bad movie, BLACK. I do not see the difference between the histrionic main characters in both movies. What did you say earlier? It was a world class cinema, blah blah and I have no taste. Well, take a walk. No, I do not speak literally but of reality to the theaters projecting this film. Because in this case, you might find in this movie a subject of Oscar level.
