An endless madness, lost, confused, confused and troubled given the very brilliant treatment of budget MGM A. Kate Hepburn embodies a wife who suspects her beautiful and wealthy husband (Robert Taylor) of being a psychotic murderer, not the boat she married. MGM's attempt to make a Hitchcockian thriller is condemned from the beginning by a turgid, confusing and ridiculous scenario, and by Hepburn's silly cast as a woman in danger fearing for his life (who could ever imagine Hepburn frightened by anything Or?) Louis B. Mayer forgot to tell Vincent Minnelli that he was doing a thriller, not a musical. Taylor is embarrassing. Only Robert Mitchum, also called a good guy, retains his dignity in a discrete and discreet performance. Karl Freund's fascinating cinematography creates images of a strange beauty - and was wasted on the wrong film. Final result: Metro "Parnell" 1940s.
