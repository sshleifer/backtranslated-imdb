Oh, but it's sad. Good actors follow one another in deplorable dialogues under an incredibly pedestrian direction to consider it acceptable. I love Robert Carlyle and Joanne Whalley is one of my favorite actresses. Tom Courtney knows how to act when pushed and David Suchet is a professional of the highest integrity but they all wallow like a fish in a barrel of aqueous gin. I swear Courtney was intoxicated, under painkillers, or both. <br /> <br /> Has the performance been satisfactory? Well, yes, David Hood, as a junior underground engineer whose companion was swept away, felt he was taking it seriously and paying tribute to it, it can not be easy when "all around lose theirs, so to speak, or their scenes came under the direction of the assistant director (if there is one). I just do not know what those people were doing in such a poor movie (other than paying bills, of course). I can not start saying how disappointed I am in them. YOU SHOULD HAVE SHAME OF YOURSELF! <br /> <br /> Any other good thing that David Hood the third ... yes The largely submerged London aerial shots were very well done and the effects of the responsible artists deserved better than seeing their work well. punctuated by such a superficial history. if you forgive the expression, because the few who see them will do so on a screen much smaller than it would be to his advantage. <br /> <br /> What's going on here? why do British filmmakers try to imitate kinds of tabloid without characters, based on shows, like the disaster movie, then do it even worse than the Americans. Realistic realism, integrity of the characters, capture a real emotion so that you can feel it and take care of it ... The Family Way, the spring wine and the port, Get Carter, The long Good Friday, Trainspotting ... . Did not you feel! I'm wrong I like a little hokum escape. The real "Italian work", the adventures of Tom Jones; but oh that should happen to that, there was a more realistic drama in Carry On Camping.
