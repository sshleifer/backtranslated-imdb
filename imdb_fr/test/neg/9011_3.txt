This film has a fairly decent premise - one always finds as much in sci-fi movies, most dramatically in "Alien" - and some decent performances "il-man" of male distribution. For me, the woman of the possessed astronaut is the weakest link in the whole. She does not seem to know what to do with her face in many of her most important scenes, which I blame director Corman. <br /> <br /> With a decent budget for accessories and special effects and a more focused and consistent screen game, "Blood Beast" could have been pretty decent. But the low cost inherent in the design of the production and the errors and gaffes of continuity undermine the procedure. For example, every time I saw the comatose astronaut lying on an "examination table" the width of an ironing board, I laughed, probably not the emotion that the crew wanted to invoke. And the monster's costume needed a serious job; The parrots covered with ferns are just not scary or convincing. <br /> <br /> However, the principle was strong enough that I cling to the end, just to see how the plot would resolve and the motives of the stranger were sufficiently ambiguous At first I could think of this as an enigma. And the scene with the photo of the assassinated scientist punched him, as well as the development of the plot where the extraterrestrial claimed to have assimilated a part of the personality of the dead. <br /> <br /> Corman. It's cheap, fast and moderately observable if you do not think too much or if you do not expect too much. What more can be said?
