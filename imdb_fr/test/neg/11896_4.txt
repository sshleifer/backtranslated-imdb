In this follow-up to The Naked Civil Servant, we see the last years of Quentin Crisp's life in New York. John Hurt is still Crisp (come on, who else could play the role?) And that's a role he lives to disappear. For me, Hurt is Crisp and I always had a hard time taking the man himself, because Hurt was more him than himself. His masterful performance. His equal is Denis O'Hare as Phillip Steele, longtime friend and confidant of Crisp. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, apart from performances, the film does not have much to recommend. To be certain that the film gets the details correctly. Filmed in and around New York, the film resembles New York and its surroundings, but is dramatically inert. He speaks with witty people, trying to cope with the world as he is (he ended up regretting misguided words about AIDS) and dealing with the infirmities that the old man inflicted on him. Quentin the man is always interesting, but his life is not really described. <br /> <br /> I am disappointed with the film. I have always admired the man and his unique point of view. I just wish it was better served by this movie about his life.
