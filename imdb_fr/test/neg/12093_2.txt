I really like Ryan Reynolds and Hope Davis and I had great hopes to watch this last night on DVD. Mostly as I try to avoid criticism until I look at myself and make a big impression. Great mistake! My 2/10 is for the first segment which, in all fairness, is actually quite correct. If they had made the film on the characters in section 1, it might have exceeded the 5/10 mark. territory stank to heaven. Ryan Reynolds marvelously captured the essence of an actor, but as a gay television writer and video game creator / devoted family man, he was significantly less effective. At the exit of the box, I was expecting a thriller flashback inspired by "Memento". Unfortunately, this movie does not live up to this movie standard.
