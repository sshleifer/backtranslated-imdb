A ridiculous comedy to which one gives an agile direction. I like one of the comments here: "Could not be done today". Well, "The Philadelphia Story" would not be possible without a car chase or two. Nevertheless, does this mean that the image is worse for wear to be outdated? I do not think that "Susan slept here" has been beneficial for all generations and that it should continue peacefully in the memory of the passionate Debbie Reynolds. There is no luster in this story about a screenwriter who attaches to a much younger girl for a "scenario search". Dick Powell appeared on the farewell screen in what was to be a nuisance for him. Reynolds is pale. Produced by a Harriet Parsons - who gives her famous mother Louella a number of inine plug. * 1/2 of ****
