Sometimes a movie can not be easily classified. One such film is "Tank Girl", a comic book, a comedy and an action movie. I'm sure somewhere there is an audience for "Tank Girl", but it's extremely small, maybe punk comics readers. Most viewers will look for a quick exit or will live with the fast forward button. The only redeeming qualities are short bursts of humor "find me a microscope and tweezers", but these tiny moments of comic relief are by far surpassed by the sophomoric action sequences. There is no character development, which is not surprising, because the source is a comic. Do yourself a favor and avoid, avoid, avoid - MERK
