I also made the mistake of thinking that I was going to see the 2003 edition of Swimming Upstream with Geoffry Rush. It was worse than a lot of student movies I saw. The script was forced, the acting was mediocre and the writing annoying. It was so slow that I managed to force myself to stay. But I always give a chance to a movie, so I suffered until the end. Apparently, there was a memo about this movie because my friend and I were the only ones in the theater. Why did not anyone send me this memo?!?! That's why I publish a message, as a warning to those who think they are spending a lot of money. I only hope that you came to this page and that you did not get trapped while watching the bad "Swimming Upstream" P.S. Sorry for the actors and the team if you are reading this. I know you worked hard to do that. I know what to do in a movie ... keep trying!
