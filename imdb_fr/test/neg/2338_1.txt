I feel that many people have liked this movie (not all, but a lot) because they do not want to admit they do not understand it. People of average intelligence, if you will, who claim to be avant-garde and trendy and who think that Lynch is a genius. <br /> <br /> For me, Lynch, it's like Tarantino. They are both great, but neither is the messiah, as many fanboys want to believe. No director can change the world, so relax. And both make sodomies sometimes, it happens. Everyone is having a bad day. And, obviously, since this film was designed as a pilot, then turned into a feature film, it was not designed with all the passion and foresight to put into a movie. Faced with this, much of the film is incomprehensible gibberish that can not be understood. We can all invent meanings, Lynch can have his own point of view, but none of that matters. There was some on the screen incoherently. Admittedly, the first part looked like a passionately intentionally complicated story, but then it failed. <br /> <br /> The cowboy, the mysterious organization of men with their phone calls, lawyers ... go ahead. I can almost imagine David Lynch screaming, forcing the crew to gather around him and explain to all of them "Look how crazy and weird I am!" Is not it great? so weird and crazy! " Bizarre and crazy works if it's a byproduct of your style. However, he is pretentious and tired of doing his best to do just that. It's like all those crazy half Pulp Fiction scraps that came out after Pulp Fiction. It's just not cool.
