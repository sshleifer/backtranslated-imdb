My bad movie guru (and the president of the Exposed Film Society) pitched it to us last week. He could not deny the glare of dementia in his eye when he took it out of his brown paper bag and announced what he was holding: "The most dangerous game", filmed with a budget of about $ 2.95. <br /> <Of course, $ 2.95 goes much further in 1962, but still ... <br /> Anyway, there are certainly a lot of things not to love in this movie. It is full of serious technical gaffes (my favorite was the "musket with repetition" which fired twice in two minutes without reloading). The hero is a werewolf who stays next to his injured friend who is fighting the henchman and gets killed. <br /> <br /> More? OK - The plot is a disaster without continuity strictly speaking. The film loses five minutes with a "special star" that physically embodies the villain's madness and paranoia, but never shows it again. The hero is stifled by the henchman, unconscious, but makes no mention of it when he wakes up and meets his host for the first time. The dumb servant is captured, put on the stand ... and then the film (and the hero, who put it in this situation), "somehow" forgets it. <br /> <br /> More? Well, the sets are cheap and the special effects are cheaper (makeup is an exception to that). Much of the plot is carried by the narrator's monotonous droning voice, which has a less dramatic impact than the Denny's menu recital. Most of the dialogues are simply ridiculous and stacked, as if they were translated from Japanese. ("I demand that our conversation be nice !!!") And the color values ​​tended to go violently from one shot to another, as if the stock of cheap movies and the problematic lighting fixtures were on today's agenda. (Note - this may be due to a bad impression, rather than to the film crew). <br /> <br /> But there were some good times here and there. The effects of makeup were surprisingly good unlike the rest of the film, the actors were sought after, especially the dumb servant and the countess. And despite everything, there was really a scary atmosphere to find, very nasty and disturbing. <br /> <br /> So what was the problem with this movie? I thought about it a bit and realized that director / writer Pat Boyette had been essentially trying to put a story from the old horror comic "EC" to the movies. This would explain the scalded dialogue, the development of the sketchy character (in a comic, physiognomy = even more than in the film), the inner logic loop of the story ("EC" horror stories have gone to great lengths to include a nasty "shock" ending without great psychological realism), over-reliance on the narrative voice (which must appear in the legends of the panels), and the interesting makeup effects that mimic the macabre images that the old artists of the EC did so well. <In fact, I would be willing to bet that when Boyette saw his main character during the casting, he immediately saw that his interlocutor was as close to being the equivalent of the skinny and quivering silhouettes and that his face was collapsed that artists like Johnny Craig and Jack Davis drew as a real human being could and still exists in the real world. He used costumes and lighting to emphasize the visual aspect of visuals and turned everyone into living comic book characters. (See: The virgin beauty of the main lady, the count's lean features, her strangely tanned skin and her sharp chin, platinum 'do on the big black bony hand man, etc.) <br /> <br /> This would explain the movie chess. Boyette knew how to "frame" things, but he did not know how to handle three dimensions and moving bodies. Boyette knew how to tell a scary story within the bounds of a comic book page, but the nuances of the film and live actors escaped her. Of course, he would not be the first to have this problem - look at what Joel Schumacher did to "Batman". But he did not have a big budget to hide. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I imagine Boyette got away from the sinking of the train and probably spent less time thinking about the "Harrow Dungeon" than the people who post on the forums of this film. He has done, in certainly vague limits, what he intended to do, and you must respect him for that ... even if you do not like "Harrow".
