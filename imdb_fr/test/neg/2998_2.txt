First the easy part: this film is pretentious crapola! <br /> <br /> It reminds me of "Magnolia". And then I thought "Wow-- someone made an even more silly and irritating film than" Magnolia ". <br /> <br /> I do not know anything about the Polish brothers, but this movie seems to have been made by someone who has learned The elements of the banal intrigue and the symbolism of the sledgehammer are pretty bad, but the dialogue is just pathetic. <br /> <br /> The detailed comments would be just a list of failures who are supposed to be funny or satirical are not, the "elegant" parts are beautiful pictures of coffee tables with mediocre music, the "emotional" parts are simplistic. <br /> <br /> The worst, c is that the movie does not show any love for the characters, other than a little dignity as a priest at Cornball. <br /> <br /> I still can not believe the respect some people have given to this image.
