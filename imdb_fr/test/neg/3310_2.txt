Good music, but these people are not PATHÃ‰TIQUES?!? A true period piece from The Trippy Sixties, and it left me feeling depressed. The director paints the bad side of Jetset's life, which stings like a nest of hornets. If the culture of the time brought people to do these things, it seems to me that everything was a journey without discovery, only despair. I tried, really tried to like this movie, but these people are nowhere on my page. Yes, it would be nice to see the world, to leave for a while, but I always plan to come back. Drugs are not the cause of the falls of these characters, it is their bad attitudes ?? These guys are passionately drinking their cup of poison. They have devalued their lives and, in the end, depreciate the journey of life. Has romance ever been so dark? <br /> <br /> To yours: interesting landscapes. Beautiful soundtrack of Pink Floyd. <br /> <br /> Warnings: dated. Drug addicts. Depressing. Totally incompatible characters; they are not children of flowers. <br /> <br /> Reserved for the curious, because most packages cancel the Pink Floyd connection. (Floyd's rare songs have never been heard before, because FM is not what it used to be.) <br /> <br /> Rating: Two Stars.
