Some of the first talkies survived to become classics. "The Squall" from 1929 is a classic, but not as expected. Melodramatic in history and acting, it seems ridiculous today, especially the casting of Myrna Loy in the role of Nubi, a seductive gypsy. Imagine Nora Charles breaking a young couple and driving a young man to fly. Scandalous! However, as many people know, when Loy first came to Hollywood, she played a number of these exotic seductive roles. <br /> <br /> According to a play, "The Squall" refers to the aforementioned Gypsy who, in the film is now in Hungary (Spain in the play), fleeing his cruel master and inviting himself with the Lajos family (Richard Tucker and Alice Joyce), essentially by showing up at the door. One by one, Nubi seduces the men of the family and the farm by speaking his English pidgin ("Nubi not bad! Nubi does not do anything wrong!") And dropping hints about beautiful gifts. The son of the family, Paul (Carroll Nye) is engaged to the beautiful Irma (Loretta Young) and can not wait to marry him. He loses interest when he meets Nubi. <br /> <br /> With the exception of the delightful Alice Joyce, Zasu Pitts as a woman living in the household and the beautiful beauty of Loretta Young, the acting is always horrible. Loy is stuck with the characteristics of his character: bad English, moans and hysteria. With her dark makeup, her peasant look and curly hair, she is not only beautiful but quite modern, although Richard Tucker put the back of his hand on his forehead reminds us that we are just coming out of silence. <br /> Robert Osborne on TCM commented that this film was one of his secret pleasures. Although it's deliciously bad, it's not deliciously enough to sit again. It's just bad - but it's a great example of how far you've come and how someone did not understand Myrna Loy's sense of humor, how much her wonderful career might have been limited.
