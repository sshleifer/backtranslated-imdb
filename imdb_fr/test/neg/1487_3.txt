The presentation is very poor. (in my opinion) as documentaries are often. The "documentation" of Michael Moore - Farenheit 911 is much more convincing, but has too much political and media influence. I can not wait until Saturday when I can see the documentary "The game of their lives". The IFC goes to the right of the center. I started a collection of IFC movies from the internet because of "TGOTL" *** on ********** on "Decade". Do you want to see good documentaries? Stick to the story channel. Or try docudrama. You can not go wrong with them my friend. Can not go wrong. The seventies were ten years of reruns. Or the old days made you believe. Disco is dead and gone forever. When Elvis died o yes we all cried
