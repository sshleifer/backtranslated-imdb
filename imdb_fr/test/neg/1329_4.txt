With its technical flash, the film "Stalingrad" of 1993 is very disappointing. Before I looked at her, I had read non-fiction stories about the Stalingrad campaign and a lot of documentary footage and photographs of the battle and its participants. I do not think any film can really describe the titanic struggle and the suffering that really happened, but I still wanted to know what a relatively new German film production would look like. Although there are some good elements in this film, overall it is a failure. For me, the worst aspect is that it has substantial anachronisms, as well as very artificial elements and clichés, especially in certain meetings between a German officer and a Soviet woman. <br /> <br /> There are also ideological elements in the film gives rise to very distorted perceptions, especially that it is the caricature of a German chaplain, to exaggerated messages about the war classes and problematic representations of "good" against "bad" Germans. Admittedly, the German armed forces of the Second World War included men who managed to maintain a certain decency throughout the war and others who did very bad things, but the attempts in the film to show this contrast are very simplistic and childish. I give credit to "Stalingrad" in the sense that it does not completely represent German troops in the simple demonic quality that is the stereotype that many people have now. Yet the film includes its own stereotypes, such as an almost too good infantryman to be true who has attitudes closer to the 1990s than the 1940s, and two completely perverted infantrymen and an officer in the rear rank. <br /> <br /> Some recent films such as "Stalingrad" and "Saving Private Ryan" are often praised for their "authenticity" by describing graphic scenes of fights. Yet these same films are deeply flawed and misrepresented in depicting the attitudes, values, and behaviors of soldiers and civilians of the 1940s. "Stalingrad" and "SPR" have major and minor characters that lack the unconscious stoicism that was common among ordinary people during the period of the Second World War. While all-time soldiers have been known for their frequent growling and occasional cynicism, the egocentric, talkative, and touching characters in these two films are something else and are far more prevalent in today's world than they are today. were not before. the 1940s. While many people like to denigrate those war movies of the '40s and' 50s that present more patriotic messages and are not as graphic about combat, many of these previous films such as "Battleground" are much more accurate in their descriptions of typical soldiers. attitudes, and they often succeed in showing the horrible effects of war more indirectly. <br /> <br /> A successful part of "Stalingrad" is a battle between the German infantry and the Soviet tanks, which tries to capture some of the horror and confusion that reigns in such fights . <br /> <br /> "Stalingrad" does a mediocre job, although it shows the common look of the front-line soldier. This may be due in part to the difficulty of finding thin and haggard extras in our America and the well-fed, well-fed Western Europe of today. In addition, too many German soldiers in the film do not wear their uniforms and equipment and do not display the usual professional behavior of the German Wehrmacht, even during the years of German defeat. If you want to get a good idea of ​​the real appearance of German troops, I recommend the following documentaries, which contain images of the Stalingrad campaign: "The World at War", "The War of the Century" and "The War of Russia ". The books "Operation Barbarossa in Photographs" by Paul Carell, "Stalingrad" by Geoffrey Jukes and "Stalingrad" by Paul Carell also contain a large number of useful photos. We also recommend books written about the battle by Antony Beevor and William Craig, and it is particularly interesting for soldiers and ordinary civilians on both sides. <br /> <br /> Relatively recent films that, in my opinion, are "Der Untergang" ("The Fall") is much better than "Stalingrad" and "Saving Private Ryan" to describe the attitudes and characters of people during the Second World War. The general feeling, the look, the horror and the gravity of this war are: "Talvisota" ("The war of winter"). While "A Bridge Too Far" and "The Longest Day" cover events on the Western Front rather than the East, they are also excellent wartime films and remain very close to factual narratives. The last two films lack a bit of courage that is more prevalent in more recent films, but they compensate for this lack by their other strengths, including the truth.
