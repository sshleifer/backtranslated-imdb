I had already heard about Ali G in Madonna's music video. I still think he's funny. (In fact, it really is.) Last year, I always thought about buying a VCD "Ali G Indahouse". That's why, a few months later, I bought it cheap and I started to watch it. <br /> <br /> But the movie surprised me. My older brother and I expected it to be an excellent comedy to laugh about. It turns out that "Indahouse" is just a stupid waste. It was really bad. It also contains explicit content about sexuality and a very crude humor. It did not make me laugh either, not even a big smile. We really hate this movie. Oh, by the way, I intend to sell it. <br /> <br /> Ali G was really different in his film compared to his TV shows - in such a negative way. Maybe he was not really focused and serious enough to make this movie. It's not because there are sex scenes that it's hilarious (because sometimes, too much is no longer so laughable). For the first time in my life, I was disappointed by him. It made me rather sad and happy. <br /> <br /> I gave this film a score of 1 in 10. In fact, I really want to give it a score of 0. This is one of the worst movies of my life. I would not recommend it to anyone who wants to watch good comedies that are not too explicit or horrible.
