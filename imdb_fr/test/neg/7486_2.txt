I had taken this one many times in the rental store, wondering if I should try it. Today, I broke down and ran it round and I probably should not have done it. <br /> <br /> The writer / director has devoted a respectable effort to the film, but he has been far from engaging. The characters, while you wanted to feel them, just did not have enough development or depth so you could really get involved with them. Sara's sexual explosions got tired, quickly. Sex in the movies does not bother me and the bitchy characters do not bother me, but being a "bad" girl does not mean that you are inclined to enthusiastically ask people if they want sexual favors. By the time what happened to the characters was revealed, I was bored and I was ready to move quickly to the climax, the end, all that was exciting ... and nothing delivered. The things that the characters in the story tell you in the end seem forced and unrealistic, and have simply not been well interpreted. If they had thrown a little more anxiety in there, that might have interested me. This should have been more of a suspense / drama movie, and should have fit under the title "Wife of Jon Good" rather than the entire "red right hand" and a horror-movie type cover. Hell ... it should have been suspensive, point by point. <br /> <br /> In any case ... watch it on a rainy day or late at night when there is nothing on TV. Although it's not as great as I expected, I would opt for it by advertorials.
