It's one of those movies that I watched and asked me why I watched it. What did I find so interesting about this? Being a truck driver myself, I did not find him very realistic. No, I've never used a "lizard", nor seen, nor heard of a traveler traveling across the country in a brand new $ 70,000 pleasure vehicle. <br /> <br /> Same thing about a pimp who never sampled the lady in question (until the end of the film, well, he still has not done ...) and who only earns $ 50 "per piece", when the prostitute earns $ 200.00 (well, $ 150.00 after her break, yes ...). <br /> <br /> I still laugh at Ivey's lizard comment (they're lizards, they're going to mess up with $ 20, and some are men dressed as women ... or something so strange ), which means that we are better than them, because we can always be prostitutes, but we are better paid. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, it's just the story of a young woman who wanted something more from life than a dead-end job while living at home (she's 18 years old) you remember?) and embarrassed by her mother who was doing essentially the same thing (dead end job). At least she had a roof and a job. She shot FIVE laps on the road ... I wonder if the $ 750 she won was worth it? I suppose not.
