There was a lot of hype about this movie and the commercials gave the impression that it would be great. Unfortunately, like Bring It On 2, Bring It On, the shameful glory of Bring It On. There are stereotypes shamelessly throughout the film. The lines given to the actors were humiliating for all the races involved in the film. Hayden Panattiere's performance was mediocre in both acting and cheerleading. There were several scenes in which I literally collapsed because I was embarrassed for the casting because the scene (lines, plot, etc.) was so stupid. My recommendation to the directors of all future Bring It On movies is to recruit good cheerleaders and teach them to play because the cast's "game" was horrible and their lack of cheerleader ability made them completely useless. Only good character: Kirresha.
