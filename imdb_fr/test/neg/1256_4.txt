Well, the movie was not that great, but the one who created the piece on the screen did not even manage to create the essence of the unger. This film was slightly below average and did not tell the story of one of the most interesting people ever born. I suggest reading the book "one of a Kind", the true story of Unger. They left huge parts of his life. Moreover, they sometimes did not understand the true character he was. The real facts of his life were sometimes out of order. And in the end, they did not really represent the personality he actually had. So please do not watch the movie; Read the book. By the way, I'm not just a con who thinks you have to stay 100% in the real story, but they did not even close!
