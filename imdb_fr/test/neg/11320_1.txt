I never saw a film so terrible that I went crazy. It was a huge waste of time to see this shitty movie. There are a lot of things I hate about this movie: The songs are so terrible (still a little catchy) that I hit my head against the wall (especially the song "Grandpa will continue the pants of the Santa Claus "10 times * shrugs *), character design, and that nasty, greedy and Bitchy Mel cousin. <br /> <br /> I can not stand her for a second, she must be one of the most bitchy person I've seen. Even if I like his southern voice a bit. <br /> <br /> The only positive side is that Austin Bucks is played by the person who is the voice of Metal Gear Solid's Liquid Snake. <br /> <br /> I would not recommend people to look for the holidays because it was a huge shame for x-mas.
