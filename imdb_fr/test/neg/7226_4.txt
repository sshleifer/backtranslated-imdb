Has very good music and performances; Creole child and coconuts, James White and Blacks, DNA, Tuxedo Moon, plastics, Miss Mel, Vincent Gallo, Lydia Lunch ... etc., but other than that, there is not much to do. The dialogue, especially the narrative (by Saul Williams), is actually quite good, but the performances are all rather bland or downright bad, regardless of the number of hipsters. Debbie Harry and Jean Micheal Basquit (the latter being the main role) still do not have enough cultural credibility to prevent this film from becoming a novelty. This is a nomadic spontaneity of Jack Kerouac style, but does not have the insight to continue to move forward, this is where the group's performances come into play. I liked it, but I did waited for more. Although there is an end of fairy tale.
