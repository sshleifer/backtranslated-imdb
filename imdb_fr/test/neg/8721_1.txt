The Dune mini-series opens with a "flashforward" montage of action sequences. The realization quickly shows that these are the * best * scenes over a period of 265 minutes and they are not good. Not good at all. Oh dear. <br /> <br /> But do not judge a book on its cover (even if that's exactly what we are invited to do). Give Dune a chance to redeem himself. <br /> <br /> Well, here's the expected opening on Caladan. But who is this petulant, strangely ugly? Paul Atreides? * It's * Paul Atreides? This generic plastic puppet? And why does he look so old? What is it? The actor is only 25 years old? Well, he does not look at it, and it's way too old anyway. <br /> <br /> But at least he has charisma, right? False. Alec Newman is a jester stumbling and mumbling. I imagine him being discovered sitting in the dark in a remedial class because no one liked him enough to tell him that the class was over and he was too stupid to realize it. When your Paul Atreides has everything on the screen, your range of Dune is doomed from the beginning. <br /> <br /> The other actors pity the poor Alec however, and give consistently uninspired and incomprehensible performance so that it does not look bad by comparison. At least, I guess that's what they do. Because I am charitable, you see. <br /> <br /> To be fair, we clearly do not give them any direction. Random gestures, blank or incoherent deliveries, missing marks, everything is there. This is like a master class on how not to do it. And of course, there are more elements of the book in this miniseries than in the 1984 film, but there are not twice as many, because of all of them. Breaks. Fill. The weather. <br /> <br /> But we can forgive all this because of the small budget of $ 20 million, only $ 5 million per hour. No one could hope to do good science fiction with this kind of budget. <br /> <br /> Except perhaps "Stargate SG-1" which is satisfied with 1.4 million dollars per episode of 50 minutes, or "Farscape" to 2 million dollars. And frankly, I would rather watch four episodes of either of these while getting a punch in the kidneys, rather than sitting in spite of the simulacrum that is Dune the miniseries again.
