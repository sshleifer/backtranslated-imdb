and in general, you may have to look for this little gem. When I describe I Changed My Sex, or Glen Or Glenda, as I call it better, I have to echo the thoughts of Andrew Smith, who put his finger on the nail when he wrote, "If you don" you have not seen any other Ed Wood movies This one is a complete bewildering experience, if you've seen a film by Ed Wood, it's quite amazing. " The film is both hilarious and tragic, but it moves with a strange rhythm that leaves no doubt that the author knows and means every word he utters during his journey. Wood, blessed be it, had the highest ambitions as a director, with the aim of promoting peace, understanding and even acceptance in the 1950s. When Tim Burton reconquered Glen Or Glenda's viewing by Studio directors for his biographical film, he showed the controllers laughing and saying that it must have been a stunt. More than fifty years later, there are still people fighting for the kind of respect that the "normal" thinks is taken for granted, so I say that is certainly not the case. <br /> <br /> No, the real comedy in Glen Or Glenda is the sheer incompetence Wood shows to compose his message. Administrators frequently use archive clips when they can find them that are appropriate for their purposes and can be edited to match their own sequences. Ed Wood used archival footage indiscriminately, and Tim Burton's biopic celebrated it with a scene in which Wood played by Johnny Depp bets that he could make an entire film out of archive footage. Unfortunately, the real Ed Wood died before he had a chance, but Glen Or Glenda is closest to all. The IMDb indicates that twenty percent of this sixty-year-old film is an archive footage that is never difficult to guess. Images of busy roads, planes flying above the head, weak effects of lightning, soldiers acting in this way, they are used randomly, sometimes several times, and often have only a loose link with the story Wood is trying to tell. If Wood had thought about what he was trying to do for a while, he would have no idea how high he could have reached. <br /> <br /> Wood himself appears in the film as the holder. character, a confused transvestite who imagines herself as a woman named Glenda. Apart from the audacious way he tries to argue his point, Wood makes a hideous woman. Having found myself on the sidelines of a society that thinks I am "disabled" and need to "heal" myself, I honestly found myself hoping to get the best possible result for the Wood character. In order to argue his point, however, Wood weaves in the news of two other transvestites. One of them makes the extreme decision to undergo a sex change to become a woman, the other is so deprived of her rights that she fears to be arrested again to the point of suicide. The scary thing about this film is that if you remove the transvestism and substitute privileges such as my position on the autistic spectrum or things like schizophrenia, very little of this movie would even need to be amended. That's how society has learned little since Ed Wood was a boy. <br /> <br /> Glen Or Glenda's other personality is Bela Lugosi, to whom Wood participated in the film. Speculation varies according to Wood's motives, but the accepted theory is that Wood wanted to help revive Lugosi's career and do anything to achieve it. Apart from taking your time to carefully build a good movie, it is. In Glen Or Glenda, Wood uses "Lugosi", which has been described as "weird" in Flying Saucers Over Hollywood. Lugosi plays a character portrayed as the scientist, but rather presents himself as an all-powerful puppet master. People who have not seen Ed Wood's films before the biographical film will think that Tim Burton invented the "Beware of the Big Green Dragon at Your Door" speech. On the contrary, Burton wondered what strange speech to use to describe the Woodian dialogue. Nothing can prepare you to see the speeches in their original context, not even Criswell's hilarious speech at Plan 9 from space. <br /> <br /> Observers will also note the presence of Delores Fuller, Wood's girlfriend at the time. Once again, Burton dramatizes his reaction to seeing the screenplay for the first time, while the film portrays her as a receptive and avant-garde person. I can not help thinking that Burton's representation is more accurate, because Fuller seems extremely uncomfortable in his role. She only appears for about fifteen minutes, but her delivery seems so mechanical, so lifeless, that she somehow manages to seem less talented than her casting companions, if such a thing is possible. It is difficult to determine if Wood's orientation was better focused than usual, but if the ability of the stand to let the stars (with the obvious exception of Bela) in the dust is a guide, then that should not be the case. come. surprise that Fuller only appears in a very small role in another movie Wood. The fact that she has written several hit songs tells her that she made the right decision to stay behind the camera. While Wood was back in front of the camera, it was never a cameo, a march or a role. <br /> <br /> I gave Glen Or Glenda one in ten. In general, I only give this rating to movies that are so bad that they become entertaining. As bold and well-intentioned as it may be, Glen Or Glenda fits this description to a T.
