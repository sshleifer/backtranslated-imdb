After watching this movie, I decided it was so awful that I had to join IMDb and write a comment to warn other people of the pit falls that it would have been necessary to rent / buy this movie. To be fair to the movie, there is only one good section in this movie and it's the end of the credits, so you know that shit is over. I watched it all the way in the hope of enjoying the movie. Just tunnels more tunnels and an old man talking to himself (If you watch this movie too much time, you'll do it too). As for Val, if he continues to select films like this, he can just as well say goodbye to his acting career. It is useless to write about the content of the film, this has already been done. Keep your money and your mental health and stay well away.
