"The new hope of Romanian cinema" ... if it was the new hope, then I would not really like to see the savior hero of such a prolific cinema (Romanian cinema, that is to say). Now seriously, where should I start? 1. The shitty scenario: you make fun of me, it is not even credible without speaking of its high degree of stupidity 2. The direction: which direction? This film should have had a psychological tension, at least that, since they decided to make it as trashy as possible. I admit that Radu Muntean is not Polanski, Hitchcock, Fincher or Lynch (the list could go on), but at least a minimum effort would have been appreciated. 3. Language: Oky, I do not understand why (almost) all Romanian filmmakers think that if you make the film as miserable and obscene as possible, then you have art. Explicit language or poor image quality do not bother me as long as the end result is worth it. In this case, this is not the case. There is nothing to comment, since all that this film means has already been said a thousand times, the characters are far too thin to become memorable, the "shocking events" that occur are also poorly illustrated and become unimportant . This film is based only on self-induced emotions, on the hype of "we must". Someone was found murdered so "WE MUST" feel sad, scared or panicked, someone went through this and that so that "WE MUST" feel a certain way. It's hogwash. Because a movie is a fiction, nothing is real here. Thus, the only real emotions are those you discover while immersing yourself in his world (that of the film) <br /> <br /> * / * * * * *
