I'm sure some people will appreciate it and find it powerful, or have some sort of personal connection to the characters and the story, but from an unbiased point of view it's not done very well. The film revolves around anxious atypical teenagers, each playing a different stereotype, which makes us believe that it's like what it's like to be a teenager. We see a little the lifestyle of each teenager, but the project as a whole seemed pretentious, be it the plans in constant angle of branches of trees in the wind or "interviews" in black and white with the students, there was nothing new or original presented in this film, and nothing that I needed to see. Yes, it deals with strong subjects and the dramatic scenes are played and played correctly, but the project as a whole seems useless, especially when it seems almost an exact replica of Van Sant's "Elephant" (one dealing with suicide, the other of a shooting school). As I said, some people will probably appreciate that, and the director / screenwriter clearly had some kind of inspiration to make this film based on the death of a loved one, so it's good that the film was made with a little heart, but I think it's incredibly inefficient and it's material that can be easily clich√© to make something original. I would not recommend this movie.
