Should I expect anything other than Carrot Top's putrid? It was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. This is by far the worst comedy I have ever seen. "Chairman of the Board" did not add humor to my attitude, but enraged me. That's right, Carrot Top is such a bad comedian that I became furious that this man is shooting movies.
