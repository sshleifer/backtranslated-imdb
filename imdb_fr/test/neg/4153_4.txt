"The Beautiful Country" is a big disappointment. It does not meet my expectations. Bihn, a big muscular guy, is the son of an American GI and a Vietnamese during the Vietnam War. We were told that he had been treated "less than dust" in Vietnam in the early 1990s, so he fled to America to look for his American father. <br /> <br /> It looks like a broken material in the heart? Maybe, but showing in this movie. I have trouble connecting emotionally to Bihn, because the film is full of clich√©s and I do not understand it and do not believe it. The writing of this film is a total failure. The plot is full of holes. He seizes certain events on a necessary basis while striving to arouse public emotion. We are not so stupid and it does not work that way. Let's see what the movie is trying to do. So, you do not feel that Bihn's boat ride (yeah, he was on a boat!) Is hard enough, let's have a storm all night and let the ship shake a bit. Still not touched? Well! Make a little child suffer from heat, hunger, illness, violence with adults on the boat, hopefully it will do the trick to reach the public. Still not touched? Soy without heart, we'll ... OK, I do not want to give a spoiler of the film, but you have the idea. <br /> <br /> The film is really long and slow. This never tells us why Bihn did not go to get his mother and father, until he left in the movie when he went looking for his mother and his father. What did he do about twenty years before going to Saigon to get his mother? And guess what? He is lucky and everyone will tell him where to find the person he is looking for and he will find anyone without a scratch. I really think the Department of Homeland Security should engage those Vietnamese who helped Bihn. The beautiful country? Which? Vietnam and America both seem like hell for Bihn.
