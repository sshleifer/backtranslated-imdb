I wanted to see this film because I liked "Kavkazskij Plennik" ("Prisoner of the Mountains") and "Brat" ("Brother") with Sergey Bodrov Jr. and "Vor" ("The Thief") with Vladimir Mashkov. Unlike other movies, "The Quickie" was a total waste of time. The story that does not make sense, a very uneven acting (Lesley Ann Warren was particularly bad), really awful dialogues, bad cinematography, what else could go wrong? I find it amusing that in virtually every American production film, when foreigners speaking the same language (the Russians in this case) are left to their own devices, they prefer to communicate with each other in fragmented English (and when they speak Russian, for some reason, translators feel obliged to add a lot of "f ** ks" in sentences that have no blasphemy, literal or non-literal). At the same time, English native speakers choose to speak broken Russian. Why is that? To go back to history, most of the film's secondary intrigues (eg, betting at home, inviting Latin American paramilitaries, etc.) make no sense or do nothing more than confuse the viewers. It is unfortunate that Bodrov, Mashkov and Leigh (all good actors in my humble opinion) got involved in this disaster.
