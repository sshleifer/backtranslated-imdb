This puddle of derivative derivatives stole all the important Soviet films and failed miserably. I had an experience of all that was wrong with organized religion in general and the particular weaknesses of the Russian Orthodox Church (know that this comment comes from a person of faith). Even the remarkable cinematography left me without inspiration. I spent his most beautiful moments very aware of the masterpieces that he imitated badly. I would not recommend seeing this film unless you have a deep passion for the Russian Orthodox Church, its monastic traditions, its miracles against communism and its saints of the seventies. It's a meaningless film of (and over) a narrow perspective that did absolutely nothing for me.
