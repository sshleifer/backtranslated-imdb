Normally, I would not bother to comment on a series of horror movies, as they are generally assumed to be bad, and if you watch them with a healthy disrespect, they can be very fun and entertaining. However, this chapter of the current Halloween saga nearly destroyed everything the original represented. In the very first film, Dr. Loomis said (very specifically, I might add), that Michael Myers was devilish, and that tries to explain why (by doing a bad job, I could add). In my opinion, he was a lot more scary when he was just a bloodthirsty monster. This whole gothic / cult affair was useless and was a desperate attempt to create a new curve in the Halloween equation. The result was a boring and predictable movie that was neither scary nor serious enough to be funny.
