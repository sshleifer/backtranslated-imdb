Compared to ARABIAN ADVENTURE, the director of Kevin Connor, this is a masterpiece. However, that does not say much. In fact, AT THE EARTH'S CORE is a crazy fantasy adventure in which Peter Cushing - who seems to be on something strong - and another actor (whom I do not know) use a giant digging machine called "Iron Mole" to dig their way to the center of the Earth - only to discover that the interior of the Earth is pink and populated by monkey-like creatures that have enslaved humans. There is also a giant bird that controls the monkeys through telepathy, and we see it blinking in close-up throughout the movie. More importantly, Cushing and what-is-his-name also meet the beautiful Caroline Munro in the underground caves. And here's what I really have against this little movie: why oh why is Munro always in a movie? 5 minutes of screen time? In THE SPY WHO LOVED ME, MANIAC, DRACULA AD 1972, GOLDEN VOYAGE OF SINBAD - she's still in the background! How can Kevin Connor think it's better to listen to Peter Cushing's false accent and watch a ridiculous monkey-man whose voice sounds like a striped CD rather than looking at the beautiful Munro? I do not understand. Please, someone is directing a movie where this English brunette is on the screen all the time!
