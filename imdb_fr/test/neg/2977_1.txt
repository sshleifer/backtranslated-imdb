Although I have tried to avoid German films recently, positive reviews have encouraged me to rent this one. There, I get fooled again by the German media, which constantly repeat national films. For me, it is not surprising that no one abroad wants to see this shit. The idea of ​​making this movie is not at all an idea (I guess an idiot read a women's magazine article about speed dating). In short: the characters (which are none), the dialogues and the content are so surprisingly trivial, banal and clichés that I kept looking because I could hardly believe what I saw. BTW to call the theses flat mechanically delivered by the numbers (certainly from the aforementioned magazines) dialogue, would be simply incorrect. Playing is so exaggerated that I do not remember worse than the one on the screen for a long time. You have to guess that the director had / had no idea at all. Surprisingly, the country's distributors and producers are still wondering why German films (with rare exceptions) do not attract interest around the world. Why? Because it's a waste of time and money.
