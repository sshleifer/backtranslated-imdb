I like to watch B-Movies horror movies, because I find it interesting to see the stupidity and inability of the creators to make really good movies. (I always compare this film to - for example - some of Spielberg's works and again and again does not understand the huge difference between what I see.) I like Ed Wood's films because it's so inept that 'is very funny. But people !!! "The Chilling" is not funny and is not even "interesting". It's an extremely boring horror movie with nothing that makes even the bad movies look good. There is no acting, no scenario, no direction, no chills and no blood. It's an extremely inept amateur movie. It's definitely the worst movie I've ever seen (and I've seen a lot of "worst movies" - believe me). I warned you !!! 1/10
