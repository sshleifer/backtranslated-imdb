It was one of the shows I wanted to follow up on. But, I just could not focus on this show. In order for your show to be centered on the theme of politics, you really need a powerful plot, with twists to enhance the mood of the show, something like "The West Wing" or "Commander in Chief" ". Rob Lowe was fine, but actors like Kyle Chandler simply could not act (he was awful in "Early Edition"). It was painful to attend this show. With his lack of suspense, his urgency and his characters who can really play, I just had to give up this show and I'm glad it was canceled so as not to miss anything. <br /> <br /> Grade D-
