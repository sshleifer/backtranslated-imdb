I am deeply disturbed by some messages that I read on the bulletin boards of this film. Some say it's actually a good movie! The fact that this film is the best of Uwe Boll to date does not make a good movie, no question of hell! Far Cry is a cliche mess full of bad acting, bad direction and an uninspired storyline with a bad storyline. This is Boll's first pure action movie, and enlightened people, action movies are not too difficult to do, because for a basic action movie, you just need explosions and hand fights army scattered around a lean conspiracy, and good luck, Mr. Boll succeeds in doing that. House of the Dead, Alone in the Dark and Bloodrayne, all horror games adapted to Boll's films are far worse than that (they have no quality that redeems them). Far Cry boasts two things that make it the best so far: two good tracks and two well-done action sequences. Til Schweiger is good enough like Jack Carver and Emmanuelle Vaugier is a strong female head. The very good Udo Kier is passable because the bad shot and the secondary distribution are damn bad. Towards the end of the film, there is a surprisingly tense chase sequence that caused a shock as Boll was behind the camera. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the rest of the movie has an incredibly cheap feel, with a bad CGI. , lame one-liners and clichés on every street corner. Oh, and the worst leads to a sex scene that I think I've ever seen. Not only did the two know each other only for six hours, but it is enough for him to say that he is warming up in the army by spooning his comrades soldiers. He had already asked him to undress simply by telling him to do it. He then took his foot and went to bed because he feared hypothermia. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it's a bad movie. It's an insane action movie that can kill 80 minutes if you're totally bored. We could probably do worse than watch this in public, but I would personally watch a classic action movie like Die Hard or Predator and stay away from this derivative mess. <br /> <br /> 1½ / 5
