Forgetting the ugly game, this can be forgiven in this kind of movie. Or even the terrible unnatural dialogues and illogical events (if my subtitles really reflect what was said). Worse still, the blatant absence of a skilled or experienced director who may have taken a vacation with the publisher during the making of the film? Looking at the movie, you feel completely old-fashioned even if it was shot "only" 7 years ago. A computer virus as a portal to life after death? lol? A dial-up internet connection? Clucky phantom images photoshopping on images ("There! Look there ... is that ... a face?" -Zoom in the face- -Ops, the sound is cut- 'cut' - next cut-), scenes and sequences are poorly edited and do not flow at all. You will see a girl finding a corpse hanging from the knot in a scene and, literally, 10 seconds later, seeing her in a seemingly unaffected place, smiling and wandering around. <br /> <br /> Besides the many problems I have with film in terms of production value, it is also painfully long and repetitive and therefore quite boring. <br /> <br /> I recommend Shutter instead, a well done Oriental (Thai) horror movie.
