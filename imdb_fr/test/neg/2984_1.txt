I just saw this movie last night and I almost cried. No, it's not because it totally petrified me, no. It was absolutely horrible! Sometimes you see movies that make you wonder what will happen to the human race in the near future - this film is one of them. It's as if the writer, the actors, the director, etc. had just joined together to copy and paste scenes from their favorite horror movies, compress them all together and say "Hey, here's Satan's whip !!!" After seeing this film, I could not help being tormented by the sight of people who call themselves "actors"; waltz as if they were some kind of talented performer ... do not be fooled, they fear! Do not waste your time and money !!!
