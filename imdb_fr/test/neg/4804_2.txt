Indri, virginal and innocent, finds herself in a brothel run by a merciless MG pimp. Indri finds herself incarcerated in MG's private prison after refusing to make love to her. Of course, Indri and Helga, one of the best swindlers in the world, join forces and plan to escape. Mom's blah Firmansyah, her uninspired leadership, and Piet Burnama's dull and talkative script profoundly undermine all the underhanded vitality that this film needs to be described as a pleasing piece of junk mining: the slow pace is painfully slow, There is no free feminine nudity. (Girls do not even show skin during the mandatory group shower scene!), the expected torture and degradations are both extremely tame and lukewarm, the lean moderate lean blood does not impress either , and even a ridiculous cat fight sequence is nothing to make exciting. Thomas Susanto's pedestrian cinematography, the ridiculously ugly dubbing, the 102-minute length, the sullen theme song and Gatot Sudarto's Cornball score add an abject insult to an already frightening injury. Only a decent action in the attack of the last reel offers a little relief against too much boredom and otherwise too abundant. A complete failure inducing a yawn.
