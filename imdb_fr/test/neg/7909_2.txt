I totally agree with Greg in Ontario. I saw this film today with a friend who went to see the director of the theater and told him, "This is perhaps the worst film I have ever seen." I saw a LOT of movies with this person, and he forgives enough, so I was shocked. (The manager gave him a free pass!) <br /> <br /> The humor of the movie shocked me a lot (yes, the scene of the baked potato was at the top of the list !). My friend and I are white and have seen the film with a mostly black audience. For a moment, I thought, maybe I do not understand this movie because I'm white. Then I realized that no one was laughing. The writing was bad; the direction was bad; the timing was almost nonexistent. <br /> <br /> There were some fun moments, there was just a LITTLE time between them. Even Airplane Two was funnier than that, and that says a lot. <br /> <br /> Snoop Dogg in Starsky and Hutch (like Huggy Bear) dazzled me so much that I was sure I would enjoy this movie. No. <br /> <br /> DL Hughley was funny, as usual, but his role was rather small. Tom Arnold had some fun moments as a "white guy", but most other attempts at humor were far from up to the task. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I could not give the film a rating with negative stars. .
