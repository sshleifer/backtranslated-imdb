It's a joke, is not it? It can not be a real movie? It's not even a real video? Give a video camera to all the kids at Harvey Milk Highk High School and they could make a better movie than this one. The filmmaker can not be serious ... no? Is it a satire? The comedy? The drama went terribly wrong? The script is about as determined and as boring as possible. Ten monkeys locked in a room with a laptop could offer a better scenario. The dialogue is not cliché. A cliché dialogue could well make this vacation disorder a pleasure to camp - but it is not and it is not. Worst of all - a hostess walks into a dramatic scene in a private apartment dressed in a bathrobe wearing a frying pan as a kind of "Honeymooners" episode. Whaaa ??? I have seen better play in college theater clubs. One of the tracks is an attractive lunk, the other is not. The two can not even handle a convincing kiss. So much for romance. The support players are to die for. <br /> <br /> Everything is emphasized by a nauseating soundtrack and the sound seems to have been recorded in the restroom of the back room. Most dialogues are (thankfully) incomprehensible. <br /> <br /> This obsolete cinematic fruit cake is not even worthy of being the next ROCKY HORROR or a gay sequel to MYSTERY SCIENCE THEATER 3000. It's just bad. In all directions. VISIONS OF SUGARPLUMS will not dance in your head - they will stomp all your expectations. Having a goose's pumper and watching the lights of the neighbor's holiday without scruple - it will be time to spend better.
