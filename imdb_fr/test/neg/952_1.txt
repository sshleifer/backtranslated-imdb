That's what happened to screen savers after G4 took it, moving from a useful source of computer-related information to a show that culminated in setting up a Miniature web server in the back of someone. <Br/> <br /> As G4's ratings collapsed, they moved away from their original target audience, the gamers, to turn to generic, hormone-focused young men, adding from magic for the eyes to the staff and a segment of sexual advice. Now, even the players who applauded the show in the beginning are turning away with disgust. I look forward to the end of the show and the network, whose demise is widely awaited and well deserved.
