After the mysterious death of an old friend, a group of teenagers find themselves in possession of Stay Alive, a survival video game based on the horrible story of Erzebet Bathory, known as The Countess of Blood. group begins to play they will soon be murdered one by one in the same way as the character they played in the game. When the boundary between the game world and reality will disappear, our heroes must find a way to defeat the bloody Blood Countess. "Stay Alive" is an incredibly poor teenage slasher movie without suspense. Director-writer William Brent Bell does not know how to make a horror movie to watch. Jump fears are irritating, the level of blood / blood almost non-existent and the story does not make sense. The dialogue is totally bad and the game of all the actors is embarrassing. "Stay Alive" is easily one of the worst mainstream horror films of 2006. Stay away from this stinking shit.
