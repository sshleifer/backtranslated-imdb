When I put this film in my DVD player and sat down with a coke and chips, I had some expectations. I was hoping this film would contain some of the highlights of the first film: great animation, a good flowing story, an excellent vocal cast, a fun comedy and a soundtrack. But, to my great disappointment, none of this is in Atlantis: the return of Milo. If I had read some reviews first, I might not have been so disappointed. The following paragraph will be addressed to those who saw the first film and who appreciated it mainly for the points mentioned. <br /> <br /> When the first scene appears, you are in shock if you just choose Atlantis: The return of Milo from the showcase of your local video workshop (or whatever) and had the expectations I had . The music seems to be a bad imitation of the first film and the distribution of the voice has been replaced by another less appropriate. (With the exception of a few characters, like Sweet's voice). The actual drawings are not so bad, but the animation is particularly sad. The scenario is also rather weak, because it looks more like three episodes of Schooby-Doo than the only adventurous story we had last time. But do not get me wrong, these are not very good Schooby-Doo episodes. I did not laugh once, although I may have sneered once or twice. <br /> <br /> For the public who has not seen the first movie, or who does not particularly like a similar sequel, here is a quick review of this movie as a stand-alone product: If you liked schooby -doo, you may like this movie. Otherwise, you can still enjoy this movie if you have nothing else to do. And I guess it could be a good children's movie, but I would not know it. It could have been better if Milo's Return had been a three-part episode aired on a cartoon channel or on television for breakfast.
