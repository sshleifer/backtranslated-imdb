The only reason I watched this little-known Irish film was whether Mike Myers played a normal, dramatic character. Well, he could and his acting was pretty good, but unfortunately it was probably the only good thing I could say about this movie. At first, the film follows the life of Mickey, an orphan of twelve, who lives with his brother and sister with their eccentric grandmother. Despite strong language, it sounds like a family film, but after a while, it becomes clear that Pete's Meteor is no longer a drama adapted to young drama. And the worst is that it's a drama with a plot as ridiculous as even totally implausible. An absurd story is transformed into another and at any moment, the events on the screen do not make much sense. I suppose that when a drama of life needs a meteor or something that looks more like an even more ridiculous spiritual content, it's a very bad sign. The characters are not better than a story. Despite all his problems, the young Mickey is by no means a nice character, but it is clear that we were supposed to care about him and even to feel strong sympathy for him. It does not work The same thing with other characters. They are mostly as ridiculous as the story itself with the main character (although he is not the main character), as the only plus point. Towards the end of the film, I was still hopeful that there is something behind all this improbability and nonsense. Unfortunately, even if the author of the story had such intentions (and I'm sure he did) in the film, they are hidden and almost imperceptible under such a strange scenario. <br /> <br /> Note: 3 out of 10. Those of you who are interested in seeing Mike Myers as a dramatic actor can watch Pete's Meteor for this reason, but the rest of the viewers will likely be bitterly disappointed.
