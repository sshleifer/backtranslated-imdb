Created in 1976 for no other apparent reason than to keep the scenographers busy, "The Box" was directed by Richard Kelly ("Donnie Darko") and stars Cameron Diaz and James Marsden as Norma and Arthur Lewis. supposedly struggling financially, although they both have a successful career - she taught at high school, and worked as an optical specialist at NASA's Langley, Virginia research center. They have a child, Walter (Sam Oz Stone). <br /> <br /> One day, the Lewise find on their doorstep a package containing a black box with a big red button. There is a note from a 'Mr. "Steward" indicating that he will return at 5:00 pm to explain the box. <br /> <br /> The mysterious Arlington Steward, performed by Frank Langella, arrives at the agreed time, wearing an elegant elegant Savile Row. suit. He is polite but professional, but his most remarkable aspect is his face, half of which seems to have been swept and neglected. Langella is the only thing worth watching in the film, but he is unfortunately overwhelmed by his own makeup, which resembles that of Harvey "Two Face" Dent (Aaron Eckhart) of Christopher Nolan's "The Dark Knight". It's like the elephant in the room: we can try to ignore it, but it's more than a little embarrassing. <br /> <br /> Steward explains that he will come back in 24 hours to retrieve the button. If, during this time, they decide to unlock and press the button, it will give them $ 1 million in cash. The only problem - and it's a big problem - is that a stranger will die somewhere. It may be across the city, on another continent, but Steward assures them that the victim will be an unknown. As a sign of good faith, he leaves them a good $ 100 note to keep, whether they press the button or not. <br /> <br /> Arthur and Norma are skeptical, believing that all this is an elaborate scam or hoax, but they will not be long in wondering what would happen if they pressed the button? Would they really have a million dollars? Would someone really die? Tired of speculation, Norma slaps the button. Nothing is happening. However, their initial relief gives way to the alarm when Steward shows up the next day with a briefcase full of money. They decide to cancel everything, but Steward tells them it's too late. "You have already pressed the button," he explains. As Steward's limousine moves away, Arthur notes that the license number, which he later discovers, is registered with the NSA (National Security Agency). <br /> <br /> At this point, the film begins to turn deep into an impossible territory to follow as secondary characters begin to have nose bleeds and bright signs of peace. Meanwhile, the city is invaded by chubby geeks and scruffy jerseys that follow Arthur as a screening night for a zombie alien nerd race. Arthur ends up being trapped by the worms of threatening books from the library (?), Where Steward's wife appears - which we have not seen until now - and informs Arthur that to get out of the library, he must take one. of three vertical columns of digital water effects of cheesy appearance. "What if I choose the wrong?", Asks Arthur, seeming much less confused than he should in the circumstances, and certainly much less confused than the audience is at the moment. the. "Eternal damnation," said the girl. <br /> <br /> Arthur places himself in the central column of digital liquid effects and, after a brief absence, appears suddenly, still in his cocoon of water, hovering over Norma's bed. When she wakes up and sees it, the water bubble bursts and Arthur falls on the bed in a spray of water that, curiously, continues to drain from the water pipes hanging just outside the camera while that a soaked Marsden and Diaz turn around. the bed. <br /> <br /> It's confusing, I know it. <br /> <br /> We finally learn that Steward was once the NSA public relations officer until he was struck by a lightning bolt that destroyed part of his face. He was declared dead, then came back to life after being transformed into a sort of superman who now serves as "those who are making lightning" and whose powers have allowed him to take control of the CIA, the NSA and from NASA. by himself. <br /> <br /> And what are all these wastes for? Apparently, Steward's mission is to subject human beings to some sort of test of biblical character (for example, the "Liaison of Isaac"), to determine whether humanity is worth saving. If enough people pass the button test by refusing to push it, the divine Steward Lords will spare the race. Unfortunately, those who press the button, such as Norma and Arthur, must be punished for their lack of moral morality, to which they are subjected to a series of terrible trials of "Lady or Tiger" that unfold as one of these "Saw movies," except without the entertaining gore or the benefit of a consistent plot. <br /> <br /> "The Box" represents the kind of unnecessary mental masturbation that first-year philosophy students enjoy chatting after a few beers. The tedious exercise of Richard Kelly in existentialist pettifogy eventually collapses under the weight of his own incomprehensibility; the tortured mixture of unbearable ideas finally freezes, like when too many colors are mixed, to give a gray film as sinuous as a film as insipid as one of those narcotics in flight whose intrigue do not suffer more or less interrupted by a quiet nap. <br /> <br /> There is a moment in "The Box" where Arthur, a technically minded guy, begins to be curious about how the button works. By opening the unit, he is disappointed to find nothing inside. <br /> <br /> After seeing The Box, I know exactly how it feels.
