In the 1950s, a gay photographer named Bob Mizer (Daniel MacIvor) founded a male modeling agency. He published a magazine specializing in muscles called "Physics Pictorial" and a film of men. Many models have become prostitutes. "Beefcake" shows the rise and fall of this guy. <br /> <br /> A mix of scenes from the 50s, testimony of many models and Bob Mizer himself, the director Thom Fitzgerald used this subterfuge to show naked men and many penises along 93 minutes, in a complete bad taste and very ridiculous shit. I have never heard anything about this morally corrupt Bob Mizer and I do not know what AMG is. In my opinion, only homosexual and very specific audiences might like the theme of this boring and pretentious film. My vote is two. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Carne Fresca" ("Fresh meat")
