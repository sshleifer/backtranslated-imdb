This may be all you need to know to decide whether or not you want to see this. <br /> <br /> The film is bad. Really, really bad. And sometimes, he seems to be aware of it and make fun of the seriousness of the situation. This aligns cliche after clich√© and even gets worse along with moments bad enough to be hilariously funny. <br /> <br /> If you can laugh at the really poor quality of script writing and production values, you could enjoy it. Otherwise, get ready for serious brain damage. <br /> <br /> 3/10
