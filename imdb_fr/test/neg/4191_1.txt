I will only add to the group of people who have deemed it "irretrievable" without, however, repeating the obvious evidence of FLAWS clearly stated by some of the commentators: The "film" is shot on video (what kind of camera I do not have no) I do not know), but the cameraman has it all the time on AUTOFOCUS (!), so that any slight movement makes it come in and out of focus. In many scenes, the actors themselves lose interest in their scenes. That alone screams "Amateur". <br /> <br /> I also noticed that in the "middle of the cornfield", you can hear the sound of the gasoline generator that powers the lights ... loud. <Br/> <br /> In addition, what about this unique light source that follows (and which "often leads" the actors) when they walk. It sounds like a news presenter with this "camera light" that follows people like a projector. There was no "credit" for lighting / PD design and I know why. The "filmmakers" did not see the need to have someone who really knew what they were going to light this photo (note I did not say "film"). So get ready for SINGLE to be the only source of cinematographic lighting for most of the film. UGhhh !!! <br /> <br /> This is probably the most technically inept production I know in the trade. I bought this title because I like bad cinema. Usually, it's so bad that you can laugh at it. It's so bad that it's unassailable. Plan Nine from Outer Space is "Citizen Kane" compared to this title.
