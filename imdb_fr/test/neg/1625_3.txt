Miles O'keefe plays the role of Ator, a quilted hero who looks like a Chippendale dancer. The Conan-wannabe has to fight with Cher's wicky wig and protect the Earth from the Geometric Nucleus, a sort of primitive atomic bomb. Watch carefully for sunglasses and visible tire marks. Mystery Science Theater 3000 made fun of it under the title CAVE DWELLERS.
