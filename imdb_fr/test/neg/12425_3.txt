Some friends and I have the odd hunt for horror movies that are really horrible and totally obscure (for good reason) and then watched under the influence of consumer goods expanding the mind, such as alcohol and / or soft drugs. Many people certainly do, but they watch movies like the remake of "Godzilla", while we torment our eyes and our brain with stuff like "The Loch Ness Horror". And, eureka, this is a bad prototype movie! We traditionally open with bagpipe music during the opening credits. This is of course to underscore, we stupid viewers, that the story is supposed to unfold in the best Scottish moments and not in the birthplace of director Larry Buchanan, Texas. For the same reason, it seems that members of the cast are also urged to exert excessive efforts and speak with atrocious accents. Professor George Sanderson, an American marine biologist, arrives in Loch Ness with brand new and sophisticated sonar equipment to locate the legendary monster in the lake. Meanwhile, there are many other parties hanging around the lake, such as a group of children in a science camp (what a boring way to spend your holidays), retired army generals looking for a Luftwaffe plane crashing into the lake during the Second World War. thieves and routed scientists who assault the monster's egg. One might think that these many subplots bring diversity and excitement to the plot, but this is unfortunately not the case. "Loch Ness Horror" is a boring film that contains only a few remarkable elements. The monster itself, for example, is a deliciously cheesy creation with cute eyes and smoky breath. His teeth are also shining in the dark, which is very useful when you are stupid enough to go out in the middle of the night. Towards the end of the film, the remaining cast members were more interested in the lost Luftwaffe plane than in the monster. It was time to finish. "Loch Ness Horror" is carefully recommended if you are a fan of the bad B movies of the 80s, but know that it contains an overload of insane dialogues and a strangely hasty ending that suggests that the film suddenly went off budget.
