I have read almost all the books so far and have seen the music production in two different languages. I absolutely loved everything I knew before. But lately, I am short of resources to maintain my imagination. I still have some books left, but they are either in transit, or they are suites that I'm in no hurry to read. So an idea came to me - pour me! There are movies I have not watched! So I have to look at them immediately. <br /> <br /> The first five minutes of this series were ... acceptable. In fact, I liked the variation in the reason for the denunciation, as different as it appears. It all came down from there, though. Chauvelin was too ... whimsical? And, I think, too old for this role. Not quite that dark and frisky silhouette with its awful either. (And what was this random bedstead scene?) It was too scary - her only love was the Guillotine Lady, and her only interest - her work and her only obsession - Sir Percy?) Marguerite ... More beautiful woman in France? The smartest woman in Europe? I do not think so. Be that as it may, whatever forced her into Sir Percy's study, I have not the slightest idea. And all that my Lord Tony did to deserve this death? Yes, all members of the League gave their lives to Sir Percy, but he would never have endangered any of them, nor would he run away like a coward when his dear friend faces mortal danger. And if he had had to cry to his companion, he would have done it, not moving as if nothing had happened. Which brings me to another point, Sir Percy. His performance was very terrible. He was neither a lazy fop nor a gallant and elusive hero who masters transformations. He did not care too much about ties (his pronunciation of that word only blew my ears) and with his own hands he had never killed anyone. So, what did it do with him, walking at random and killing people? <br /> <br /> The costumes were too bright for this period too. We are talking about post-revolutionary France! Not pre-revolutionary. People in such a dress stand out quite easily from the crowd. It was just ... gah! <br /> <br /> Although I must admit that after watching other scenes, my opinion has changed slightly. Watching it as a separate work, independent of the Scarlet Pimpernel series, was tolerable. Just your other average hero in the mask. But for what they tried to pass, it's still miserable.
