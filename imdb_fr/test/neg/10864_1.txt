It's easily one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time (and I recently saw Starship Troopers 2 !!!). I did not find anything to buy this movie. The acting game, which is probably the best part of the movie, is at best fair. Michael Madsen is his main character. Denis Hopper does not seem to know what he is supposed to be. Vinnie Jones accent is weird. One positive thing is that Leonor Valera is fantastic. Her game is pretty mediocre, but I doubt that's why she's here. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is really dreadful. It's just hogwash. I do not know who signed this proposal, but they really need the help of a professional at the next visit. <br /> <br /> This film is why the IMDB scoring system should be able to include zero stars out of ten. Avoid at all costs.
