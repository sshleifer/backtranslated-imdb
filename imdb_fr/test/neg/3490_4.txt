I remember seeing this movie when I was a child. I remember that it terrified me enormously and that it remained to me during all these years. I spent a few years trying to find it online ... I did not remember the title, but only the story. After searching and searching, I came across a VHS sold on E-Bay. I was excited and when it finally arrived, I engraved it in the VCR and I could not help being a little nostalgic. Needless to say, I was slightly disappointed. It's not the movie I remember having looked like a kid. It was boring from time to time and I found Beryl Reid's incessant groan extremely annoying. The performances of Reid and Flora Robson were good overall, but the film was not scary. I think that any movie deserves to be viewed to form his opinion, but sometimes, well ......
