Normally, I'm not trying to guess a crime thriller, but Cleaner was quite predictable. Samuel L. Jackson, who plays the character of Tom Cutler, and his craft, creates an interesting twist at the beginning of the film, but that's about it. Without even thinking that I knew where the plot would be taken and within 30 minutes, I had already figured out who the killer was. Rather than trusting myself and having seen several films spinning, I watched until it was completed. What a disappointment, I was right from the start. <br /> <br /> The cast of the characters was a good thing, as well as the acting of Jackson and Harris ... except Eva Mendes. From the starting point, she did not play a credible character in correlation with the script and it ruined the plot too early. Perhaps it was a leadership problem or simply a weakness in the story itself. Her role as Ann Norcut should have shown more emotion and distress for the situation around her. This would have made the accumulation a little more convincing and the ending more dramatic. Nevertheless, Cleaner is observable and not memorable. I saw episodes of CSI that were more exciting than that.
