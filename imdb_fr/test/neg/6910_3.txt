This series does not present the British vision of the war of independence, nor an anti-American vision of it. The underlying theme of the series is that a silent majority of settlers enjoyed British rule; that the founding fathers were manipulative crooks whose sole purpose was to drag Great Britain into a violent civil war; that the American partisans of the revolution and the militia were racist thugs, violent, deceived in the struggle. It is clear that the intention of the author, Richard Holmes, is that the viewer extrapolates these features, in a straight line, from the American population from 1775 to today. <br /> <br /> For example, in the episode "The" Holmes flirts with an obscure imprint of the Boston massacre, in which he claims that the skin of Crispus Attucks, a black man and the first man killed in the revolution , was deliberately "bleached". Holmes says that presenting Attucks as a black man would have been a bad propaganda for the revolutionary cause. Holmes never reveals how he knows it. And there is more Holmes strives to work in one and the same unfounded atrocity: the profanation of the body of a British soldier. He compares American militia to Viet Cong and mujahadeen - not to mention any difference in the objectives of these groups. The list continues. <br /> <br /> Supposedly, this series was made in response to "The Patriot" by Mel Gibson. This speaks volumes when an academic feels the need to answer Mel Gibson on any topic. Instead of presenting the British point of view, it seems that Holmes really wanted to give a sensational and anti-American point of view and in doing so, he became the Roger Corman of historians - a third-class schlock.
