This awkward and painstaking 5-reeler is certainly not one of Harold Lloyd's best films. The gags are sparse and mostly uninspired. Saccharom melodrama is abundant. The installation takes forever, as Lloyd, the unconventional country doctor but incredibly kind, makes his tour, bringing a little sunshine into the lives of children, the elderly and puppies. It's like a 1922 version of Patch Adams. Ugh. 4/10.
