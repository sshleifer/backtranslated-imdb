The film career of Jean Claude Van Damme seems to have been disproportionate in a handcart. It is therefore ironic to see him play a character who meets the same destiny literally at the very beginning of the film! It is also interesting to note how much the scenario of his films is very similar, regardless of the producer, the director or the scriptwriter. Van Damme usually plays a character who lives in France and, because of circumstances, finds himself in another part of the world where he has a deceased brother and it is up to Van Damme to avenge himself with the help of a character who he has just met. Look AWOL or LEGOINAIRRE or many other films that have the title "With Jean Claude Van Damme" and all of which have about the same type of narrative structure. This does not mean that they are identical of course, but very similar. If you have seen a film by Van Damme, you have seen them all. It's the same with MAXIMUM RISK
