I can only name a few films that I saw that were so bad. This film has everything to please: the dialogue is cheesy and clich√© ', the acting is mediocre with a few exceptions, the cinematography has nothing to celebrate, and the plot is ridiculous (A fat woman follows a family of suburban girl did not make the football team). It's so bad, it's funny to watch. If you can catch this for life, I would highly recommend it as a comedy. As for serious movies, I'm afraid I have to rate this as a 2. <br /> <br /> Do not watch this movie if you're a serious movie lover and look for an interesting and challenging storyline. or good acting. There is none to find. <br /> <br /> Edit: Hmmm ... I think a group of people working for life must have written bogus reviews and voted all negative. Do not believe them. It's a really bad film.
