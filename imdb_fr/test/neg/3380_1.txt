Although I can summarize this pathetic episode of Night Gallery in two words, these two words being "dung horse", I am obliged to write at least ten lines. It's a very sophomoric episode, not worthy of Rod Serling's standards, but rather an inept attempt at some kind of ironic black comedy. The premise of giant rodents inhabiting the moon, a lifeless orb, is totally ridiculous, as is the construction of a giant mouse trap. I suppose we must also assume that the moon is made of green cheese and that's how these absurd creatures survive. I can only assume that this episode was presented as a filler to supplant the other two episodes aired for the first time on this date. In the end, waste of film, actors and airtime.
