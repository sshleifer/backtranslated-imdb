Let's be clear. It was bad! So putrid that it can not even be engraved in anyone's memory. <br /> <br /> The repetitive plot (which constantly recycles not only the jokes, but also the intrigues and appearances of characters). ; Sue (the mother) opens the episode by quoting how she loves her baby but smells bad (as if it does not get old! Har-de-bloody-har!), A quasi-nationalist Australian "bogan" seems to be saying point she thinks she's great because she's an ozzie while all / all the others who are not dead before disappearing for the rest of the episode. (thanks a lot) <br /> <br /> The rest of the plot is centered on the fact that the father (Gary) disagrees with Sue and addresses his group members to get tips on how to fix it. <br /> <br /> The phrase "words I miss" is old, but that's where it's the most truthful thing to say. It's so BAD! HORRIBLE, I would like every trace of its existence to be sent to the deepest depths of the North Sea and life can continue. <br /> <br /> It saddens me however to see someone as good as Sally Bretton (good actress, I like) makes a jerk, Ardal O Hanlon (except My Hero) at the Ability to be quite funny - but not here - and Ben Elton, distinguished for so many good things, still manages to invent this ... so the comedy has very serious problems!
