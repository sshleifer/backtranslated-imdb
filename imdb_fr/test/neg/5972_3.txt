This documentary was boring and pretty stupid. <br /> <br /> I mean ... the documentarist obviously does not even know how does Darwinian evolution work? It's a theory, and the name is just silly. Reading a book of university biology could have explained to the documentary maker what Darwinism really is. Darwinism is a good theory, but perverse if it is done in politics. <br /> <br /> There was also no tangible evidence in this documentary that was only interviewing some people ... no expert testimony, or questionable tracks ... <The documentary was also boring. I mean, it could have been reduced to 35 minutes, and it would have been much better. <br /> <br /> There are much better documentaries than that ... it was not worth watching ... you can Get better information on Wikipedia = D Do not waste your time and money !
