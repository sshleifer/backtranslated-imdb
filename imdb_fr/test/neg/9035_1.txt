I just watched this movie as if it were on TV and I had nothing else to do. We went here to IMDb also to look on the trivia page and got to watch the comments of the users. And what do I find? Every idiot idiot throws this movie to the sky! I would not even have written anything, but when no one else took the time to spread the word about this shabby movie, I thought I could do it. . The worst was the guy who played Brian Wilson (I think the name was correct) because he was too active, especially when he was high. The rest was not as bad as him but nobody was good either. I am not an expert on the beach but I really can not complain about this story ... except that it sucks. No motivation for character decisions most of the time, but hey, maybe they were idiots in real life. And what I found worse was that I thought it would be a movie about the boys on the beach, but you really only master a few of the characters. I hate when they do it in movies, same thing in doors, even though I like this movie more. You do not have the energy to write more ... it sucks! do not buy or watch!
