This show is terrible. I can not overcome the total waste of the great talent that this show contains. It's not an entertaining improvisation game, it's just an inexpensive attempt to get famous actors on the stage and have them play a poorly improved stage. In fact, I did improv work as an actor and this show is not improvisation. <br /> <br /> What the audience is really laughing at (if they make fun of this show, it's really wrong) is the embarrassment of the guest star lost as a deer in the headlights. People who laugh at laughing are stupid things, completely independent of each other. And if this is not part of the scene, the actors will tell them it's wrong! I find that this show is a shame for the art and makes me cry for shows like Whose Line, that is to say Anyway, who had a lot of talent, excellent improvisational games and who did not give me not want to change channels.
