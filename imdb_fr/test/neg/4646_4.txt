Well, I first read the book and I thought, wow, it would be cool to see that in a movie, so I started looking and found that there was already a movie that had been done ... I bought the movie a week ago on DVD and watched it .. they did it terribly badly! first this kid Hapi, which is not in any book, then the mix between the two books ("the god of the river" and "the seventh roll") that Nicolas needs funds, while in the book he He is the lender himself. Everything about the Hyksos is also wrong. Taila is supposed to have invented the light tank. Everything about the grave is also very wrong. It is supposed to have a channel that has some kind of vacuum- sucking around it .. the grave itself was made in a labyrinth with only a possibility to pass if one knows the rules of the old game of boa. There was nothing in the movie that said Nicolas was English and that Royan was a Christian Coptic in the book, not a Muslim. This list is endless. There were few good things in the movie, the actors who played Royan, Nahood, Taita, Boris, Mick and Tessay were well chosen, the rest were just parodies of the characters in the book, Rasfer was the worst, he did not even get close to the character I had in mind while I was writing the book It is a shame that such a large book is mutilated in such a bad reproduction ... I wonder why Wilbur Smith never gave his permission for that.
