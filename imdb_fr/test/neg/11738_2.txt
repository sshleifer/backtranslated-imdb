This is one of the most stupid ideas for a movie. Remake a classic movie filmed by shooting. I hope no one will try this technique again. In 1998, the director of "Good Will Hunting", Gus Van Sant, tried to remake the classic "Psycho" Hitchcock in 1960 and failed miserably. What the hell was Van Sant thinking? This remake is not nearly going over the original. The few changes made here are of no help. If you want to see "Psycho", the choice is obvious. See the original. <br /> <br /> * (out of four)
