The scenario of this film is clich√© and has obviously been stolen in Jurassic Park. Filmmakers did not even try to hide that. It seems that there is not enough budget to make dinosaur dolls worthy of the name. The viewer sees some toy dinos-like robots (a cheap store) that move in a very unnatural way. It's funny though, because it's so bad. The acting is almost as natural as the dinos. Nobody seems really excited about being in this movie (which I totally understand). Especially the last half hour is extremely boring and it is almost impossible to watch without falling asleep. The positive comment I would like to make about "Raptor" is that it does not take 90 minutes.
