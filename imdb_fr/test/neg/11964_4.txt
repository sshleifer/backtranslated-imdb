This third installment of the Scarecrow series is by far the best of the lot. I know, I know ... but what is its quality? Well, let's not be stupid. It's still pretty bad, but compared to the first two, it's a good movie. Again shot in digital, with decent lighting and good camera work. <br /> <br /> **** SPOILER **** <br /> <br /> When a university baseball team hurts new members, it stays in a diabetic coma. Of course, they leave him in a cornfield, tied to a scarecrow. According to legend, the soul of the boy is transferred into the body of the scarecrow, which comes alive and causes a terrible revenge, well, just about everyone. The co-eds lead to the beach, which is very close to the corn field. On the sunny beach, they are killed one by one by the whistling scarecrow. <br /> <br /> Writer / Director Brian Katkin does a credible job bringing an essential drama to the film. Unfortunately, the drama jumps on the right and lands in the common cheese. Most of the game was honest, but there were some really terrible passages, including a horrible piece of poorly made lip sync. Some plot points were left largely unresolved, and most were used to have someone alone so he could be shot. Again, better than previous slices, but still missing.
