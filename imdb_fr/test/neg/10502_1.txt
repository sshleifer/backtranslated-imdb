If you came here, it's because you've seen this movie before and are curious to see what others have to say. <br /> <br /> I feel for you, I really know it. And I apologize very much as a Canadian (because that's what we do) that this film must have been your eyes, if only for a moment. I heard there was no treatment for retinal bleeding reported in a dozen cases. <br /> <br /> Like everyone else, I rented this movie, believing it was a stupid swindle of Blade's movie B. I thought "of course I could laugh at a stupid movie". I will give the creators of this film A positive comment about their "creation": Thank you for removing the REC XX / XX / XX from the lower right corner of the screen. I can see how it would have been a distraction to see this movie. <br /> <br /> And for the record, I * saw * the film, but I did not watch it. The dialogue was incoherent and most of the scenes took place in my grandmother's caravan, I swear to God. <br /> <br /> You know what? I do not write about it anymore. It's too painful.
