It's a terrible adaptation of Charles Kingsley's story. Animation is frankly frank. And the songs are a shame for movie songs, especially the song "high cockororim", which they keep repeating. I'm sorry for Jon Pertwee and David Jason, two of the best British talents, who provided the voice for the depressing animation sequence. Bernerd Cirbbins does his best to play in this dreadful production, but he fails. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie at all costs, even if it's the last movie on this planet!
