I think Homegrown is a bit unfit for this film - rather "Plantation Grown" - but it does not really have the same sound. My guide described this as a comedy, but the miserable trials of these unfortunate buffoons are not my idea of ​​a belly laugh. More in the genre of thriller / drama stuffing. The characters have grown enough - a cast of stars made it so promising, too bad that the plot is obviously absurd. Ted Danson provided a good cameo, as did Jamie Lee Curtis in his role as director. Jon Bon Jovi has this incredible ability to measure THC content on the front seat of his car! I guess if you drink some in advance, you should be able to get through this one - not for the shy paranoid guys.
