Honestly, the people who gave this film a ten would have given 100 for dough fiction. This is the level we are dealing with here. <br /> <br /> The film is not bad, but it's not like "OMG, the best movie since Pulp Fiction!" Some people have incredibly low expectations for movies, even those of the independent variety. Personally, my interest in the film decreased after half an hour. The plot challenges logic and conviction. You must know why the woman did what she did to "save her husband". Yes indeed. I guarantee you will come out of the theater thinking, "hmm, now it makes no sense." It is a film in which you really have to suspend all logic and conviction. <br /> <br /> Those who said the score was good were probably listening to their MP3 players. It absolutely killed the film in places. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, watch the film only if you have nothing important to do. I give him a three because there is a long sex scene in the motel that is decent.
