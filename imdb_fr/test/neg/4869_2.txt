This film is bad. It is filled with glaring holes in the plot, characters that are ruled by stupidity, bad acting and above all, a mediocre scenario that has already been done in so many movies, but better. I'm sorry for Donald Sutherland, I just hope he had to make this movie rather than wanted! Miss that.
