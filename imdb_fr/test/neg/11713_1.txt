I saw this movie on a show that showed bad B-movies and was trying to get you to buy them. It was actually just a long trailer, but you really have a good idea of ​​what the movie was. After watching the trailer, I thought to praise this film because it looked stupid and generic, but could still be entertaining in a perverse sense. It's not entertaining in any sense of the word. The film has two (or should I say four) goals and it's not the number of dead, it's women. They are very hot and naked and Mrs. Lovell could be a legitimate actress, but not in a film where the focus is on T & A and nerdy dialogues. It's not even a horror movie or scary unless you talk about watching the actors try to act. The value of production is pathetic, the acting is worse and writing is the worst. What was the purpose of making this film? To scare people? To rip off "Texas Chainsaw Massacre"? Trying to be funny? Show women's breasts? Put someone's head in a delayed outfit, with fake hands and fake legs? For a character to simply pronounce the word "Snow" repeatedly? Do not have real violence but enough nudity to try to conceal the fact that there is no real plot? Can you follow a movie that no one has seen or will ever watch? I made a mistake while taking this movie, do not make this mistake too. <br /> <br /> STAY AWAY FROM THIS FILM !!!!!!!
