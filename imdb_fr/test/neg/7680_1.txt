There are bad movies, movies that are horrible, and then there is a tiny and rarefied film body that is so horribly bad that even after seeing them once, it's impossible to forget about them even for decades later. It's exactly such a movie, and it's hard to believe that the original movie in this series was actually pretty good. Let's see, George Kennedy, the mechanic of the "hard-to-cigar" of the original was promoted captain of airline and, after the Concorde is attacked by a missile (do not ask it), he resorts to stunts like shooting with a flare. through the cockpit window, despite (supposedly) flying to Mach 2, while performing evasive maneuvers at high altitude that would have torn the wings of any real airliner, not to mention the effect of the passengers! But the worst aspect of the film, at least for airplane enthusiasts like me, is that this atrocity has "played" on one of the coolest, sexiest and most technologically remarkable planes of all time. The Concorde (or, quite simply, "Concorde" as its pilots designate it) deserved much better, this abomination is tantamount to taking a high class beauty like Audrey Hepburn and putting it in a sequel to "Porky". Fortunately, the release of the always hilarious "Plane!" The following year, the entire "Airport" franchise stopped, because studios and moviegoers could have made fun of anyone even considering a fifth installment. <br /> <br /> 1/10
