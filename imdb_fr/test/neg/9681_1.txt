This film is a completely inaccurate description of the true story of Noah's ark. The producers probably did not even read the Bible. This is the worst movie I have ever seen! Noah's wife was never named in the Bible, but the film's authors named her Naamah. This film depicts the destruction of Sodom a thousand years before, and what about Gamorrah? It too was destroyed along with Sodom. (Maybe the producers thought that did not include Gamorrah in the story and show the city of "Sodom" as if you knew what would make more eyebrows quiver.) This movie is an extreme dirt and makes fun of God and the Bible. It is astonishing that any true Christian wants to participate in the production of this abominable, hideous and reprobate mockery of the Bible.
