'Tycus' is almost as bad as a sci-fi movie can go. <br /> <br /> I can hardly find anything good to say about this film. The premises are completely wrong. A comet is supposed to hit the moon and cause catastrophic damage to the Earth, but nobody believes the scientist who predicted it. An entire underground city and launching pad for nuclear-armed rockets is being built in the mountains of California without anyone realizing it. As the comet approaches the Earth, the news arrives on television and newspapers barely a day before the event. And so on ... <br /> <br /> No emotion reaches the screen either. Is the genius who discovers the comet and builds the underground city a savior of humanity or a beast? The director or Dennis Hooper who played the role did not seem to decide until the film was finished. In fact, it makes no difference, because playing and directing is so confusing that one ends up wondering what this movie is trying to say. Special effects are so cheap that not only can they not convince in the era of computer effects, they could not have been in the 1950s, four decades before the film was made. <br /> <br /> A total loss of time.
