Ed Wood, perhaps the worst filmmaker of all time, has left us jewels so terrible that they delight, unwittingly being funny and therefore charming and innocent. <br /> <br /> James Lay and his backers (Mom and Dad, it seems from the credits) have created in 'Dreamland' a film as mediocre as any film by Ed Wood but devoid of charm and innocence. Dreamland simply stinks and the only good thing about this 90-minute waste of time is the certain certainty that James Lay and his colleagues will never make a photo again. <br /> <br /> I must mention some of the drama Some crew members took a long time to avoid being associated with this horrible picture. I am sure that the production controller, once the film is finished, asked that his name be changed in the credits in "Donna Snartlebutt" and the accounting done by "Brutus". One can imagine "Brutus" with his roll of $ 5 bills paying the crew at the end of a day's filming. <br /> <br /> I will not mention the many technical problems of this little pathetic videotape, but I must mention a few comments comparing this slag to the work of David Lynch. You know that your mother became a real whore when you asked your mother to connect to IMDb and post such a BS - no one, except for patients with severe mental disorders, could - ever - ever to cheat of "dreamland" with - all - produced by Lynch. What a horror against Mr. Lynch and his work. <br /> <br /> Go back to film school, Mr. Lay.
