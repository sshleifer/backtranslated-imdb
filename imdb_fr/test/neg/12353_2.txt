Rabbit Fever is a collection of documentary skits, each of them focusing on a female personal device made popular by a single episode of Sex and the City in 1998 (second half of 1998), rather than the first episodes that had all been done by women). According to the opening statistics that make Rabbit Fever sound like a soft porn movie, we are treated to a tide of predictable sketches with real and imaginary characters in a crazy world with women's addiction to solitary pleasure. <br /> <br /> Men, as Germaine Greer arrogantly explains, have invented a women's gadget that makes men superfluous in the bedroom. The Rabbit vibrator (which, according to some statistics, accounts for about a quarter of all vibratory sales) is so called because of long ears resembling rabbits that vibrate to stimulate the clitoris, while rotating beads inside the stem stimulates the inside of the vagina. The film interviews characters who frequent anonymous rabbits to help them overcome their "addiction", as well as famous personalities such as Tom Conti posing as a teacher or Richard Branson (among rabbits scenes banned on the plane) ) Saying that he would like to offer free rabbits to his first class passengers and finally to all. <br /> <br /> The main weakness of the film is that the idea is not enough to maintain 85 minutes of cinema, the sketches have no writing. The abilities of Charlotte Church or Ricky Gervais to make them quite funny and, although it can make television late at night, has no hook to get people to queue in front of public multiplexes to watch jokes about masturbation. <br /> <br /> Lines like: "It's been almost a week since you used your rabbit - how are you doing?" wear rather thin after five minutes. The film is based on the idea that the mere mention of the word "rabbit" will make you laugh. . . and another, and another. Frantic midnight drives to buy batteries may seem like fun in real life, but here they look rather laborious, and the special emergency delivery service exceeds its reception. <br /> <br /> Strangely, the BBFC awarded her a certificate of 18 despite the zero violence, virtually no explicit sex, and the less "perverse" sexual references than any humorous late-night show. The company protested the decision, but the BBFC did not move. At first glance, this seems exaggerated on their part and their advice to the consumer simply states: "Contains strong and frequent sexual references". One might think that young people would find jokes about masturbation more fun than the most desperate evenings, and that they deserve to be debated; but Rabbit Fever does not even have the saving grace of a balanced approach to its subject. <br /> <br /> The best part is probably Ruocco's The Rabbit Song (which plays in the movie Thumper band). For those who have fallen asleep and woke up in the end credits, there is a bonus scene at the end to reassure them that they have not missed anything.
