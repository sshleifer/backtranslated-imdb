I may be just a simple person, but I prefer movies that make me think of others. I do not care about anyone in this movie. It was supposed to be a comedy? Maybe the humor was too subtle for me (up to the nanometer level). The problem is that he missed so many things. There were characters who could have been funny, but they were not. There were characters you could have loved, but you did not do it. For example, the guy who thought the Beatles had stolen his songs. There was so much potential there, but all he did was talk like a Beatle and complain about how they scammed him. Haha. And the previous poster spoke of the scene "I am the walrus" as if it were special. What? He played "I'm Walrus" on an old piano and sang fake. Is there a joke inside? It stinks at first sight. This film gives me the impression of a film that people say they like, because it sounds "intellectual" or "trendy" to say that you like it, that you receive all the metaphysical message art / garbage of the artist. If you want to entertain, stay away.
