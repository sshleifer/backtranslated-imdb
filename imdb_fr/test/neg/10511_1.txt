We are in 2005, my friends ... an era of amazing special effects and technology. So, why could not we see a movie a little more thought than this lame film at a low budget. I've seen a lot of low-budget films that jostle me, but this one ... it's almost like trying to be awful. Just ... do not ... look. I can look beyond the lack of special effects and computer-generated scenes if the acting game itself was at least good. I feel like a little kid has produced all this movie. There is not even an original plot. Vampire Assassins is in itself a big intrigue hole with an attempt to make fun of itself. Can anyone tell me if, perhaps, it was conceived as a comedy movie and I did not know it? That makes me think, what's next for us who loved the first payment so much?
