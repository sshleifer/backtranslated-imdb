You get an hour and a half of braindead I have to save the action of the whole world, a doubled and a woman somewhere in the equation. This time, he plays a guy who helps people in the witness protection program. quote the cover of the film. It erases their past to save their future. Woppi, it must be cool :) I bet young people will love, but it's a bit too much for my taste. And the linings are really something else, and I'm not saying that in a good way. After killing a crocodile, he manages to say. "You are a baggage" If you are in a good mood, you can enjoy the movie. And as for the action braindead, it's not very serious. But almost before the movie starts, you know exactly what's going to happen. But if you like this kind of movies, you'll probably enjoy this one. I note this movie 4
