Maybe it's unfair for me to see this movie again because I left well before the end. It's strange, because I usually like Shakespeare on the screen and the dream of A Midsummer Night's Dream, many years ago, when I saw it on stage. twerp with the Shakespearean name, Calista Flockhart and Michelle Feiffer sitting in a giant shell. Well, I guess you could say it's supposed to be a comedy - but when the scenery is funny and the actors are not, I'd say we have a bad movie in our hands ...
