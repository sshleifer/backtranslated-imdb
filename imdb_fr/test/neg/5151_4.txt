No, it's just a cheap 1940s series that uses the good name of Cape Town. If you are a fan of comics, you will be greatly disappointed. They radically changed the character. No shield, no Bucky, no fight against the Nazis, no wings on the side of his mask and more importantly: Captain America is now a prosecutor and is no longer a GI. <br /> <br /> Dick Purcell as Captain America? Do not look too closely when he changes his costume. It's pretty obvious he was not in the best shape when he did this series (can you say flabby?). It is also very obvious that a stuntman performs most of the action here. Almost every chapter has a mandatory fist fight that is shot and executed in exactly the same way. The villain is rather bland and although he uses a pseudonym (The Scarab), he wears no disguise. The story is repetitive and very simple. The effects are laughable and the action is average. On the positive side, we have the sexy Lorna Gray as assistant to the DA and the good captain can drive on a cool bike in a first chapter. Overall OK but nothing special.
