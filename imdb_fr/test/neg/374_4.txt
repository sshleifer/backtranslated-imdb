Although the story is good and represents what I expected from Sam Elliot, my DVD copy contained almost unbearable timing issues. The dialogue was almost 3 seconds behind the movement of the lips throughout the film. <br /> <br /> I would be very careful when buying a DVD of the film without checking the problem. <br /> <br /> I would also follow the recommended classifications of censors, especially with regard to language and drug use. <br /> <br /> This film could become a silent classic detective film. With the aforementioned warnings, I can recommend it to potential viewers.
