I must say that I really liked UNDER SIEGE and HARD TO KILL. <br /> <br /> Watching Seagal practice his funny martial arts on people. <br /> <br /> I have always been eager to see Seagal-Movies and, unfortunately, I was initially disappointed by GLIMMER MAN, which I found really bad. FOREIGN is probably one of the worst Seagals to have acted. Horribly boring, poorly edited, bad soundtrack, etc.! Dear reader, indulge yourself and stay away! <br /> <br /> Honestly: stay away!
