Hey, I know Angel is not the kind of series that gives people a happy ending, and I know they could not make everything perfect, but I could not believe Angel's ending. I love the show, it's maybe the best show of all time. However, I really hated this ending, as well as all the way through the second half of Angel's Season 5 (similar to Buffy Season 7). The death of my favorite characters was rather useless and did nothing for the plot. Cordelia was one of the best characters in the series, and once she and Angel finally got together, she turned all the evil into a demon. I wanted so much to get her back, do not get me wrong, Cordelia's return episode is fantastic, but I was still very angry that she was gone. Then, was Fred dying just after she finally had Wesley? There was no sacrifice, it was useless, it was absolutely nothing for the plot, and the blue-haired demon girl is a frightful and useless character. They spent far too much around the end. Another big problem is that they have not connected the elements well enough. I know these guys on this black thorn wanted to provoke the apocalypse, but there was not even a fixed date for the intended time. The apocalypse should have been done and discovered throughout the season, instead of just mentioning that there are bad guys one hour before the end of the season. One of the biggest problems is that every character that the public cares about is dead or has nothing to live with. My three favorite characters are dead. Angel, Spike and Gunn (which I'm not sure will survive) have no office, have not even returned to their aid, are in the middle of a huge battle and have lost everyone who interested. Angel and Spike are never redeemed, they lose the girl that is close to their heart and almost everyone is dead, and they must always fight this strange evil army. I understand you never stop fighting, but it was stupid to finish him in the middle. Could there not have been some redemption, knowing that there would always be many more battles to come. I do not understand why this episode is so well rated, because I think Buffy's end was 10 times better and I was not even a giant fan of it. Why did they have to slide in the end, seasons 3 and 4 and the first half of five were so incredible, then they went to spoil the show.
