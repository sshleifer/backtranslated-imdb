This film takes up the plot behind the sci-fi film "Doppelganger" (an astronaut of our Earth who crashes on a "counter-earth" on the other side of the Sun and the totalitarian vibrations of the Cold War in this world) and tries to turn into a pilot for a television series. However, everything went off without a trace, and television is probably better for her. <br /> <br /> Here, everyone is perfectly up to "made for television". Cameron Mitchell achieves his usual strong performance. The same is true of Glenn Corbett (who seems to be a sort of John Saxon of the poor) who plays the robust individualist whose very existence threatens the founding of the "World Order" on Earth. <br /> <br /> But the small budget, the reduced energy consumption and the incoherent scenario as well as the lack of real imagination in the sets and the cinematography keep this adventure of science-fiction at the center of the ramp of launch. <br /> <br /> I will give an example: In the original model of this pilot ("Doppleganger"), the astronauts lose control of their landing vehicle during a storm and collapse in an order really dreadful (it was obvious that their ship will never fly again). Then the two astronauts leave smoking debris from their vehicle in the midst of rains and howling winds, to let themselves be shot down and overcome by men without a face screaming through loudspeakers. <br /> In "Stranded in Space", astronauts sit in their seats when the buzzer sounds, things start to shake and the camera gets confused (and as one friend pointed out, it was obvious that the actors were just shaking themselves in their seats, not even shaking the camera or camera). I have seen episodes of "The Twilight Zone" and "The Outer Limits" that have required more effort to create an ambiance and decor than this mediocrity designed for television. <br /> <br /> And, in essence, what is the problem with "Stranded In Space". No budget, no time, no imagination ... just make symbolic gestures hoping that the imagination and enthusiasm of fans of science fiction will fill the rest. Sorry, guys, it did not work. <br /> <br /> I'm sure everyone here just finished their work on this one and went away, and never thought about it except as a list on their resume. And that's what you, the viewer, will do. You'll remember, if you're in a hurry, that you've already watched a TV movie called "Stranded In Space", but that did not leave you with a lasting impression, and you can not remember it too much.
