... that you easily spot the biggest mistake of the movie. What was the motive? The details of the murders were used, but never explained. I guess the team has penetrated the atmosphere too much, which is great, but the story is definitely missing. There is no thread to follow. I suppose that if it had been done correctly, the film would have lasted a little longer, but it would have been worth it, at least for me. <br /> <br /> The cast is very good, I loved Wilson as a vulnerable Vicky. <br /> <br /> Not much more to say, really. But I really wish they were a little more focused on the less obvious. <br /> <br />
