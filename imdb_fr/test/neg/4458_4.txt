Being too young to have experienced Hammer movies when they were new and fresh, I discovered their sacred horror films as I find them on DVD. I know it was almost a decade and a half between them, but it's hard to see much of the magic of the original Hammer Dracula in this late entry to the Christopher Lee series. The original story of the vampire Hammer had a lot of atmosphere and a wonderful story in which to get involved. Lee was a great Dracula, a vibrant vampire if possible, at the beginning of his release, but here he is nothing more than a cardboard character that seems threatening. Fashionable young people speak like cartoon characters (even though my aunt lived in England in the 1970s and she says people actually talked with those terrible shots). I have no interest in knowing who lived or died among the younger crowd. They were all pretty terrible characters anyway. I enjoyed seeing a young and charismatic Caroline Munro; but she leaves history too soon. Lee and his historical foe Peter Cushing add an air of authenticity to the film but they can not draw blood from this empty film. It's D.O.A.
