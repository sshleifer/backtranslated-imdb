I recently saw a series of films about caving and this film managed to concoct all the worst aspects of this type of film. You get very little appreciation for the speleology or monster they face, while the characters are clich√©s (spiritual type, leader with tragedy in the recent past, etc.) and the end was just weak. It really bothered me that the director continues to shake the camera or show almost total darkness to create an atmosphere. I read that this film gave a real picture of caving and yes, I imagine that the caves are dark. Show almost total darkness during half of the movie really brought this home. I really enjoyed the "downhill" which, for my money, had better acting, showed tighter caving situations, better monsters and finished well. <br /> <br /> **** spoiler ****** <The monster turns out to be a guy whose plane crashed and the parents were killed, letting him grow up in the caves. He seems to have developed a super strength and speed, but why you never get interested - maybe the same force that has exhausted their torch batteries caused this, but during the movie, whenever someone is killed, you get the impression that something big with claws tears up every victim (see how much blood splashes the walls!) but in the end, it's just a guy with a fur draped over him and a mask? I would be ready to ignore it if large suspensions were reached, but that was hardly the case. Then he starts violating the last caving and the remaining credits ... Almost absurdly bad, I thought. Sometimes, a movie is so bad that you can enjoy it and maybe laugh, but this movie does not take itself too lightly. <br /> <br /> You looked at it, you can not take it out!
