I had to watch this movie during a cinema class, I suffered all the time. I am not Asian, but I am still very offended by this movie. The film is based on racism, minorities in general (Rex Harrison is not even Asian!) Are portrayed in a narrow way. The ban on film in Thailand illustrates the degree of inaccuracy and subjective representation of Asians. In addition, critical attention was given to Anna's biography. Many critics argue that Anna has added many fictitious events to her story to project herself satisfactorily. Some critics of the film and the biography even said that Anna had invented the whole story. A horrible film but good for discussing BioPics as a form of meta-narrative fiction rather than a non-fiction work.
