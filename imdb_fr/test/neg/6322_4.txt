The New York lawyer is plotting to get rid of his senile mother after meeting an attractive and available woman. Writer Robert Klane, who is adapting his own novel (the kind of paperback that kids would buy for dirty parties), does not seem to know about mental illness. George Segal - who in the 1960s played mainly in war and spy movies - had by this time become one of the greatest American comedians in the sad bag bag; his delirious reactions and nervous reactions compete with his mother's impenetrability. Segal is well associated with Trish Van Devere, and their moments of connection (although also played for laughter) are really the only sequences on which one can gravitate. Ruth Gordon, adorable as she is, is just too much around - and more of her is worth less. It's one of the worst directed and edited movies I've ever seen so-called professionals. Promising scenes that do not fully realize their effect are randomly disconnected from other endlessly moving moments, resulting in the self-destruction of the rude and wobbly film long before it is actually over. * 1/2 of ****
