As a documentary, this is laughable in the manner of a camper - a schlocky collection of recreated biblical paintings mixed with solemn interviews of so-called "experts". Think of it as a little business that pushes Jesus instead of the masters thighs. <br /> <br /> However, the detailed scene of the crucifixion is, in terms of historical precision, superior to similar scenes presented in Hollywood broad-screen extravagances such as "Ben-Hur", "King of Kings" and "The Greatest Ever Story". For example, rather than pulling all his cross on Golgotha, John Rubinstein simply carries his cross-bar attached to his shoulders and outstretched arms, the nails are not squeezed into his palms but through his wrists. not nailed separately but one is superimposed, so only one nail should be used Incidentally, the flogging of Rubinstein before his crucifixion is in 35th place in the book "Lash! The hundred big scenes of men whipped in the movies. "<br /> <br /> Of course, Rubinstein and the two thieves wear modest loincloths, which is probably not in keeping with the shameful reality of Roman crucifixions, but it must be taken into account.In a curious way, the "good" thief is positioned on the left hand of Jesus, which goes against a long tradition.The reason why this thief is played by a chubby man and overweight is however a mystery, especially as the "bad" thief is somehow a "handsome kid".
