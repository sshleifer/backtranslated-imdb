The film is a false representation of the way of life and orthodox practice. NEVER a Jewish court will impose a divorce between couples without children. Although the concept exists in Jewish law, the conditions are too numerous for it to occur. Childless couples struggle to cope in a community where children play a very important role in life, but they are nowhere "rejected" by their community as described in the film. They are treated with extreme sensitivity. In fact, many of the great rabbis have lived all their lives without children and have never contemplated divorce. <br /> <br /> The depiction of Yosef, a horrible human being, is supposed - perhaps unconsciously - to show the behavior of a typical male orthodox. In reality, it is also typical that a drunken violent rapist is typical of secular society. Both exist in their own worlds and are despicable. <br /> <br /> It is amazing that so many people are forming an opinion on a society based on a FILM (from an individual who favors a community). I have always thought that only the Orthodox, because of their narrow-mindedness and insular lifestyle, judged all lay people on the basis of the violence and immoral conduct they talk about in the newspapers or in the cinema .
