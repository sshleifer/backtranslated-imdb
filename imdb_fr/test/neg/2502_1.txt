Joe D'Amato might have made other remarkable films during his very long and prolific career - prolific, of course, in turn by making quality movies Z VERY cheap in the big boom of exploitation in the late 70s and early 70s in Italy - but Porno Holocaust is not one of them, or at least should not be. Certainly, I should not expect much from a movie that bears such a title, but I thought, on the back of the description of the box, that there could be fun horror scenes with the " cannibal zombie, horny, mutant and horny ". It turns out that the zombie only appears halfway through the movie, and we get at each turn a tattooed sex scene as hardcore as we can imagine. Which is fine. But it's not very nice, except in most cases "what kind is this BS". There is a laughable dialogue involving lobsters that cost more in Japan than by mail: in Paris, slender and hot women play biologists and zoologists who have sexual problems (leave the door open for rape and a sort of Bipolar enjoyment <br /> <br /> All this leads to the island, where "the main attraction" is a guy who, at first, only has to spend an absolutely pathetic time (forget ridiculous) to watch The newcomers in the radioactive desert of the Caribbean Island, and once revealed, have a face resembling that of the Jabba palace guards and a sweet potato as the main genital organ.But much dumber than before, this is the " relationship "which is established between the monster and a dark-skinned lady who has a disproportionate time to escape, but who sits there, face empty, because the monster brings gifts and for what must be an act of Exploitation A racial response from filmmakers, the monster ONLY rapes and kills white women, not her. And that ends of course with a happy end. I use quotes, of course, to make some kind of legitimate end appear. <br /> <br /> At the end of the day, it's NOT what you can expect, as it can be a bloody horror. A movie with a lot of Italian zombies monstrous but cool look devouring human flesh. If anything, the violence in the film is done on a shoe rope; a shot in the face is immediately cut in the bloody aftermath, which is like the consequences of a tomato hitting someone. So really, the last part of the title is more for the market. Yet, even as a porn movie, it does not have much to do if it is not a reason for the actors and the team to realize a paid vacation in the Caribbean (as suggested by an interview with George Eastman) . island). He got a hidden camera job and similar actors, filled with genitals about 3/4 of all time, synchro lip and music like Nino Rota, forced under the threat of a rifle to do something brisk in a brothel, and it is ALWAYS a piece of celluloid dung all the same; all this could be an immense guilty pleasure, but it is not the case.
