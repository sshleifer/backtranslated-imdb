This film is like many directors "fresh" (close-ups and concentration on the emotions experienced by actors). The point of the film was presented from several angles and well expressed by the relatively inexperienced cast. The goal being "Have faith in Jesus Christ and in the Mormane church" Oh, and if you read or hear anything that is contrary to the teachings of the Prophet, it is simply Haterade. (Fuel for hate)
