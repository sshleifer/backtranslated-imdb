I'm rarely motivated to write a review unless I'm inspired by the quality of the film. In the case of Comanche Moon, I was so uninspired that I felt the need to warn others of the seriousness of this mini-television series. Here are some thoughts. <br /> <br /> The Indians: They appeared like in a Saturday Night Live skit, mocking the way the Indians speak. When McMurtry writes a dialogue in his novels, he reads so interesting; I'm not sure how they ended up with what they had. <br /> <br /> Gus McCrae: It looks like Festus from the old Gunsmoke series. Playing is acceptable and Robert Duvall's McCrae manners are accurate, but the look is purely cowboy. <br /> <br /> Clara: Maybe you could use some dust or sweat for next time. Ever been to Austin in the summer before air conditioning? I promise you that women do not look like this. Do you think they have never seen an episode of Dearwood? <br /> <br /> Gov. Elisha Pease: Once again, every time they are in the governor's office, it's like a skit on Saturday night, and the skit is a bombing. <br /> <br /> Woodrow Call: Call is the most reasonable character, of course, he talks so little how can you screw up that? But hey, what about this hat? <br /> <br /> Blue Duck: See above and include the fact that it's not even a little scary. Javier Bardem should have played the role. <br /> <br /> The Rangers: right out of "O Brother, Where Art Thou", I was expecting George Cloony to come and see them and sing a song. Maybe I am premature because the miniseries are not over but I doubt if I look at them anyway. <br /> <br /> I would not expect anyone to be able to reproduce Lonesome Dove's thrilling sensation, but I'm looking at it and it seems they have no idea of ​​the old west.
