Imagine this: a high school. Except it's a boarding school and the kids do not have parents. Oh, and it's in Malibu. And the children are all thin, white and beautiful, with the exceptional minority of chips or the big child who plays the "weird" pariah. And there are no reasonable rules, such as cohabitation, nuclear weapons in dormitories, coffee kiosks, a sushi bar and a free laptop per student. <br /> <br /> Here is the story: A Zoey Brooks, a young girl, attends the PCA, a school once reserved for boys. Absolutely perfect in all areas, she is smart, pretty, slim, athletic, creative and everything a perfectionist wants to be. Almost every boy in school wants it and every girl wants to be her friend. She is the person to whom everyone speaks for advice, the one who saves the day with a simplistic plan and who is simply beautiful. Too bad, none of this makes her friendly. <br /> <br /> Are we supposed to believe that if we do not even get close to Zoey's perfection, we are bad people? In the series, nothing is his fault, and if someone contradicts it, he is described as the villain (Logan). He may be a fool, but at least he has a brain that thinks for himself instead of simply agreeing with the princess every time. <br /> <br /> His loyal group of blind followers are: Chase, the average ass mute who has a secret crush on her, Michael, the symbolic black (and the only decent actor on the set), Lola , a Wannabe and anorexic actress, a snobbish tanned head, Quinn, the clever but helpless teenage girl, and Logan, the rich idiot who has a sweet side. Yes, this show essentially spits out stereotypes. <br /> <br /> What bothers me, however, is that they are all trying to pretend to be normal children. They complain that Logan earns too much money when they have to work themselves, even if they are already in a boarding school too good to be true and have relatively beautiful things that many teenagers can not to afford. They drink coffee and eat sushi regularly, barely have homework and tan almost every day. Wow, they have trouble! Other problems? I am too handsome, rich and stress free! I guess Zoey 101 (what's the 101 for, anyway?) Is Nick's attempt to realistically represent teenagers. Except that they caught a glimpse of reality, did not like it, and decided to give children a life like donkeys on The Hills. <br /> <br /> But hey, at least, the decor is pretty.
