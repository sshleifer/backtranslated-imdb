This proves how awful the WB network was in the last years of its existence. As a student at home, I deplore this show of course for its ridiculous and obscure, obscure and not funny stereotypes, according to which children are "strange hippies who are so intelligent that they are far removed from the super cool students of high school. ". Sorry, TV writers, the world as it is perceived from the inside of your ass (which contains your head apparently when you wrote this show) is NOT the world that we, the talented people, see from our eyes while we live in a little thing called reality. As for those who really liked this show ... please, my dear Jesus, PLEASE rethink the statement that you really liked this shit during a very long walk. The actors play is even more hollow, fake and wooden than the stereotypes around which the show was built. Thank you WB for making the right choice and for putting this horse out of its suffering from beginning to end. This show would never, never have had the privilege to be made, having no less than eight terrible episodes. I really hope that these actors ended up having a clue and stopped playing roles in TV shows like this one at the end of it.
