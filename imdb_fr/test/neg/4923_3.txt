The fact that a film is on DVD does not guarantee that its quality is very good. The fact that the quality of a film is removed does not mean that you should not buy it. This notice actually applies to two paired movies on a single DVD. <br /> <br /> The plot of these films does not matter. They only interest Holmes movie collectors ?? Anyone who just wants some of the best deals would do well to buy Jeremy Brett's ones ?? or, strictly speaking, Basil Rathbone. There are some other very good Holmes movies featuring good actors on an ad hoc basis ?? like "Seven Percent Solution" or "Sherlock Holmes Private Life". In any case, these films are considerably less estimable. <br /> <br /> Here we have a pair of movies featuring some of Holmes' best actors, although the results tend to be disappointing. This seems to be the only disc on which these movies appear (although "Deadly Necklace") appears alone in the same version on other discs. <br /> <br /> "(Sherlock Holmes and) the Deadly Necklace" dates from 1962, although it does not look at it or ring. Some who have seen this may be surprised to learn that it was produced by Hammer Studios. It's not that Hammer did not produce really schlock stuff, but for Christopher Lee, they usually did a better job. The print is a direct transfer of a fairly worn 1: 1.33 copy in black and white. The color quality suggests that the original may have been in color, and the cut-away ends of the film's appearance suggest that it may have caused 1: 1.66 or more. <br /> <br /> The film takes place at the beginning of the 20th Century ?? not improbable, since Holmes was still working at the time (and did not really die until 1957). However, the script is not adapted from a real Doyle story. This is an Egyptian necklace and Professor Moriarty appears as a world-renowned archaeologist as well as the prince of crime. The plot is melodramatic and banal. <br /> <br /> The biggest flaw of this film is that ?? for any reason unfathomable ?? Hammer filmed it in Germany. It was nevertheless filmed in English. It was then dubbed in German and re-dubbed in English. So what you hear is not Lee or any of the other original actors, but a lot of unknowns? not that, besides Lee, I doubt anyone who knows any of the other actors. It's a shame, because Lee (see his "Dog of the Baskerville") makes a Holmes quite decent. In fact, his double voice is condescending and simple like a bread pudding without grapes or cinnamon. <br /> <br /> The music of this film is above all jazzy, in a possible attempt to become "a point". Too bad no one thought of ragtime. In the current state of things, music has nothing to do with what is happening on the screen and often comes up against the action. <br /> <br /> The other film is "(Sherlock Holmes and) the Speckled Band" from 1931, starring a young Raymond Massey. The quality of the image and sound is at the height of that of 1962, and actually a little better. Massey is a very respectable Holmes, although he certainly does not have the same role as Rathbone and Brett. Other actors involved in this production are unlikely to be of interest to modern readers. The game ?? as is the case of many films of this period ?? owes a lot to the post-Victorian scene and silent films. <br /> <br /> It should be noted that, although "The Deadly Necklace" is available on DVD only, "The Speckled Band" is only available with the old movie. <br /> <br /> There is very little to say about this film. The settings seem to be a strange combination of the 1890s (carriages) and the 1920s (electronic devices such as a primitive dictaphone). Taken together, it's an interesting curiosity and incentive enough to buy the DVD with the pairing rather than a DVD with "Deadly Necklace" only.
