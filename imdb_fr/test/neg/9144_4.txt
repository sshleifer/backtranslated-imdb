That's the answer. The question is: What is the only reason to watch this movie? I loved it in "My name is Julia Ross." It's one of the best black movies of all time. Black or whatever it's called, it's a very disturbing movie. <br /> <br /> She also has fun in one of the worst studio productions of all time. It would be "The guilt of Janet Ames." This one has a scary and promising title. He has a good cast. He has a good director. I was expecting something black. Maybe something a little tawdry. Instead, it's a routine spy movie without inspiration. It's pretty much a total boredom. At least it was for me. Ms. Foch is captivating. And that's about it.
