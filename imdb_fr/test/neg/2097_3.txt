Overall, it's a very bad movie. But for $ 5 at PathMark, it was not a total waste. <br /> <br /> The whole scenario concerns a guy who is with this lady infected with snakes, supposedly by a magic curse. The actors / actresses are not big names (even if some look like TV shows), so I will not do what I do with Troy McClure. <br /> <br /> For a moment, the film holds your interest. as the couple gets on a train and goes to LA to see a shaman cancel the curse. There are a few other intrigues going on too; like two women smuggling drugs. <br /> <br /> But the last 20 minutes turn out to be a total disappointment. As violent and bloody as the entire movie is, the grand finale is just totally computer-animated. <br /> <br /> I saw the unrated version that had a lot of language, blood, blood, violence, everything! The bonuses were OK. <br /> <br /> General Note: D-
