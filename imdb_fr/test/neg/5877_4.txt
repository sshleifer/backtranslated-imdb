You can see that if the film is not directed by his brother, that's what he can do best. And sad to say, his best does not cut him off. "Ice Cream Man" is a very weird horror movie, it's a real explosion to watch if you're in a good mood. In a bad mood, we know that people are violently attacking their loved ones. So be careful with caution. <br /> <br /> Clint Howard (if something really looks like Clint Howard?) "diabolical" "psychotic" "weird" (Yes, in quotation marks, he's not one of those, but he's in close proximity) An ice cream vendor, who tortures local children with explosive bombs that are really melting and ice cubes cut into humans and dogs in them. Ick. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the plot is just an excuse to show the ... well, the ... uh, well, it's a plot. Oh, wait, I know! It's an excuse to show all the cameos of the losers! There is Jan Michael Vincent and Lee Majors II (The sequel?) As cops in search of the elusive man, o Ice Cream. And even Doug Lleyweln appears as a supermarket employee. <br /> <br /> Better still, some of the bizarre blunders of the movie are. I really like the fact that, for some reason, instead of hiring a big actor to play the unfortunate "big kid" in the group, they just make that one kid dressed in stuffing under his clothes. And the principle that anyone would want to buy ice cream scoops from an ice cream vendor. Who buys ice cream scoops at the ice cream man? Then there is the whole scene of the psychiatry room, in which Jan Michael Vincent's play goes from slightly interested to bored beyond the state of consciousness. It's the cops who are also looking for clues in Ice Cream Man, but manage to hide the ice cream truck (where, of course, the different bodies are kept). Oh well, better luck for the troops next time. <br /> <br /> Howard himself exaggerates, as if to make sure that people in two cities farther away can see and hear him. It's just stupid. And enough fun to laugh in the beautiful tradition of Pumaman or Gymkata. You will have a good laugh with good sense of humor. I like that one. <br /> <br />
