Even the most ferocious fans of John Wayne will have to admit that this movie is a mess. Wayne's character, John Tobin, is after the gang that killed his parents, led by Pandro Zanti (Earl Dwire), half-white and half-Apache, posing as a Mexican. <br /> <br /> There are almost too many stupid plot points to count, but the ones that stand out include Sheriff Williams (Jack Rockwell) handcuffing a Zanti captured around his boot, so all that Zanti must do to free himself is removed his boot! Tobin's friend Dusty (George pre-Gabby Hayes) takes a knife in the back and comes back as new for the rest of the story. In a chase scene, Tobin rides a plume of makeshift logs through a drain pan surrounded by log walls in the middle of a desert, and misses his mark, pursuing Zanti on foot in the desert. Zanti looks for relief and drinks in a pool of water, but OOPS !, he did not see the sign above the water point saying "Do not drink poison". As Zanti collapses, Tobin resumes his hunt from the rest of the gang and captures it by blowing up a rock wall that seals a secret passage in Dusty's cabin - what convenience. <br /> <br /> In the closing scene, we see the new sheriff Tobin on the phone talking to the new Mrs. Tobin (Sheila Terry), the daughter of Dusty, Ruby, who, earlier in the film, was a target of the kidnapping of Zanti's gang. Apparently, the studio was determined to ensure that the girl was present in virtually every film they made with him, because this type of ending is totally predictable for almost all Lone Star movies.
