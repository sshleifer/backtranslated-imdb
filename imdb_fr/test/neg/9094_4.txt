The icy and bloody story of a couple inheriting a 150-room Italian castle while continuing to mourn the loss of their young son. The couple's wedding seems to be on stones because of the car accident that took their son's life and made their daughter blind. When making an inventory of the castle for future sale, a hideous, tortured and deformed creature gets lost in the bowels of the twelfth century castle. Pretty gore with a great atmosphere of horror and some sexual connotations. With Jeffrey Combs, Barbara Crampton, Jessica Dollarhide and Elisabeth Kaza.
