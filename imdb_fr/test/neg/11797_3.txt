Obviously, someone was trying to capture the wave "Blair Witch". <br /> <br /> This film was designed like all the haunted "reality" shows that have been on television recently (and I must admit I'm having fun, but this movie is MUCH more beautiful!) The first three Quarters of the movie are probably filled with "participants" crossing the house, WHINING Leave me alone! Spending 10 minutes whining to get into the attic is not my idea of ​​a good time. All paranormal events are blatant configurations No string, but too perfectly photographed to be real The "participants" were not very nice either Two crazy guys who do not take it seriously, a girl who scares the fall of a hat and paranormal par excellence, does this become the "formula" of a ghost film cliché? <br /> <br /> I have to admit, the last 15 minutes were pure tension. took every ounce of tension in the film and stuck it in those 15 minutes. I admit that I spent this time pacing the kitchen. I really would not recommend this film to younger viewers, even if it is PG13. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for entertainment, if you do not take it seriously, you will have fun. of this film. There are tons of situations to make cracks! If you are looking for a nice story, look elsewhere;)
