There is not enough space to explain the many ways in which this movie is a disappointing mess. The stupid special effects and an incomprehensible plot are the least of the problems of this film. The film seems to have been designed in the mid-eighties and can not be cooked until it can finally be made in the early nineties. The mule-headed "hero" (with the three-day-old "Miami Vice" shadow beard), the ham fist strikes Ronald Reagan, it would be funny if it did not take itself so seriously. As it stands, the film is just pathetic. In fact, I'm sorry for the poor actresses who ruined their nude scenes in this dreadful movie.
