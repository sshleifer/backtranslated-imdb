Personally, I have not really benefited much from THE ACT TO SEE YOUR EYES. I noticed a lot of critics who are very appreciated here for the film, and I'm a bit surprised. Maybe I missed something that other commentators thought "moved", but I found the film rather tedious and fundamentally useless. <br /> <br /> "The action" of the film is a series of autopsy sequences filmed in an "art-house" - a lot of close-ups, strange editions, etc ... and without sound or dialogue <br /> <br /> I guess seeing with your own eyes could be considered a study of human anatomy, or maybe (if you really want to dig a little) a comment on the fragility of mankind or anything - but I personally found it was a bunch of semi-interesting but ultimately boring autopsy sequences, so if that's your thing, then it will be a winner for you. I've seen more interesting images of urgency, it's not a "bad" film, because it's not really a "film" in the traditional sense of the word - I have not found anything really remarkable - 4/10.
