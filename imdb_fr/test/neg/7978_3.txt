Geesh, I've never, ever, ever thought of writing the four words above. But, in reality, she is the culmination of this little movie. <br /> <br /> As the movie was packed when I rented it, it's supposedly a comedy about a girl who has been kidnapped but does not have her medication. stable guard. It looked like a cute concept. For years, everything we saw from Spelling was Donna Martin in 90210 and an endless parade of dull and lifeless TV movies. It seemed like a chance for her to stretch a bit, and considering the success of her movie on TV and her rich dad, she had no financial reason to make this movie. So I thought she was playing the role because it's budget jewel. <br /> <br /> False. <br /> <br /> Instead, Spelling's role is limited, and the subject of the victim of an unbalanced mental kidnapping is just one of many scenarios. When she's not on the screen, the movie crawls so badly that I could have sworn it was longer than the 85 minutes that were listed on the tape. It would have worked so much better if Spelling's story had been dominant and if it had been turned into a romantic comedy with her and Phil, the least irritating kidnapper.
