Lead director / actor Dutcher marvels at this wild-eyed movie, in which he tries to win acceptance of the world for tarnishing the otherwise optimistic world of Mormon missionaries. Some of the actors are right. But some roles are unrealistic, such as threatening (rather than fatherly) mission president, etc. from him, in terms of being optimistic, coherent and inspired. The only inspiration I see in this film is Dutcher's personal inspiration. The film is slow and boring, and the filming and screenplay look like a student project.
