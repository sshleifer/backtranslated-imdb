Seriously, I can not imagine how anyone could find anything flattering to say about this movie, let alone find in itself the praiseworthy compliments contained in this comment section. How many methamphetamines was Bogdonovitch exhibited during the filming of this film? Did he give a bonus to the actor who spit out his lines with the greatest speed and the least inflection or thought? The dialogue is bad, the plot atrocious, even for a "ball comedy", and claims that the film is a tribute to classic comedy, it's the most stupid thing I've ever heard. Cinematography is inferior to the quality and innovation of the one presented by the worst TV movies, the acting is horrible (although I feel that the fault lies entirely with the director) and, I mentioned that the direction is so random and impenetrable that it defies the definition of the word? Everything is terribly unfriendly (even in the world very beleaguered of funny, funny nonsense), sucking of soul, waste of two hours of your life that you will never find again. Be afraid, be very afraid ...
