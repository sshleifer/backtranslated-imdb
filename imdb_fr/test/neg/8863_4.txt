It can hardly be called a good movie, in fact it's not even close. But I have to say that some things made me ... do not laugh, do not laugh, but something like that. The parody Resovoir Dogs is one of them. The rest is not important enough to remember. <br /> <br /> To be honest, I was a little disappointed by this movie. The plot seemed like an idea, but it quickly fell to the ground. Everything was too complicated and the actors were not good for the characters; most of them are simply overworked. There were also a lot of unessecary footage, it was a total waste of movie. I realize that it would shorten the film by about 20 minutes, but only to make it better. <br /> <br /> six toilet seats for this one.
