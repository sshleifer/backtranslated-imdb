"Northfork" is what is wrong with independent films. Despite all their harsh comments and ambitious plans, the studios do not want it, that's the sacrifice we make. For nearly two hours, I was subjected to the torture and pain of a film that starts wandering like a blind man in a new place and ends without covering new ground and dies happily. <br /> <br /> There are parallel stories that detail a dying city and a dying boy. Two men dressed in black (one of them, James Woods) must force the last inhabitants of Northfork to leave before the dam that opens and flood the city. The other story has a boy returned to the priest (Nick Nolte) who gave it to the parents. He is dying and is visited, I suppose, by angels. Among them Anthony Edwards with weird glasses and Daryl Hannah with a weird costume reminding me of Seinfeld's pirate shirt. <br /> <br /> Even if it is a "plot", it is not the purpose of the film. The film does not talk about anything. He does nothing, says nothing, goes nowhere and has nothing interesting to show. Perhaps by design, more likely as a consequence of the pretentious and surrealist, David Lynch wannabe - we are an important artistic film that you can not see - the style of achievement. The entire film is filtered through a dark gray background that corresponds, I suppose, to a film about death. Instead, it makes the movie much more difficult to watch. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a movie about men in black, watch either the "Men in Black" movies, not too impressive, but compared to "Northfork". they are raised to the status of citizen Kane. If you want to see a film about a dying person, look at "Lorenzo's oil". If you want to see a film that has the destruction of a city by water, look at "O Brother, Where Art Thou?" If you want to watch a movie better than "Northfork", there are hundreds. If you want to watch a movie that is worse, there is only a handful. 0 * on ****
