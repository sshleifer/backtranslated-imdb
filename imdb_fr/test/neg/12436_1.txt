Listen, do not get me wrong, I love independent movies, but COME ON! I could hardly sit without wanting to kill myself. the director had absolutely no talent and he turned a thing that could have been acceptable into a damn nightmare. I am passionate about punk and even the music is nil. the acting was nil. <br /> <br /> I'm usually a bleeding heart for these low budget movies, but this one, this one did not even try. Please do not waste your precious time and money. I'm sorry for being so hard but go! he trailed and again and again and again. Do you remember when the kids attended this party with the weird cupcakes and the watermelon martinis? how did they mix? It made me frustrated to see how they could go wherever they wanted and get in trouble, have sex and a "serious conversation" with whom they wanted. I know I stammer but my mind buzzes with all that I hate about this movie.
