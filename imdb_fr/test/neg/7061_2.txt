The gypsy, played by Myrna Loy, enters a happy home. With his incredibly wild hair and his very sharp and weird voice, it's hard to believe it's Loy !! She has no resemblance to the refined and entertaining character Nora Charles with whom she played in Thin Man's films. Instead, she over-acts so much that you almost expect her to be in an Ed Wood movie. What a huge difference a few years have made in the quality films she has achieved as well as her acting ability !! In addition to the horribly stupid character, the film also fails, because it is neither interesting nor exciting, but very, very stupid and stupid. The audio system of Vitaphone is the only asset of this device. It makes the sound quality of this turkey one of the best of 1929. Heck, it was even better than most movies of 1930. The sound technician has at least something to be proud of all the others, forget it . <br /> <br /> This is a movie that even the animator of Turner Classic Movies called "guilty pleasure" because the movie is so bad! And, after seeing it, I do not agree ... slightly. The movie is just bad.
