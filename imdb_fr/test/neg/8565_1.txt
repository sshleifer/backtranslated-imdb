Well, first of all, excuse me from the lame word game in the title. I was looking for movies to rent the other day and I saw that. I heard something about it, so I picked it up, looked in the back and there was a short introduction to John Fallon's AKA Arrow in the Head! At that moment, I thought, "Well, if he loves her, I have to love him!" So I rented it and I finally got to watch it last night (college keeps me so busy). Oh, and maybe I'd like to add that I read a bit of Arrow's review and it turns out that on 4 stars he gave it a year and a half. So, my expectations of this film went from very high to doubtful. Well, after looking at this, I agree again with Arrow (and it turns out that the quote from the review was the only positive thing he said about it!) Wow, this movie was Can he or what? Where do I start with why he did it? Well, the movie was so dull in my opinion. Even small pieces of cold blood did not excite me and when a decapitation does not excite you in a movie, it's a shame! The characters I hated a lot and from the beginning I could tell who would die and who would not die. In fact, the film proved to me that I was wrong at times, but the worst part is that a particular character I wanted to die did not do it! What the hell? And chemistry between the main girl and the guy she met? I did not feel it. Obviously, he was just there to spice him up and give him a love interest, otherwise I thought he was a loss! And as a horror fan, I should know that doing the "silly horror movie" sometimes has to happen, otherwise there would not be much of a movie, but these are disgusting to me! Hello? Why are you in the nun's room while you should be on the lookout for her? And that was done by supposedly smarter characters, not less. The twist ... oh, it would have been good, if it had not been done a billion times and I would not have had to go through this waste of film to reach this point! My main point: a stupid movie that sucked me up with a few words from my favorite movie critic (actually my only favorite). Jerks!
