Michael Allred's comic stories, especially his work on Madman, are usually very amusing. "Astroesque", Allred's independent budget film, is the opposite of fun. <br /> <br /> The worst acting game ever associated with a truly awful dialogue creates a brutal cinematic experience. Almost certain that Allred understands that WTF is happening, but he's the only one. It's not enough to look at the mess as a whole, but to focus on the mess. <br /> <br /> "Astroesque" is a kind of movie link with "Red Rocket" by Allred. 7 "cartoon, which, ironically, is mostly illegible, so if your experience" Astroesque "is not terrible enough, find without a doubt the oversized comics and keep having fun. <br /> < I'm sorry for Allred, who was completely out of it to try a movie.I also felt sorry for myself, what an incredible loss of time and money.Please buy my VHS copy, which is available now on eBay.
