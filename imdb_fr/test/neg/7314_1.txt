'Gross Misconduct' was one of a series of texts published in Australia in the early 1990s that explored the alleged victimization of the Male Heterosexual Privileged in the age of feminism. This creature only needs to watch Pretty Young Thing, he is accused of sexual harassment and his life is ruined. Damn the libbers of these women! Grrr ... <br /> <br /> As my tone suggests, I do not buy anything from this anti-feminist film and, therefore, I did not like this film. 'GM' trivializes the problems of sexual harassment and teacher-student relations. Sexual harassment here is the product of the imagination of a confused young woman and the professional boundaries that teachers are supposed to maintain ... well, when the teacher is a charming and charming family man (and played by Jimmy Smits!), It is useless. Do not worry about those. <br /> <br /> Sexist garbage, and even examining it, I leave them more time than it deserves.
