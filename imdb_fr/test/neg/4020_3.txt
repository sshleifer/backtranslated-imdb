This film wins its 3 points for its bad writing, its mediocre technical merit and its problems of continuity. Some people have given this film a 10 - and maybe it does not matter if you just mark it for its fun aspect. However, technically, it's an inept film series from start to finish - produced by screenwriters, actors, and third-rate teams. This was true of almost all serial publications, as they were designed as a low-face entertainment especially for children. And there is nothing wrong with that, but "great art" it is not! Spy Smasher gets a lower than average score compared to other serials because its quality is still inferior and its continuity issues are MAJOR, even for a series. It was common for a series to have a "cliff support" - that is, a moment at the end of the episode that gave the impression that the good guy would die but would miraculously survive early in the next episode . BUT, in this movie, it's a lot more hokier and ridiculous. You would literally see the hero die in the last episode, but in the next episode, they re-turned the scene and showed that he was NOT dying (although they clearly showed him to buy the farm in the last one) ! Again and again in SPY SMASHER, he seems to die, but in the next episode they show him from a different angle and he somehow avoided death - even if he fell to 1,500 feet in a river, fell in a circular saw or other. > <br /> Watch this film not for its quality, but for laughter or to learn what it looks like to go to the movies on Saturday morning several decades ago.
