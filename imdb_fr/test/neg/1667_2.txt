Tommy Lee Jones was the best Woodroe and no one can play against Woodroe F. Call better than him. Not only was he first and best, but he was the only person who could describe his grief and confusion. It was a bad disappointment and I am surprised to have even made it look. I can even start how sorry they are Woodroe I understand that he would be old at that time, but everyone knows he would NEVER let that destroy him. The first movie was the best and the only one I will ever watch. I hope that no other director intends to continue or remake the wonderful classic without Tommy or Duval. Without them, movies are a waste of time and money for everyone, including the director. IF YOU ARE PLANNING ANOTHER LONESOME DOVE OF ANY KIND, take mine and billions more, do not waste time. Continuing the movies only crushes the first in the ground. Thank you.
