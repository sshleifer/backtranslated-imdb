The original movie "Psycho" (1960) is widely regarded as Alfred Hitchcock's best work and is, in my opinion, one of the best films of all time. Therefore, the decision to film a remake shot is a bit confusing. <br /> <br /> The distribution in the original film was impeccable, the distribution of this remake had a lot to live. Vince Vaughn as Norman Bates was not a good choice for the lead role. He is too handsome and is not very convincing as Bates. I can imagine actors such as Mark Wahlberg or John Turturro doing a much better job in this role. Anne Heche as Marion Crane does an honorable job, but she is mentally compared to Janet Leigh. Julianne Moore is a much better actress than she shows here and Viggio Mortenson is content to review his role. The best of this new cast is William H. Macy as a private detective. <br /> <br /> Although director Gus Van Sant does an acceptable job, he can not create the suspense in the same way as Hitchcock. And why did he change the scene in the basement of the house? In the original, the atmosphere is dark, wet and closed, while in this version, it takes place in a very bright laboratory. And I think the black and white photography of the original has a definite advantage over the color version. <br /> <br /> Perhaps another flaw could be the fact that most moviegoers have seen the original and know what will happen and when. <br /> <br /> All I can say is that if it's not broken, do not fix it. <br /> <br />
