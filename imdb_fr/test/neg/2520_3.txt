I first heard about this film when Patton Oswalt spoke about it on his CD "Werewolves and Lollipops". He said it was a lost classic that is completely ridiculous. Being a dreadful movie lover, I knew I was going to feast on myself. <br /> <br /> This film is without a doubt one of the strangest I have ever seen. Certainly one of the strangest films of Shlock. Basically, a demon took human form years ago for a woman. This woman is dead or something, the demon has cried blood, the blood has fallen on the bed, the bed is now possessed and he is eating now. With fruits, flowers and chicken, it also has a taste for people. People can be horny teenagers, mayors, gangsters, maids or professional orgies throwers. There is also a sick guy that the bed has eaten but who has put his soul behind an image in the room. <br /> <br /> Most movies allow you to understand the plot through exciting action. The deathbed takes another path: it basically tells through the narrative what exactly happens while slow and boring murder scenes take place. In addition, I must say that everyone who eats in bed is surprisingly quiet. I would think that if a bed devoured you like a fifth-year science fair experiment, it would pique a bit. I guess nerve endings were only invented in about 1981. <br /> <br /> The story is crazy, the direction is slow and pretty awful, the sets are rare, the game is quite painful and the brother is one of the unintentionally ugly actors I have ever seen. Would probably make a good party movie if alcohol and smart assholes are involved. Certainly the one you should not miss.
