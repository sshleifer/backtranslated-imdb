Like the two previous films of "Mad Max", "Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome" does not escape violence and intrigue. Mad Max is in a post-war society where he must destroy the master blaster and bring the kids to "tomorrow tomorrow". This is usually a veiled film with references to Peter Pan and Tina Turner, methane pigs and strange characters. I was very bored looking at all this, and it offered me nothing. I did not feel inspired after watching this movie; the only decent thing about this movie was the extremely strange characters who were chosen in different ways throughout the film. It's too weird for me and it was way too boring.
