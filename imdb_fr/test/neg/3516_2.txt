In any case, this too simplistic script, with roughly one character, should not be interpreted as entertainment. In fact, you have enough material for an eighteen-minute short film, which would seriously reduce the length of your attention. Zero characters beyond Noble Willingham are developed. The endless closures of lips and phones are sleep-inducing, and the script is so undeveloped that the chimpanzee could have written it. In fact, all this sad should not have been filmed. A tape recording would have been more than enough to make you fall asleep. Certainly not recommended. - MERK
