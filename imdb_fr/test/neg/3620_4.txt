I will not lie and say that I do not watch the show - I do it. BUT he has many and many faults. 1) The boarding school is perfect. The drama is at a minimum. Everyone is so nice to you, you know. Lets give this a reality. It is IMPOSSIBLE that ALL schools are perfect like the PCA. Free laptops for everyone. Large dormitories. Mini refrigerators. If there was a school like this in real life, hardly anyone would be a virgin. Two, everyone is so rich, and it's strange that no one has stolen anything yet. 2) The characters really unrealistic. First of all, good spirits speak like them. They speak like a perfect teenager. Secondly, Logan Reese (Matthew Underwood) is an extremely rich "hot" teenager. My question is, why are not almost all the girls in this school all over him? He is rich and "hot" now one day all these girls would be after him, even if he was an idiot. In addition, Chase is the most stupid person of all time. He is this shy teenager who claims not to be in love with Zoey and overreacts to anything that involves Zoey. She must be blind to not see him in love with her. <br /> <br /> Come on Nick. I know you can do better than THAT. Please..
