Sensational. Not because of 3D imaging, which was sometimes used well to provide good deep images, but what a lame end! The end of the film seems to implode on itself. This film must be one of the craziest monsters of all time and one of the most pathetic attempts to explain it. The misogyny of this film is also painful. If you're looking for a bad 50s sci-fi movie (aka "forage bot"), go for it. Otherwise, look for better movies.
