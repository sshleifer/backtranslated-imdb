If you like watching movies because they are pretty, you should agree with this one. If you like watching movies that start with a good guy trying to catch a villain, then reveal clues to everyone's motivations throughout the movie, ignore it. At the end of the movie, I still did not know why Stargher had killed women the way he did. When organizing such a ritual serial killer, it would be nice to know where the rituals come from. In Dreams was a nice similar movie with a serial killer that was not the best either, but at least the why of his assassination was explained. They also alluded to a dark background for Vaughn's character but did not explain, did not really explain why Lopez's child psychologist was so much better suited to this task than the rest of the interviewees, did not did not give a lot of explanations. for the problem of the little child, etc. If the rest of the story is convincing, I do not care about the details, like how Stargher had offered all his sophisticated electronic equipment and underground chambers, or why the FBI did not check if he had any other property or had access to distant places while they waited to see if everything that was going on in the killer's mind would work, but I like to get an idea of ​​what motivates the serial killer in a killer movie about series when he kills in such a complex way.
