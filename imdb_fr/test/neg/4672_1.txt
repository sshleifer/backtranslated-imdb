I like action movies. I have a softspot for "B" movies with bad dialogue and wooden play. So I hurt the idea of ​​one of my guilty pleasures that was worse than this blockbuster. I can not have a hard time putting together a bigger piece of cr * p than this Bruce Willis vehicle. <br /> <br /> Armageddon is the story (and I use this term loosely) of a team of "Super-Drillers" "flying off to destroy an asteroid before it destroys Earth. "Not really, but who cares?" It's an action film, I do not blow up the scene. <br /> <br /> Minor devastators: <br /> <br /> The film begins by a few scenes designed to present the threat and the characters Bruce Willis is the leader of the team, who spends his first time on screen, stalking Ben Affleck with a gun for the unforgivable act to sleep with her daughter, for some reason it did not make me laugh, it was forced, like everything in this movie. <br /> <br /> The team is called because they are the only people all over the world to be able to pierce the asteroid Ok, I'm willing to accept this premise if it brings us to action - the so-called meat of the movie. of humor, each character coming out to do something crazy and nutty before flying off. Once again, lame. Finally, they take off. Here is where the movie really has me. They arrive on the rock and get to work. Would you believe that nothing is working properly and that everything is counting down !!! Whoah! Ten, nine, eight ... one - Oh surprise surprise, we still saved the day !! <br /> <br /> And do not even throw me on the camera's jerky shooting. When I saw him at the theater, I thought I was going to be sick. I can only assume that they were trying to hide the huge holes left by the tasteless performances by doing a different shot every few seconds (and that of a person raised on MTV - the attention is all by itself). <br /> <br /> Just when I thought it could not be worse ... wait - there's an end of tear made that was so stuck on it and that made the rest of the movie a Citizen Kane virtual. <br /> <br /> Summary: The words of mind were not spiritual. The plot - well, I said I'd let that one go. The game was bad. Really bad. Even Billy Bob could not go beyond the scenario, which was worse. Camerawork - again, bad. (I did not even mention the most stupid love scene in film history - think about pet biscuits). <br /> <br /> Rating: 1 out of 10. (I give half a point to Steve Buscemi, which makes me smile against my will and another point at a time where I was able to watch the beautiful Liv Tyler and try to ignore his performance) This is by far the worst movie I've seen at the theater. .. already.
