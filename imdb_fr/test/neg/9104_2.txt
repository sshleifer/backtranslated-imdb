This film was bad on many levels. The writing was horrible, so even the best actors could not have made this movie visible. It's a shame because they had good actors in this film. I mean, if anyone saw one of the Police Academy movies, you'd know that Steve Guttenberg was good. His character in this movie was very serious, which was a big difference from the characters I'd seen him play with before, so that was an advantage. And I thought Steve Guttenberg was extremely hot in this movie. With or without the shirt, you can not deny that he has a great body! Sexy face too. I loved the shadow look at 5 o'clock, it made it look dangerous. At part of the movie, he is lying in bed without his shirt and I must say that I would have jumped into it and tried not to forget his problems! So, honestly, I would watch this movie again just to fantasize!
