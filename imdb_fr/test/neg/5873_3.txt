I bought this movie at a thrift store. A few months ago, my friend told me about it when we were talking about silent films that we saw. Once I spotted the tape, I knew I had to have it. I watched it that night. I could say it was going to be very cheesy and cheap. . . That's what attracted me. I inserted it and laughed all the way. I recognized Gregory (the ice cream man), but I did not recognize his name and I could not remember where I had seen him. Later, while watching the Andy Griffith Show, Clint Howard (Ice Cream Man) was introduced as an extra, since he is the brother of Ron Howard (Opie Taylor). I saw the credits and I gasped. I turned to my mother, who was also watching the show, and said, "This is the ice cream man !!" She was panting too. This film is great, but only for laughing and criticizing. This is the perfect example of a horror movie with cheese. If you want to laugh and make fun of low budget movies, rent this video.
