Do not pay attention to the rave reviews of this movie here. It's Van Damme's worst film and one of the worst of any kind I've ever seen. It would appeal to someone who has no depth and needs nothing more than shots and explosions to be entertained. <br /> <br /> Seeing it's directed by Peter Hyams, I realized that Peter had no talent as a director, but is very good at filming explosions and the like. However, movies also need other elements. for example, a story. This one did not have any. This could explain the seriousness of some of Mr. Hyams' latest films, barely better than this one. <br /> <br /> One can not help but wonder how people were put behind a camera.
