I loved this movie when I was a teenager. I loved. He did not grow up with me, though. Perhaps it is due to the fact that it is a melodramatic load of old garbage, full of macho postures, cheese dialogues, excessive slo-mo and characters who say a lot "Good God". The lumpy narrative rolls without character from one character to another, from one intrigue to another, without ever putting everything in place, and the fact that William Baldwin's mono-expression of a performance is sufficiently wet for the fire is completely extinguished does not matter. excessive execution time. Robert DeNiro and Donald Sutherland are worth watching, but no one is really at their best here, and women are particularly thrifty. The only real impact comes from the impressive fire fighting sequences and the majestic Hans Zimmer score, which remains one of my favorites of all time.
