Maybe this movie was actually intended to be satire like "Airplane", but it failed as bad as that, just as it failed to become a "thriller". I do not understand why they could not have paid a few hundred dollars to a real pilot for a little technical advice. Hell, I would have done it for free! This magical aircraft managed to go from a 757 to a 767 to a 747 in an hour and the power levers worked back. And the dialogue seems to result from a phone game where everyone speaks different languages. In fact, I rewinded the TIVO and watched a portion of it a second time to see if it was as bad as I thought at first. It was.
