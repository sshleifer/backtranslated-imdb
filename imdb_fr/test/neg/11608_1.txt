This film is about pathetic, spoiled, ego-motivated winners who think they have something interesting to say, portrayed by pathetic, spoiled and ego-motivated winners who think they're interesting. Straight out of the coke filled gutters of New York's incestuous arty farty theatrical scene. <br /> <br /> The way so many viewers are led to believe that it carries a substance is a mystery to me. Maybe they secretly aspire to be part of this overpaid and overrated "guild of actors" or have never seen a movie worthy of the name? <br /> <br /> Get out, put your hands in the mud and find a real job. Otherwise, kill yourself with a real gun.
