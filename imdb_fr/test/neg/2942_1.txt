"The Twins Effect" is the worst movie I've seen! Not only the support is weak, but the characters too. I'm sorry to tell you, Edison fans, but Kazaf is by far the weakest vampire I've ever seen in my life. I'm sorry Edison; your role in this film was disappointing. Edison does not fight at all in this film and I'm sure if they did not have Kazaf in the movie, the plot would not be very different. The main plot of the film is not sufficiently explained and the whole film was too focused on the growing relationship between Helen and Kazaf. I mean, who the hell was Kazaf and why did they need his blood? Yes, it's the prince, is not it? So what? <br /> <br /> Some scenes from this movie were just stupid. Yeah, the action was great but the whole outline was stupid. In a scene towards the end, Duke Dekotes says that Kazaf is the strongest of his brothers ... Yeah, it seems that now that he is an adult. Why would you expect him to grow up to attack? Another scene was with Jackie Chan, one of my personal favorites. In the scene, Jackie asked Helen what creatures were following them persistently. How can you be so naive as not to know that they are vampires? People are dying around them with bite marks on their necks; surely the NEWS would be faster than you can say "Vampire". <br /> <br /> The characters were yet another mistake in the movie. Helen, played by Charlene Choi, is Kazaf's girlfriend. What kind of girl would not be afraid of vampires, especially if it's up to your brother to kill them? I can bet you that you would not find a girl as brave as Helen if you were looking for your whole life. Helen is boring, bitchy and is a queen of total drama in the movie. She tries too much to be different and ends up failing miserably. One of the strangest and most disturbing characters I have ever seen in a movie. Why would you want to bite someone's neck especially if you're not a vampire? It is very strange that his reaction to Kazaf's confession does not keep him quiet. Kazaf, played by Edison Chen, is another stupid character in the story. What a degradation for a young actor like himself to play in a film with such a badly constructed role. He does not defend himself throughout the film and does not fight. Although I'm a fan of Edison, I would not want a man who stays on the ground all the time. Gypsy and Reeve are my favorite characters in the movie. Their love is pure and sweet. Gypsy is beautiful and does not try too much like Helen. Reeve, played by Ekin Cheng, is wise and seems to be the only person who makes sense in the film. One plot failure was Reeve's death. The film had absolutely no substance and yet it was condemned by removing one of the only nice characters. Duke Dekotes was another character. The story did not focus much on him and therefore his desire to get Kazaf's "rock" seemed unimportant. <br /> <br /> It's very sad because towards the end of the film, I forced myself to watch because so desperately want to see Kazaf fight. The end was so abrupt because I expected so much that everything went well. Kazaf, who is the so-called vampire prince, does nothing for the film and I'm sure that if he was released, the film would not be very different. I highly recommend you NOT waste your time on this movie as I did. I was greatly disappointed. If you're looking for a good movie, why not watch "The Lord of the Rings" or "Pirates of the Caribbean?" Friendly characters with a well written plot.
