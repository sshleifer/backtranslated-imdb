I did not see or hear the original version. <br /> <br /> I'm not Russian, but I'm learning now. <br /> <br /> I also have no preference for Russia, Bulgaria or the United States. etc. <br /> <br /> But what I must mention is: <br /> <br /> In the German synchronization of the entire film, all Russians speak with a Russian accent. Americans speak "Hochdeutsch" (without accent)! I have never heard such nonsense! It's also boring. <br /> <br /> I hope the original will be better. <br /> <br /> The rest is a simple thriller, not really good ideas. Like a cheap version of a James Bond movie.
