My wife and I never got into the movie. We thought it was a way of sloooowwww and many subtitles. better.He never did yes, they had a hard time getting to America, but I wanted to see him pick up and find his father.Not at the end, but create a relationship. I know they do not do a lot of good movies today. I think action movies are the only ones to watch. I rented a lot of netflix and now, blockbuster, maybe 20% are worthy of seeing.I'm not kneeling realistically or just doing a movie thats fun and makes you feel good.Gary
