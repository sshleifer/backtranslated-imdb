If you plan to watch 'Partner' and read IMDb reviews, you've already lost too much time for this stupid, silly and awful movie. <br /> <br /> It's a horrible, horrible and horrible copy of the movie 'Hitch.' I chose to ignore all the other warnings and bad reviews that I had heard about this movie, and I lost 20 precious minutes - I thought that after all, it's David Dhawan who makes it, and it's Govinda - how bad can it be? But after 20 minutes of observation of this nonsense, I could not go, and I turned off my computer. <br /> <br /> All actors in the movie were overwhelmed, stupid dialogues, wasted time - I gave it a 1 star because it's the lowest you can do. If I could go lower, I would have given a score of -100.
