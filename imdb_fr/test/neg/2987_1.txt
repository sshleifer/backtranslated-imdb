I do not know how it was judged so high (5.8 at the time of writing), but this film was absolutely horrible. The acting was not entirely bad, but it had absolutely no interest and the overall quality was mediocre. It's obviously a movie B (or a C if such a thing exists) and it looks like it was shot during a weekend with friends or something. I'm all for low budget movies and I usually watch those I meet, but this one is really bad. I mean like "The Fanglys" bad. I do not know what else to say than to trust that because I'm really sitting through this horrible horrible film and I can spare you the effort ... Do not worry. Seriously ... Do not do it.
