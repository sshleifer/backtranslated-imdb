Honestly, I do not know where to start when I review a film as pathetic as Ernest Goes to Africa. Apart from two or three good laughs scattered throughout the film, this loss of an hour and a half of time and life is not positive. It is amazing that someone has managed to gather a group of people ready to play, film and edit this junk, and even more incredible that it is the eighth installment of the Ernest series. <br /> <br /> During the opening credits of the film, we see Ernest posing next to various African objects, such as wooden masks and African animal heads, making faces and gestures that would probably make laugh most grade 3 students. This opening scene gives the viewer a glimpse of Ernest's frequent attempts at humor and shows how his comedy falls flat in 95% of cases. <br /> <br /> The first thing that really struck me in this film is how much action is. Everyone in the movie is a typical C-movie actor, but Linda Kash is particularly terrible. It is the quintessence of the excessive act; all his lines are delivered with incredibly inhuman enthusiasm that you will only find in a college room. Most high school theater students would probably have been able to replace these actors and give a more powerful performance. Jim Varney displays at least some comic abilities from time to time, but for the majority of the movie, he behaves like a complete retard, trying to be humorous by making silly grimaces and speaking different voices. <br /> <br /> Ernest Goes to Africa begins in Africa, where an archaeologist stole two invaluable jewels from an African tribe. The gems then return to the United States, where we see an unidentified man fleeing several goons through a flea market. He hides them in a bucket of "two for a dollar" objects and then runs off the stage. Ernest is looking for a gift to buy for Rene, a waitress he likes, so he goes to the flea market and of course buys these priceless jewels. He then takes them home, paints them and sticks them to make a yo-yo. He gives Rene the yo-yo and explains that they can never be together because he is just an average, and that she wants a man of adventure. René and Ernest are found by the henchmen and are then taken to Africa to remain prisoners. <br /> <br /> Most of the film really does not make sense. Once in Africa, Ernest falls from the truck in which they transport him and lands in a river. In the next scene, we see him as a Hindu servant named "Hey You". His skin is dark and he wears a loincloth. At first, I thought Jim Varney was playing another role in the movie in addition to Ernest, but I immediately recognized Ernest's idiocy once Hey You started talking. <br /> <br /> Another scene that comes to mind is this: The scene of the car chase in the African wilderness is completely ridiculous. René and Ernest took the truck of an ostrich farmer and are pursued by the henchmen. Driving at about twenty kilometers an hour on a relatively straight road, the two henchmen shoot at Ernest, who is at the back of the ostrich farmer's truck. Ernest, on the other hand, throws ostrich eggs on the henchmen and their driver. The henchmen never hit Ernest during the five-minute chase, but Ernest manages to defend them by hitting them in the face, as well as their driver, which allows them to deviate from the road and explode in a giant column of smoke. I should also add that Ernest throws the eggs two at a time under a big bra. <br /> <br /> The scenography is also incredibly mediocre in this film. There is a large part of the film in which René and Ernest are walking in Africa, trying to find civilization. During their trek, we see them crossing fields and jungles, which could probably have been fired anywhere in the United States. The fields are simply grassy fields, with no indication of being near Africa (they may have at least digitally added African trees in the background), and the jungles look like the forests of rural Connecticut with paper mache skulls, vines, and thorns hanging from the trees. According to IMDb.com, the film was actually shot in South Africa, but I still would not believe it at all. <br /> <br /> The film continues, jokes Ernest after joke. The rest of the movie does not really make sense either; the African tribes all speak English for some reason, and Ernest is then invited to a "battle of the truth" by the main man, who is suddenly dressed in an outfit that looks like a ninja, but which looks a little like that of a submissive slave. . The henchman has before him a table of axes, swords, knives and masses, while Ernest has a table with a sandwich, a teddy bear and some other worthless items. However, Ernest wins the battle and ends up saving the situation. <br /> <br /> Overall, this film is painful to watch. I could not bear it in one sitting; I had to stop halfway and do something productive for a few hours to make up for the loss of brain cells while trying to appreciate Varney's humor. They should really put a general warning of the surgeon on the box to let people know that they will actually be a little more delayed at the end of the film. I must say that of all the films I have ever seen, none are as pitiful as Ernest Goes to Africa.
