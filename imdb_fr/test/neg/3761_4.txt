Although it can be VERY tedious, this movie is not really that bad. The acting is quite well done, even if stereotyped, and the production values ​​are quite high considering some of the science fiction movies that were to come later in the decade. <br /> <br /> My biggest problem with this movie are some of the very outdated characterizations in it. There is the Texas guy, the "professional" scientist, and the worst of any woman scientist who finally makes his wife. A film that seeks to make a statement about humanity loses some of its impact by reducing its characters through sexist stereotypes.
