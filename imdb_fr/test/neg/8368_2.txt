I'm a big fan of H. P. Lovecraft's books, and Mythos' background has spawned other pretty good stories and things like that. And in recent years, boys have made films about the work of H. P., ?? for the most part low budget movies ?? and showed them to audiences at places like the H. P. Lovecraft Film Festival. Now, as I said, most of them do not have much to say, but they know at least the heart and soul of Lovecrafts' work and movies like Cool Air. or "The Call of Cthulhu" - what I would like to think - gifts for fans and other loonies who love the creation of HP. <br /> <br /> And then there are people like Ivan Zuccon, who just ripped off the name and created a film that would have been fun to watch if I had made it myself and filmed with friends at the beach. That's what Mr. Zuccon seems to have done ... but although films like Aaron Vanek's or Bryan Moore's may not have moved any further, they still had more to offer, like a story. , real characters and some connection with Lovecraft! Names like "Nyarlathotep" or "Necronomicon" only make a film that is not an adaptation of Lovecraft. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this movie will not only thrill and hide the fans of Mythos, it will not please people who 1. like good movies, 2. mock bad movies, 3. like good C Upgrade movies or 4. look at everything that has Horror written on the DVD cover. I will not go into the "project" of this waste of time, as has already been discussed by others on this page, but as I said, Unknown Beyond is like a movie I would have composed with geeky friends .. Apart from that, he lacks ideas for any story and goes into ridiculous "silly-idiot-but-he-it-is-art-stuff". It's fun to watch self-made movies of this "quality" if you know all the types that make up it and do you see how XY spits the fake blood we made from old tomato sauce and other products ?? but hey, you do not put that in a DVD case, declare it as a real movie and you want money to win it? <br /> <br /> I give it 2/10 because of I do not know ?? effort or something like that
