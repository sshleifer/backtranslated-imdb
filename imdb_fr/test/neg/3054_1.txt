Dear friends, I have never seen a movie as trash as NIGHT OF THE DEMONS (1988). It seems that director Kevin Tenney intended to copy classics such as Sam Raimi's THE EVIL DEAD (1978) or George A. Romero's Return of the Living Living Dead of the same year. The cinematography was ugly, the film was very dark, so I had to adjust the brightness control to the maximum. Indeed, the horror images must be dark, but not like NIGHT OF THE DEMONS. The whole movie was ridiculous, no suspense, worse actors except Alvin Alexis in the role of Rodger and horrible makeup effects. An average vote of 5 stars for this film? I can not believe. Maybe the users were happy with the breasts, asses and pussies of the actresses, they were well worth 5 stars. Sincerely, Hans-Dieter
