It was without a doubt the worst movie I have ever seen. And that says a lot, because I saw my share of horrible movies. <br /> <br /> But I have never seen a film in which each character described was a loser without intelligence. Seriously, there was not a single respectable character in the entire script. As it was natural that the plot be so lame, without any intelligence. <br /> <br /> I can not believe that Keanu Reeves and Cameron Diaz even consent to participate in such stupidity. And even though I have not seen all their other films, I have always enjoyed their performances so far. It's not that the acting was bad, just the whole story was stupid.
