The only good thing about Problem Child's films was getting Amy Yasbeck and the late John Ritter together. Apart from that, the movies are as demonic as their hero. In this almost useless sequel, Ben (Ritter), freshly separated, and his little junior hero (Michael Oliver, who never needs to go on screen anymore) move into a new city infested with consenting singles. Ben eventually chooses Lawanda (played by SNL-er's most underused band, Laraine Newman), whose White DuBois tendencies do not suit Junior at all. To add to Junior's torture, it seems that this city already has a little more brio with Trixie, who has by chance a sweet single mother played by Yasbeck, the same actress who played the first horrible mother by the adoption of Junior. You can see where the plot goes from here. Looking for my favorite scene is like pulling teeth, so I guess I'm going to go with the gag "cherry bomb in the toilet" which makes James Tolkan of Back to the Future one of the many adult victims (this guy always plays with the authority of the school figures). Jack Warden and Gilbert Gottfried resume their role in the first film, but unfortunately, there is no appearance on the part of Bow-tie Klansmer, I mean Killer (Michael Richards) who made Problem Child all the more fun . On a serious note, I'm sure these films, whether they were seen by abusive parents or not, have worked wonders for the redheads of America. We also pay tribute to these proud American films for their tremendous promotion of adoption. Oh, and dog shit jokes - you need dog shit jokes ... Shmucks.
