This film is a perfect example of the fact that a film can not succeed with a high budget alone. It is obvious that a lot of time and effort has been devoted to this subject: the animation is fluid, detailed and superb; the soundtrack is not too memorable, except for Celine Dion's concluding song (at least I think she is). The score is a powerful full orchestral material. Congratulations to the animators and composers! 9/10. However, the story and the characters fall flat. It feels very 'past, done that', predictable and simply uninteresting. The characters have distinct personalities but nothing pleasant. They pissed me off endlessly. I really tried to like that, but I did not care about the story - it was an action-adventure plot shot. There were "jokes" that were not funny. It was predictable to vomit from beginning to end. The dialogue was clich√©d and awful - especially the last line "It's not ... it gives you wings, it's love!" Whatever it is, I remember having a recoil crisis. I wanted him to hurry up and finish. I was not the only one either - the people I went with thought it was boring. Please watch the movie Asterix and Cleopatra Obelix if you are going to watch a movie. It was a waste of time.
