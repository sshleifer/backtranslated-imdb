We are in the early morning of our discontent and some friends of mine and I just watched "The Wind". Really a disaster movie. Not in the sense that the forces of nature are wreaking havoc on an unsuspecting population, but rather on a horrible film that ravages an unsuspecting public. To show you how frustrating it was to watch this bomb, I'll give you an example from my first painful observation. If I am given the choice to watch this film a second time and boil myself, I am afraid to say that the choice would not be immediate. But instead of just saying "ad peliculam" with meager dubbed, I'll explain exactly why exactly my friends and I shot this particular movie. <br /> <br /> For starters, I like low budget horror movies. I even like artistic and low-budget horror movies. I liked "Cold Hearts", "Midnight Mass", "Jugular Wine", etc. Ambitious and daring films, even if they lacked production value, performance and even acting. In general, an interesting premise, an unusual camera technique or simply a scene or two well done can save a film a little rough. That said, I would like to say conclusively that I hated "The wind". <br /> <br /> The film was probably very disappointing in that it was incredibly frustrating to watch. From the actions of the main characters to the unfolding (?) From the plot, through the omens suggested by the opening that finally aspired to the dust (and did not even logically connect to what was happening in the rest of the film , and left the viewer, expecting something more, with a feeling of a lot of noise for nothing). The dialogue was at best irregular, delicately constructed and completely unrealistic. By this I mean that no one in any of the situations in which the characters were would have reacted in the same way as the characters or said the things they said in the way they said. There was a clear lack of vision and direction that would have corrected this problem. <br /> <br /> The interaction and the development of the characters were catastrophic. Claire, the "sex goddess lambent", or at least what the passive-aggressive luggers thought in the movie, was so obvious in her manipulations that she might as well have fired a weapon at the characters. Nevertheless, she was the highlight of the film. The other main characters (with the exception of Mick's Milfy Mom, which was not terrible) are so indistinct that they could have been described by the same actor as well. Let's see if anything escapes me: borderline personality, co-submissive minions with deep feelings of sexual confusion and inadequacy, fanned by fits of childish rage through the naive orchestrations of a loose-lipped, crimson-eyed, unruly, transformed into Caligari. No, I think it covers everything. <br /> <br /> Lack of reach was also problematic. How did those who participated in this film expect the casual viewer to know that this was the beginning of the end of the world of this pentagon of amateur lust, incredible and poorly represented (well, what would you call it?) largely in the woods in the middle of nowhere? There was no witness of the "atrocities" presented. There was no witness in the movie. <br /> <br /> The credibility issues associated with this lack of attention to detail were numerous, even from the moment the plot started to hurt. Case Point: If this guy, Bob, was going this way to get home from the gym and here's the key, **** every day ****, there's a good chance someone else it was later, while the writers were arguing about the crime scene. One would think that with the murder of a young man in the woods, it seemed that the city was boiling, that the characters would have been questioned, etc. But instead, there was no witness in sight (aside from Earl, the psychopath in the closet without inner monologue). We suggest that there are no witnesses * for * this film either. <br /> <br /> As for the almost homosexual meanders present, I have no problem with those either. It's not like they're a surprise, since we've been shouting at the status of most male characters since the second scene. Again, not problematic in itself, but thrown in for the wrong reasons. It was totally useless, thrown at the sheer value of "shock" and / or "dangerous art", and neither shocking nor dangerously artistic in every way. What we had instead was an awkward attempt to redeem a boring and awkward movie with a boring and clumsy conspiracy. The poorly evoked sexual tension, which only foreshadowed heaviness in the anticipation of this flabby scramble scene, has only pushed this film further from the "mediocrity that deserves criticism" to "suck so much film that it lacks privacy. thanks to sucking enough to make a good laugh and harangue. "<br /> <br /> So with most of the film, a lot of artistic groping, very little meat and a lot of aggravation, it's not that we do not get it. We've had it, all right, we just do not want it, look, the mere fact that we cheer the hype in the final scene as being the only thing that has meaning to it is an indication that Something was really wrong with this film, rather than moving forward as the name suggests, this film slides slowly forward, like the trail of sweat running down your nose when your hands are full. Argh: This feeling sums up pretty well the heartbreaking frustration of looking at this train wreck.With regard to this film, there is no breath of fresh air, there is only the stale miasma of bad ideas wrongly done. , rotting before being concretized.
