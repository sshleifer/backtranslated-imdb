I have to give this movie a 4 because of several things. <br /> <br /> 1. What I will call the "stupid victim syndrome". If you have the killer on the ground and you have his weapon, shoot him please. If you are a cop and your shotgun is aimed at the killer's back, please shoot him. <br /> <br /> 2. When you are in a high stress situation and you have your finger on the trigger of a gun, your first instinct is to squeeze. That's one of the first things they teach you about handgun training and why you're not pulling the trigger until you're ready to shoot - ask any hunter or infantryman. If you are electrocuted, your muscles must also contract, which forces you to squeeze your finger. <br /> <br /> 3. It is very difficult to lie on the floor for 8 hours without two other people, including a doctor, realizing that you are not dead. Especially if you are dying of a brain tumor and you were in the hospital a few months ago. <br /> <br /> 4. Technically, the killer actually killed one of his victims - the guy he injected with the poison that was to be given the antidote. If you poison someone, it's a murder. <br /> <br /> 5. What was Adam's lesson he was supposed to learn? Yes, the doctor had to be present, but what was Adam's crime? Maybe I just missed something. <br /> <br /> Aside from these things, I would have given this movie a higher rating. The plot was pretty good and the methods used by the killer to kill his victims were very inventive. I can even forgive the terrible behavior of the doctor: the scenes with his family were enough to make me sick. The cinematography and the soundtrack were very good, but the end seemed artificial and just did not work for me. Thank goodness, I did not have to pay to see this or I would have asked for a refund.
