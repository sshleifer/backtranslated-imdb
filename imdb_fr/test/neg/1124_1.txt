** WARNING ** MISERABLE FILM ** WARNING ** The day before Christmas Eve, a nut case decided that it would entertain us by sending this movie as "entertainment" on television. In the name of God, what did he think? <br /> <br /> This film is filled with terrible humor, abject actor play, ludicrous jokes and a planning disaster. Randy Quaid plays the silly role as cousin Eddie Johnson. Eddie is a brain dead person unable to perform the simplest tasks. He was fired because he was silly, but the company he was working for was sorry, so they sent him and his family on vacation. But, stupid as he is, he has managed to turn the holidays into disaster. <br /> <br /> All in all, this is the worst film I've seen, and I still have nightmares about the miserable game. the jokes even more miserable in this film. It's so sad that you almost have to see it ... But do not do it. The nightmares I do are far worse than any other nightmare you'll ever have. Believe me ... I hate this movie so badly because of acting, humor, jokes and history. The only good thing was the beautiful landscape. <br /> <br /> That's my opinion and I hope everyone will agree with me ...
