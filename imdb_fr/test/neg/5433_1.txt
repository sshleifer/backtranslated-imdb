If you can go through this film without laughing on the screen, you are a better spectator than me. <br /> <br /> Count out the logical errors, the common sense jumps and the stretching credibility ... need Betcha more than two hands! <br /> <br /> PS: If an extra movie uses a clearly UCLA place and claims it's a different university (in the case of this movie: Berkeley), I'll lose it.
