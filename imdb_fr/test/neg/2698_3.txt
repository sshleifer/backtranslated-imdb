In fact, I went through all the reviews in search of those who have awarded this film less than 5 stars. They were few and far between. Which is completely confusing! Yes, I know it's a Disney movie and it's not directed by Christopher Nolan, but God. It's a direct absurdity. They should have finished and animated the bloody thing. <br /> <br /> And what is even worse is the fact that IMDb does not let me just finish my speech there, because my opinion must be longer! <br /> <br /> The "awesome" camera shots in the game are literally taken from Tiger Woods on the PGA Tour Golf on the Playstation, the story unfolds like a sulky schoolboy, character development and multi-stranded intrigues paralyze weak configuration, and the grand finale is boring. <br /> <br /> Aside from that, it was really the greatest movie I've ever seen in my life. <br /> <br /> Good costumes, decors and authentic sports equipment. There, I said it.
