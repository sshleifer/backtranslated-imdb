The fact that this film was distributed free of charge by a certain national newspaper that I do not like, made me look at it to a certain extent, but as I had found a copy of the document, a local charity store was giving up for nothing I felt that I could look at him in all conscience. <br /> <br /> The film has its moments, the evocation of the location of Thameside is well done, but it suffers, in my opinion, some defects too. First, Vinnie Jones is just not convincing as a journalist. Although Vinnie himself is an interesting character, the truth is that he just does not have the ability to play a role like this. <br /> <br /> Second, who would take away with them a lost manuscript they were informed is "priceless"? It seemed that everywhere Mr. Jones went this manuscript went with him! Third, the whole aspect of Dickens' story, while seeming important, thwarts what might have been an interesting film about high-level corruption. Maybe I'm just a bit thick, but I really could not understand the interest of story style in the Dickens style. It adds nothing to the film and serves to confuse things only when modern history begins to become interesting. <br /> <br /> The only praise I'll give to the directors is that at least they tried something a little different. I am for independent British films that are trying to be "out of the left field", but it's not a "red road" or "This is England". What it is, it's a bit mess and too long. Yes, it's partly fun, but in the end, it's as if two films were merged to form a whole and failed in doing so. (Also, I can not help but think that I saw something similar having been done recently on television by Ian Banks, which takes place in Edinburgh with a story about Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, the creator of Sherlock Holmes).
