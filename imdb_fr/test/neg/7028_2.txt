This film could have been much better than it was if it had not been a Disney movie. I thought the girl playing Shirley was fine, you could tell she was really trying to do the job. The teenager Shirley Temple was not right at all. I think they should have spent the last time in their childhood, the first hour should have been devoted to the young Shirley, then the last hour should have been devoted to the old Shirley. It was a boring movie, and not a good story of Shirley Temple.
