Do not worry when you look at the DVD jacket, Sandra Bullock does not appear more than 5 minutes in this cult classic. The entertainment value here is very high. <br /> <br /> To name just a few of the many highlights to pay attention to: <br /> <br /> - The evil voices lined with the main villains - The special gun camera - The strange masks and killer outfits - The spectacular ways to catch a ball and touch the ground - The abundance of shots down - The flying scene in which Bullock falls unconscious in the street - The type too clich√© Italian Moe (LaMotta)) - The cheap synthesizer background music - The excessive fetish of hypnotizing guns <br /> <br /> And the last but not least: the super-cheeky fist fight scenes. I wish there were more ... <br /> <br /> An added bonus for the successful attempt to make me laugh out loud.
