I am a big fight. As a surrealist story, this film could have been awesome (as well as it is estimated by some here), but mixed with the role (director and loved ones playing major roles, for financial reasons, I think) found here. ..when calling this comedy is not just a part of that word, it gives it a new meaning! A whole new meaning! <br /> <br /> If you like surreal movies (I like a lot of them, see The Strange Circus, for example), you may be able to forget the flaws (see above) ) and enjoy it more. There are good ideas here, after all! Many great metaphors and ambiguous scenes, but looking at this (with a group of friends), we were almost all able to not stop laughing ... this is not the intention of the director of course! Again, everyone has their taste, as shown by the high score of this film, but I can not recommend it if you know the work of Alejandro Jodorowsky and / or he is one of his fans!
