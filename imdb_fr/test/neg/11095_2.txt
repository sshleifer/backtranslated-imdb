"An evil spirit seizes a girl and spreads panic in the Louvre Museum", that's all I think, the summary of the film and the film itself! I think it's one of the worst French or non-French films in the history of cinema! <br /> <br /> Nothing good here except the music (the credits only!), some tender moments of (Sophie Marceau), and of course the final shot of the film .. No because it puts an end to centuries of what seemed like countless years looking at That Crap, but also to be as perfect as a magic CGI job too good to be true here! <br /> <br /> By the way, I want to modify the summary of the plot so that it is as follows: "A perverse spirit seizes some film artists to make ugly films." Just like this one, for sure.
