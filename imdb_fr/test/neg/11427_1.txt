It's really one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. It's not funny at all. It simply describes a lower-class cadre in northern Britain. I find it's a very sad movie at times, at other times, the cuts should not be. One thing that really pissed me off was the close-up view of useless objects that really slowed down the pace of the movie. I only managed to get through the film because I had quickly advanced some sequences towards the end. <br /> <br /> This film completely loses public attention. Its main problem is that it creates multiple reasons for an action, which in turn tends to weaken that action. However, if there is a reason for an action, it makes her more passionate. Overall, this movie is everywhere. I have not learned enough about the characters to be interested in them because of intrigue and changing stories in which I might have enjoyed exploring a character's life. <br /> <br /> For example at the beginning A guy meets God at the bar, God seems to be a cool guy. The film could have worked out at that time and I think it would have been a lot funnier. <br /> <br /> Anyway, that's enough. Look at it if you want, but I warn you that this movie is shit. I respect the decision makers who have tried to succeed with such a small budget, but they could have done a much better job. I guess everything lies in the movement and editing of the camera, the acting is decent. But again, it's just my opinion.
