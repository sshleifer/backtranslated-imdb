This seems very difficult and condescending to a great extent. The whole plot is extremely forced - especially the "gallant" effort to save the college from ruin, and the moralistic harmony (especially of the main woman) bumps a little. <br /> <br /> But there are one or two comical moments that help relieve boredom and dancing is very fun (especially for alleged amateurs - ah ah ah!) <br /> </ br> > The shop owner and the young man who taps spectacularly have been a highlight. And I liked Peter Hayes's impressions of Charles Laughton and Ronald Coleman.
