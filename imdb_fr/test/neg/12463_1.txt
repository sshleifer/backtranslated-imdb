I only wish I had the good sense to turn off this movie at first, when I knew it was terrible. <br /> <br /> Instead, I gave him the benefit of the doubt and I waited for it to get better. <br /> <br /> Do not make the same mistake as me. <br /> <br /> The title has nothing to do with the movie. The film has nothing to do with the real world. The plot has nothing to do with a plot. The acting game is a guy who wants to be John Cusack, but can not cope. The main role is a girl who tries to be Claire Daines. Unfortunately, she can not remove that either. They are in love, though only God knows why. And in the end, I hoped that they would kill each other just so that I could believe that none of these children would defile the world again.
