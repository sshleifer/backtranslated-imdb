I rented the DVD in a video store, instead of reading the report. But that's about all that is needed as terror. <br /> <br /> Although the film may present information from the story in the drama, you speak for producers - there is no reference to the commission's report in the film. Not one. <br /> <br /> The acting game is pretty bad - just about all stereotypes of "hot shot", government agents have mouth silly mouth, everyone thinking to know more than everyone else. There may be some truth in all of this, but there really is a bad smell of Hollywood stereotype. <br /> <br /> The ratings and comments of the IMDb user community tend to be more real than fake, and I started to take a look at the ratings before renting whenever I can. <br /> <br /> I would like to have on this one.
