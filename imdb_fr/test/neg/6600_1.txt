I am speechless, honestly, I can not understand how anyone could have conceded to a scenario like this, cast anyone in the movie let alone direct it. The fact that I write this review is an insult to my fingers, this film should be thrown in the trash rather than being re-read. I am disappointed by Flex Alexander for even thinking of accepting such a lame excuse for a screenplay, let alone trying to play the role. OMG! I think I just insulted the word "try" ... um yes I did it. You know what, the less we say about this conduct without spirit, the better. You have been warned, no one has warned me that I have to live the horror myself. Look at your own risk.
