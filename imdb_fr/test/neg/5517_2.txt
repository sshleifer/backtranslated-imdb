If there was an EPA for the film, then this film would get their most sincere approval. If we recycle all our "material" to this point, we will never miss anything. <br /> <br /> It's funny to remember this movie when I saw Starwars I: The Phantom Menace for the first time. At least Lucas did not recycle his old footage. <br /> <br /> It's a failure. But it's a beautiful miss. Cute in spots (I liked when the kid said, "fucking rocks"). And, if you like explosions (even those that are recycled), you will be filled. <br /> <br /> In fact, for a film obviously "without budget", it's going pretty well. Playing is weak, but there is a bit of characterization here and there. The story is predictable, but it will guide you anyway. <br /> <br /> This is a film of the type "Everyone pursues the child" which will probably appeal to the youngest audience. I gave it a 2 out of 10. <br /> <br /> I dug up my old VHS copy of this movie. I do not think it's on DVD.
