This film is terrible. A true hockey fan should assume that the people who have played and produced this movie have never played or watched a real hockey game. I was hoping it would be a "guy movie", but the only people who would probably like this movie are women aged 13 to 17. The hockey scenes are terrible, the defenders play as if they were 5 years old, the goalkeepers are diving on throws 10 feet wide, etc. It's so hard to predict the end of this movie !! For those who saw it, who would have guessed ?? For those who have not seen it, do not waste your time! <br /> <br /> I understood it less than half of the film. Calling this movie a drama is ridiculous!
