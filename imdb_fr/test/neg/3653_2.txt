I was anxious to see this movie, it seemed that everyone who had seen it liked it. I was completely disappointed. The acting was so exaggerated. The script seemed to be as if the writer had collected 25 different movie scripts, randomly selected a dialogue and assembled them to form a plagiarized script. <br /> <br /> Spoilers: Have clich√©s been omitted from this movie? There had been an attack on the crowd, homosexuality, prostitution, a serial killer, a fire, many sponsorship godfathers, the main character in love with the prostitute, disguise, torture by the police, Hannibal style mutilations Lechter, I could go on and on. <br /> <br /> Line is like (the godfather wishes the prostitute) <br /> <br /> - "Ben senin arik calismani istemiyorum" (I do not want to work anymore) <br /> - "Ben calismasam kirayi kim odeyecek?" (Who would pay the rent if I was not working) <br /> <br /> Unrealistic scenes: we have never seen a single policeman during scenes of serial murders, yet when the main character is gone, his father was taken away by police and tortured for weeks. <br /> <br /> The only way for me to make sense of all this film is if the version I had of the scene had been modified very severely. I certainly will not recommend it and would love to discuss it further with anyone who wants to do it. <br /> <br />
