I enjoy movies of all kinds and qualities. Whether it's your typical Hollywood action film or your Oscar season film, movies that meet a certain standard will almost always be good for me. <br /> <br /> In Soap Girl, I received only confusion. We first meet Maya, a massage parlor worker who seems to be attracting all the salon guests. A virgin poet, Harry, arrives one day and they fall in love. After that, there are various twists in the plot that seem to lead to nothing. <br /> <br /> Although many have commented on the controversial issue of an Asian prostitute exploited by the white man, keep in mind that this film was directed by an Asian filmmaker who wanted to illuminate the issue. But no matter whether he succeeds or not, the issue is whether the film is enjoyable or not. <br /> <br /> For me, Soap Girl is not up to the standard I expect movies. It was hard for me to get involved emotionally in this movie, given the intrigue and the mediocre game. Worse, it seems that the director wanted to make a drama, while the tone falls back to comedy. <br /> <br /> A film like Soap Girl that does not trap me in the magic of cinema will always leave me bored. Throughout the movie, I could not help but think, "What is it really about?" A film must answer this question before it is created. Otherwise, you will get an empty attempt to captivate the audience. <br /> <br /> Grade: D + <br /> <br />
