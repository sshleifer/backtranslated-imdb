It's the worst movie I've ever seen, and the worst I'll probably see. I do not see the need to go back to what everyone else has said before, just be warned ... <br /> <br /> It's NOT one of those bad movies you think you want to watch Because you want to be able to do it's fun, it's just BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD. <br /> <br /> This film is equivalent to having a "pet" as a friend. You wait and wait and wait and wait and wait and wait and wait for something to happen. Unfortunately, this is never the case. At least, with a pet, you knew what you were doing. Lion's Gate completely deceives this bomb ... No ... it's a disaster. After watching this film, you would have sworn that George W. Bush had his hand on the making of this film ... yes, it's silly. <br /> <br /> Stay away, unless you just want to watch the worst movie of all time. It's probably how Lion's Gate thought he would make money with this piece of tripe.
