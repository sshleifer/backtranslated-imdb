According to most of my acquaintances who have seen this film and some critics I read, this film was supposed to be an extremely entertaining thriller to be seen by more people. I did not expect this film to blow me, but I certainly did not expect to find this film mediocre at best, and that's what it is. <br /> <br /> I'm no stranger to French films, which are both French and have studied as a student, so I'm aware of the clich√©s and twists of the intrigue that can pass unnoticed by the Anglo-American public. Some French films should have been broadcast internationally, but this is not one of them. <br /> <br /> For starters, the plot is both far-fetched, too complicated and too intelligent to be entertaining. you really feel every minute of his 2h and 5min race time and by the time everything is finally revealed, you do not worry about anything anymore. The main character himself lacks true charisma or even acting talent to keep your focus focused on him and his background at all times, even as you consider swallowing the twists and turns of the main storyline. he started to appear to you. that you have wasted your time! I actually remember turning off before the credits actually started after the film's reunion - that was the point I was sure I had almost lost my time passing. <br /> <br /> The film is not at all the worst thing I've seen but it seems completely overestimated. For example, I read somewhere that he was beating all Bourne Identity movies in terms of suspense or even having "wall-to-wall tension". I can say with certainty that some people tell stories about this boring movie. <br /> <br /> 4/10 is a generously considerate note for this film that I feel, and since then I have saved the 1, 2 and 3 for them.
