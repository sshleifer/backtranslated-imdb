Ok, here is a very short review: this movie was blown. I wish I could have just one criticism that states this simple principle, but I must bore you with more bad words like "horrible", "clich√©s" and "unstoppable". It's the type of movie you watch when you're drunk or stuck on a deserted island with nothing else to do. The premise is that the Vice President is captured by a terrorist group in a playoff game and only Van Damm can stop the madness. Really, really terrible, but again, I did not pay to see it the first time and only my father felt the lack of strap in his wallet after this film. I hate the fact that he is Republican and everyone, but again, he spared me the horror of paying for this waste. Okay, it's now enough space to be recognized as a criticism, so I say goodbye.
