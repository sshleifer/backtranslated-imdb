Because they all look at MST3K with their artificial friends who do not (usually) make such funny and obvious comments about the movies. And this is the only way for these people to watch them, then comment and reject them on IMDb simply based on that. They do not even try to watch the movie by itself. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie itself, I did not read the reviews first, I did not have people who said something to laugh, I just received the DVD ( bought for the opposite side Morons From Outer Space, an old teenager) and I watched <br /> <br /> I knew what I was in the Golan Globus movie, Albert Pyun, but it's usually very entertaining . <br /> <br /> The film is Alice, which tells the story of Rabbit-Hole, is so little stressful and whose basic structure is similar (but whose content is completely different) to Warlords of Atlantis, a another entertaining B movie. <br /> <br /> The voice was annoying, but it's the idea that they even evoke with a few lines in the film. <br /> <br /> The character of the hero has one of the worst voices / accents in the world. in English fi My story, but you are more and more numerous to accept and appreciate it. <br /> <br /> This is not a good movie, but it's not really a bad movie, it's just kind of a kind of B-Movie DTV movie, nothing new too exceptional, and would probably be more appreciated by a younger age group (eg 7-14 years old) than by me. It's a bit of a fancy light. <br /> <br /> Will I see it? again, probably not maybe about 10 years ago. <br /> <br /> Do not be so harsh with a movie, because some puppets have told you too, this movie is not taken seriously and it's certainly not Troll 2 or Space Mutiny.
