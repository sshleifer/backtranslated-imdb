I always liked the bill because of her script and her remarkable characters, but lately, I have the impression that she has turned into a kind of emotional soap. If you look at promotional images / posters of the bill, you will now see either two kissing / kissing agents, or having something to do with friendships while promotional images of the bill a long time ago would have shown a connection to the crime. This proves that the absolutely incredible police drama has changed a lot to become an ordinary television drama. When I look at it, I feel like watching a police version of Coronation Street or something similar. I have to say I still like the bill because I'm interested in police work and things like that, but I really miss the quality I missed. I want to rate it as 2 out of 10 because you have to admit that it was completely ruined by the people who took the note. <br /> <br /> Regarding the script and the characters they both came down, most of the big characters are gone now (although some still remain I think) and I'm not saying that the new characters are poor or anything because they are certainly not, it is simply that they lack aspects, personalities and difficult script lines All the old characters used to because most new characters are currently involved in silly relationships and family problems. <br /> <br /> All in all, this is one of the only police programs on television, The Bill This will always be a terribly interesting thing to watch, but as I said he has lost a lot of his uniqueness (if it's the correct spelling) and would now be classified as a terrible and unreal television soap. <br /> <br /> Recommended to look for a good laugh about the stupidity of the police involved - 2/10
