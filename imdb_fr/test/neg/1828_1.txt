Anatomy was a German-made film and subtitled.It was also too long and boring.If it was supposed to be a horror film, it failed miserably for me.The actors were following their pace and seemed more like to be somewhere else. the work of the film was correct, but more attention should have been paid to the terribly banal scenario. I did not pay anything to watch the video and I still feel wrong. Go read a book and save your money.
