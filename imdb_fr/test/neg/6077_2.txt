I am alarmed by the fact that people are not so critical of a job that deserves criticism. The many similarities, both structural and literal, with "Amadeus" apart from "Copying Beethoven" deliberately choose the easy way by placing the public before art. And therefore, deny the world insightful, intelligent and creative work. <br /> <br /> Now, consider the following: Is it not possible that the true story of the creation of the Ninth Symphony is truly an engaging and powerful story in itself and also in a dramatic narrative? Beethoven was completely deaf by the writing of the symphony ?? is not it more interesting? How was the symphony conducted? Would not it be great to know? So ask yourself what is the motivation of a filmmaker to present a woman as a copyist. If there was a copyist, he would definitely be a man. What was his story? (Please try to be a little critical here even if you like the invention of a female composer). <br /> <br /> Imagination should be much MORE than a distortion of reality to serve a writer's purpose. For those who compare and justify Anna Holtz's invention to the invention of Salieri's claim to have murdered Mozart in Amadeus, consider that he confesses to a priest in an insane asylum (Schaffer uses this device with a great influence in the film). "Copying Beethoven" might have worked if Anna was a product of Ludwig's feverish imagination. But we are supposed to believe that it is 'possible' ... Yes and that Strauss was helped by extraterrestrials. <br /> <br /> Most of the positive reviews I've read so far are often the expression of a DESIRE for the film to be good; almost a deliberate amnesia. Remember the movie for what you want it to be rather than for what it is. <br /> <br /> For those who believe that fantasy justifies the means, consider that you accept not only a lower interpretation of real events, but also that you sacrifice the truth for the sake of triviality. <br /> <br /> Finally, a short note on the acting game may surprise some of you. Ed Harris is not good like Ludwig Van Beethoven. Does it shock you? He looks clumsy throughout the film, a bit like a dressed-up yet casual actor standing at the dining table. Most of his lines are said to be clues rather than answers to Anna Holtz's lines (ie, he does not listen to the actor). He is very clearly an actor who pretends to be the character rather than the character. <br /> <br /> Really, how many times must Beethoven roll in his grave before everything is well understood? Ask yourself if Ludwig agrees.
