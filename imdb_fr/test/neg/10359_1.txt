I read the positive comments about this movie. I guess the people who were in this movie had to come to this site to do good press, because it was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I always watch the entire movie despite the quality or lack of which explains why I watched all this movie, but I do not think I laughed even once during the entire duration of this film. The jokes were generally very bad, but when the jokes had something promising, the delivery was canceled. If you liked it, maybe you should drop the buds because you have to preserve the 5 or 6 brain cells you have left. This film had a mediocre scenario, a bad acting, a bad staging, a weak plot ... nothing of virtue and was not entertaining. If you have not seen this movie, do not do it.
