But certainly a serious candidate for one of the 10 worst of all time. <br /> <br /> This DVD is cheap, with Sandra Bullock headlining the case. It's a misleading advertisement - it's on the screen for almost 10 minutes of the movie. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, there was no other selling point for this movie - the dialogue was horrible, the editing was apparently over. By someone who was attached to Quaaludes, the staging was ... well, let's just say that my 14 year old daughter could do better, but I hope she will never see such low praise. It is possible that the family cat could have done better. <br /> <br /> Sandra does a commendable job for a first film, even if she's on screen - and that's the only quality that redeems this movie. Stupid story, poorly written and transferred to the film as only a grade 7 media class should be able to do it. <br /> <br /> In short, it's horrible.
