[As a new resolution for this year 2005, I decided to write a comment for every film I saw at the movies (10%) or DVD (90%). <br /> <br /> I have to admit that DVDs have revolutionized this habit. For example, I can hear the true voice of casting, which is an essential trait of the personality. In my country, non-French films are doubled and we end up with aberrations: the French voice is terrible, very far from its original tone! the same voice for different people or the same person with different voices !!!! <br /> <br /> Well, if everyone found my comments useless, well, in 2006, I'll stop my criticism ... Ah, AH .... So, enjoy now! ! ] <br /> <br /> My summary means that history, places, distribution are not very nice ... <br /> <br /> Only .... <br /> <br /> > Sandra Bullock is there .. She is a talented actress, able to attract the spectator on the film .... <br /> <br /> It reminds a "fugitive" feminine .... So if you seek When you escape from your life, watching this movie only makes the situation worse because Sandra's life is messy .... <br /> <br /> She has nothing to keep, alone his poor mother (Who is sick of Alzheimer's ?: again the contact for depression) .... <br /> <br /> In fact, she has a sad life at the beginning of the film, a sad life while throughout this one, to finally come back to the end .. .. what a happy ending !!!! <br /> <br /> maybe the writers wanted to make a point about the life of a nerd .... <br /> <br /> far from the best computer movie of all time: * WARGAMES *
