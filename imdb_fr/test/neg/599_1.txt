I would have given LESS less than a rating of 1 if it was possible. The entire film should have been left on the floor of the editing room. What a waste of time, money and pathetic effort! Let's see ... get the prettiest cast that you can find (which of course is directly proportional to the amount of talent they lack) ... combine the thinnest plot you can dig up ... and l 'alto! An abominable waste on which the director and / or producer should be ashamed to put his name. How much worse can the kind of horror have? And do not use the "little budget" excuse ... I've seen a lot of BIG budget movies ... in fact, some of the best horror classics of all time were low budget. If you do not have the talent and ingenuity to make a good horror movie, then, for God's sake, do not do it at all !!!
