Unfortunately, it's not as good as all the other movies Jim Carrey (producer and star) and Brian Grazer have worked on together, but a few are definitely worth a visit. By and large, Dick Harper (Carrey) thinks he is being promoted to a better job. Until the business of Dynocorpe disappears and closes. Now, Dick and his wife Jane (TÃ©a Leoni), and their son of course, have money problems. No matter what they try, they can not get the kind of money they really want. So they start flying a few places. And then, they decide to rob the guy who prepared Dick, his ex-boss Jack McAllister (Alec Baldwin). I think the most laughable moments are when Carrey in the elevator sings "I think I can fly" and when he ties someone into a burglary and speaks with a voice changer (he looks like a poop robot). Okay!
