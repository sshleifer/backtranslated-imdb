This movie is one of the worst remakes I have ever seen in my life! The acting is laughable and Corman has not improved its piranhas since 1978. 90% of the special effects come from Piranha (1978), Up From The Depths (1979) and Humanoids From The Deep (1979). This gives Piranha II: The Spawning the appearance of which he is a part.
