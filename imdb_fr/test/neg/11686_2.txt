I had never written a comment on IMDb before, but it was so bad that it left me little choice but to warn you not to waste your time. As a passionate historian of the Second World War, I do not even know where to begin how historically inaccurate this film was. Rifles with bayonet horns from the Korean War, cleaning cords and the missing protective portholes of the K98k, German uniforms that did not exist, the list could be eternal. Let's add that it is full of defects, that it literally has neither plot nor culmination, and that it acts in equal measure with the theater of your local high school. The quintessence of cheese. <br /> <br /> PLEASE ... there are too many good movies from World War II to waste your time on this junk.
