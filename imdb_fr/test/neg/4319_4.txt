First, the current description of the IMDb plot seems to be misleading. The film is about a group of girls discovering a misogynist hitchhiker who plans to kill them all. They stop at a small motel, where he holds them hostage, but develops an intense attraction for one of the girls. The violence follows. <br /> <br /> I picked it up by mistake, thinking it was the other 2007 film, "The Hitcher". It's not that Hitcher is better, and I was still looking for a shabby movie, but it was sometimes almost unbearable. I think I could have thrown up on a piece of paper and come up with a better scenario than this one. <br /> <br /> I can not even count the number of movies I've seen with pretty much the same scenario. was almost painfully predictable at times, but what really made it awful were a few scenes that ... well, let me give you an example. At one point, a door is covered with blood (which is very obvious) and two policemen, at the scene after a call to 911, look at about thirty meters, see a man also covered in blood , go out. from the door, agree that this sounds suspicious, but decide not to investigate further. <br /> <br /> But, as ridiculous as it may be, the film has never been boring, has been well produced, directed and performed, complete with good special effects, free nudity and violence. I probably would not recommend spending 90 minutes of your life watching this movie, but it turned out that it was perfect to use while cleaning my basement. Also highly recommended to movie fans, it would be a good movie to watch with friends when you plan to talk more than watch.
