Lonesome Jim is a bit like a romantic black comedy about a dysfunctional family whose two boys are totally losers. Both boys are around 30 years old, live at home, with absolutely nothing for them. I live in the Midwest and I can not name a family like this. I chose it because I like the humor of Buscemi. Now, I realize that I need an agent countering humor to make it work. Actor and camera work and editing were good. The first 15 minutes allowed you to get ready, and the last 15 minutes helped prevent the film from being totally depressing for Jerry Springer. The female members of my family begged me to turn it off, but I assumed that there must be a turning point towards the end and we watched the entire movie. As expected, the male members of the family simply left after the first 30 minutes.
