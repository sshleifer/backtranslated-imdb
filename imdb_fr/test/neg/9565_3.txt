I praised this idea thinking it would be pretty good just on the cover of the movie. The judge and the jury started out as a very good killer chasing the man who killed his wife on a bicycle with a cool gun, but this film has become more and more stupid as time goes on. David Keith is a great actor, especially when he plays a role like this, too bad the movie was a shit, he really lost his talent. The judge and the jury were stupid. I gave a 3 should have given a 2, I gave him an extra star just because David Keith's gun was cool.
