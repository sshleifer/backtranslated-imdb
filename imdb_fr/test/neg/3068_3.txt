Recognizing the dinner photo on the cover of the DVD made me realize it was a local film. The word Detroit in the title reinforced my suspicions and I did some research. Yes, it was a local film. <br /> <br /> So I took it back. Someone I knew knew some producers / directors (I can not remember which one) and said that the producers / directors forced people to PAY to appear in this movie. <br /> <br /> Great! What a good idea. Filmmakers get funding to make the film, thanks to their actors and their team. Then the investors (actors, teams, others) get some of the profits, I guess. <br /> <br /> The profits! <br /> <br /> Uh, anyway. This film totally upset me. The special effects were special, as in the special children who took the small buses to go to school. The acting game was very entertaining, not intentionally though. There is a good line where a guy says "well, this bone is not going to smoke!" like a pickup line. Unfortunately, it's the only fun part of the whole movie. The story? Well, I followed him about three-fifths of my arrival, then everything stopped making sense and as we sat to watch him, it suddenly stopped. I mean like in, .. no resolution of anything .. as if they were running out of time. "Sorry, out of time, good night!" <br /> <br /> We sat there, puzzled and booed, and launched another movie. Then, about 20 minutes later, one of my neighbors showed up ... with one of the guys from the movie! We threw it in and he (the actor) gave us a comment in progress, which was great because he totally ripped on the movie! <br /> <br /> What more can you ask for? <br /> <br /> The most absurd scene for me was a motorcycle hunting scene where it was so dark that it could have been literally a guy running with a flashlight and not a motorcycle from all. That and the jaw that falls on your face suddenly ends, that's enough to make you scream. In pain! Zombies looked less like zombies than my colleagues. And I do not work at the morgue either. <br /> <br /> I recommend you to watch this if you can bring someone from the movie to comment on everything that happened behind the film. scenes and make sure that person hates the movie because it just adds to the fun. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, pass this one. Rent something like Feeders if you want a jaw dropping a funny movie ...
