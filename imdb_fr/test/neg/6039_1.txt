There is no worse criticism for a movie than the word BORING. <br /> <br /> Some "bad" movies are very funny, some "funny" are really bad, but being BORING means nobody will do it. Never forget to buy the DVD to watch it again and again. <br /> <br /> It seems to be a film using the Antarctic theater class. They were all too busy running to stay warm instead of acting. The main actor, spoke is a whisper almost, husky style voice, whore, it seemed he was going to seduce someone, and he was making fun of who. <br /> <br /> The film can not make money if it's boring, I hope it dies fast, never to be seen again, death.
