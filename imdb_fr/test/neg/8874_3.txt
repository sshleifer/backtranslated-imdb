This film may have historical significance, and it seems astonishing to see how the facts come together: the scenery, the rocket, the space suits, the surface of the moon, all shout "to a classic" - but ultimately the result is a pretty boring movie for the eyes of the day, and the tech scenes of the '50s that you could hope for in a film like this are by no means enough to reward you for going through all the insignificant dialogues and Predictable plot developments. The characters and plot may reward a sociological scientific analysis, but often have insufficient entertainment value. <br /> <br /> Much of this film seems to be a good movie for nine year olds. Mature themes, human drama and violence are also up for the children. <br /> <br /> The images of the Earth and Moon from space may be more accurate than those of "2001", but too bad if their use is dramatically ineffective. The year 2001 in particular may seem like a meditation stretched on the themes of this film, and has not Star Wars, in one way or another, modeled its opening titles parading in the past? space on the opening titles of this film? But again - the inheritance is marginal. <br /> <br /> If it's a true revolutionary and mega-influential 1950s science fiction classic you're looking for, check out "Forbidden Planet".
