I am one of those greedy punters when it comes to sitcoms these days, I will always check them from time to time. I observe that most of them are not very funny even those of the big networks who get high grades, I just do not understand who finds them overwhelming. Some made me smile, but none of them made me laugh. I usually change channels after a few minutes. Now on the FOX network, they produce new shows like changing underwear. For one reason or another, they think they can do a good sitcom, a fake fake fake fake. They beat the dead horse so much that he is about to hire everyone he can find to write a rotten pilot with a bad dialogue and send him away. Let's take a quick look at the last piece of junk that Fox produced called "The War at Home" <br /> <br /> I watched it for about 5 minutes and it was generous. In this episode in particular, the girl talks with her parents saying that I am an adult now. The father is tired of saying, "Okay, go ahead, do what you want, that's your problem." to which she answers "Well I guess you are crazy but good at least I did not have AIDS" (cue the trail of laughter, no way to make an audience without being paid to applaud such garbage) -J I found the crack of not having the AIDS to be so bad taste. Well, at least I do not have to look at this shit anymore. Take a clue, FOX, stop wasting your time with the sitcoms.OK you have the Simpsons, but he is now really old and tired.
