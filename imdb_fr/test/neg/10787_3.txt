I think the manuscript of this movie was written on toilet paper. No respect whatsoever to many important details that intrinsically make the film. For example, the names of some Serb terrorists (which I remember) are Caradan Maldic, Ivanic Loyvek and Leo Hasse. What kind of names are these? Certainly not Serbian! By the way, Caradan Maldic !!! What name, I laughed for days thinking about it. Probably an implication on Karadzic and Mladic. Secondly, the Serbs have never committed terrorism. A journalist like the main character should have known. Third, the actors who play the Serbian terrorists are not even Serbs and do not speak Serbo-Croat. All this aside, this film is solidly played, but the story is thin and full of holes. Sometimes it does not make sense !!!
