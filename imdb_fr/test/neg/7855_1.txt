I came across this film by chance and I would like not to have it. <br /> <br /> Why make a sexually brutal sequel (and sometimes gore when a man is beheaded) of a well-known children's movie. <br /> <Do not take young children to see that the title is fooling you, it has nothing to do with the original Snow White, other than stealing his characters. Better yet, do not bother, it's not worth it. <br /> <br /> I could not watch everything, the poor (compared to Disney), the cartoons graphics, and no plot except on how to totally ruin a classic movie made me want to give up and leave.
