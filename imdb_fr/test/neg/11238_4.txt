In London, the Venetian Carla Borin (Yuliya Mayarchuk) is looking for an apartment to share with her beloved boyfriend Matteo (Jarno Berardi). She meets lesbian real estate agent Moira (Francesca Nunzi) and rents a big apartment. When the jealous Matteo finds photos and letters from his former lover Bernard (Mauro Lorenz) in Venice, he hangs up and marvels and amoral Carla has a brief affair with Moira and relationships with an acquaintance in a party. When Matteo goes to London, he concludes that his thirst for Carla is more important than his jealousy and his behavior. <br /> <br /> "Transgredire" is another "soft porn" of the ill director Tinto Brass with ridiculous story where every situation is a motive to expose the private parts of the casting women. The amateur camera exposes the body of the beautiful Yuliya Mayarchuk from every possible angle and her character is abused, touched and licked in all parts of her pretty body, but without showing any explicit penetration. This movie is only recommended to this director's fans and to a voyeuristic experience that consists of seeing Yuliya Mayarchuk nude in erotic situations. My vote is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "A Pervertida" ("The pervert")
