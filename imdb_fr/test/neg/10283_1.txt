I think cheaters must stop broadcasting and end reality TV once and for all. No matter what everyone says, you can attack me or agree with me, but sometimes it's true that the show only propagates propaganda and the host. cheats Joey Greco is a little bastard who wants to think that showing people in front of a camera is effective and without knowing it no, it will show disgustingly that it is also the wiretapping and tracking of people by "cheaters spy's" is illegal and a federal offense that we live in a police state like the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany, I'm glad there is bad criticism on this basket, it must stop quickly, otherwise we will lose our freedoms as a nation, no wonder our country goes to hell because of this and other emissions of dirt, I prefer older shows of the years 1950-1980, I hope you all agree with me on this thank you, infowarrior
