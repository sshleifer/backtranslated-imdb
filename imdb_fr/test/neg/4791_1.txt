Have you seen all the great adventures of the past decades? If you do not mind because you've seen most of the scenes before - and I can guarantee you that these scenes were originally in much better movies. <br /> <br /> The story (I'm sure the real storytellers will never forgive me) is childish and stupid (stupid so to play it in a mortuary would result in a group of angry angry deaths) . Each character is based on a cliché and ... well, they are only the cliché. And yes, again, all you need to be a hero is to be American. <br /> <br /> At least in Finland, they announced it was the kind of film for which the DVD was designed. Maybe I should sell my player then ... <br /> <br /> 1/10
