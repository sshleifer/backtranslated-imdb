I must say that this movie was not what I expected. Even though I have not read in the book that plants can catch bait, then waiting for a massacre to happen before letting it hang over a corpse for lunch is the worst scenario anyone has imagined . With the ruins of the title, one would think that over 3000 years, a kind of deity, ancient animal or god would be the culprit. It's like another primitive movie where you might think it's something strange that villagers fear the most, but not a crocodile. Anyway, this film was like that, it makes you think about the ruins of Maya or Inca folklore that awoke and the old god or the people who had another program of sacrifice to do or whatever something like that But plants? ... Come on, is there anything else that producers can create to impress the crowd? Regarding this film, it will appear in no time on the list "b". I must say that some of the gores were excellent to watch, but they did not make up for the rest of the movie. And a plant imitating the sound of a cell phone or a popular voice is too hard to believe. I'm a fan of horror movies but I'm not a stereophonic fan who relies solely on gory or mechanical effects. I rely a lot on the suspense and what will be the next scene. The thing had a better story than this one. Even the ring blew me up for more, but the ruins are just that ..... ruined for using a plant to incite the victims to kill or be killed by the villagers. The principle was suitable for the villagers to keep him in check with salt. For example, a simple blowtorch and a lot of napalm can easily do the trick to end these boring plants with an eating disorder.
