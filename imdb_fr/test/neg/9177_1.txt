The only reason I bought this DVD is because Cynthia Rothrock is there. Now everyone knows she is the queen of martial arts movies. The problem is that it is not a martial arts movie. in this stupid movie. Now, if you were a filmmaker and had Cynthia Rothlock in your movie, would not you want to have a lot of martial action? all she does in this film is walking around, looking bored, like when I look at that pile of shit. I own a lot of his movies and they are all b-type movies are a martial arts fan avoid this no matter what I'm always angry, I lost 4 dollars to buy this DVD
