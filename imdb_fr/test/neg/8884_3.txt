I made here this movie was good from different people. In addition, I like Natalie Portman and Javier Bardem, as well as the director Milos Forman. Yet, after watching this movie, I really had nothing to admire about it. <br /> <br /> First of all, the acting was very much below average. The performances were simply not powerful enough to really feel shocked by what the inquisition had done. Javier Bardem gave a solid performance and was probably the only one to have had a Spanish accent. It is quite obvious that this Bardem was the only one. Natalie Portman, who I think is a very good actress and who comes does not really make me feel sorry for her torture. As in the movie, there was nothing to admire about his performance. Stellan Skarsgaard, whom I like, gave a very average performance, like the other actors, a boring performance. This film essentially spoke about him since he plays the role of Goya. Yet he did not become what he had to be to make this film good. What about Randy Quaid? You just made fun of me. He playing King Carlos IV. Look, he's great in comedies, but he's playing a king that describes the whole movie for you. <br /> <br /> The realization was horrible in this movie. When a movie is messy, there are usually two people to blame for it: the director and the writer. I have the impression that Milos Forman really did not want his actors to focus on Spanish. Very rare fight scenes here, they have all been horribly exposed. In addition, as a director, he must give you the sense of shock of what the inquisition has done. After this film, I felt that I could neglect this event. To summarize, he went wrong and misplaced the actors. <br /> <br /> The writing that was also done by Milos Forman was just as bad, or worse than the staging. There was really nothing memorable in the film, except the one seen where Bardem receives the same treatment as the character of Portman. Otherwise, the film did not give you the impression of the period and at least it could have caught up with a quote or two. <br /> <br /> After finishing this movie, I was just watching television. thinking OK, why should I care about all this? I care about the story and I'm very interested in it, but when films like this come up, you get the impression that the producers stole something good that could have been removed from the movie . When the movies are so bad, we point out a lot of technical flaws that if it was good. Like the accents. I'm not sure that people would have insisted on the lack of Spanish accent if this film was good. <br /> <br /> The whole point of this criticism is to simply say not to look at it.
