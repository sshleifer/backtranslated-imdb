It was funny because everything was so unrealistic, I mean, come on, as a pop star would show up in a public high school and fall in love with the girl who is obsessed with him? Come on, people! <br /> <br /> Everyone except the main girl was completely awful to play. The dialogue was nerdy, the premise was stupid and the camera work was poorly done. I felt like I was watching a poorly made home video. <br /> <br /> I feel as if I have lost almost two hours of my life that I would never come back. <br /> <br /> I have nothing else to say, except that I prefer to hit my face several times than to watch this movie again.
