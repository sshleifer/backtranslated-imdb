Even for an independent film on a budget ... it's really bad, I'm afraid. I can not even believe that even Troma has such bullshit. I've been a fan of some Troma movies for years (Toxic Avenger, Squeeze Play, Rockabilly Vampire, to name a few) .But LLoyd, come on, it goes well beyond the limits of all tastes . the unemployed on the street who could have been so good ... oh, wait, that's what they did.I really think, these characters have a negative charisma.With a chance, the producer and director of this movie will have a huge karmic debt But beyond the terrible acting and horrible special effects, the dialogue is absolutely traumatic for the ears. The scenario is full of intrigues the size of Alaska and poses serious problems of continuity. The worst part is that it's not entertaining, even in the smallest way. And it is the most unforgivable sin in the making of a film. But do not believe me on my word. Go out and lose four dollars by renting it. Do not say I did not warn you.
