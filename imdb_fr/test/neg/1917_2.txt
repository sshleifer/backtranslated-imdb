****************** SPOILER ********************* SPOILER ********* ** ********** This stinking movie. Let me just say now that I totally agree with what carissaphillips had to say about it. What was Sam thinking? She was with a guy who told him that he loved her (3 times in all), that she was VERY HOT and that she was stuck with her despite her difficult times (Josh Hartnett). But she decided to break with him, no, to deceive him with a foolish, hideous, spoiled and rich loser, who never said he loved her in the whole movie (oh, wait, he wrote it on the wall, this account?), and left her in need because he was scared (Chris LOSER Klein). Who would you like to be with? The only reason I watched the whole movie was because Josh Hartnett was in the movie and maybe she hoped she would die in the end. I wanted Jasper to have another girlfriend worthy of him. The whole thing "your mother" was funny. I liked that. I hate it when people here say it but I think Kelley deserved it. Jasper should have told Sam too, she needed a good slap. How romance has begun is a mystery to me. In any case, they never said anything to each other, so I do not understand how they met. "I was thinking about the cheese sandwich you gave me ... did he have mustard or mayonnaise or ..." Oh, what's that? The lines supposedly romantic were so stupid. Moreover, he is sososososososo UGLY! I must admit that I cried in this movie. For a long time, really hard. Not because she's dead, but because she broke Jasper's heart. He cried so much in this movie ... he tried to smile for her but he could not stop his tears. He cried when 1) he told her he loved her 2) she got sick 3) Chris Klein came back and he saw how happy she was 4) she died. I cried when he cried because he loved her all his life and told him so, and yet she was stupid enough not to care and love a guy who had left her in need, and who had not cried at the funeral. 1 1/2 stars only because I love JOSH HARTNETT! Oh by the way, Chris Klein, YOUR MOM! -The sister of Wiley
