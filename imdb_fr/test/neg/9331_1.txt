Tyrone Power was first launched under the name of Solomon. However, halfway through the film, he died suddenly. The studio chose to play Yul Brynner in the lead and re-shoot the scenes of Power. In hindsight, given the gravity of this film, Power was lucky - it would have been a horrible way to end his great film career !!! <br /> <br /> Of all the biblical epics I've seen, this one is by far the worst - and that says a lot, because Hollywood has made many boring Bible stories - you wonder if the creation These movies were an atheist conspiracy !! In fact, the film was so dull that it deserved to be included in Harry Medved's brilliant book "The Fifty Worst Movies Ever". There are so many reasons to hate the movie, but the worst part is how much it was! Of course, throwing characters with Italian, Eastern European, Scottish and English accents to play the Egyptians and Israelis was bad enough - but at least it made the movie strangely funny. Having Gina Lollobrigida's bosomy playing the role of a woman deemed to be from Ethiopia was also horrible, but at least she was beautiful even though she could not act. The fact that George Sanders had such a young, overweight and post-middle-aged role was also very bad, but at least he had a pretty voice. Creating an orgy scene that was choreographed and terribly boring was bad enough, but at least you have to see in the credits a mention of a person as an "orgy choreographer"! No, the worst thing about this movie is that almost two and a half hours, it seemed like nine o'clock so it was so rhythmic and tasteless! Considering that the only mention of this Queen of Sheba and Solomon appears in only a few lean verses from the Old Testament, it is astonishing that the film continues over and over again. The most beautiful story ever told was a little longer, but this film was based on four gospels - not a dozen worms! <br /> <br /> The result is that the movie is miserable almost in every way (except Gina's cleavage). Even for devoted Christians and Jews, this is a film to avoid, because it plays so fast with the truth and injects an incredible amount of sex in a Bible movie! Terrible in almost every area, it's really a blessing for Tyrone Power not to remember him for his role in this swollen turkey.
