His of the Mask is a terrible movie. I do not like the baby and I do not like the dog. Jamie Kennedy and his wife are a lovely couple but can not buy sitting in this trash. Even at just 88 minutes (or so), the movie could not end soon enough for me. The only bursts of laughter come at first with a brief appearance of Ben Stain. That's all. The rest is just a summary of the first film. In reality, this is only an insult to rehabilitation. Why was this suite created? This film cost millions of dollars. Why should I sit in a movie with a baby and a dog deliberately trying to make the father crazy? Jamie Kennedy is talented but he has nothing to do in this movie. I do not care to be nice to this movie. 1/10
