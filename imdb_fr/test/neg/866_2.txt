This film must be one of the most boring and stupid films of Perrugorria. <br /> <br /> It looks like an advertisement from start to finish. The "director" has spent all his time on a tripod, he has no rhythm, no pace. It's illogical. What a mess. You can tell what will happen for the first 15 minutes and the end ... Wow <br /> <br /> ------ spoiler ------- <br /> <br /> Jesus Christ, how on earth was Perrugorria killed? Are you serious? The worst scene of someone being shot! <br /> <br /> ------ end of the spoiler ----- <br /> <br /> Bad direction, bad scenario, bad acting ... Really bad overall . I would not recommend this movie at all. It is a waste of time and money.
