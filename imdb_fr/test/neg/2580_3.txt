The Patriot (which has nothing to do with the movie Mel Gibson of the same name) is out. Steven Seagal always did this thing to "save the environment" in his films. Which is fine. But that does not give rise to a good action. <br /> <br /> When the plot (?) From this film finally began, I saw the turning point (?) gain momentum. Seagal's anti-war attitude and attitude towards nature are not very subtle. For a movie that was originally supposed to debut in cinemas, the filming is much like a TV movie, despite some great pictures of the country taken by Dances with Wolves photographer Dean Semler. <br /> <br /> like 1 fight scene in the whole movie and it's totally boring. As an action film, it fails, the drama stinks, the environmental message is obvious. Avoid as Ebola crossed with the plague.
