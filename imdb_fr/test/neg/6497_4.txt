I saw this selfish "effort" centered on getting a film of "epic" status in the company of several members of the Russian family. Five people made 5 different reactions, from Mikhalkov's cult to cynicism. <br /> <br /> I saw a film that looked like Mikhalkov who took a lot of money from "Canal +" and put some in his (and in others) pockets and entrusted the project to a group of film students. I counted at least 4 different styles in the movie. There is no way that the same director is responsible for these different scenes. Contrast them for yourself: <br /> <br /> · Cadets polish their shoes with a dog. <br /> <br /> · Station scene (say goodbye to Andrei). <br /> <br /> · Exterior panoramic shots. <br /> <br /> · Ormond speaks through the keyhole. <br /> <br /> · First attempt of the Grand Duke and continuation of scenes to bring Andrei back to Figaro. <br /> <br /> · Fencing sequence <br /> <br /> Julia Ormond is faster than Superman. Hearing of her late transfer, she crossed Moscow in a minute to say goodbye to Andrei. <br /> <br /> The people of Russia felt that the impression given of Russian life was a "caricature" and not a story. They called it "tourist postcard" Russia. <br /> <br /> They were all proud that a Russian director / producer / repairer was able to break through the "big time" and be able to waste more than 30 million dollars on people's money while possibly putting to be a little in the local pockets while shooting. <br /> <br /> If you want to "think" you have seen Russia go see this movie. Drink some coffee before leaving.
