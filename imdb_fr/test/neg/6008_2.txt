Being a big fan of Laura Gemser, I took this to a rental store just to see another Emanuelle movie. I made a mistake! <br /> <br /> EMANUELLE IN EGYPT has nothing to do with Emanuelle. Laura Gemser is there with her husband Gabriele Tinti, but this is the only link with Emanuelle. Here, Laura plays "Laura" (original, huh?), A beautiful supermodel who will visit her rich friend Pia (Annie Belle) in Egypt. She is accompanied by a photographer Carlo ** (Gabriele Tinti, looking haggard) and a blonde woman who never bears his name. Pia's mansion also lives in Horatio (the sexy but silly Al Cliver), a mystic who only talks nonsense. Pia's two daughters, one lesbian with short hair and the other brunette, arrive for the weekend. A lot of sex is involved, but barely shown. A good actor plays Ali, the Egyptian servant, who is lucky with three of the women of the manor. Laura has sex with the lesbian, the lesbian has sex with Horatio, Pia and the blonde have sex with Horatio during an orgy Egyptian, Laura drinks goat blood and is possessed at an Egyptian ceremony Carlo violates Laura. Everything happens with such little talent that EMANUELLE IN EGYPT is one of the worst films I have ever seen. Far from being erotic, even the actors themselves look bored during their sex scenes. <br /> <br /> Since there were two famous couples in this film (Laura and Gabriele & Al and Annie), the number of sex scenes available is uncountable. . Instead, a movie featuring a leading cast on Eurocult and never delivering the goods will annoy all viewers, with the exception of the hardcore Laura Gemser. Otherwise, avoid EMANUELLE IN EGYPT!
