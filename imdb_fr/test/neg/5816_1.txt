If you are looking for a movie with beautiful pictures of Mount Everest, then you can enjoy this movie. Just go to the mountain views. <br /> <br /> (Spoiler Alert) However, if you think like me that lives are precious and should not be wasted, this film will leave you with a bad taste mouth. 6 people died, 5 Sherpas and a member of the Japanese side so that only one man can try to hit Mount Everest. <br /> <br /> The question is asked in the film whether the pursuit of the expedition to meet his personal goal was worth the cost in human lives, and he responds with a categorical "yes". <br /> <br /> The game on the ski dates from the last 15 minutes. He skis a few moments, then falls back to the ground until he stops in the snow.
