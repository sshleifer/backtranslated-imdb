'Til There You You is one of the worst movies we have ever seen. He fails in all respects. Jeanne Tripplehorn was better (as an actress ...) at Waterworld. In comparison, this movie is Dungworld. When a character stumbles once or twice during a movie, you can understand it. But the character of Jeanne falls, stumbles, stumbles so often that she might have a little Jerry Lewis in it. In his defense, each fall (practiced) was probably blocked, choreographed and repeated. And repeated. Although this is bad enough for a movie, the actors (Dylan McDermott and Jeanne Tripplehorn) seem to spend most of the plot going to "smoke" or find a place to smoke. If the movie was a rant about not having a place to smoke - OK, BUT that's not the case. <br /> <br /> Whatever the life of the film, it is too long, 10 minutes after the time has elapsed. <Br /> <br /> Oh, Jeanne Tripplehorn, ALMOST is acting in a public meeting. You see her almost pierce life in the character. Oh, it's ALMOST as compelling as his scene screams at Michael Douglas in Basic Instinct - hmm, thinking about it, not really. <br /> <br /> This is a movie to avoid at all costs unless you need a cigarette and are trapped in anonymous nicotine addicts or forced to watch the HOOPER (Burt Reynolds) catch. And even then, throw a coin or go to bed.
