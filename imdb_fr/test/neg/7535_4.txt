Very strange. But destined to be. This director is his own man. Even if there is tension if Polanski, Bergman and Kafka at least in episode 6, the voyeur. What made all this so strange, and reminiscent of the three artists above, was that it was going everywhere, we never knew where it was going, we could have finished anywhere, and finally when it was over, we could have Carry on. The end is hardly a finality, no one could tell you what these two characters would do in the next frame. Another thing to say about the director: No wonder Kubrick finds it fascinating. There are many Eyes Wide Shut in this episode in one way or another, in the direct approach of the character, the realistic fantasy elements of both. A Kubrick camera placement without any of the void effects, much more faded, and squeezed, not as restless. That said, at first, this guy always has his own things to say and says them well. Yet, for some reason, there is not a single scene I want to see again. But I certainly did not feel scammed in the least by watching him once. But I still had the feeling that three or four other ghosts of directors were moving in the parade, blurring everything. The warning was that it was only episode six: the other nine could give me totally different shots. But since this episode revolved around the absolute eye, the absolute domain of the film, I will say this, he has not taken any of the usual routes, he has definitely followed his path while carrying the luggage of many good directors.
