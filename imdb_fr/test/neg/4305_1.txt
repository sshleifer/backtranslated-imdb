Praise this tone of my local video store. It was entitled "Black Horizon". I guess someone thought it was enough for a re-release in 2004 ... <br /> <br /> Micheal Dudikoff is unfortunately not a ninja in this film, one of the major flaws of this movie. Another major flaw is that Ice-t action scenes are stolen in other movies, especially the first scene of his rescue, which comes directly from Wesley Snipes' movie "The Art of War", with Ice -T edited in. I hope they paid for these pictures. <br /> <br /> The plot is horrible, the special effects have made little effort (like these threads that hold them in space), the game of actors is wood (also likes the accents of New York / Russia). Ice-T being in the movie is useless. These guys also forgot the fact that there is no gravity in the space, but I guess they did not care. <br /> <br /> Micheal Dudikoff should start doing what he's "good at" and do American Ninja 6
