I do not know which came out for the first time in 1970. Cannon for Cordoba is a "Western European" It was made in Spain. That means it's quite inferior to Sergio Leone's so-called #Western Spaghetti and John Ford's American masterpieces, Sam Peckinpah, Howard Hughes, John Sturges and Anthony Mann, in my order of merit. This order should not be interpreted because all John Ford westerns are better than all those of Sam Peckipahn. I think 100 IMDb sorts them all very well. <br /> <br /> The worst thing about this company is casting. George Peppard is ready for a sergeant role, Raff Valone for a "Maffia Capo" and Giovanna Ralli for a "puttana" on the "Piazza Vennezia" in the sixties in Rome.
