I am fond of these changes in British social norms and it is rare that I lose. But our Betters lost me a little. It's a story of social climbers and their joy of breaking the rules, but personally, I found it a bit boring. <br /> <br /> I loved the duchess even though she moaned a bit too much and Constance Bennett kindly fulfilled the role of Lady Greyston, a role Bette Davis could have played backwards. <br /> <br /> But the film comes life in the third act when Ernest joins the party. He is so lively and fun (and in truth probably wears more makeup than Lady Greyston). He gets the last line of the movie and it's a gas!
