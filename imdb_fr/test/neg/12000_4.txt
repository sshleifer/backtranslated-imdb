Wow, what a nerdy movie it is! It starts by giving the impression that it will be a background slasher, with the camera following the dogs running in the woods. It then becomes a little boring and follows the story of some girls who have settled in a house haunted by Indian spirits. We then have a lot of pictures of a girl partially dressed and another girl naked in the bath. It suddenly becomes very old when the "Zombie Indians" emerge from the earth and begin to terrorize the girls. We even get an Indian samurai. <br /> <br /> This film starts quite boring even though I found the story of the four Indians who buried themselves alive very interesting. Once the Indian zombies (or whatever you want to call them because they are not technically zombies), start to terrorize the girls when all the fun begins. It's not a special movie and can not be taken seriously, it's just fun to watch when you're bored or drinking with friends. I can not help thinking that it would have worked better as a new one, because the first half is tediously boring.
