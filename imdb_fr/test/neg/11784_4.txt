Irwin Allen put all his talents behind this one: he is co-scriptwriter, producer and director of this "epic" caricaturist on an atomic submarine and his efforts to reduce the circle of radiation around the Earth. A potentially exciting story does not take off, despite an eclectic cast. Varied players, from Walter Pigeon and Joan Fontaine to Frankie Avalon and Barbara Eden, mix in interesting ways and add a touch of color, but this soggy science fiction is rather old-fashioned. Good for some misplaced laughter, but Allen did not seem to know how to tell the difference between a solid and solid adventure and a campy absurdity. Later, a popular TV series. ** from ****
