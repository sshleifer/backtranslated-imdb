I saw this film a few years ago and I never want to play golf again. I mean, ninjas seem to have no respect for golf or the way it has evolved. And I'm not talking about "victimless" stuff like forging a dashboard. Based on what I saw here, they shamelessly massacre police and golfers on a sacred club ground. Judge Smailes is turning in his grave. And do they repent of those sins? No no, based on what I saw here, the typical response of a killed ninja is to take back the body of a busty phone repairer and take revenge. I find that morally reprehensible and it goes without saying that after seeing this nonsense, I not only stopped playing golf and talking on the phone, but I also decided to stop feeding the homeless. shelter.
