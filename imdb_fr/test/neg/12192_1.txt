I like dissing this movie. My comrades always do their best to defend it, probably out of love for Quentin Tarantino or Harvey Keitel, but they will never convince me that this one should be precious. Here are some major reasons why: A: The plot goes from a kidnapping movie to a road trip to a movie slashers in a denominated bar bar inhabited by vampires without any setup. Suddenly, something very real turns into something very wrong, which amounts to sitting in front of a Thanksgiving feast and then exploding with dynamite. B: This Juliette Lewis without talent is in it. C: The clues abound, such as the torso and leg guitars, the brothers with the family name "Gecko", the bad vampire makeup, Cheech Marin playing three characters (?) And a crotch-based rifle who only shoots when "erect" and belongs to a guy who goes through "Sex Machine". If Robert Rodriguez had not tried pathetically to be so innovative with his violence, I might have amused myself with this obvious film of popcorn. The whole project is as if he had ideas by playing with action figures. The only thing that brings me closer to my favorite scene is the ridiculous and ridiculous monologue of George Clooney, after he killed his brother who sucks the blood and is excited by the children. I swear I think they thought about it right away. This film is offensive and ends up offending those who want the offensive. Horrible film.
