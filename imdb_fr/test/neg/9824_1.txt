We looked for this hard-to-find VHS after watching two excellent Merchant-Ivory images one after the other. Knowing it was an instant box office failure, a failure as a rental, I thought it might be interesting to see it anyway, because of the reputation of MID. Pity! Nine years ago, the goal of the Liberals' agenda was to destroy the founding fathers and they effectively eradicated the founding fathers of many American classrooms, particularly in New Jersey; the eradication of our great founders quickly ended when the Washington Times shone the spotlight on the NJ's school board and its subversive act. A small part of this was headlining the alleged connection between Sally Hemmings and Thomas Jefferson, ignoring the impractical DNA results that did not support the wacky left agenda. It does not matter! They had James Ellis, a dubious author, put it in a book, and Columbia University sealed the deal by giving Ellis a Pulitzer. <br /> <br /> As for Jefferson in Paris, the rotation of the liberal agenda begins in the opening scene where James Earl Jones claims to be the son of Jefferson. The spin simply continues in flashback mode in Paris. The indisputable truth is that, even if a person presumes that the lie is true, Hemmings's allegation would be an insignificant detail in the vast affair of Jefferson's extended and vital diplomatic mission in Paris (as well as in the Netherlands where he got crucial financial support for America when our fledgling nation was without money). <br /> <br /> In addition to the Liberal Spin Job, this dull and tortuous film is not interesting. Some of the other stories are indeed accurate - adding credibility to frame the lie - but this film takes one of the most interesting moments in American history and reduces it to a cure for insomnia. <br /> <br /> Please do not ask me why the Liberals decided to undermine the founding fathers, because I do not waste time explaining the actions of such people. Do not ask them either; they usually answer these questions with the same answer: "SHUT UP!"
