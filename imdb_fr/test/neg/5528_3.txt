... but memorable because it includes an actor that I really recognize! James Horan is, compared to these types of films, Lawrence Olivier. He had decent performances on stuff like Highlander and various Star Treks, so it's kind of fun, albeit slightly depressing, to see him down here. Ok, yes, there is a plot. The character of Horan and his wife are fighting, he has an affair with a movie critic while trying to make his movie "masterpiece", and their guest decides to enjoy the wonders of striptease. But watching Horan is really the only pleasure we find here.
