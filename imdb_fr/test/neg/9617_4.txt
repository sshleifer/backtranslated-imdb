I will not waste your time in describing the plot for that, the other criticism has already done very well. I will, however, give you my opinion on this film. This film is basically anti-Japanese propaganda. The Japanese are portrayed as incredibly evil evildoers who do not respect anything, while having very weak martial arts skills. the fighters lose almost all the fights (if not all) of the film, which eliminates the suspense. The plot is actually pretty solid and perfect for a kung fu movie. The problem lies in the fact that there is not a lot of fighting. When there is fighting, some fights are good enough, but other scenes are poorly choreographed. A scene Angela Mao takes six Japanese in a church and knocks all their asses. The problem is that they show it fighting one by one while they are all supposed to attack at the same time. I guess this movie was incredibly cheap considering the price of some games. They use the same village for the time they are in Korea and when they are in China without changing it at all. Some scenes are filmed in real places and look beautiful. Overall, the only real problem of the film is its slow and uninteresting plot. Since there are few fight scenes, we have to rely on the plot to entertain ourselves and, well, I did not have fun. <br /> <br /> a star and a half in four
