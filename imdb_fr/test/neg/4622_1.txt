It is the film that represents all that is bad in the world of cinema. The actors are pathetic and the scenario is awful. The special effects, if any, are so badly made that it would have been better to do it with cartoons. Other than that it's great! I think the creators of the film wanted humor, but the only time I laughed was when I saw Patrick S. with long hair and colorful costumes that all world wore. The scenes at the end were good but they were not part of the movie. In the end, you will wonder "why did I waste my time and money with this shit when I could watch the plants grow or the clouds move". I do not think I'm a critic or anything but it's a really bad movie! DO NOT LOOK! DANGER OF STUPIDITY OVERLOAD!
