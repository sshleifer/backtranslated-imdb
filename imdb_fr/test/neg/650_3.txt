I really wanted to love this movie, but the pace was too slow. <br /> <br /> It was a beautiful story, but it was really like watching a slug race. <br /> <br /> The film would have been better served had he had more action. I do not mean much, but at least something in the background. <br /> <br /> This could also have been helped by songs that set the tone / mood of the longer periods that were missing from the dialogue. <It's been about 10 years since I can not see it and it may be necessary to give it another chance. <br /> <br /> 3/10 or * 1/2 (out of four)
