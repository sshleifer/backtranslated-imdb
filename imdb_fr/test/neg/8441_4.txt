Piranha begins as planned, stupid whites will discover new lands and exploit them. I thought for a moment that it could be a cannibalistic movie. It starts like so many others, showing only plans of the intact Amazon rainforest. As far as I know, it could be Florida. At this point, you think animal mutilations or natives will appear. Instead, you get the acting skills of William Smith, who played in L.A. Vice and Angels Die Hard. He plays the famous hunter Caribe, which I would call Jack Palance Light. He is taller, but not quite like Jack Palance. As for aboriginal people, you do not have many. Where is the piranha? Should I even ask this question? Caribe is now hunting humans, I guess. He does not really chase anyone until the end of the film, he just watches them. Caribe races with one of the motorcycle tourists in a dramatic style of Smokey and Bandit. The motorcycle challenge occurs for no reason other than an action sequence. I can not tell you how many times I have seen a tourist challenge a stranger during a motorcycle race in the jungle. Never really. Do they live, are they dying? Do you want to worry? Someone wants to ride a motorcycle? Caution: this film contains an extremely dry aspect. My advice is to rent a Jack Palance classic like Craze.
