This film is painful. This is probably the best way to describe it. It's 93 minutes of your life that you will never be able to recover. In fact, this is equivalent to 86 minutes, because nobody would want to miss the credits of this stinking pile of dog feces. Immediately, you can say that the film comes from the producer of "Mortal Kombat", because of its annoying and annoying techno soundtrack. This drains the ridiculously enjoyable moments that this film can give you. The rest is drained by the totally uninteresting and annoying characters, the action abilities of "Freddie Prinze, Jr. School of Acting" from all the actors involved (including Christopher Lambert miscast), and non-existent staging. Have I forgotten something? Of course I did it. Let's not forget the scenario inducing suicide, with its funny dialogue (unintentional). Oh, yes, and let's also talk about how they ransacked the original poem with this sad and useless futuristic / medieval translation. The costumes and weapons (those giant pizza cutters that I kept seeing?!?!) Are just stupid, it's the best way to describe them. And the last culprit of the night is the always awful CGI. When will filmmakers learn that CGI is nil? When will we see the wonderful effects used in the 80s? Probably never, but movies like this and "Star Wars, Episode 1: The Ghost Threat" make us wish they could bring them back. In closing, avoid this film like the latest film by Freddie Prinze, Jr. Again, if you like Freddie Prinze, Jr.'s movies, you deserve to miss out on this horrible excuse for making movies.
