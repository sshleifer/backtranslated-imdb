Well, I cracked for that. I saw the box for that at the video store and I confused it with "Girlfight", which I had heard was awesome. In my own defense, the titles are similar and they redid the box cover so that it looks almost identical. In any case, to summarize, they have obviously redid all the packaging / promo of the cover to capitalize on the buzz / success of "Girlfight". I fell into it and had a bad feeling when they started showing trailers for low-budget movies, and worse, when a video clip of the film's main song, which sounded like music elevator and featured slomo's tacky movie clips preceded the main feature. When I saw the first minutes and Maria Conchita Alonso arrived, I knew I had fallen into the trap. (Understand me, she's a talented actress, but I knew she was not in "Girlfight", the movie I had under the false impression of praising.) So, <br /> < Apart from the fact that I feel cheated and angry at me for not looking more closely, the movie was OK. The plot involves Belle, a young Latino woman who is the daughter of a former boxing champion. One of her closest friends is a boxer who - and I saw all this happen so far in advance that it was really a drag - is seriously injured in a game with a villain named "The Terminator", who looks like a female version of a larger and more inflated Ike Turner. Of course, Belle decides that the only thing to do is to become a boxer and avenge her friend. She lives with her supportive, supportive but protective father (her mother died of cancer when she was younger), who happens to be just a cop. Her loving, caring, supportive and protective interest is also a policewoman who works with her father. Hmmm, they both have a job that puts their lives in danger in the performance of their duties ... wonder what will happen? She starts to train and meets a sordid manager who, of course, pretends to take care of her, but only wants to exploit her. The actor they hired resembles Cary Eweles, his low rent. He is so young that he barely manages to be a mustache. His game was also really, really bad. I will not even go further in the plot, because anyone who has seen Rocky, or almost, knows exactly where this movie is going and how it will end. <br /> <br /> It was not completely terrible movie. Most of the actors were OK and the main actress was very good. There were good and strong Latino female models. The final scene of the fight really interested me, although I knew everything that was going to happen well before. The actress who played "The Terminator" did a great job being quite unfriendly so I really wanted Belle to kick him, and I took root for Belle-again, though he did there is absolutely no surprise. My favorite moment (maybe the only time I was not mad at me for renting the movie by mistake) was when Belle slapped his shady director after he showed his true colors, screams after him, then turn away only to pretend give him a punch and watch him back out of fear, showing that she is really the one in charge. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was really, really bad, my main complaint. One of their attempts to make the mind was someone who was talking about boxing saying "size does not matter" and the woman ironically replying "now, where did I hear that before? ? " The other lines supposed to have a dramatic impact are "The doctors told me I could never walk!" "Come on, you know you can trust me!" and "Your mother would have been so proud of you". I could go on and on. Nothing you have heard a million times before in bad serials or movies of the week. <br /> <br /> Maybe I'm too mean - the filmmakers made an effort, and I sat down voluntarily during all this ... but only because there was nothing else to watch while I worked. You could do worse (especially if you're looking for a movie with strong female characters) but you could also do a lot, a lot better.
