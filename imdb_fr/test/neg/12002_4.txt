I could not help but watch the time every 5 to 10 minutes because I found this film totally slippery. Childish humor, inexpensive scenery, inexpensive effects, plot that gives "Legally Blonde" the nickname "The Suspect Suspects" and so many coincidences that I can now officially say that Robert Rodriguez underwent brain surgery after 1996. his trademark is composed of nice camera movements, but it ends there. OK, so the guy decided to do something new to change, a spy movie for kids. Well, if I was 12, I would feel insulted. The best thing about this movie is the amazing Carla Gugino who stole all the scenes she was in. Unfortunately, there were not many. 4/10
