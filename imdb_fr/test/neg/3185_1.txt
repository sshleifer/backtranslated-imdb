This is one of those great comedies filled with stars that could a) be hysterical or b) wish you to go to the dentist instead to get all your teeth torn out. Unfortunately, One Night at McCool's is a classic of "b." <br /> <br /> Goldie Hawn recently commented for "Town and Country" that it was a big problem in Hollywood to start hiring actors and making a deal. before a script is finished. You must understand that not only did they enter this image without a full script, but they also damaged it daily. We may need to send cards and letters to the heads of all the studios that say, "That's the script, stupid." <br /> <br /> It's also one of those movies where you feel sorry for most actors. They strive to make all this hysterical, but they know that most of these events will not be accompanied by belly laughs, but by the sound of crickets you can hear inside the silent theater. <br /> Is this an unmitigated disaster? Not entirely. There are some smiles along the way, mainly due to the efforts of the actors. I would probably be out of the theater thinking, "Uh, that was good." So, why is the tone undeniably hostile in my review? The end. If, as noted, the rest of the film is only a montage for the end, it is missing dramatically. I really wish I could talk about it specifically, but I hate people who give it too much (even with warning). Suffice it to say that as soon as you see John Goodman behind a bent Paul Reiser (nothing was given here, he's in the trailer), get out of the theater and come out thinking, "Uh, that was good. "The rest of the film is stuck and goes bankrupt in a creative way, and you'll be appalled by the fact that there will be people who will laugh at this mess." <br /> <br /> If you liked "There have something about Mary "or" Meet the parents "(the two very good movies), do not look at this movie anymore, go and have these teeth treated instead.
