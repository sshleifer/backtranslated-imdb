*** POSSIBLE SPOILERS BELOW *** <br /> <br /> What a long and uninteresting movie! Who were these characters? Why did not I care about them? If I watch a movie for two hours, I'd like to worry about someone or something. <br /> <br /> We know that Salvatore dreamed of the riches of the new world. Beyond that, however, we have learned little about hopes, fears, and so on. of the family as they embark on an adventure in the unknown. <br /> <br /> And why was Lucy in this movie? She said little; we knew little about her or what she was doing (was she obliged to serve men in return for permission to board the ship?) or about her plans when she arrived in New York. For those who might suggest that it was necessary to emphasize that a single woman, regardless of her culture, could not enter that country, I say that this is not sufficient justification to give her so much time on the screen. It could have been done in five minutes, with Lucy as a momentary character. <br /> <br /> Other questions: Why was not the twin brother on the boat to meet the family? We heard about the brother, and a closure on this point would have been helpful in giving the film some cohesion. Also, how long did the trip from Italy to New York last? Given the conditions on the ship, the fact that the trip takes five, ten or fifty days changes things. (Someone said something about seeing the land a "week" at some point, but I think it was when they were already on the road.) I needed that kind of detail to better appreciate what they were going through. <br /> <br /> The only scene that really pleased me was when the boat, filled with passengers, left the dock. <br /> <br /> If you choose to rent this movie, do it with the remote control by hand; you may want to use the Fast Forward button. <br /> <br /> Finally, let me suggest that, with the appropriate voice-over, providing useful information about the times and circumstances of immigrants - especially during slow campaign plans, people who walk, etc., this film could have made an interesting documentary on public television.
