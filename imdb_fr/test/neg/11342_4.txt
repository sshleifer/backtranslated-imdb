Thunder Alley finds Fabian banned from NASCAR tracks after causing the death of another driver. Stanley Adams may want to name him on his rider team, but the other drivers are not for him. <br /> <br /> Desperate to find a job, Fabian teams up with a stunt owner, Jan Murray, who pays him. peanuts and trying to capitalize on Fabian's bad representative. He must endure it, but Annette Funicello, Murray's daughter, provides another reason to stay. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film is Fabian's fight to return to the NASCAR circuit while juggling between the two Annette and his current girlfriend Diane McBain. Personally, I would have taken McBain, she has everything on Annette. <br /> <br /> Thunder Alley is helped by filming on the NASCAR tracks in the south and by good footage of the NASCAR races. A rather idiotic story that explores the real reasons for Fabian's problems and his rather unrealistic recovery from this situation does not help. <br /> <br /> It's still possible that NASCAR fans will opt for this solution.
