Mr. Accident is a deliberate series of nonstop disasters and near-death experiences reminiscent of Warner Brothers cartoons from Saturday Morning. Like the coyote that falls from the cliff 5 times per episode, the "main character" (more like a klutzy kid who has grown up) always succeeds in postponing his meeting with the Grim Reaper. <br /> <br /> This "Australian surprise" is offensively unpleasant, and sometimes even depressing.The 2 (out of 10) are for visual stunts (some have never been tried since Daffy Duck) and for use of bright colors (as in these national advertisements of high-class laundry detergents). <br /> <br /> It can be an age range where this "comedy" finds a sequel. this age a long time ago Call all preteens: here is a "ha-ha" for you!
