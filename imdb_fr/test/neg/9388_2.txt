On the positive side, I'll say it's pretty enough to be watched. On the downside, it's pretty tasteless to cause regrets for 2 extra hours of life lost in front of the screen. Long, whiny and useless. And I do not say that to be mean, I really wanted to love this movie, it seemed to have everything to please, it had the so-called "buzz", and it was a hassle to find. If a little more effort had been made on the side of the story, I think it would have been incredible. And I hope that the team behind this will produce a great job in the future, they clearly have the capacity. But I recommend waiting for their future efforts, let this one go away.
