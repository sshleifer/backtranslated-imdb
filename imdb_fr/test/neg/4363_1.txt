<br /> <br /> This film is bad! The first was much better. Nobody from the beginning came back in this stupid sequel and in a way, it's a good thing because of the bad acting of the actors, but the characters of this film are not even better. Killjoy in the woods? Come on! Leave me alone! I am surprised that Blair Witch, a friend of killjoy, did not show up to make an appearance. Bad acting, bad story and just stupid and boring. Do not waste your time!
