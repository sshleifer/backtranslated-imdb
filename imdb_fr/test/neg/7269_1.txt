This film is awful. At first, I thought it might please kids, because of the Ewoks, the crazy people of Stars Wars. After going through this monstrosity of a movie, I'm sure that even a 4-year-old would not find this movie interesting. The special effects are by far the best of this film and compare well to other 80s TV movies. The script is bad, the actors, especially Aubree Miller, and incredibly bad, and the movie is so predictable that I still can not not believe that I could not touch the progress button on my VCR. However, I almost extinguished this mess more than once.
