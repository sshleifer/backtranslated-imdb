I watch a ton of movies and occasionally enjoy film B, but this film was awful. Apart from the "home" quality of the film, it was very slow and seemed to give nothing. I'm just commenting on the b / c of another review I saw here that said it was great! WOW! Maybe I can watch a rainy day when nothing else is available. <br /> <br /> The characters were disjointed and did not correspond to any perceptible model of reality. The dialogue between the characters was forced and sometimes very confusing. <br /> <br /> I guess if you were very interested in the whole field and understand some of the nuances of other reviews, maybe that's fine - but for me - The Average Joe - I do not do not understand !?
