Bad movie! Wrong! Go stand in a reduction bin. Carrot Top should really stick to the unenlightened comedy clubs. It's movies like this that make Jerry Lewis's old movies look like Shakespeare and John Agar look like John Barrymore. Coutney Thorne-Smith (a talented talent) is absolutely lost. His goal seems to be mostly pretty and unconscious. <br /> <br /> The only thing nice to see in the film is to see Raquel Welch play a role like Alexis Carrington and Estelle Harris as an owner harridan. The only way I can imagine someone thinking it would be a good idea to make this movie (beyond the sophomoric), is if the fourth-grade child was allowed to choose the script. Well, maybe his third grader. What this film really needs is to be rubbed in the nose of its creators.
