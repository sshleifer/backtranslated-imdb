According to the presentation text on the back of the DVD case; Jonothan Ross "laughs until wee wee out." I suspect it has more to do with it being full. <br /> <br /> I have never watched the show for one reason or another, so maybe I miss some essential benchmarks. As for this film; I watched the first 45 minutes or so. I laugh once, smile, then grab the paper until something fun happens. Nothing to do. <br /> <br /> Obviously destined to be a surreal parody of life in the post-Python style, with raw humor, it falls flat. There has been a series of comedy series on television in recent years, including "Bottom," "The Fast Show," "The Vicar Of Dibley," and "Father Ted," each engaging a hilarious group of characters and characters. sketch. Any of them could throw that shit into a cocked hat. <br /> <br /> If the series looked a lot like this movie; I'm surprised they received the funding. Fortunately, it was one of those purchases of 2,000 Tesco books and it is now in the local charity shop. <br /> <br /> The moral of history is; do not believe the experts, never pay the price.
