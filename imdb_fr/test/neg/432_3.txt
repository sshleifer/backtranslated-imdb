you will probably be deeply disappointed by this sequel which is not a sequel. AWIL is a classic. But this film is as far from being a classic as you can get. What a joke.Special effects that are not very special, horrible dialogue and a ridiculously ridiculous plot, quickly and without conviction (not to mention the fleeting), with about a third of the film left. Did I mention that the story is less than lame? The ranking he currently has (4.8 / 10) is too generous if you ask me. My rating for American Werewolf in Paris: a 3.5 / 10
