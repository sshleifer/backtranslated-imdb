What an offensive! Those who loved this movie probably never opened a Bible. I can imagine NBC members saying, "OK, let's do a movie to appease those pesky Christians, but they will never know the difference if we have nothing factual or in the right chronological order." Well, they were wrong. Anyone associated with this atrocity must find a church and repent for their involvement in this blasphemous atrocity. I only gave this movie a 1 because I could not give it a 0.
