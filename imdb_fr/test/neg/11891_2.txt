At university, our philosophy teacher, Mr.R, played us "Roger & Me" in its entirety. It was at a time when obese obesity was still almost unknown; a future quack, a future family name that was always busy honing his skills in fact wrinkles and learning to manipulate people who were easily impressed, pathologically paranoid, mentally ill, sexually frustrated, illiterate, semi-literate, helpless and ridiculously credulous among you. <br /> <br /> When we finished viewing it, I thought, "Yes, it was a bit of fun - in a totally stupid bugs Bunny, somehow, but what an ultra-biased propaganda turkey and anti-capitalist who has no objectivity, his only goal being to take cheap pictures of people and ideas for which the creator of the film has a pet peeve, a documentary by an effort of imagination. However, our dear Marxist professor was absolutely delighted with R & M, and we ended up NOT criticizing any of its aspects, but Mr. R spent the rest of the class praising his "qualities". For us to understand each other well, the words "propaganda", "viewer", "extremist left" or "selective presentation of the facts" never came out of his mouth always smiling ... And just to remind you: to be a course of philosophy, not INDOCTRINE YOUR STUDENTS WITH YOUR OWN POLITICAL BS Of course. <br /> <br /> Anyway, now I come to the really interesting aspect: this professor, M.R, is now a very successful screenwriter in Hollywood. He wrote several left-wing scripts with A-class stars. <br /> <br /> The moral of the story: They are people for whom all doors are open in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> <br /> Michael Moore is a talented filmmaker (of which he proved he had no doubt with "Canadian Bacon"), but being a liberal Marxist opens the doors to anyone. Tinseltown is teeming with rabid pro-Chavez extremists, hence the reason why political brainwashing through a simplistic portrayal of reality has been an integral part of the Hollywood experience for several decades. <br /> <br /> Embrace this demagogue and you've betrayed your own brain forever.
