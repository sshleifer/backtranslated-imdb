This film gives a cinematic example of the word worthless. It's awful, you can forget about the plot or decent acting because it's not there. And with the rejection of any decent story or actor or even the trait of being slightly scary, then there usually remains only one benefit for a horror movie. The call to those who love soft core porn. This movie does not even have that. Women show a little skin, but not really more than Xena's show. With the exception of the main star who is not particularly attractive and who has some poor, I mean poor sex scenes. In short, if you like good movies, this movie does not interest you, if you like cheese, you still have no reason to rent this movie, if you like eroticism and porn soft core, you do not care really have no reason to rent this movie. and, more importantly, if you value your time, you can not do better than avoid this movie.
