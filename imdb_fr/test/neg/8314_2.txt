"Death Machines" is inspired by an action movie (machines to kill the unstoppable martial arts, sent to eliminate opponents to a crime leader) and turns it into an unbeatable mess. I have rarely seen such a breathtaking combination of low budget, bad acting, and incoherent screenplay published as "film". This is by far the worst martial arts / action film I've seen in years, eclipsing even "Ninja Holocaust" (which has at least had some good energetic fight scenes). <br /> <br /> The current "star" of the film is the white "death machine" (it's basically his vehicle), so he's featured prominently in many more scenes than his two cohorts. He is in good shape and not very handsome, but as an actor, he is hardly - think of Chuck Norris in "The Octagon", but without any energy or emotion. This is obviously a deliberate choice on the part of the actor and the director. ..but you must be Arnold to remove that kind of thing, and this guy is not Arnold. <br /> <br /> The film (and the director) do not seem to be able to find the time (or the budget) to film the scenes that would have answered the basic questions she originally asked, such as Who was the shadowy figure who gave his orders to the Asian lady with her marbled mouth? How did the "gang war" end? Why did this rebellious Asian lady decide to kill her zombie assassins? And what happened if her assistant died and she waved a katana like a broom? <br /> <br /> However, he finds the time to film a total fight in which a sailor (he looked like Popeye) destroys a bar because the jukebox does not work. This only concerns the rest of the film, because in the process, he was also the "hero" of the film, a student of the bartender / karate victim of the first major mission of "Death Machines" (he was cut the they were killing his teacher). It follows one of the most unsolicited "love scenes" between the hero and his girlfriend that I have ever watched. The transition does not make sense - at the end of the fight, she grimaces on her bloomed body, and then they find themselves in a "tasteful" montage of sex and love that seems to come from a Hallmark card . BTW, we will never see the sailor again. <br /> <br /> And wait for the confrontation between the homicide detective and his captain - it's as if the director and screenwriter had never seen a movie scene inside a police station police, but had already heard about it and decided to include some without really knowing how they worked. <br /> <br /> The film is a case study of bad casting and community theater actors struggling without decent direction. The three "machines of death" appear as clods; the "hero" knows his lines but can not wear the film, since his character is an inefficient wimp; his girlfriend is a void of charisma; and all the other minor parts are barely observable. All of this makes for a rather mediocre film - but the "dragon lady" does more to drag the movie into Stinker's underground territory than anyone else or anything else. She looks ridiculous. her tiny, expressionless face is dominated by her skyscraper wig, she wears her red silk dress like a bathrobe and she speaks with a terrible spilling mouth that screams "he needed time with a dialogue coach". Poor lady - she was obviously out of her element and, as far as I know, never appeared in a movie again. <br /> <br /> Add to that a low-budget synthesizer soundtrack that never goes silent and never plays anything appropriate or interesting; shitty film film and lighting; fight against choreography that is strictly hunger; and a general all around the sadness and lack of energy in the blockage and the stage deal ... and you have a lame film. <br /> <br /> I understood it as part of a compilation of 50 DVD movies, so it probably cost me about 50 cents. It was not worth it. Feh!
