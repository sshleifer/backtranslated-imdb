It's by far the worst 'horror' movie of all time, no, do it like any movie I've ever seen. Shame on Block Buster to even carry this type of shit I never ask for a refund for a movie, but I think it will be a first. <br /> <br /> The film is so bad that I had to stop after just 15 minutes to watch it. <br /> <I had more fun watching any of the fuzzy YouTube movies than watching this piece of falling. <br /> <br /> The marketing guy in this film must have some sort of silvery tongue so this thing can get into a blockbuster setting.
