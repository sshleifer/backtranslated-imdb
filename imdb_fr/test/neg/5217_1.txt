Intrigue boring, infamous rank, some of the worst directions I've ever met, inane and horribly cliche. The film ends with one of the main characters coming out of a dream. WHAT'S WITH THAT? Even the Dallas JR could not survive this trap. <br /> <br /> You have what can only be described as an inappropriate relationship developing between a main character and a girl, who is supposed to be paternal, but who turns out to be perverse. You have special effects of a first-year community college film school with loopholes the size of the Kimberly Hole. It is as if the children of corn and the passion of Christ and the passion of Christ were imposed by an endless loop of training videos for public administrations - in the end, if you do not plan to finish them, you will have no brain <br /> <br /> Do not bother.
