I do not understand what strikes in this movie! I do not understand why high school students should look at this! I do not understand why it should have made me think of anything! <br /> <br /> * Spoiler * <br /> <br /> When the unknown girl is about to commit suicide, was I the only person to cheer her on? The cliché of classical music, the long shots, the melancholy emotion of the film at this stage reversed the meaning of what was planned. I would have been happy only if she entered the room and the whole cast was inside with her scissors to cut her wrists. <br /> <br /> Why? <br /> <br /> Because I went to high school ... and I'm really sick of dying to see one movie after another in Australia with teenagers only based on terrible scenes the clichés. I've been waiting a long time for a young person to write a movie that can identify with this piece and this piece of emo garbage based on stereotypes is what I have instead. It was like a dark version of disappointment that required a predictable end. <br /> <br /> Why are all teenagers in Australian drama depressed or do they have really strange problems that are not plausibly said? <br /> <br /> On the plus side, it was funnier then "fuzzy". And I needed to laugh a lot.
