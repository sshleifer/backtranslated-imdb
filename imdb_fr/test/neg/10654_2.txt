This film is terrible, it was so hard to believe that Katie had become a sincere teenager with the power to save the pity of the Chinese. The film showed no convincing argument to prove it. And the rest of the plot has made no effort to show us more than common sense ... <br /> <br /> The plot is ridiculous and the only thing we can extract from it is is that it shows how an arrogant human can be. Katie must have inherited her arrogance from her mother, the most boring character I've known for a long time. <br /> <br /> The acting and the sets were acceptable, but the plot ruins everything, full of inexpensive clich√©s and hypocritical scenes, I hope not to see this movie again in my life. Skip this one!
