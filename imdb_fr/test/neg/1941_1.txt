Does anyone remember the first CKY, CKY2K etc.? At the time when it was about creating incredibly cool stuff, rather than watching Bam Margera behave like a spoiled, 5 year old, super / rock-wannabe tote. <br /> <br /> The show was awesome, however, Bam's fame and wealth led him to believe that we now love him as a childish and silly child, more than cool stuff, that was once in the ex. CKY2K. <br /> <br /> The acts are so repetitive that there is nothing new, apart from a boring stupidity and repeated comments ... We only see Bam Margera, so busy showing us to what He does not care. how much money he had or anything. <br /> <br /> I really do not have much to say other than to make CKY2K, because Bam sucks .. <br /> <br /> I like to watch Steve - o, Knoxville, etc. a thousand times more.
