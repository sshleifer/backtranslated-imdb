I do not agree with Dante describing the zombies supporting the Democrats as creatures with an average IQ of 23. I think their behavior should reflect an IQ lower than that of an IQ Pelosi ... A single-digit number , please. . <br /> <br /> The MOH series is quite uneven, and it's the worst episode. Dante, yet another foolish Hollywood liberal (or an apolitical na√Øve who screw up left wing formation to resume his pitiful career?), Must have finally realized that his directorial duties had been stuck at slow speed for almost two decades now we have come to this subtly indulgent left "satire" of the Bush administration, Republicans and capitalism. Maybe he felt he had not been openly political before. He would not be the first without talent to use silly political propaganda to advance his career, while all else fails. Creator of types such as "Piranha", "The Howls" and "Morning", Dante was a contributor as useful to the kind of horror that Adolf Hitler had been to peace in the world. <br /> <br /> TH uses humor at the lowest common denominator, affordable and predictable gags that even the most blue of all members of the blue collar union would have no difficulty understanding. Or have you ever seen a liberal, intelligent, subtle, and intelligent satire? Populist manure has the lowest of all messages. Therefore, the language and manner in which this message is communicated must be as simple and basic as the name of Sean Penn. And what better way to send this message to the mutton who eats popcorn than two Tinseltown losers who sniff cocaine and who have all fallen so low that they are forced to write for television ... > <br /> I do not want political propaganda, neither left nor right, in any type of film. But to place it in horror - of all kinds - is a testimony to the endless stupidity that reigns so high in Hollywood's anti-intelligentsia. Dante was so insipid that he did not even notice the hilarious suggestion that zombies would vote for Democrat ... (That's what you get to finish a film school: it's not a source of wisdom nor useful knowledge, far from it.)
