Let me see ... I saw all the movies that Lou Ferrigno made. I saw Batman & Robin ... twice. I memorized the Breakin '2 dances: Electric Boogaloo ... I watched Blade Runner's unfinished student films ... but this movie is the most painful thing I've ever seen. <br /> This was the first film for the "directly to the video market". So you can thank Blood Cult for all those mysterious Michael Dudikoff movies on your local Blockbuster. You should know that this is not even a high quality video. This is consumer grade. This is your father's video camera, he never uses. That's what you have to watch for 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> I will not bore you with the details of the plot because I start falling asleep thinking about it, but I will tell you that watching this movie is a form of torture. I only watch this film when I feel angry with myself. I recommend this film if you are suicidal or ready for a big challenge. <br /> <br /> If you rent this movie (God be merciful), you'll know what you're going through. First 10 minutes. That's when you're struck by the usual intro of the horror movie. You know the chorus. There is a lot of suspense and accumulates before the death of a girl. Yes, you've seen it before, but not like that. This is the most boring intro I have ever seen. Honestly, I think you can buy a camera for $ 10 on ebay, catch the buttocks that smell the most gin and sweets and tell him to film your mother preparing dinner and that is more interesting than this intro . It bored me to tears. I cried like a baby. <br /> <br /> Actors are another of the things that make this movie incredibly painful. Yes, I did not play well. BELIEVE ME. I saw 4th grade Oliver Twist productions with a more realistic dialogue. The main actor makes me sick. The actress "support" is the wreck of a human. <br /> <br /> I will not even comment on the boyfriend. Real horror. <br /> <br /> Rent this movie if you can find it. You will never be more depressed than you spent $ 3 for something else.
