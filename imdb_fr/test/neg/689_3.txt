This film is a cinematographic collage of gangster clich√©s. The writing is grade z and the plot and the story are built without worry or logic. It's a messy pastiche of stereotypical gangsters (think of Bugs Bunny cartoons) and silly secondary characters (the doctor and the writer). Bogart's films are much better. In fact, Bogart seems to have slept during this performance. He puts very little effort into this character. I think the board he received was something like, "He's a bad guy, act bad." This guy is the equivalent of Darth Vader at the time; obvious, evil and anti-hero. Do not waste your time with this one.
