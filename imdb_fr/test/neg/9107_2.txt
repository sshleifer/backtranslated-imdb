Wow ... that's the kind of movie that makes you wonder who got that idea and what soup they eat right now. To say that it was bad is an insult to the bad movies we all know and love. <br /> <br /> When I saw Guttenberg's name in the TV guide, I thought it would be a parody ... maybe it should have been. Could have made a better movie. <br /> <br /> Look for the scene where they are in a plane in full flight with the door open and where there is no wind. They could have at least counted among the fans. <br /> <br /> Look for several Canadian actors and c-list in the movie. This is the kind of movie you'll find in fixed-rate cable channels that you never watch, except on a rainy Sunday.
