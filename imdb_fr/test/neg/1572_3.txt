An awaited remake of a beloved musical classic and a bitter pill he had to take. Very, very difficult to swallow ... all that. There was no ounce of credibility anywhere. And when you do not have Rose, you do not have a show. <br /> <br /> Bette Midler seemed born to play this role. Yet all she could produce was a pretty, funny, sumptuous brand, Bette Midler ... weighed down by all the familiar Midlerisms. Roz Russell has nothing to fear. She can rest in her grave knowing that she is still the definitive mother (of the film, anyway). <br /> <br /> I thought Midler was really going to get it this time ... to get into what's been one of the greatest musical roles of all time ... as she did in "The Rose". But no, she played caution. She played herself. She made Rose a total caricature of dinner theater. Even his songs were uninspired. It was infuriating to watch, knowing that Midler had the talent to rise above his job that was making money. She promised only once in this "Gypsy" and it was with "Rose's Turn". But at that moment, it was too little, too late. <br /> <br /> Cynthia Gibb, the star heroine, gave the film her only spark and when Gypsy's role surpasses Rose's, you know there's a problem in River City. <br /> <br /> A huge disappointment.
