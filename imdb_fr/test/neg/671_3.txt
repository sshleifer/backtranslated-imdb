I am surprised that so many comments on this film are positive. After reading the book several times (and all the other historical novels by Mika Waltari), there is no way to say much good in this film. If I forget the origins of the story, I could consider it a pretty good epic. Of course, bringing such a brick to a book on the big screen is a task that should not be envied, but it could be done with class. I do not understand why even the name Nefernefernefer had to be abbreviated to refer only to Nefer. I love Peter Ustinov because Kaptah and Marlon Brando would probably have created a better Sinuhe, but the general attitude is too Hollywood to do justice to the book. Note that Mika Waltari left the prime minister of this film in the middle of the screening. That's how he liked it.
