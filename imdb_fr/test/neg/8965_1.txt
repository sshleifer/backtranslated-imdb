This movie is really amazing, in every sense of the word. I could not believe what I saw and heard and I did not believe it anyway. Hepburn is probably my favorite actress, but it was ridiculous. Being a hill myself, I know how it should look and it's not the focus of Kate's Back Bay. The only thing that makes me more funny is the fact that the character who played Charlie Chan so many times, Sydney Toler, was chosen to be part of the group of hillbillies, with a corresponding accent. Maybe it was a joke, do you think? I can not think of any other reason for such a particular cast. Well, maybe this. I noticed that Natalie Schaefer, Lovey Howell at Gilligan's Island, appeared in this play on Broadway. Can you imagine what role she could have played?
