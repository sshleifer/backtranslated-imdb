Terrible. Absolutely terrible. Long, confusing and unrewarding. After about three hours of this painful mess, the end is really the last nail of the coffin. Even the beautiful, sexy and beautiful goddess Francesca Annis can not save this poor adaptation of Agatha Christie's work. The plot hangs and trails and time passes slowly and suddenly, you realize that you do not even have any idea what's going on. In the end, even with the usual explanation of the villain, there is still much to explain and ?? It's finish. A total waste of time and without a doubt one of the worst adaptations to bear the name of Agatha Christie.
