I only saw the first part and concluded that I would not miss anything if I did not watch the second episode. Cinematography was fine, but apart from that, the plot was as banal and banal as any other war story. The actors and actresses play their characters without any passion and the makeup is really bad (Heiner Lauterbach with his white hair and Kai Wiesinger, respectively, as if some dyed white hair could give them more dignity and common sense). I mean, if you watched more than two or three films about World War II (like most of us), then you would only have to see a third or a fourth if it promises to new ideas or twists in the scenario. But Roland Suso Richter seems to be afraid to do it, you can almost feel his fear of not living up to the bourgeois and jejunes expectations of the conservative ZDF TV channel while watching this movie. Millions of euros have been spent to perpetuate boring and unimaginative German films. These millions of dollars could have been spent on three or four independent films, but no, let's give a director who will make a film that tells people that war can be explained by rational means. My advice: read Joseph Heller or Kurt Vonnegut instead. They will tell you what the war looks like! Or give me a million euros and I make a better movie than this load of BS! Another thing: why are German films only nominated for Oscars when the film deals with the Second World War or the Holocaust? Probably because it's the only thing German cinema is good at. And that should make us think, is not it?
