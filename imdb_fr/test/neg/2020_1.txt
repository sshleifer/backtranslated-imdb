My God. And here I thought there was no worse director than Uwe Boll. <br /> <br /> Imagine the number of decisions needed to produce a movie. Conceptual approval Script writing. Dialogue edition. Molding. Design of sets and accessories. Selecting the location. Acting. Timing. Cinematography. Lighting. The music. Audio and video editing. Direction. <br /> <br /> Now, imagine that each of these decisions was wrongly made. <br /> <br /> Result: Dracula 3000. <br /> <br /> For a film supposed to take place in the 2900s, this film looks amazingly like a cheap gangsta movie of the 1970s. together is ridiculous for the period. The dialogue is atrocious. The timing of each scene is ridiculous. The acting game is beyond the abyss. Everything stinks. <br /> <br /> Just take accessories, for example. If you have a film shot on a space cargo ship built in 2900, what is the probability that it will have the exposed piping and hydraulic doors of a 1960s tanker? What, technology has not changed for 900 years? The "Professor" uses a standard keyboard and Radio-Shack switches to "reprogram" the computer. What, they have not yet understood the control of the voice? Of course, the Prof is attached to a wheelchair. With wheels Even though, you know, they have intergalactic hyperdrive ... but apparently not even a powered wheelchair, let alone a floating, or bionic legs or anything like that. And apparently, this freighter was carrying an intergalactic shipment of rosewood caskets. As is practical. Then there are the weapons - the crew carries standard firearms from the late 20th century. In a boat. In the void of space, where a single plate would kill them all. Nice planning there, accessories department. <br /> <br /> Oh, why continue?
