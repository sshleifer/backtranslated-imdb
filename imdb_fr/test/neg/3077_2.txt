Usually, I start my criticism by explaining how and why I watched the movie I'm reviewing. With that, I just can not explain. The next day I had to get up early to get to work. The last thing I wanted to do was watch a movie I did not know anything about. But something kept me stuck to my comfy futon while I watched this Heather Graham vehicle. Oh that's right. Boredom. <br /> <br /> Graham plays Joline, a bohemian nut case that seems more obsessed with her marriage vows than the guy she married (played by Luke Wilson). When her husband decides to go looking for better things (probably work, women and scripts), Joline starts a fanatical quest to find her husband and free him from his "spiritual wheelchair". Looks like I'm inventing that, but unfortunately I'm not. In fact, this is little more than a current exercise for Graham because it lamentably plays a role in this role of Phoebe from Friends. Oh and Goran "ER" Visnjic is also present, for some reason. <br /> <br /> The television schedule was like a comedy, but I missed laughing nowhere. I was struck by the fact that it was a personal trip for Lisa Krueger (the director and screenwriter), in the same mold as "Girl, Interrupted", but it even made more laughter. Graham's character is just too self-centered for the public to care about and I felt sorry for the husband dressed as a chicken as he bravely fought for his release from his clearly mental wife. Very little of this film made sense, the characters just appearing in the story as if they stood there, waiting for Graham to appear as the extras of "The Truman Show". In fact, the only positive note I could draw from my scribbles was "Heather Graham - nice baps". And it's not because I was too tired to enjoy the movie. <br /> <br /> In truth, it is very difficult to think of anyone recommending this film. The Graham purists (a VERY small number of moviegoers, you will agree) will have to commit to watching these slags and the hippie students who collect the captivating Indian dreams will get something out of it. I was surprised that the average rating (at the time of writing) is 5.0 - which would make this movie a success as good as "Die Another Day" and "Gothika" in my book, but this is just not right. "Committed" is a weird mess of a movie that does not entertain or enlighten. It's complicated, useless and just too boring for my taste and probably yours too. Do not even think about watching this.
