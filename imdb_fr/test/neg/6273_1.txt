My paraphrase above the slogan on the back of the DVD box sums it up: this movie was much more horrible than horrible. <br /> <br /> This is the worst movie I have ever seen since I remember. My wife accidentally rented it thinking it was Tom Cruise's version. The ridiculously gross special effects on the menu screen should have warned us. Free nudity already present in the opening scene has made us even more suspicious. <br /> <br /> But as the film progressed, we were stunned by an awkward game - both on and sub-actor - a non-continuity in the making and editing, the banal writing and the raw special effects. We gave up after half an hour or less; After starting that badly, it could not be better. <br /> <br /> Since I despise critics who panic a product without giving details, here are some examples of particularly troublesome moments of the film, even if they are equivalent to spoilers: <br /> <br /> - The author says goodbye to his elderly son while he is about to leave with his mother, the latter thorny because it's their wedding anniversary but the advance does not come because of sudden affair . The son asks, gently worried, "Will I ever see you again?" It may be supposed to be a premonition, but an incongruous behavior for a child of this age in this situation. <br /> <br /> - A huge alien spacecraft crashed to the ground and sat in a huge crater. . A crowd of people stands nearby, scrutinizing the scene with concern but seemingly indifferent. A woman finally says "it's normal"! <br /> <br /> - After this craft has devastated a village and its inhabitants, the leader and a passerby, now alone near their home and trying to charge their car for an escape, exchange something like this, on a softly puzzled tone: <br /> <br /> "What was this thing, anyway?" "I do not know ..." <br /> <br /> - The army blocked a crowd trying to evacuate by a bridge, part of the bridge having been destroyed. When a foreign ship fires an explosive, the crowd starts to flee, apparently only because a director told him, not because they are afraid or they run a real danger, not to mention unusual circumstances . <br /> <And so on ... writing on the film is far from the experience of actually seeing it. But please, please, save yourself the trouble, even if your morbid curiosity is stung! The film is so bad that you can not even enjoy it in unintentional humor (for example, King Vidor's "Solomon & Sheeba" with Yul Brynner wearing a wig). Life is too short to lose looking at such nonsense. There MUST be something more productive and fun to do, such as walking the dog or cleaning a birdcage.
