This is a terrible redesign of a very good movie called "Up In The Air" with Frankie Darrow, Mantan Moreland and Marjorie Reynolds. I could only spend about 20 minutes before turning it off. Almost all the lines are identical, I do not know why they redo the movie. I totally disagree with a previous post that does not like songs (again the same ones), in the original song is first rate, I'm not sure if Marjorie Reynolds actually sang herself, c is difficult to say since the voices were usually added later, and the songs are very good, surprising in a movie "B". If you have the chance to see the original, it is available on DVD. You will be pleasantly surprised.
