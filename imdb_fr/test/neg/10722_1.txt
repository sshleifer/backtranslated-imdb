The low rating given to the film is the focus on unemployment and the suffering we have to endure. Although this is good for the drama, in comedy, we know that it is not necessary to insist on pains. As a result, having fun with Dick and Jane is not an appropriate title and I was disappointed that I could not have fun with Dick and Jane. It is true that it is a copy of the film of the same name, but it fails during the execution and the title is not appropriate for the story. <br /> <br /> However, if the film has been renamed as such. "The Art of the Steal" and the focus on wacky comedy takes more on the fly and plans to fly (stupidly of course) would have given the film a boost. At the same time, the film should show the CEO, at least in the beginning, that he is a crook, so it will be easier to project the pain to an early leader and stay away from it. The film suffers from a problem of point of view and in this spirit, a comedy can not work if the point of view is not done correctly. An intriguing husband character who is that of a Wile E. Coyote on the Road Runner would be funnier, including burlesque comedy. But in this case, flying instead of capturing a complicated bird would be extremely fun. I mean you can do a lot and put them in the movie. But as the point of view was poorly done, the stolen part had to be limited. <br /> <br /> You'll enjoy the movie the first 15 minutes (during Jim Carrey's big rise), but make sure that the problems you encounter are more comical because it's a comedy, it's the part that needs a major overhaul. It may be funnier if the problems encountered were more like John Travolta's civil action during the fall. This film was serious but the problems they faced were somewhat comical.
