Wow, I was told it would be a movie B to watch. I feel that I was misled after seeing this event in preview. The plot is at best a twisted series of several movies. Even the title is a version of another movie if you can give it so much credit. I'm sorry to say that I was taken to the cleaner. I would not want to waste your time on this one. This film seems to be a bunch of wannabes that came together and made a bad idea of ​​a movie on a weekend with a borrowed camera. Being in the entertainment industry, I can judge a decent movie and this one deserves to be put aside or thrown away. My advice, stay true to a classic like the Dawn of the Dead of 1979. On a scale of 1 to 10, even a 1 is nice for producers, because this movie BLOWS. (Below the limit of what sucks) Producers need to stay with their day jobs. If you watch the movie, be honest in your comment, this one seems to have been packed and inflated by a few. There are some who have seen this for what it is and have posted correctly. Sorry, but I must say that is a case to ignore.
