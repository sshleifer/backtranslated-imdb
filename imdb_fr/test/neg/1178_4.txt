There are many reasons why I'm not a fan of fact-based films, but more than anything else, it's the way filmmakers allow themselves to create their films. If they have such an imagination, why not use that talent to create something original? Otherwise, stick to the facts. It could have been a good movie if only they had done it. Ed Gein was an extremely scary human being. It was said that if you had to group Michael Myers, Jason Voorhees and Leatherface into one person, Ed Gein would always be sicker / scary. So, why can not someone make a film about him that can transmit it? When will they understand that reality is ultimately more frightening than fiction? <br /> <br /> I read books and watched the news about it. Now, I'm neither a screenwriter nor anything else, but I think there is enough documentation on Gein that there should not be much writing to write it. a story about all these atrocities he committed without creating murders that had never been documented. I am aware that he was only found guilty of two murders, but with all the evidence found at his home and in his barn, there should have been many other ways to mount this film rather than using the MP's relationship with his mother and his girlfriend as a filler, and way too much. <br /> <br /> I guess what I'm wondering is ... why, at the end of the film, I knew more about the secondary characters than about Ed Gein? Why did not we get to know his mother, father and brother and the relationships that bind them together ... What made him the psychopath he was ... what abuse did he get? he endured when he was a child who could have contributed to the man he became? Instead, the only thing we had from his childhood were flashes of him as a little boy ... running. <br /> <br /> Finally, I give it 4/10 stars. It's 2 for gore and 2 for Kane Hodder. Even though the cast was bad in my opinion, since Gein was a small man, and probably effeminate, Hodder was anything but small and far from what I would consider feminine. Maybe I was just excited because he was Jason Voorhees.
