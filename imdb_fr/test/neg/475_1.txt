I just saw this film last night during a preview screening at midnight (I work for an independent theater chain in Colorado - that's one of the benefits) ... I'm sorry, but this is one of the worst movies of my life seen! I know there are Bruce Campbell fanatics who (like uncompromising Star Wars) are shooting you from the nearest tree if you dare to talk bad about their beloved movie icon ... nonetheless, Campbell's work from The Chin is a black hole in celluloid. <br /> <br /> Before you start on the assumption, I'm a big movie lover who only looks at "real" movies like "Ladies in Lavender" and "Sideways", think again - I'm a big fan of B movies, and Bruce Campbell in particular. His Ash character is one of my favorites and his portrayal of the old Elvis in Bubba Ho-Tep was phenomenal. <br /> <br /> But hey, B movies still have the potential to be reeeeally, reeeeally bad (and not that "good" campy way that we all love) ... and that's what watching this particular person was like for me and my colleagues. With the exception of this tracking shot where Bruce runs through the square and scares the kids, there was nothing to laugh about. Overall, we found that the story was stultifying, the mollasses in the back, and the so-called humor more stupid than a bag of hammers. (I'm sorry, but the character of Ted Raimi's "Pavel" was not a comic relief ... he was simply retarded!) Believe me, we all went in this desire to really love that, but we We felt incredibly disappointed and stripped hours. <br /> <br /> If you absolutely love this film, consider to see it several times, if you want to get married and have children with him, etc., it's fantastic - we all love what we like judgment of me. But do not question the sense of humor or loyalty of fans of those who do not have multiple orgasms in front of Campbell's latest cinematographic coupe. In my humble opinion, this movie was a smoky shit sandwich ... and as a true Campbell fan, I'm allowed to say it!
