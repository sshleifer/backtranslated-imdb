This film was an embarrassment. Ulma Thurman seemed to have some kind of illness and John Travolta seemed to be walking in his sleep. I was expecting it to be a rather rough sequel to Get Shorty, not a half-cooked remake of the movie exactly the same (except that some characters have different names and clothes) <br /> <br /> I would not recommend this to film to my worst enemy. I feel that I was scammed and Hollywood once again made me see another horrible sequel (I also suffered from Alien Vs. Predator). <br /> <br /> The best thing I can say about this movie is that it has my vote for the worst film of 2005!
