This movie was terrible. Biblically very inaccurate. Moses was 80 when he took the people out of Egypt, the film is about 40 years old. Moses was about forty when he fled Egypt, he left for forty years and stayed with them for forty years. He died at the age of 120. He was denied the privilege of going to the promised land. I realize that movies use a lot of "poetic license" because the Bible story is not that long, but if you make a Bible film, they must always reflect the known facts and retain the general flavor of the main biblical character, this movie . fails in this aspect, and in many others. Although the 1956 version is also problematic, it was much better on a theatrical level.
