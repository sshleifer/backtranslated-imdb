Although the figures are higher compared to other sectors of society, I do not oppose the extremely high salaries of many artists and athletes today. <br /> <br /> A-Rod, LeBron or Brady have all made good 8-digit deals, or the low 9 area. Ray Romano and Jerry Seinfeld could become billionaires thanks to their emissions, huge residues and the fees they currently charge. Even their members of the cast and all members of the group "Friends" have reached nearly 7 figures per episode. Letterman's earnings for a show could solve the financial problems of most people, and a week or two would occupy several for life. <br /> <br /> But all are based on sound supply / demand principles and on the financial benefits to their employers. And all perform their work with talent. <br /> <br /> But then comes someone like Rachel Ray, who achieves a level of pay far beyond any apparent level of talent or skill. I find it strident, annoying and with a forced "force" that is as fictional as the proverbial "3 dollar bill". <br /> <br /> A friend of mine is responsible for special meetings, events and convention projects for his company and its subsidiaries. One of the main sources of talent is hundreds of clients, ranging from $ 5 to $ 10,000, with a handful of clients earning $ 200,000 or more per appearance. (This area includes Trump, Seinfeld, Lance Armstrong, Robin Williams and Larry the Cable Guy - no kidding.) <br /> <br /> There is a larger number between $ 100,001 and $ 200,000; The list included personalities such as Bill Cosby, Steve Martin and even Larry's benefactor, Larry, Jeff Foxworthy. <br /> <br /> This category includes Rachael Ray. I guess I must admit that the demand for his "talent" and his offers may be enough to justify his talk show. Some of them may be paying more than $ 100,000, + first-class airline tickets, hotel suites, all expenses and door-to-door limousines for a few hours at the event organized by their organization. <br /> <br /> I can not understand how this could be possible.
