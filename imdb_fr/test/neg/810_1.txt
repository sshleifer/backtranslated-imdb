If I could give this film a negative note, I would do it. Humor is the most cruel I have ever seen in a movie. Horrible things happen to the right people and people who have already suffered terribly without any fault from them. There are 2 plots, none of which can support half of a movie. Where is the "depth" that others see in this film? That no good action goes unpunished? That only the heartless can succeed? The film starts well and the black and white is very dark and well done. The acting is very good and convincing, which makes the cruel humor even more horrible. If you think that the 3 Stooges are too nice to each other, if watching the decapitation of a kidnapped kid with a Bowie knife is a real thigh thief, if you thought "Schindler's List" was hilarious, this movie is for you.
