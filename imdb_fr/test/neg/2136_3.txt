WARNING: MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS <br /> <br /> The ripples in the wake of the first movie "Jaws" were still important in the 1980s and beyond. The movie monsters have gone from radioactive monstrosities to unknown and voracious beasts hiding in the unexplored recesses of human experience (the ocean, deep space, genetics). Although "Jaws" was a milestone in this particular area of ​​cinematic horror, few films were able to match the visceral impact of the original. "Shark rosso nell'oceano" (aka Devil Fish or Red Ocean), is a faithful follower of the original formula of "Jaws". After the brutal killing of several boats and unfortunate sea passengers by an ocean creature, there is an initial desire to discover the beast, then a failure to study it without horrible results and a last effort to destroy it. Although the filmmakers have tried to breathe new life into the equation by adding elements of technology and corporate conspiracy, the result is nothing short of disastrous. This film plunges under its own weight: appalling editing, fragile game and cheap fears. <br /> <br /> The most awkward feature of "Devil Fish" is its cookie cutter mounting. From the beginning of the film, when 3 different scenes are mixed, the viewer feels that the film lacks technical credibility. It seems that the editors cut the scenes around a musical score instead of cutting the film and then making the necessary changes to the music. In addition, each cut is broken and it seems that publishers have never heard of the terms "fade", "erase" or "dissolve". The impact of scenes can never settle because they are immediately cut after one last line and a new scene begins. Ridiculous camera towers abound, for example when two of the main characters share a private moment on the beach and a kind of accelerated image of their act is composed on their body. <br /> <br /> The music is just as bland. The creature's theme is a hopeless copy of the "Jaws" theme with slight variation. Although I like to keep my criticisms devoid of MST3K influence, Mike aptly described the dark score as "soft core music porn". Do not produce tension in a film that relies so much on it is a deadly blow to "Devil Fish". The acting is obsolete, the relationships disconcerting and all the conspiracy is laughable. There remains the question: if genetics had reached such a level to create a huge monster-sea monster to protect the interests of the oceans, why could not a more practical use be given to a better humanity? One of the few positive aspects of this film is the idea of ​​the monster, even if its presence is less than stellar. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie is bad enough to dive below mediocre. If "Jaws" had never been realized, the film could be qualified as a medium because its subject would be new and exciting, even if it had been executed inefficiently. Unfortunately, as a true copy of Spielberg's original thriller, he sits very comfortably on a pile of cheese.
