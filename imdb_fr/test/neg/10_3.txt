Years ago, when DARLING LILI was playing on television, it was still the widescreen and digitized version, which I hated and decided to wait to see the film in its appropriate widescreen format. So when I saw an inexpensive DVD of this Julie Andrews / Blake Edwards album, I decided to buy it and watch it once and for all. <br /> <br /> My boy, what a terrible movie. It's so bad and at so many levels that I really do not know where to start to describe where and when everything is so bad. Looking at it now, it's obvious to all film fans that Blake Edwards created this star vehicle for his wife, simply because so many other filmmakers had won gold with Andrews in musicals (MARY POPPINS, SOUND OF MUSIC, THOROUGHLY MODERN MILLIE, etc.), but also because Andrews was snubbed after playing in projects made famous on stage by Julie herself (CAMELOT, MY FAIR LADY, etc.) because Hollywood thought she was not sexy or glamorous enough. So Blake created this stillborn effort to present his wife in a bizarre mix of spy stories / war movie / romance / comedy / musical comedy. DARLING LILI suffers from multiple personalities, never knowing who or what it is. Some specific scenes are good or effective, but overall, it does not work at all to the point that it's very embarrassing. <br /> <br /> Notice, the version of the DVD is that of the "director" ", or in this case," get all we can "from this famous failure at the box office By publishing the DVD, Edwards cut out 19 scenes (19 !!!!!!!!) of the inflated theatrical version in a simplified and remarkably ineffective version.The film goes by without any idea of ​​what it is.This is 25 minutes and we still do not know not what's going on or why we're watching what's going on, what kind of spy is Lili, how powerful is she, has she ever been responsible for someone's death, instead we're looking at a Rock Bored Hudson trying to woo a Julie Andrews who seemed deeply bored The inexplicable reason why the two fall in love is useless Why does Julie fall for Hudson Why he and no other men with whom she got involved? There should have been one of his ex trailing in the ages, trying to win her back or trying to decipher her secret. This would have given us a much needed contrast with the confused action. It would also have given us a bit of enthusiasm for the slowness of the procedure. There is no catalyst in this story. <br /> <br /> Just look at the cut scenes to see clearly that Edwards and the writer have come up with ideas inspired by previous Andrews (and Edwards) successes. The best (or worst) example is the scene where Andrews and Hudson follow a group of children singing in the middle of a forest. Edwards channeling SOUND OF MUSIC. No wonder he removed it from the DVD. In 1970, this scene may have worked at a certain level, but today this moment feels desperation. There are other elements of the plot directly inspired by other Andrews / Edwards films. The endless scenes of dogfights are inspired by the much better MODIE MILLIE. The musical moment "I'm going to give you three hypotheses" was created solely to make fun of Julie's character, Mary Poppins, who became "hot" with Julie doing a striptease in the act. The end, seen as the crow flies from Julie running towards the Hudson plane, is another "nod" to SOUND OF MUSIC. <br /> <br /> The whole thing is confusing. Julie plays a singer, born to a German father and a British mother, who lives in England but sings her songs (English) in Paris. You never know exactly where the story is going. Some moments are just badly edited. Like when Julie and her "uncle" are on horseback. They talk and talk and Julie suddenly comes out in the middle of a sentence. I am like "what happened here?" <br /> <br /> The comedy pieces are not funny and worth cringe. All the scenes with the French police are pathetic. Where is Peter Sellers when you really need him. The action is stupid beyond belief. When Julie and her "uncle" travel to Germany on this train, the Hudson squadron fires bullets into the train, almost killing Lili. Brilliant. What is also funny in this scene is the two people who leave on the train in the middle of the night, but Hudson and his squadron reach the train even if they take off the next morning. It's a slow train that goes there. <br /> <br /> The musical moments. The beginning is the best part of the whole movie (and the reason I gave it 3 stars), but its effect is considerably diminished as it is repeated in the end. Speaking of redundancy, do we really need to see a scene of can-can, a striptease scene of Crepe Suzette and Julie undressing? The "Girl in No Man's Land" is OK, even though the bleeding is obvious, but that moment makes no sense, as Lili is singing it in front of a group of wounded soldiers in a French hospital, which makes me wonder: how many soldiers were wounded indirectly by the result of his espionage? <br /> <br /> The whole project is without energy and without energy. The romance is 100% amazing. Rock Hudson is way too old and tired (look at the museum scene). Julie looks stunned, as if she were on Valium. But what really kills this ill-conceived project is Julie playing a German spy. Edwards desperately wanted to dispel the Mary Poppins Syndrome that affected his wife and thought playing a traitor was a good career decision. Although I like Julie, it is not Greta Garbo, who has done so well in MATA HARI. Funny enough, even though Julie plays a German spy, she's still cute and nauseating. <br /> <br /> What is the fate of DARLING LILI? Even after 37 years of existence, Blake Edwards felt he still had work to do for the release of his DVD.
