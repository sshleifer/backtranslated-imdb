If you read Errol Flynn's autobiography, My Wicked, Wicked Ways, you will see that this film is full of poetic license. It's not that it makes a big difference, because Errol Flynn was still quite generous with a poetic license in autobiography. No need to worry about spoilers, because there is nothing to ruin. <br /> <br /> For me, it would make more sense to use the story of a fictional Hollywood actor; then you could go out and find a better actor than Duncan Regehr to play it, and you would not have to worry about the public saying things like, "But he did not have a mustache in Captain Blood." Another disadvantage of this film is that it shows Flynn as a two-dimensional character. Flynn was a smart man, well educated, well read. This film focuses solely on his funster image. <br /> <br /> Regehr is a disaster. The rest of the cast is struggling with their scripts. Hal Linden agrees as Warner and Barbara Hershey makes a credible Damita, although Lili Damita herself does not think so. <br /> <br /> The best thing to do with this film is to forget it and let it slip slowly into oblivion. So, I can not imagine what I'm writing this for.
