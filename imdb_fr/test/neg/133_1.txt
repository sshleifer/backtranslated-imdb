Writers, directors and producers are increasingly betting on the end "surprise". The old art of closing a film, taking all the information we have learned throughout the film and carrying them through, has been lost. Now, what we have is a film that, no matter how complex, detailed or frivolous, can be completed in 5 minutes. Everything was in his head. This explanation is the director's safety net. If all else fails, or if the writing is not as good, or if we run out of money to finish the film, we can always say "everything was in his head" and finish the film. The public will buy it because, well, none of us are psychologists and none of us are suffering from schizophrenia (we do not know it), so let's take history and believe in it. After all, the mind is a powerful thing. Some movies have succeeded. But these movies are the reason we're getting more and more of those crappy ends. Every director / writer now thinks they can do it because Fight Club did it and that brought him a lot of money. So we have movies like The Machinist, Secret Window, Identity and this movie (to name a few).
