Ok, I went to this site before watching this movie, reading the comments, feeling pumped (because they were all very good for a B-movie), I watched it and I was completely disappointed. The main characters wanting a solitary revolt straight out of the Midwest act were disgusting, and did not even get me started talking about the two cops. The plot was completely predictable, the editing was rather limited, I swear that the publisher even slouched towards the end when he cut the film, and the direction was darkened by a bad cinematography. Now, please, do not get me wrong, I like B-flicks, some are really good. <br /> <br /> You want to watch a good movie rated B ??? <br /> <br /> Dave recommends "High Voltage" <br /> <br /> http://imdb.com/title/tt0338095/
