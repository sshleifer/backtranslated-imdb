Something strange is happening in Loch Ness. The water is crystal clear and not cold. A giant robotic plastic monster emerges and kills Scots! Which movie is this? First, I like reading stories about Nessie, the sea monsters in general. When I saw this for sale, I thought it was a cheap joke scam. No, it was terrible! The story was in vain, playing 100% waste, the only advantage was the cool mechanical Nessie they used. It was full of inaccuracy, bad location and everything. Not worth it, just leave it on the shelf (or trash) on which you found it. As a second note, this film was shot in Cailifornia and not in Loch Ness, a major dispute for fans of Nessie.
