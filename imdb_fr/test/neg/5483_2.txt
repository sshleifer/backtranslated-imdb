The comments already left for this show are much more fun than the show itself and they are all accurate. I am very much in the same direction: I am very disappointed to see how much Rick Mercer fell while doing very good things in This Hour Has 22 Minutes. He does some studio work on hot topics but they are never funny at all, just really sad and predictable jokes about the headlines. Most of his show is about going somewhere to talk to people. For example, this week, he goes to a rodeo and the videos make funny faces and be afraid of wild horses, etc. has become a lot less funny since we left This Hour Has 22 Minutes and this show is no fun anymore. Now that Air Stuff is no longer in the air (well, thank God!), Mercer and This Hour Has 22 Minutes must be next on the list, just a tired, predictable old comedy that almost no one will find funny. It's sad, considering that Rick Mercer was the funniest man on Canadian television!
