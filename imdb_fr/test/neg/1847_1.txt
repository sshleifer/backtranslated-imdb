It must be one of the worst movies I have ever had the misfortune to see. The general idea of ​​a coronal mass ejection striking the planet Earth with an electromagnetic disturbance is fair enough, but where did they get the idea that humans could survive at a sustained temperature of 150 ° F? The acting was so horrible that I had the impression that the casting agents had just grabbed a handful of people on Santa Monica Boulevard and threw them in front of the camera. In all honesty, I saw less wood playing on my ironing board. Sorry, but this movie was poor, poor, poor.
