I had to read I know why the caged birds sing in my English class and we watched the movie after finishing it. After watching the movie, I regret to see. This completely removed the impact of the book. The scenes had no meaning in their sequences, the acting was horrible, and it seemed that the scriptwriter never took the book, but rather chose the cliff notes. I was scandalized by the way the film ended. Nearly half of the book has been cut out and some aspects are extremely important to Maya's growth as a person. If you read ... Birds in Cages, this movie will spoil the experience of the book, so I warn you not to see it.
