Othello is about to burn the eyes of the audience of this film. The misrepresentation of Shakespeare's characters and the terrible interpretation of Desi & John's love made this film an incredible horror. By far, Othello, directed by Jeffery Saks, is beyond mediocrity and atrocity. <br /> <br /> The film Othello is a pitiful drama about the love between John and Desi. Their fidelity to each other will be tested by the friend of the man. In the opening scene of the film, it is clearly demonstrated that the love between John and Desdemona is inseparable. Moments later, Ben Jago, John's friend, appears on the screen scary viewers and showing them immediately how liar and eager to be able. <br /> <br /> By far, this movie was much more horrible than the Shakespeare novel itself. That said, the number of good games is minimal. For example, the love shown between John and Desi was very well described and it seemed that the couple was so inseparable; as explained in the book. Although the love between them was exceptionally well shown, it still did not show the jealousy that Othello had between Cass and Desi as well as he should. <br /> <br /> Love, jealously, deception, this film is based on the three main topics discussed in Shakespeare's novel. The novel, however, really explains how it all came together much better than the movie could. For example, the conclusion of this story ends much more differently in the book than in the film. Many more details are also put in the novel. That's why this movie is a disappointment, believe me, those who read it will also find it disappointing. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, this film is by far the most horrible representation of a novel published by humanity. By avoiding seeing this film, viewers will not only save an hour and a half of their lives, they will also save one or two eyes from the unpleasant face of Ben Jago that escapes them.
