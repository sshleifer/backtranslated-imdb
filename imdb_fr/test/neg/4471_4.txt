Steve Martin has always had the respect for me to be a very funny comedian and a very good actor, and I loved "Airplanes, Trains and Automobiles" and "Bowfinger" - but "Bringing Down the House" is not certainly not one of Martin The funniest of works, and it does not even seem that it tempts, which is simply sad ... <br /> <br /> I do not know; maybe I did not like this movie because I rented it with "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets" and "Phone Booth", two great movies, or maybe because I'm used to it to do it a lot better than Martin, or maybe it's just because I'm in a bad mood today ... Anyway, this movie was just not very entertaining or entertaining, and I never managed to make more than a smile or a low laugh at the gags of the film, which is really a shame, since the extracts of this comedy were so promising! I was expecting "Bringing Down the House" to be a comical party, and I was certainly expecting more funny comedies and interracial laughter from Martin. Instead, we are "treated" to see Queen Latifah wagging all over the screen, trying to do her best with her totally uninspired character. Eugene Levy is the funniest thing, but he does not even get the time he deserves on the screen. <br /> <br /> I really would have liked to enjoy "Bringing Down the House", but I would find it very difficult to recommend it to anyone except Steve Martin's hardest fans . Ignore it and rent instead "Planes, trains and cars" ... <br /> <br /> You will have a better stay.
