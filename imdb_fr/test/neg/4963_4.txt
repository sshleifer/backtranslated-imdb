Think of this film as a fan service, a dream for the fan of the slasher genre. We begin with a bloody prologue that has virtually no connection to the rest of the film. Nine months later, the real story of the plot begins: the virginal Mandy Lane is coveted by all the jock and nerd of her school and is invited to spend a weekend on a ranch by three guys who think they can be lucky. Bimbos obsessed with their weight and size. So ... you have a group of young students in a house in the middle of nowhere on a dark night, who want to do nothing but make love, take drugs and drink alcohol. The only other company is a hunky ranch-hand with or without Gulf War syndrome. Hmm ... maybe a future suspect? <br /> <br /> So, as you've probably already noticed, all guests of the house end up being slaughtered in various ways, and to change, the Black is NOT the first to die. However, some conventions still hold, like the barely dressed baby who is chased by a car in a field. Or the lights go off mysteriously in the evening as our "heroes" unwisely separate to tackle the problem. Even in the end, the film is like an old 1980s horror update for the 2000s, and on this point it succeeds. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, he also inherits many of the problems of movies of that era too, namely the slender characters and the predictability of the entire company. People are injured, injured, injured, etc., but because of their innate hatred towards the public and their stupidity to be in these situations, it is difficult to worry as the bodies are siding. Someone is murdered, one of their friends will pick them up alone, BANG is brown bread. Rinse, then repeat. Maybe one day we'll have a scenario with plausible, intelligent and friendly characters who make rational decisions, but who always end up being thwarted by a genius killer. Until then, we must tolerate teenagers find themselves under a deranged hoodie. Oh well .. 4/10
