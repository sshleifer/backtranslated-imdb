What a bad movie, the places were all there, the actors were all there. And yet, a credible plot, a good dialogue, characters to report a little lacked. <br /> <br /> The typical booty has been misinterpreted on a backdrop where everyone is trapped by the system. The main character Tye and his little brother have been unlucky and their house is going to be taken over, and godfather Matt Dillon (who does not look much older than Tye then does not really know how it's done) went to the rescue with a plan to steal money from an armored van on which they work as security guards. Tye has a brief flirt with a conscience but decides to accept it. And so begins a really awful hole mounted on 30 minutes of incredible waste. I will not list all the reasons why this movie was unrealistic, but let me tell you the main ones: <br /> <br /> Because of the fact that Tye decided to be a good guy because a homeless man has become a close friends, including his godfather, die. His godfather, who is supposed to be a family, and the man who brought him to the last minute to help him die, helped him die because of Tye. Failing his friends and his godfather destroys all the money. The money came from the same bank that was taking possession of his house. And yet, he chose her over the supposed family of Matt Dillon. <br /> <br /> There are many more, needless to say, this film has been shot and I sincerely hope that no one else will see it.
