This film has started quite well, remaining fairly faithful to the atmosphere of the book even if the acting was not excellent. The soundtrack was badly bad. Saxaphone and electric guitars? It was terribly incongruous. The singer was really dreary! In the second half of the film, the story takes a significantly darker turn. Too dark for Austen. Northanger Abbey has become a dark and scary place while in the book she was unfortunately tamed and modernized in Catherine's eyes. <br /> <br /> Who the hell is this marquise with horrible makeup and wig? A totally foreign and useless person. <br /> <br /> One of the key elements of this book is that the general is not a Gothic monster like the characters in Catherine's books. His monstrosity is much more complicated in his oppression of the minds of his children and his treatment of Catherine based solely on money problems. He does not lock up his wife or kill her, but he sends Miss Morland alone, in a rental car, for a 70-kilometer trip, with little money to pay for it. Only the thought of her friend, Miss Tilney, giving her money on leaving, prevents her from getting stuck. This whole point is seriously embroiled in the film. They make the general too dark from the beginning. <br /> <br /> Peter Firth should not have been singing! This part was painful to watch. His portrayal of Tilney was not too bad but it was dark in places. Henry Tilney from the book made Miss Morland's fantasy play during his trip to Northanger but he was never in the dark. Firth would have benefited from a better direction. The young woman who played Isabella needed a better coach. John Thorpe was suitably obnoxious. The combo vest with stripes and coattails he wore was awful! It certainly suits his character. <br /> <br /> I think the film would have done better with a completely different soundtrack. He threw an oppressive veil over the entire film. If I watch it again, the sound will be turned off and the subtitles turned on. Maybe I would give a 4 to the movie. <br /> <br /> The sound quality of the DVD was rather poor. The quality of the image was not much better. It is obvious on a digital television. <br /> <br /> When I think about what this film might have been, I think about Persuasion with Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds.
