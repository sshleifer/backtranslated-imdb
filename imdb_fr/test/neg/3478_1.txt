Plankton, or Creatures of the Abyss as I am sure, is more commonly called & filmed under the title Creatures of the Abyss appears on a moving image & in the same type of font as the rest of the credits, start with five 20 something the children, Mike (Clay Rogers), his girlfriend Margaret (Sharon Twomey), sisters Julie (Ann Wolf) and Dorothy (Loren DePalm) and a pesky fool named Bobby (Michael Bon) who decide to enroll in a small inflatable boat and go to sea, do not ask why, because I do not know. Oh and the complete idiot Bobby has left gasoline behind and has never thought of telling anyone about it, so it's no wonder they find themselves stuck at sea without gasoline for the engine and to make it worse. things, they are trapped in thunder and thunder. discover a corpse floating in the water. Shortly after their luck seems to change when they meet a yacht and potential safety, everyone gets on board the yacht and begins to explore. First, they find a scientific laboratory with various specimens of fish and computer equipment, and below, they find cabins fully furnished and luxurious. They find a chemist (Deran Sarafian) who seems crazy and who can not speak. They eat fish in the fridge, causing Dorothy to vomit green vomit, beetles and slugs. They learn that these fish live in fossils thousands of years old and have been contaminated by toxic waste dumped in the sea. They fly, mutate, bite and are generally unpleasant. I really can not be bothered to continue with this plot, so here's what I think ... <br /> <br /> This Italian production was produced and directed by Massimiliano Cerchi under the pseudonym Al Passeri. (I would hide under a different name if I made such a bad movie) & I think Plankton is simply one of the worst movies of all time. There are so many problems with this movie that it's hard to know where to start. First, the scenario of Richard Baumann is total shit, it makes no sense and it is so slow and dull that it was a torture for me to sit still. Why would five people simply go to the middle of the ocean on a rubber boat, barely big enough to accommodate them all? What did they plan to do exactly? Why do we often get point-of-view views of these fish creatures when they seem to be totally invisible to the characters, as they are never shown on the screen even if they are right next to a character, and how do these fish move around the boat as there is no water to swim? People's actions and reactions to things are all wrong, they are constantly dividing, they make weird decisions that simply do not make sense in the situation they are in and part of the dialogue is also horrible than anything I heard. I could talk all day about all the holes of the plot and ridiculous activities, but I'll run out of space if I do it. The fish creatures themselves look awful, a mixture of rubber puppets and a really bad motion-stop animation at the end, the scenes where they interact with the human cast also have a horrible aspect with bad taxation. I've heard a lot of comments saying that plankton is bloody, do not make me laugh! Forget it, there's practically no blood or blood in Plankton, there are some gooey scenes where Bobby turns into a fish monster while making love with Julie, but it's pretty brief and he does not kill her, he drips two tentacles grow on her and a fish head comes out of her mouth. Later, Julie's vagina begins to sink a little black mud, but that's all, we never really see what happens to him or what it is mud. Dorothy has a fish creature coming out of her back, out of the screen, and control but again, we never see what happens to her while Margaret commits suicide, a very short plastic harpoon stuck to his forehead. The coarsest scene is easily the one where Dorothy makes this green stuff with what looks like beetles and slugs. That's it, only one person dies on the screen and for the most part, the plankton is pretty docile and as exciting as watching the paint dry and I almost fell asleep it's so boring. I do not see how anyone can like this total shit, I simply can not. The acting is dreadful, the dubbing is awful, the characters are awful and I hated them all. From a technical point of view, plankton is also a predictable shit, with a budget estimated at only $ 250,000, all I can say is where did the money go? The sets are monotonous and boring with a lab and a few cabins, the special effects are at the bottom of the barrel, including the most fake boat that has ever exploded, the cinematography is bland, the music is zero, the atmosphere is zero or the tension is total. Plankton, as the name implies, is as low as possible in the food chain. I hate plankton, it's awful in all aspects of its 86-minute duration. Do yourself a favor and avoid it at all costs unless you are a masochist or insomniac.
