CHE! is a bad movie and deserves its reputation as an unintentionally funny movie. It addresses a serious subject and presents it as the version of Cliff Notes or Classic Comics because there is not much emotion nor appropriate story - just connect episodic segments with "stories true" mostly stupid relayed by a variety of yutz. /> <br /> This is a ridiculously deserved film because it is poorly written and misinterpreted. However, what I found most interesting about the movie is its apparent gay subtext. Instead of Che Guevarra and Fidel Castro working towards a Communist Cuba, they seem to be more of a homosexual couple - Che behaving shyly and distantly and Fidel as a fiery suitor! Again and again, the film teems with beautiful phrases like when Fidel implores Che "Cuba needs you .... I NEED YOU !!". I'm not sure the studio has planned this homosexual sub-stream, but it does not take a brain surgeon to recognize it! I am very surprised that other critics did not report it. However, if you remember when you watch the movie, it makes visualization a lot more exciting and even more fun. <br /> <br /> A final note. In recent years, Che has been very classy - even a fashion statement with a horde of brain dead teenagers, who have no idea who he was, wearing shirts adorned with his face. Considering he was a cold-blooded killer and a nihilist (a strange combination for a doctor), this new respect for man is disgusting. What will they do next, put Hitler or Dr. Mengele on t-shirts and posters? !!? Even conscientious Communists should be frightened by the bloodshed Guevara was responsible for, and I find it ironic that people with computers are defending a man who could possibly have killed them with a half chance! <br /> <br /> Given how stupid and unintentionally funny this film was, it has no impact on the message that Guevara was not a hero. I would love to see a realistic movie of his life - with the good and the bad, but also with dialogue and intrigue that apparently have not been created by chimpanzees!
