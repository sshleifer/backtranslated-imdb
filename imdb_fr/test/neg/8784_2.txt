Would it surprise you that my ears and eyes have almost bled while watching and listening to this horrible movie? My eyes almost bled, watching the dreadful animation and the tasteless story, without intrigue, empty. My ears almost bled as I listened to songs that seemed to have been sung by a chorus of howler monkeys. Then, my brain almost melted because of the lack of intelligence of this film. It's a formula every step of the way. Talking to animals is one thing, but a penguin able to fly just to stay true to one's dreams can become schtick reality? Show a little more faith in the children's intelligence please. Next to Rock-A-Doodle, it's one of Bluth's worst.
