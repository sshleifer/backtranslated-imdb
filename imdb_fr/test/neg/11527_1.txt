Sure, you can put a model of a device on a black background and call it sci-fi, that's enough for me to be interested, so if you're like that, Black Horizon will interest you at least before you watch it. The best part of the movie is when they rehearse images of a shuttle launch. <br /> <br /> The film plays like the Naked Gun series, imitating cop drama with bad shots and bad acting. Unfortunately, I do not think they wanted to be funny, the actors are really cardboard, the dialogue is really bad, so we must laugh at it, and not with them. <br /> <br /> A side note, it is rare to see a film that takes place halfway in space, half on Earth, and does not mix with extraterrestrials and expected supernatural events. I really feel bad for a more realistic drama based on our space projects.
