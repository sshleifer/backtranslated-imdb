The Macbeth play was written by William Shakespeare between the years 1604 and 1606. Since then, many other versions of the play have been produced, including remakes completed in 1948, 1971 and 2006. Akira Kurosawa even directed a Japanese version from Macbeth in 1957 entitled "Kumonosu j√¥". The play begins when King Duncan hears of the success of two of his generals, Macbeth and Banquo, in a recent battle against the Irish and Norwegians. After a quick promotion of Duncan, Macbeth immediately feels the sensation of lust, greed and power and does everything in his power to access the crown: even if it includes a murder. <br /> <br /> Geoffrey Wright attempted to create his own version of the famous piece in 2006 by placing it in the modern underground world of Melbourne. Imagine a humble Macbeth killing hundreds of soldiers with an AK-47 and hitting his own interpretation of "Low" at the same time. I'm joking about the latter, but one of the things he does is to pronounce the traditional Shakespeare. And he continues throughout the film. It is true! Shakespeare meets the ghetto. That's all you can hope for! Do not?? The newest Macbeth is brutal and violent enough to be compatible with any other modern action movie, but lacks decent acting, good jargon, and good camera workmanship. <br /> <br /> The modernized film begins with Macbeth (Sam Worthington) who works as a drug killer / drug dealer for Duncan (Gary Sweet), a drug lord from Melbourne, Australia. After being promoted to Duncan by The Thane of Glamis (as predicted by the three witches), Aspiration begins to seize Macbeth as he sets his eyes on the throne. After promoting Macbeth, Duncan comes to his home for a night of drugs and alcohol. Before the start of the festivities, Lady Macbeth (Victoria Hall) asks Macbeth to kill Duncan to take power on the throne. After the bodyguards are drunk and everyone is asleep, Macbeth sneaks into Duncan's room and stabs him to death. After his murder, Macbeth takes all of Duncan's business, including the hidden title and crown. As soon as he thinks he gets what he wants, he discovers that it will take more than corruption and flight to solve his problems. <br /> <br /> One of the main flaws of the film is the acting game. Macbeth, who once seemed flamboyant and powerful, turns into a wet chicken. And he looks like a sad puppy throughout the movie. I do not really know if it was Worthington or Wright's fault, but anyway, one of them should have realized that Macbeth was a king, not a newspaper knot that took everything his woman had to say literally. As I said earlier, Macbeth should have been rude, arrogant and mean. But when his character becomes a drug lord, he also changes his personality, I suppose. On the other hand, Lady Macbeth really caught him off guard when it came to recognizing and personifying his character. She did not look as mean as she was in the play or the 1971 version, but she reminds Macbeth that, compared to murder, all he could do was not at all. <br /> <br /> Another thing I did not like was all the nudity. This mistake must have been Wright's fault. Witches did not make fun unless you followed in your birthday suit. At one point in the film, I started to wonder if I was watching Macbeth or Unique Positions Vol. 2. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong when I say that I find the Shakespearean dialogue irrelevant. It is spoken perfectly, but when it is spoken by an Australian gangster, it's really weird. When Macbeth starts killing people, he lets them know by talking to them in ye Olde English. Macbeth contains a lot of action, blood, blood and nudity to last a lifetime. You forget all the positive facts when you start thinking in yourself: "OK, what did he say in the last sentence?" At times in the film, I do not even think that the actors themselves knew what they were saying. The new age of the film could easily have been removed without the "You" and the "You". <br /> <br /> The camera work was just right for me. One thing I could not handle was the constant comings and goings between the characters. The technique of the camera used released this atmosphere of Blair Witch and made me vomit a little in the mouth. Matt Reeves tried to try the same concept of camera work in Clover Field, but it just does not work. It makes me want to get out of my chair and look around to find the little storage bags they have placed on each seat. <br /> <br /> In retrospect, the gangsta 'Macbeth has a positive point: a lot of action. Apart from that, the film contains nothing more than an uninspired acting game, a proper use of English and a spinning camera work. The soundtrack contains one or two identical songs, but each song is edited or remixed differently for each scene. There is never an interesting or captivating media variation used. From now on, the directors should leave the dangerous world of drugs to Al Pacino and Robert Deniro. Future interpretations of Macbeth should be created exactly as Shakespeare had planned 400 years ago. I would recommend using medieval clothing, Ye Olde English, swords and shields and a soundtrack prepared by Enya. But in any case, the modern Macbeth makes you want good folk music, a campfire and a bustier.
