One would think that with the incredible backdrop of the Second World War, Stalingrad, the writers would propose a scenario. Nope. There is no story here! It's like porn, vignettes of violence interrupted by a pathetic dialogue, insane and meaningless. <br /> <br /> A band of Germans runs around a ball and gets shot. Slowly, there are fewer Germans to walk, shoot and get shot at. Then there will be more Germans to walk, shoot and get shot. <br /> <br /> Pretty bad. <br /> <br /> Chilcoot
