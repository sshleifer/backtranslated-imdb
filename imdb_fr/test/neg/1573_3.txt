Bette Midler is the best thing about this movie. This is a bad second compared to the original of 1962 with Natalie Wood in the role of Gypsy. The songs were much better done in the original and the costumes were better. Bette's voice was excellent and she looked better in most costumes than Cynthia Gibb. Only someone who has not seen the original might think it's a good movie. <br /> <br /> There was not enough change between an ugly duckling and a beautiful girl. When Natalie Wood was Gypsy, she was considered as beautiful as when she donned the dress with her gloves for the first time in the burlesque show. When she has her hair stuffed and magically everything is beautifully rebuilt and she looks so elegant, it's an important aspect of the film because it's also the first time Gypsy is seen as something special and she could even be a star. , not just a poor substitute for his sister. And the scenes where she slowly becomes more famous have been rushed. It was an important part of the movie and they slaughtered it. It is essential to show her that she is becoming more comfortable with her future as a stripper and that the costumes are incredible in these original scenes. It was extremely disappointing to see it unfold in this film. I was completely disappointed and if there had not been Bette Midler, I would have closed the film.
