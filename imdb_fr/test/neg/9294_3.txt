A very sensitive subject - a 15-year-old girl, abandoned by her mother as a baby and going to visit her, continues to be ignored, raped by her mother's boyfriend and becomes pregnant. There was not enough depth displayed of this situation. It takes too much time to chase the truckers who carry the baby. (Interesting, this baby with asthma - we never see him crying - except once--, being fed, having changed diapers during the whole truck transport event.) I would have liked to see more interrelations , more attention to the fact that this girl was a minor - this should have stood immediately in court. <br /> <br /> And it was a true story! It deserved better than that! <br /> <br /> If it was not the subject, I would have given it a note closer to 0. I rented it at the library. It was only later that I discovered that it was a movie made for television. <br /> <br /> well
