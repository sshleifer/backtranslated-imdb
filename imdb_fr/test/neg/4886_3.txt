From the late teens to the 1920s, Stan Laurel was a solo actor in the movies. During this period, Laurel was definitely NOT one of the top echelons of talent and her humor was much less equal to that of contemporaries such as Lloyd or Keaton. However, for second-level short comedies, he created a decent niche. As for the quality of the films, they have varied enormously. Some, such as DR. PYCKLE AND MR. PRYDE, were fantastic, while most were of average to below average quality. <br /> <br /> FROZEN HEARTS is a strange movie. Like many films he made for Hal Roach and distributed by Path√© during this period, the costumes were absolutely top quality and the film looked very beautiful. However, despite this and with the support of James Finlayson, they forgot to include humor in this film. No jokes seem to work and the movie is almost like a drama, not a comedy. Only really stupid intertitle cards betray the typical movie it's supposed to be. <br /> <br /> My advice is to try to see all his Laurel and Hardy movies, then see the movies solo. In addition to DR. PYCKLE, try to see THE SOILERS and MUD AND SAND - two of his more tolerable shorts.
