As a "fan" of Genghis Khan, I was eager to see this movie. After devouring Conn Igguldens' epic novels on Genghis and reading many historical records, I know something about it and am delighted to share my knowledge with friends through this movie ... a disappointment. This film is practically composed from beginning to end. There are a few things that seem right but most of the time it's just making writers believe. This should not be a problem, I like a good entertainment, like everyone else, unfortunately it is mostly boring. Nothing of greatness appears in this film. <br /> <br /> I would NOT recommend this movie if you know something about it.
