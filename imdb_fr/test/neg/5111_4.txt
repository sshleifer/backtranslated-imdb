When I typed Savage Intruder into IMDb's search engine, one of the options was Savage Garden: Collection of International Videos: The Story Until Now (1999), the only reason I mention this is that I am a big fan of Savage Garden. & you should do yourself a favor and watch some of their music such as Affirmation or To the Moon and Back rather than bother you with this average boiler, sorry I just wanted to say that. Anyway, Savage Intruder begins with a bizarre montage of what looks like MGM's musical and early sequences, as well as a few rotating portraits that have no long-term meaning. It's the late 60s in Hollywood and in the midst of pomp and glamor, a serial killer works to select aging actresses, kill them and dismember their bodies. A young man by the name of Vic Valance (David Garfield - John David Garfield) jumps from a bus looking for a job when he stops at a now retired actress, Katharine Parker (Miriam Hopkins) who was one of the biggest stars in the world. He now lives in a big house with an elderly housekeeper named Mildred (Lake Florence), a personal secretary, Leslie Blair (Gale Sondergaard) & a girl named Geta (Virginia Wing). Katharine recently broke her foot and needs a personal assistant and gives the job to Vic. Slowly, Vic finds his way into Katharine's affections and, especially, into his big wallet. Vic begins to turn Katharine against the other employees, but Vic is not what it seems. Vic is an addict loon who puts Greta pregnant while having sex with Katharine. Greta threatens to tell Katharine and spoil Vic's sneaky plans, but she's faced with an ax. No one in the house is immune as Vic brings drugs, sex, party rock '& gardening to Parker mansion as his grim plan begins to become more apparent ... <br /> < Written, Produced and Directed by Donald Wolfe I thought Savage Intruder was a bit of a mess, but a little distracting at the same time. The script is everywhere and he can not really decide what he wants to be, Savage Intruder suffers from an identity crisis! The film begins with the discovery of a head and severed limbs, just after another woman (Dorothy Kingston) was killed by a mysterious unidentified character, but then completely abandons the elements of the slasher film that he comes to build never returning them. Savage Intruder then becomes a kind of good movie while Vic befriends Katharine and shows him how to enjoy life again and have an implicit sexual relationship with her, it's actually disgusting to think she is old enough to be his grandmother. Katharine stops leading a lonely life and gives up alcohol while Vic seems to make her happy as she goes to the party together and arranges banquets for Katharine's friend as she did too. This part of Savage Intruder would not be out of place in a Disney movie! From time to time, the boredom of the feeling of well-being is interrupted by the awareness of Vic and his ridiculous hallucinations about his mother (Sybelle Guardino). Then, after Greta's assassination, Savage Intruder becomes a bizarre horror movie as Vic reveals himself to the madness he is. Savage Intruder just does not work like a movie in my opinion because it mixes different genres with little success. Likewise, the mysterious elements of murder do not work and are frankly a puzzle. Why do not you hide the identity of the killer during the scenes of murder, but then specify perfectly who committed them in the rest of the film? Vic as a character did not work for me either, at some point he's a cool, calm, clever and sneaky crook and then he's a complete delusional idiot! Why kill all her other victims but with Katharine, try to convince her? What makes it so different? If it's because she has money, why not chase her? So many questions and so few answers ... Some dialogues from the 60s are quite funny to listen to these days, for example when Vic offers Greta a painkiller, actually drugs, & Greta says: "why I need a painkiller? ", Vic responds nicely" because you're in pain "wow this guy knows how to charm the ladies! Or when Katharine suggests that Vic does gardening and asks "do you have green fingers?" he answers "no, but I'm good at grass!" There is not a lot of gore in Savage Intruder, some cut limbs and a few decapitated heads. There is also a pretty impressive shot when someone is cut off with an ax, which is probably why they are repeated three or four times. You have to see the silly scenes of drug hallucination to believe it. Technically, Savage Intruder is OK, the location in the grand mansion & Hollywood Hills probably gives it a better look than it deserves, the acting is average, just like the rest of the production. Overall, I would say that Savage Intruder feels that this is a mystery of murder that, unfortunately, betrays the murderer and, as a result, simply does not work. At best, it's a punctually amusing and amusing watch at worst, you decide which one!
