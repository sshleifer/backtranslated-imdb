If it's the best film of Commander Hamilton, I have no curiosity for others. <br /> <br /> The greatest tools of an actor are his eyes, but when Peter Stormare wants to show great emotion, he closes his. Five or six seconds later, we admire his eyelids while his feelings remain unknown behind them. Unhealthy game technique. <br /> <br /> Stormare also flinches when he shoots with a firearm, turning his head and closing his eyes. Watch carefully. James Bond can stay calm with such competition. <br /> <br /> There are other interesting performances, but not enough for the whole film to be suspended. The cinematography is beautiful and captures the Nordic cold well. Even the Sahara ends up looking cold. Maybe Hamilton has his own climate with him. <br /> <br /> There are some good action sequences here. Unfortunately, the only sense of humor on the screen belongs to the villain, who turns the hero into a big pill. James Bond's jokes may not be particularly successful, but at least he does not look constipated. <br /> <br /> A positive point in favor of the film is that the psychotic, contorted and vicious hatred of Israel by Guillou books have been left out. What has been retained is the cult of a noble and heroic PLO, which he shows us that works in Libya without the dictator Khaddafi knowing or controlling it. It is hard to believe this fantasy because Khaddafi expelled the PLO from Libya for four years at a time. And at the end of the film, Hamilton offers the PLO a very disturbing gift. Where will they use this gift? Hamilton does not care. <br /> <br /> We are very far from "For whom the bell tolls" here. <br /> <br /> Commander Hamilton will remain a local phenomenon. While Henning Mankell's books are selling well around the world, Jan Guillou will never have the same success. <br /> <br /> As for this film, bleeeeaaahhhhh.
