The story begins in the house of a little girl who is going to organize a birthday party and the father and mother seemed to be acting rather calm and reserved with each other. They then proceed to give their daughter a gift that comes from both of them and it sticks to me the expressions on the faces of both parents when they gave this gift to their child, it was almost like: "I hope that She loves him"! The film is murdered and Catherine Mary Stewart (Julia Kerbridge), "Reaper", 2000, is involved in the case because of family ties. Julia strives to become a doctor and this murder disrupts her whole life. Rob Lowe, (Kevin Finney), "View From The Top," 03 is a neighbor next door in the same apartment as Julia. He ends up going to bed with her and tries to help her otherwise. It's not a bad movie, but it's certainly not crazy, unless you like a Canadian location and a beautiful Catherine Mary Stewart from Canada.
