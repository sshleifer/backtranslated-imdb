Thank God I did not buy this movie myself! I borrowed from a friend who bought it out of curiosity and of course, after watching it, I think they should be refunded! This must be one of the worst movies I have ever seen! I realize they could not have had a lot of budget, but I swear I could make a better movie than watching my pets! The acting was awful, as was the editing, the dialogue, EVERYTHING! It was so bad that it made me really angry looking at him! I'm looking forward to the REAL movie about this story coming out soon so that curious people do not have to stoop to watch this joke!
