It looked cool from the sleeve of the movie, but after five minutes we did not know if it was a homosexual documentary telling a West Side story without any female interest. The quality of the film was mediocre and there was not enough gang fighting to keep the interest of the most drunk people alive long enough to watch the entire movie. May God have pity on the soul of the actors and filmmakers responsible for what I can only describe as my new and unique reason why I will never want to see (or trust) an Australian-made film again. I have to write more to be able to say once again that the actors were so bad that I am convinced that I could make a better movie with fifteen dollars and a box of Trojans. Please do not see this movie for your own interest.
