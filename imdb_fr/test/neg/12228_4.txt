It was only a matter of time that a parody was made of sports movies! And there are a lot of movies to see that we do not care about. But the biggest problem I had was that it's movie recognition. The director and writers of "The Comebacks" forget to be creative. Although I must admit I laughed at some scenes, "The Comebacks" could have been funnier. The actors forget to give their lines seriously and have an impassive face throughout the film. That's what a parody requires and that's the main reason why silly jokes work in movies like this. Because of the cast's inability to do so, the jokes never hit their goal. Some scenes last forever and normally in parodies that should not be a problem. Take "Naked Gun" for example. Their is always something that happens on the screen. In "The Comebacks", they did not even bother to let things happen in the background. Only a few factors make this film interesting to watch! It's always fun to spot amused movies. And Jermaine Williams as Ipod. His parody on Cuba Gooding Jr. as a radio was hilarious! He seemed to be the only one in the cast to get an idea of ​​what a parody is. Not quite bad!
