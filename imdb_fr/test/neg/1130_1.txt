I watched this movie last night, and let me tell you it's the worst thing I've ever seen. The whole movie is a train wreck, and it's not the actors. It's a horrible scenario. <br /> <br /> ** Spoilers ** All right, Eddie loses his job to a monkey. His nerdy son is disappointed. The bathroom goes crazy. <br /> <br /> It enjoys free holidays. He accompanies Uncle Nick and the first Audry. Their boats crash. They stay on an island. They are stupid and do not even care to look at the neighboring hotel. <br /> <br /> OK, that's all. What makes this film pathetic is humor. It's so horrible, hilly and stupid that you can not even laugh. And it's not a funny funny humor either. I could not laugh at all that.
