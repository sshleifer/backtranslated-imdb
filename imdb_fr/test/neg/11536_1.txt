I know that when you buy a used DVD (oops, excuse me, already viewed) for $ 5.99, you should not have high expectations, but even if the price was high for this poor disc canned. <br /> <br /> I will give producers the credit of providing a complex challenge to the viewer. . . to determine what is worse, the acting, the script, the work of the camera, the special effects. . . they are all pretty tied up for just terrible. Oh, there is the worst simulated car accident ever used in a movie, anywhere. <br /> <br /> Now all this is ridiculous for a movie fan who proudly presents "Police Academy", "Naked Gun", "National Lampoon's Loaded Weapon" and a host of other campy records from his collection. But, at least, these people know that their language must be firmly planted in the cheek, the casting of PW, unfortunately uses their language to try dialogue, and although that is almost beyond my idea, the characters of the film seem to think that they could really do something valuable. A pornographer in the background would be ashamed to get him out. <br /> <br /> Oh. Fortunately, I bought the worst video ever made at the same time ... "Fraternity Demon" ... maybe the name should have given me a hint.
