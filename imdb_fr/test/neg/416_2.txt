Ron Howard and his "editors" had only one job to do ... Follow the instructions in the book "rich", "mysterious", "moving" and very cinematic! <br /> <br /> What did they do? They have changed EVERYTHING and I mean EVERYTHING! What is left is something that has no right to be called "Angels & Demons"! <br /> <br /> I really like the book and I find it very difficult to see it treated this way! <br /> <br /> I wonder what Dan Brown's opinion was for "this" movie. <br /> <br /> I really do not have the patience to sit down and correct the 1,000,000 changes they made, it's useless .......
