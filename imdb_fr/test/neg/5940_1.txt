The film shows the relationship of the dying mother and son, who is very attached to her and definitely loves him. What does he show? This shows their lives in very bad conditions. This shows with what tenderness they "walk" (in fact, he brings it back). But what do we see further? After their walk, he walks alone to the same places, where they walked together. It is not possible. A person who loves another dying person and who loves him, would do anything to improve his life. He would not have a free minute to meditate, to be alone with himself, and if he finds a few minutes a month for that, he would flee the places where he should normally be. Something else. The author dedicated this film to Andrey Tarkovsky. We see that he has learned a lot of visual effects from Tarkovsky. But in Sokurov's film, they are only effects, they support neither sense nor mood. Someone compared this film with "Mirror" ("Zerkalo"). There is nothing in common except these visual effects. "Mirror" is an excellent film and this one is just a bad imitation.
