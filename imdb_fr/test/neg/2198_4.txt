Computing . Can there be something more boring? Sit in front of a computer all day typing keys all day, touch, touch, touch. This is largely the problem of this film. The heroine sits in front of a visualization screen tapping the keys of the keyboard and whatever the number of agitated looks she gives, or the number of touching notes that the composer hits or how many extreme close-ups the director uses He There is not much excited about the fact that there are few things less exciting than watching someone on a computer <br /> <br /> There are some other problems, too many factual errors concerning the operation of computers. Is it possible to hack a computer that is off and not connected to the Internet? I guess when THE NET was created 10 years ago, very few people understood how computers work, so writers could have used BS for a long time, but since then we've been living in a global village where almost every home in the world Western has its own computer, the public is certainly very aware of the factual errors of this film. And of course, there are too many cases where someone behaves stupidly or out of character at crucial moments in order to advance the plot that makes THE NET a very mediocre film.
