I could not wait to see this at the Sydney Film Festival. I left the theater, like many others, before the end credits because I could not miss it anymore. It was bad shot, the sound was bad and the acting was worse than an episode of The Love Boat. Now, I know why this movie was not able to find an American distribution company to bring it out to the United States. It screams of low-budget high school production.
