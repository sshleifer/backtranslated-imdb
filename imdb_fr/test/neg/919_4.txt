This film is about a troubled actor who seeks to be satisfied with life, especially a love he has not tasted for 5 years. <br /> <br /> This is essentially a film featuring a man with very bad social skills, and he says things wrong all the time. The plot is hollow and artificial. The main character, James, is alone, but this theme of loneliness is not sufficiently explored. This is more like an empty statement from which other subplots come from. Sadness and disappointment after being dropped are superficial. The film is seriously lacking emotions. <br /> <br /> It's not funny either as a comedy. There are funny lining but that's it. It does not miss the joyous and uplifting atmosphere to infect people in a good mood. I do not find "I want someone to eat cheese with" funny.
