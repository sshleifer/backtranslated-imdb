*** May contain spoilers *** <br /> <br /> I was expecting a lot from this movie, based on the trailer. I knew the real Ed Gein a bit, so I thought it was a Hollywood budget-sized version of real events. I was wrong. <br /> <br /> First, the writing apparently came from a student of eight graders who barely knew Ed's story and wrote the script in about 20 minutes. The film goes through the most interesting facets of Ed and his relationship with his mother (not to mention what the real police found at home) and decides to focus mainly on the young MP who looks to have gone astray on the set. In the same way, all the male characters seem to be changing their dialogue throughout the film. I am not exaggerating. <br /> <br /> Do not even get me started with the historical blunders of this movie. Seriously, who the hell led that? This film is supposed to take place around 1957, but the cops are wearing modern batons, some of the hardware from the hardware store seems to come from Lowes, and when it arrives at a public telephone, it dials 9-1-1. did not exist at the time). In addition, Ed was a scary little guy, like the character of Anthony Perkins in Psycho (which was supposed to be based on Ed), and not that beefy guy who ended up looking much too much like the villain of Men In Black . <BR /> <br /> Another thing that really bothered me was that the directors of this movie filmed everything in a set of 3 abandoned buildings. Because of the "smart" camera angles, you never see a real city, and the interior of the sets looked like old, long-abandoned shacks. Open a crate on a saw horse and get started! - Instant hardware. <br /> <br /> In general, I quite forgive the low budget horror movies, but this one claims it. All you had to do was to include most of the actual events (even embellish them!), Pay five good actors instead of 15 miserable actors and, in Pete's interest, take 5 minutes and think of the period from time to time. My advice: Google Ed Gein, you will be much more entertained.
