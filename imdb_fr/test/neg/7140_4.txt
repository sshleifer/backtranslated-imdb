Beside, strange things are happening in their neighbor. <br /> <br /> "The Grudge 2" has frightening sound and visual effects, with the woman and the boy giving goosebumps, and I have surprised several times watching this movie. movie. However, the complex scenario with three secondary intrigues is totally confused, which makes interlaced history a real mess. There are too many characters and situations and at one point I was completely lost with the disconnected and fragmented story. In the end, I was completely disappointed by this confused film, but also sinister. My vote is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "O Grito 2" ("The Cree 2")
