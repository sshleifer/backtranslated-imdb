"Haaaarrrryyy" <br /> <br /> The amplified and unbiased female voice could have been Leona Helmseley in heat, but no, she belongs to Allison Hayes in the role of Nancy Archer, the woman's title at 50 feet. In the most infamous role of her film career, Allison's performance literally rips from the roof. In fact, make some roofs. <br /> <br /> Disgusting, "Aot50FW" tells the story of Nancy, a neurotic and boozy heiress and her soulless husband, Lothario, Harry (William Hudson, who also co-starred in front of The Amazing Colossal Man). Nancy has a close encounter of the third type, in the desert, with a bald giant of space who wears a mini-skirt and gladiator sandals and who loves Nancy's jewels. What he does to her once he's won is probably a mystery, but Nancy is soon starting to grow up. <br /> <br /> Entering the city center with tranquilizers, tightly wrapped in bed sheets, the buxom giant goes to the low-rent living room where Harry laughs for a few moments with a sister named Honey (Yvette Vickers ). The confrontation becomes ugly. <br /> <br /> The Poverty Row f / x gives the impression that the alien giant and Nancy are transparent because of incompetently transposed images. You'll understand why director Nathan Juran changed his name to Nathan Hertz. Juran was no stranger to the realization of giant creatures, human or not, having also directed "The Deadly Mantis", "The 7th Voyage of Sinbad", "Jack, the giant killer" and several episodes of "World of Giants" and "Land of Giants." <br /> <br /> Lots of laughs for all the wrong reasons.
