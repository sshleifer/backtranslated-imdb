The premise of this film seems to be that the death of the Second World War generation in America, with its apple pie character and hypocritical morality, was a terrible tragedy. These ugly hippies have ruined everything. <br /> <br /> What keeps the film going is the excellent performances, especially Lemmon, which is really remarkable. Otherwise, we have a drama of the boring slice of life (just over 24 hours of Jack's life) with pretensions. <br /> <br /> I found a chore to get through.
