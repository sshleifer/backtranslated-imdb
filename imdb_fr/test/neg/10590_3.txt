This is one of the most boring movies I have ever seen. The three main members of the cast just did not seem to click well. The character of Giovanni Ribisi was quite annoying. For some reason, he seems to like to repeat what he says. If he was the "Rain Man", it would have been good, but he is not. <br /> <br /> 3 of 10.
