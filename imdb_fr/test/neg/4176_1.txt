This movie was horrible ... It had absolutely nothing to do with Dark Harvest. And the DVD was very misleading because it showed a scarecrow and a fake, which did not appear in this movie. <br /> <br /> The beginning was a mixture of random scenes that, for the most part, have nothing to do with the film, except that they show in a way that the man is psychic ... but not too good ... <br /> <br /> After the first 10 minutes of the movie, there is only one hour left to find the character for his girls. It becomes vaguely interesting when the girls meet two girls who died the year before. But that's all. <br /> <br /> And why could I ask if this movie was rated R? There were two drops of blood and four curse words. And how did he get to a video store? This film was badly played, badly filmed, poorly written and globally horribly executed.
