This soft-core / science-fiction B SOFT movie is what you would have if you took a Fred Olen Ray movie at first and took it out. Or conversely, it's like a "film" by Uwe Boll, but without so much incompetence. A naughty gang gangster (CC Costigan) agrees to pretend to be a space marshal to stop Kim Dawson's wacky plans to ... get everyone to have sex with everyone (this vile demon). Anyone who has gone into this movie looking for serious science fiction, well you have what you deserve for not doing homework at all. First of all, when did Kim Dawson NEVER play anything other than soft Skinamax shit? Also, take a look at Costigan's CV and the director before telling you that you were expecting something else. Do not get me wrong, for a movie space / action / soft-core / titillation, this movie is STILL not good, but if you expect something like "Contact", I will not complain. <br /> <br /> My note: D- <br /> <br /> Where I saw it: Starz on request (available until December 8, 2005)
