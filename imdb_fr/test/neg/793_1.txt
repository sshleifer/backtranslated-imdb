For the first time in my life, I felt the need to write a review. <br /> <br /> I have seen thousands of movies in my life and I like a wide range of movies. I'm reasonably open minded and can easily say that I liked a movie while saying "yes, it was not good but I liked it". I can appreciate the mastery of great movies like The Shaw shank, the godfather and the American story X. I can enjoy good movies in a genre like horror or comedy, although the film may not be not so great. I can even enjoy a bad movie waiting for me (Bloodsport). I will also try to evaluate the film in a fair way, even if I did not like it. Charlie Chapin's City Lights was not a film I enjoyed, but I really appreciate the acting and the timeline. <br /> <br /> I think that some people visit this site instead of clicking randomly on a ranking, should take into account some ideas. Try to rate the movie based on its quality. Do not let your personal bias affect the rating. Also look at the other movements you have evaluated and compare the movie you are going to evaluate. <br /> <br /> This "film" is the worst waste I have ever seen. 2 hours of my life where I just flew. The acting was awful at all levels. The scenes were at best agitated. However, the real shame was history. During the first 20 minutes, we had a story that tried to make sense to the reader and brought the viewer from point A to point B. But after that, it was a nightmare. They kept trying to add new items, but nothing was explained. Nothing really made sense, the steward was dead, alive, enlightened, enlightened, extraterrestrial, alien, etc. The only good thing was that no one cared about us where we were just happy to leave the theater. <br /> <br /> 6.5 / 10 ??? What is the problem with some of you? I'll admit that the 8 of us were so crazy to see this, we said to ourselves: "What could improve it?", And we decided to tell some friends that this movie was good for them to suffer and see this film. What can I say misery like the company. That's really the only reason I see a score of 6.5. <br /> <br /> Do not lose your life!
