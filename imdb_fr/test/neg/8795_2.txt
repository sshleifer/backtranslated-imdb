<br /> <br /> To make this short film: I hope that this film will not be considered as the founding work of the "great Asian" of American cinema. the acting was mediocre, based on stereotypes, loud voices and exaggerated sodomy to get one's message across. chris chan park does not dive very deeply into one of his characters, allowing them to remain angry / frustrated / distant / non-communicative caricatures of Asians. these representations do not make the characters mysteriously attractive; it makes them confused and unfriendly. I like to think that we Asians are more complex than that. <br /> <br /> I left the film without being convinced. not convinced that these characters had a long life bond, like a blood brother, to go to the end they did to help their boyfriend go out. not convinced that the main character had anything but a superficial attraction for his girlfriend. not convinced that hardworking immigrant parents would not pay for their son's college education. not convinced that all the characters were even necessary, namely: janet, who is put to bed in the back of the car and quickly forgotten. <br /> <br /> the line of the story, which I actually think had a potential, was not allowed to come into play for two reasons: 1) flat characters for which I had no sympathy / affinity, 2) the plot is eclipsed by insignificant scenes of non-sequitur, such as the silly / useless sequence Seance / Donut Shop with Amy Hill. <br /> <br /> I congratulate Park for his efforts, because I'm sure the production of the film has been a lot of work and I'll give it the benefit of the doubt. I am a beginner / screenwriter, but I sincerely hope that next time he will go a step further. The fact that this film is one of the first of its kind to talk about the American experience at the Korean scale does not mean that it is automatically good.
