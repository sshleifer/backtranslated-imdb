Okay, first of all, I missed the first 15 minutes of the movie, so I missed credits and stuff. So when I finally got to that, I thought, "Who's this guy?" I discovered that it was several hours after watching the movie. <br /> <br /> Flex did not look like Michael Jackson. Not a bit. He could not dance like him or move like him, the only thing he almost had was the voice. People have commented on Elizabeth Taylor, but I can not really talk about it because I do not know her very much. <br /> <br /> The whole film was like madness. The dialogue was nil. Cinematography, if we can say that it sucks. The soundtrack was nil. The game sucked. Yes, even Flex ... I'm so pissed off about it. I did not want it to worry. I'm so sad that Flex was told he could get away with it. But it all looked like a dressing. You know? It's like no one seems to have to, except Joseph Jackson. <br /> <br /> The concert sequences were simply nil. I'm sorry, but Flex can not dance like Michael. I mean, how on earth did VH1 think? The makeup did not match as much as the time of what Michael was going through. For example, in the movie, it was still dark when Neverland was attacked for the first time. In real life, MJ was as white as hell. There was a kind of stupid delay in her skin that was fading. <br /> <br /> The movie was not boring, good for me it was not. It was not really anything. I was so pissed off about everything that was wrong. I wanted to see how it went and whether Flex could redeem himself. He does not really have. The only part I found a little interesting was the whole story of Lisa Marie. When they fell in love It was good. But I had to turn my face when they kissed. He h. And only two parts made me collapse laughing. The first time is when they cut Michael with short hair, you know the era of Thriller, to Michael with the long hair of the Dangerous era AND HE WAS STILL BLACK! It was fun. The second time I laughed was when they showed all the posters and all the memories of Michael, but they had the face of Flex instead! It was so funny. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie was a cheap trash. It was just two hours of dressing and it could have been so much better. But no, VH1 is not expensive. Look if you want. But this movie is not funny, considering its ridiculous. I came out of there with a feeling of anger. And when I found out it was Flex, I started to feel so bad. So ... look if you want.
