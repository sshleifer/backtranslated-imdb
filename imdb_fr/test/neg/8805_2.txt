I'm normally a glutton for mediocre movies, but this thing feels nauseated. <br /> <br /> Do not watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Terrible effects and very little humor. to make this film? No gore to speak and no acting to talk about. <br /> <br /> I could only manage 45 minutes of this failure of a movie, which is rare for me. <br /> <br /> Something positive to say about this drivel? the cover art was OK, I'm pretty sure the movie has an end too, even though I did not succeed. <br /> <br /> The rats were not organized and were constantly blowing, they lacked intensity and seemed to just go through the steps for their paycheck. The actors were worse.
