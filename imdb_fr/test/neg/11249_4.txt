Barbershop 2: Back in Business was not as good as its original but was just as funny. The film itself lacked little things that the original held which made it much more enjoyable. Back in Business seemed to be just another worthless sequel made to make money with a very slim plot. Cedric the Entertainer's terrible apology for the flashbacks ruined the film and seemed like a bad way to try to get the audience to adapt more to the character. Overall Barbershop 2: Back in Business was a useless sequel, without the charm, soul and spark of origin.
