I saw this movie and I really like horror movies. <br /> <br /> I did not know what to expect, but as soon as the film arrived, it was nice to watch it. The idea was quite original and the acting was nice. Especially Jenna Dewan as an exciting / devilish Tamara. <br /> <br /> The hardest thing about horror movies is to finish well. But here the film failed. To change, a final scene in a hospital, where suddenly all the employees are gone. First, you see doctors and nurses running everywhere, and then they all went home? <br /> <br /> No call for help while Tamara pursued him, Escape on the roof (also a smart move ... not) and leave Of course, a kind of open end. <br /> <br /> No .... the movie started well, the main part was nice to watch, but they really messed up the end using all the clich√©s of bad horror movies. Jeffrey Reddick has failed in my eyes with this movie, having made high quality films such as Final Destination 1 and 2. <br /> <br /> If you like the horrors that await you, Tamara is a good movie to watch. For me, I like movies that surprise me.
