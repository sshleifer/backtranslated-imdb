I will not even comment on the type of waste of this film since it is already established. However, looking at this with my friends, we all burst out laughing when the main girl made a reference to Shelley Hack on the phone. We sat there trying to figure out why the author would throw her into the mix. We can only assume that he had a fixation of Charlie's Angels at a time. Based on this reference, we have assumed that this film should have been filmed around his film Charlie's Angels, shot in 1979 or 1980, but from what I read here, it was shot around 1987. You certainly can not say as much about low production values. It seems like it was done by a student for a cinema class. And although I do not expect a low-budget trash festival like this to be politically correct, the rednecks of this movie have been good for derogatory homosexual remarks. Still, I would only classify it as the second horror film ever made, just behind "Nail Gun Massacre".
