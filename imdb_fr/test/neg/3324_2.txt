I should have known when I heard Anne Rice leave the project that the film would disappoint me. I could not have predicted that years after its release, just thinking about the movie always makes me angry. The novels are extraordinary and, as I understand it, the on-screen translation has lost a lot of meaning, this film has been a major major for its original work. I hope someday someone will try again, in a good way, to start with vampire Lestat. They change the roles and appearance of major and minor characters without good reason. They destroy the story of Lestat. The Queen's game is so far-fetched as to be comic, but I can not bring myself to laugh. The charm and appeal of novels are simply not there. The film is a bad excuse to muster as many musicians and "dark" pictures as possible into one film, hoping that the tiny American Goths would find out. Part of the attraction of the first film, Louis's story, is that he is caught between his humanity and his curse. Lestat is supposed to take over and spread the magic and excitement of the vampire world. Thank goodness, I first read the books, otherwise I would never have touched them after this movie.
