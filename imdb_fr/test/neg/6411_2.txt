The Good <br /> <br /> Carrey is a good actor and he proved it in "Man on the Moon" and "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind". But what can an actor do without a good story and a good staging? He can do the "number 23". <br /> <br /> The Bad <br /> <br /> Joel Schumacher is an overpriced and mediocre director, who has proven it in almost every film he has made. What he did with Batman is just a disaster, but it is likely that Batman's films are supposed to look good. Well, they did not do it. Instead of Gothic and macabre, we had Disneyland. Of course, "Falling Down" was great, but can you ruin the movie with Robert Duvall and Michael Douglas AND with an excellent screenplay? No you can not. <br /> <br /> And the good actor and poor director finally came together and created the "number 23" ... <br /> <br /> The mobster (23) <br /> < I know it's stupid at first, but ... Fingerling's subplot (almost half of this movie) looks exactly like the intro of another chapter of Max Payne2. VoiceOvers, the quality of the detective story itself, the quality of the characters, even the colors, the atmosphere and the music, the editing and the sound mixing too! It may work for the game, but surely not in the cinema. <br /> <br /> The staging is so bad that it becomes funny. It's not even boring. Carrey reads down the stairs in the park? Why? Is it natural? No, but it looks good. Why did Suicide Blond cover the walls of her apartment with white paper? If she just wanted to kill herself? There is no logic to that, but it still looks good. Guess what, it does not look good at all. It does not seem natural instead. <br /> <br /> All female characters are flat. Why is it so? Who cares, let's continue the story. <br /> <br /> Who is this Fingerling? Private eye on suicide? Barely believable. <br /> <br /> The scenes where Walter Sparrow argues with his wife about the weather are really about him and could be the best part of this movie. Instead, we get the Moulder / Scully routine. Disappointment. <br /> <br /> The interiors show no trace of their inhabitants, with the exception of important objects (shoes, photos, etc.). No chance. <br /> <br /> The dialogues are not that bad. But what about V.O. Well that's another story. "Fate does not exist, there are only different choices". Captain evident to the rescue! "The number came after Fingerling, and now it came after me." Cliche. And so on. <br /> <br /> It is obvious that the average housewife would enter a public building in the middle of the night. With success and without being disturbed. <br /> <br /> The sub-plot of the dog driving the main character in the cemetery. It's something so old and so comfortable for the writer, and he should have been banned. I want to say it! <br /> <br /> Backtracking and editing similar to "what happened in the last episode of X-files" is not the best way to present the most interesting part of the movie. Is it? <br /> <br /> I wish I could say that this story deserves a better fate, but it is not the case. It does not mean anything. Told in chronological order is weak and unbelievable. All the time, we have trapped underdeveloped characters, a chain of situations that are just badly written fiction. It could be fun, but since the whole movie is deadly, it's not. For many coincidences, it's just bad for every story. And the "mystery"? It's predictable and easy to guess. <br /> <br /> Losing touch with reality is a great theme for a good movie, but I've never seen anything like it in Hollywood productions. If you're interested in the subject, just look at Polanski's "Repulsion" or something from David Cronenberg, "Spider" or "A History Of Violence", both of which deal with issues similar to those of "Issue 23 ". Wanted, but failed.
