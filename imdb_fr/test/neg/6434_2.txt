Now television programs (at least in England) are full of home improvements, bargain hunts, housing searches and afternoon cooking shows, giving each of the terrestrial broadcasters the opportunity to dig such hours of screen time in a slow afternoon are, to say the least, slim. But in the eighties, the BBC did it, and guess what, I watched it. And it shows the overwhelming strangeness of this American-Hungarian co-production, which I can still remember in large pieces, more than twenty years later. To begin, the eponymous hero appears briefly in the first titles, before disappearing for at least half an hour. (Imagine AN American TAIL reissued so that Feivel is nowhere, and you will understand how confusing it is.) There is an extremely strange animation in which one of the characters gets his mustache finely carved and stretched with a Boingy sound effect that makes it go to the boss's eyes. Probably hilarious if you are stoned, but for a child, quite disturbing. Speaking of which, the famous "hippo cull" scene is represented in an abstract way - clouds in waves hippopotamous shapes are struck by lightning - but it's still rather unpleasant. In fact, this film is rather cold and uncomfortable, a state of sad state of affairs barely helped by its strange production scenery, its muddy colors, its flickering lines, its swollen shapes and this unique gloom reminiscent of that of Jan Svankmajer . Then, to top it off, we have songs from the Osmonds! This film is not so much a horrible movie as a deeply misguided movie, less spooky than a bad trip.
