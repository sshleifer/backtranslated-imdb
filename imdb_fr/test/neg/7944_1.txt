I do not think it's necessary to describe the plot for you because the site and other users have already done a great job in this regard. That said, here is my point of view. This is by far the worst film of 2005, and there have been very bad ones. I do not even need to go into details because there is nothing that redeems this film. Bad game, bad scenario, wrong direction, bad effects - name it. If it's not the worst movie of all time, it's tied to another piece of shit. I would be embarrassed to let my friends know that I was in this movie. But hey, most people who will see him will, no matter what comments he gets, so more power for you. When you feel the emptiness between your neurons two hours after the beginning of the evening, do not blame me.
