The seller Lenny Brown (Woods) is losing his talent to sell ice cream to the Eskimos. A philanthropic entrepreneur has allowed a philanthropic entrepreneur to shine in California, and his wife Linda (Young) lives the busy life of investing in tax shelters. a fortune they lose when the federal government changes the tax laws. <br /> <br /> Seven hundred thousand dollars in the red, and in need of a "boost", the yuppies without a portfolio begin to attract large numbers of Colombians on the move sprinkle their sirens until they end up with hungry monkeys on their backs. After a brief hair removal, Linda's coke-induced miscarriage sees Lenny again becoming a pinball machine between rods and tents. Purgatory then lives. <br /> <br /> A contemporary version of Reefer Madness, with perverse echoes of Albert Brooks' Lost In America, The Boost has been eclipsed by tabloid revelations about an alleged case between Woods and Young, and their draft tumultuous. Woods, then fiancé to horse trainer Sarah Owen (now his ex-wife), reportedly slapped a $ 2 million lawsuit over her co-star despised for "emotional harassment" during filming, citing late phone calls in the style of his fiancée with Fatal Attraction and, in a remarkable incident, apparently leaving a mutilated mutilated doll at the door of it and Owen. <br /> <br /> Ironically, the lack of chemistry between the supposedly loving threads is one of the most depressing aspects of this last day. exploitation film - Woods' only real passion for Young is when he kicks him into the room. The scenario is also hilariously horrible, perhaps lessening the almost comatose performance of Young when screams such as "stay with me - until I fall from the Earth" bother me. Moreover, given the dramatic and edgy characters of Woods, his nervous descent loses all credibility, while he was really looking this way. <br /> <br /> In the end, The Boost must be put in context: in the 21st century, cocaine use is ubiquitous. However, in 1988, when America was still struggling with a "war on drugs," the very fiber of the nation seemed in jeopardy - and therefore one of the most infernal and hysterical representations of the world. drug abuse.
