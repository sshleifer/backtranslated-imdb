Although it is most certainly a well-crafted film, it is totally devoid of entertainment value. <br /> <br /> If you are already depressed, this movie will make you switch. <br /> <br /> If you feel a bit depressed, this movie will be just one part of your life that will make you bitter. You will have the impression that it is your chance to have chosen to watch a film that turns out to be a total waste of time. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, you may be able to go through this unscathed movie (I do not BTW), knowing that your life is so much better than Jim's. Again, you might think that you were wrong and that the situation is actually much worse than you had imagined before. You may feel a little annoyed by Jim for bringing this to your attention. You might want to slap him a little with a wet fish. <br /> <br /> The sad truth is that even though I wanted to love this movie ... I hated it. It took a long miserable path on the path of oblivion and then suddenly, for no reason, turned on itself and then stopped. <br /> <br /> Jim does not have an epiphany, at least not an epiphany. transmitted to the screen. Jim has a miserable life and a miserable set of options. He discovers nothing that one can understand and does not succeed in making significant progress in his self-discovery journey. <br /> <br /> Of course, no one living could write a happy ending to this film. As others have said, it's not a Hollywood tale, it's realistic and real. It is well done. Life is sometimes difficult. If someone knows "the answer", it's good to shout it on the rooftops. <br /> <br /> Still, I feel cheated because this movie claims to have something to say. You feel like it's going to say something, that if you suffer a little more, you'll have something to say. This will make you stop and think. <br /> <br /> This is not the case. <br /> <br /> Once again, I say that this is a well-designed film. And so can be useful to a film student with a penchant for example. lighting techniques of the use of color palettes. <br /> <br /> For the rest of us, it's totally missed.
