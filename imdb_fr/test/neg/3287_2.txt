This show is just another bad comedy that will probably be canceled after two seasons. It's not just that the jokes are sexist / racist / homophobic, they're not funny and clichéd either. In the first episode, the father said something like, "I wish women could not find a job and have the same rights as men. Blah blah blah" It really helps attitudes huh? Then he made fun of his son saying he was weird. Which parent says that their child is weird? So, overall, this show is boring, unoriginal, offensive, cliché and especially not funny. Yeah, offending American dad. But that also makes you laugh and obviously takes micky. It's the difference.
