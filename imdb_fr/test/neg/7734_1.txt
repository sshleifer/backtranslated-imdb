It's impossible to avoid comparing Zhang Yimou's "hero" to Ang Lee's "crouching tiger, hidden dragon". They were big budget Chinese kung fu movies with a breathtaking cinematography of the Chinese landscape and a cast of super stars. But apart from the obvious, there is really nothing else to compare. `Hero 'fails to reach almost every important level, proving that stars, beautiful scenery and action effects are no substitute for a director's art and vision. <br /> <br /> All the hype preceding the premiere of the movie 'Hero' only made his failure spectacular. Highly anticipated, Hero seduced moviegoers when it opened in theaters in mainland China and Hong Kong, making this film an instant hit at the box office. However, although the scenario pleases the government's censors, the Chinese public has reached new heights in bitter criticism and sarcastic wit to express disdain. Online critics, both professional and amateur, have proclaimed the film "disturbing ideologically," "from the point of view of deep servitude," written "by an amateur historian or a person with ulterior motives." An article was simply titled: "Hero, you make me sick!" <br /> <br /> The film's most profound failure lies in its intrigue, not only morally wrong, and based on an unforgivable historical mistake, but - worst of all for a movie - is boring! All successful epic films are known to take certain liberties with the facts of history, but "Hero" surpasses artistic license in an unforgivable ignorance when he tries to glorify an emperor as brutal as Stalin or Hitler. "Hero" does not compensate for this lack of moral compass by being entertaining or amusing. Instead, it lamentably makes a mediocre attempt to be "deep" and just manages to be pretentious and to preach. <br /> <br /> Although historians agree that the First Emperor of China was ruthlessly violent, Mao Zedong was known to have admired this leader - no surprise, given Mao's tyrannical rule. Similarly, the communist government of Beijing sees the allegory that can easily be drawn between the First Emperor and his own methods with an iron fist. They were therefore particularly satisfied with this latest work by Zhang Yimou. Tony Leung, one of the stars of "Hero", said in an interview to promote the film that the Beijing government did well by canceling the student protests because it was necessary to maintain "stability" in China . For these remarks, Tony Leung received shocked criticism in his hometown, Hong Kong, but he merely expressed the underlying message of the film aloud. <br /> <br /> Director Zhang Yimou said his goal was to surpass the traditional values ​​of loyalty and revenge in kung-fu novels and movies to reveal superior wisdom. Unfortunately, his version of "wisdom" turns out to be: THE OPPRESSOR RIGHT. In China, where thousands of years of historical reality have spread this message, art was the last refuge where the individual could really free himself from this tyranny. The great popularity of the kung-fu novel is explained by its ability to escape into an alternative world: a world where kung fu warriors roamed the country in search of adventure and fighting for justice, free to all fear and winners. superhuman skills. It was only in the novel that the individual conquered institutionalized power in China, and only in the novel did the oppressed find their champions. Going against this tradition of the kung fu hero, Zhang Yimou did not progress to a higher truth, as he had hoped, but even lower in government propaganda. It is not surprising that the government was so happy. <br /> <br /> Some film buffs may ask secretly: "All moralistic judgments aside, is this at least entertaining?" Fortunately, the answer is a no! Because the same story is constantly repeated with slight variations, it is tedious to watch. In addition, the three contradictory versions of the same story serve only to confuse the development of the character, because it leaves only very little time to the viewer to feel sympathy for one of them when the version " real "will appear. <br /> <br /> The film is not without its beautiful images. However, all the scenes fall flat because they do not connect and do not improve the scenario. The use of different colors to distinguish different versions of the tale appears as simplistic and artificial, and cinematography appears more conscious than really beautiful. Perfect for a trailer, but a disappointment once you're there to watch the entire movie. <br /> <br /> For the Chinese who showed disdain for the unrealistic 'Crouching Tiger' kung fu, much was expected of Hero. 'Jet Li, who plays the lead role, is a true kung fu artist who won national titles before starting his acting career. His previous films had revealed limited ability to act, but many hoped that Zhang Yimou could fully utilize Li's flexible body movements while assigning him a role that would not bother him. But he did not have to be. `Hero 'is trying to go beyond the kung-fu genre. So there are not many fight scenes. Jet Li is expected to play a difficult role: an inner transformation leading to deep wisdom and self-sacrifice. As the casting director should have expected, Li fails miserably. Meanwhile, the only fight scene that reveals real skill in kung fu is the first of the film, between Li and Donnie Yen. All the scenes that follow are a disappointment, so that "Hero" can not satisfy even at this level. <br /> <br /> Although most audiences outside of China are unlikely to be aware of the historical confusion of the cruel First Emperor's history, it seems even more unlikely that they accept Zhang's version of "Chinese wisdom", which is anything but. Perhaps the only time an audience coming out of the "Hero" screening was seen smiling - instead of yawning or frowning - was during the special screening reserved for Chinese government officials. <br /> <br />
