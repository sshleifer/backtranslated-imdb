My first post at IMDb is (unfortunately) to warn others not to waste time with The Cavern! There is no story, no character development, no fear and no good lighting. It does not mean anything. If you like to play badly, people running through small portions of caves, bouncing cameras placed at a wrong angle and people screaming while the screen is in total darkness, you'll love this movie. I could turn off the lights in my house and scream too, without having to pay the rent. The only thing that scared me was that someone made such a horrible movie. <br /> <br /> ... one of the worst movies I've ever rented.
