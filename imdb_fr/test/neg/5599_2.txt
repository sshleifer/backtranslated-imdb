OK if you are looking for a fun lesbian madness. It's not the movie If you're looking for a fun movie with sociopathic characters (in the name of "cruel intentions" or "crazy things"), it's not the movie if you're looking for a lesbian seductress vampire movie classic. It's not the film. <br /> <br /> However, if you are looking to lose an hour of your life, this is your movie. It is badly written, badly directed, badly marked, badly filmed. He had bad effects ... I mean really bad effects. I think you can actually generate the same special effects in imovie lol. <br /> <br /> IT'S REALLY A BEAUTIFUL FILM. <br /> <br /> The actors were beauties of classic starlets, although they look more like porn stars. It is shot as a soft porn, but you never get the money and the actors all look bored by their brains. the scenes of "girl on girl", which are really nil, were so lousy that there was little need to mention them. Go watch the "almost sex scenes" on youtube because that's the only reason you would want to watch this movie and even if it's not worth it. <br /> <br /> A POINT OF MONEY AND TIME !!! do not even take it, look rather "Cruel Intentions 2" - the same film without the bad effects, the bad script, the bad writing, the bad dialogue and the bad acting of the actors. in fact I could go watch it now just to purge my mind
