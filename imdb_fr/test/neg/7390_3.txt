"The King is Alive" is an imperfect and artificial mess of a film that presents itself as an author self-indulgent excuse for transporting a group of actors in a Namibian desert of Godforsaken where he can play the major role of Dogma-domo and conceive it selfishly, silly and overworked drama with a total disregard for the real forces of human nature, market appeal, common sense and even good art. In other words, it's a stupid movie and if you do not believe it, your penance is watching it. Only for movie heads, critics, dilettantes, etc. (RE)
