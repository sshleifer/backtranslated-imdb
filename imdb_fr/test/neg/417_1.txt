Several commentators have pointed out the implausibility of the plot, especially the immense difficulties that Father McKenna would have faced and the impossibility even of certain calculations that he should have made, including the fact that Langdon was going to decipher each index in a few minutes. McKenna is scored; A few seconds later, he gives orders, and a few minutes later, he directs (literally) the operations in charge - in real life, he would be shocked. And, as usual in thrillers, the assassin does not kill the heroes, giving only lame explanation that they do not appear on the list of people to kill, as if all other innocent bystanders he had killed had killed. I have always used Independence Day as a feature of a really horrible film (the US president requisitioned a jet plane and defeated aliens, ha ha), and this effort is near. Angels and Demons contain a remarkable number of predictable incidents for such an unlikely movie. Who did not laugh knowingly when the assassin went to get his reward in the Volkswagen? I wanted to shout, "You're going to blow yourself up." Who did not know that the heroine was going to find a body in the laboratory? Who did not spot the bad guy? Technically too, the film was awful. The dialogue was more often indecipherable than clear, while the races from Rome to the next church were accompanied by deafening music. In addition, many scenes looked like mud. The photos of Rome and what resembled the Vatican - a feat, because I'm sure the Vatican officials would not have wanted that bullet to be fired in and around St. Peter's, were a valuable asset - and the interiors were convincing. Rome is a magical place and I had the pleasure of seeing it briefly.
