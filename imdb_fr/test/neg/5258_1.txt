I have not seen such a horrible film for a long time. I was hoping that at least Adam Sandler could be funny ... hopeless. Looks like a teenager wrote her screenplay and her father pushed her so far, that someone agreed to shoot him. (Movie) World could be a better place without it, no matter what it is.
