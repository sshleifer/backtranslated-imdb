The two leaders, an Englishman and an Australian filming a report on the Civil War in Romania, do not have the slightest spark between them, are absolutely incredible as lovers and totally unfriendly. There is no story, no characterization, virtually nothing to keep the eyelids apart during this endless party. Renee Zelwegger, also desperately ill-received, is practically putting up the fence poles, but at least looking at her embarrassingly provides comic relief. Nicole Kidman is a decade too old for the role and has no idea what's going on. The weak role of Jude Law could have been played equally by any of the Romanian extras. The only requirement is to wander in the forest, look stupid, watching the parade of guest stars steal the show. It was not important because all guest star roles were completely useless because they did not advance the so-called plot of an iota. And as if all this were not enough, the author found it necessary to add kung fu spinning and swirling at the vault. What was it?
