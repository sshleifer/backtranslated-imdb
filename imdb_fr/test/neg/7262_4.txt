A giant praying mantis is awakened from sleep in the Arctic region and heads south, causing havoc. Boats, planes and trains meet with the flying creature. Before unleashing all his anger on NYC, the praying mantis is condemned to the hands of the armed forces in a tunnel in New York. The special effects are of course rudimentary by today's standards, but for a 10-year-old boy in 1957, it was memorable. <br /> <br /> The stars are William Hopper, Craig Stevens, Alix Talton and Pat Conway.
