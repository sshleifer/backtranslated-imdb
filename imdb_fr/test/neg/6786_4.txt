* SPOILERS! * When I saw the preview for the first time, it looked like a good old brand movie. I love bluegrass music, so I can not wait to see it. When we rented the movie, we read the back and it sounded even better. The movie was pretty boring for the first half, from time to time a song was played. Then (I'm embarrassed to have typed this) a lesbian love saw entered. I thought there was something more than friendship between the teachers, but I certainly did not expect nudity or prolonged discussion sessions. I watched this with my mother and I was quite embarrassed because I chose this film. But other than that, it was a good movie. The acting was good, the actress who played Deladis was great. To be honest, the soundtrack was the best part of the movie. I do not care to see the movie again, but I bought the soundtrack the day after the movie. And there are consecutive records that follow. If I were you, I would skip the movie and get only the music.
