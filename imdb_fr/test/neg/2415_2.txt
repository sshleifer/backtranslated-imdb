The sister of a brave party brother is brutally murdered by a street gang, which sends him into a sudden psychotic outburst. His friends and he slaughter half of the city to bring his sister back to life. <br /> <br /> SAVAGE STREETS appears a year after this film and is more entertaining. Linnea Quigley, who plays a leading role in this film as a sexy (and briefly nude) girlfriend of one of the guys, also starred in SAVAGE STREETS. <br /> <br /> This film is mediocre, although it offers enough free entertainment and nudity escape to please its target audience (me). <br /> <br /> MPAA: rated R for violence, nudity, language and some sexuality.
