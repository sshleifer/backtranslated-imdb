Movies on U.F.O. are always a good way to save time. So it was a rainy Sunday night that I took this film, expecting what can be expected from a live DVD U.F.O. mystery. <br /> <br /> Boy, I was wrong! About halfway through the film, it becomes very obvious that the film U.F.O. The theme is only a deceptive means of attracting unsuspecting viewers to this Christian propaganda. And it's not just a Christian movie of an average Christian. No, it is Christianity of the extremist fundamentalist type. The scary kind. <br /> <br /> At the end of this film, the non-believer is deceived by their colleagues who use a joke thinking that the Rapture has begun (what Christians think is the case at the end of time where the true believers go to heaven and the unbelievers are left behind.) <br /> <br /> When the joke is explained, it is suggested that it is always better to become a true believer, 'just in case we Christians are right. Now, it's the least excuse to become a Christian if you ask me! <br /> <br /> This film always tries to convert non-believers using an alarmist tactic. "Believe in God or you will go to Hell!" is the message here. Simple, but quite offensive, really. Especially because this film is sold as something completely different. <br /> <br /> Suppose now that you are a Christian fundamentalist and that you will not be offended by the themes of this film, is it a good movie? I'm afraid not. No, actually I'm lying: I'm GLAD it's not! The acting is horrible, the pace is horrible, the plot is horrible, especially the end is ridiculously bad. As soon as the film starts, you immediately feel that it will be worse than expected, and you will be right. <br /> <br /> In the first half-hour, he seems at least trying to set up a passable mystery UFO, but suddenly they introduce that lookalike of Count Dracula who's starting to chat about the devil. At first, you think this guy is just crazy maniac, but it turns out that it represents the true views of the authors of this film. As soon as you start to realize it, you know how it will work. But in reality, the situation is getting worse. <br /> <br /> Avoid.
