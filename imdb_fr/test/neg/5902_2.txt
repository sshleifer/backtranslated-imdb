It's not usually my practice to watch movies that I dislike very much. However, once or twice a year, I temporarily set aside my rule to comment only on things I like to warn. I find it more pleasant to comment and improve something that I like than to shoot in bad movies. But some "films" claim the razor. <br /> <br /> The bilite is one of them. Cinematography is not the only aspect that is unclear and unclear here. A plot almost indistinguishable (certainly incoherent, if there is one): bad action game, nerdy scenario and horrible rhythm. These are his main problems. <br /> <br /> Understand, I firmly believe that not all films are created equal and that films must be judged according to their category. It is not reasonable to judge, for example, the Beach Blanket bingo against Gone With the Wind. I judge Bilitis against other films in its weight category. Measured against films like Emmanuelle or The secrets of a maid, it takes off very badly. Even the candy in the eyes must be entertaining and the bilite certainly is not.
