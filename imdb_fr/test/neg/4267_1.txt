I find the criticism of many IMDb users a bit harsh and, in many cases, they criticize the film from a very professional point of view and not the guy on the street who wants to sit and watch something just for to move away from it. <br /> <br /> In this case however, I must say that it was BAD. I am a SciFi addict and there is nothing in this movie that caught me even a second. <br /> <br /> There was no suitable scenario. I may be an idiot, but I still do not know where the government was so worried about these plays. <br /> <br /> The pathetic attempt of the main character to assemble these 3 pieces is frightening. Half the time, the two pieces were already in place and all that remained was to add the third. A 3 year old could have assembled them. <br /> <br /> This movie was bad. <br /> <br /> Dominic
