A protected, home-schooled, and perhaps very talented young woman has a troubled and emotional side that surfaces after her absent father visits her mother, asking her to divorce her. Directed by the famous director of photography William A. Fraker, this untitled psychological thriller falls into the trap in which most of the films are barred by directors of photography: each shot is composed for the greatest style, but at sacrifice of the, striking story. Fraker (and his director of photography, László Kovács) adore bright whites and golden tones, giving the photo an impression of polished paintings. The mansion in the center of the action looks like a funeral home and Fraker paces the whistling thread like a funeral. Robert Shaw and Sally Kellerman (as Shaw's fiancée), two of the most interesting actors of the 1970s, succeed in piercing the plastic overhang and are quite convincing despite the irregular editing (which turns their scenes into half-done small businesses) ). Sondra Locke, another interesting personality on the screen, seems to have a striking resemblance to Catherine Deneuve in "Repulsion". With pale eyes and saucers, long hair and imposing, Locke is a mysterious human puzzle. At first, it is rather intimidating and dangerous. However, this role is so old that Locke finds nothing fresh to get out of the freeze, and she wades. Fraker lets Locke's scenes of panic unfold constantly, while Shaw (looking terrified, good-natured) is in the impossible position to play him little daddy. All of this nonsense could be worth the trouble if the script had been peppered with a minimum of tangibility (or, at the very least, a quick wit or humorous relief). The script by Lewis John Carlino and Edward Hume, adapted from Stanton Forbes' novel, "Go To Death Thy Bed", challenges the viewer from the beginning. Only the charisma of the players allows us to reach the finish line. * 1/2 of ****
