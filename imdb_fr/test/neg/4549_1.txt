It must be one of the worst films I've seen. I tried to like this movie but they managed to ruin virtually every single aspect of this movie! Cheap dialogue, no character development, no tension, not enough story to attract you, no action outside really cheap scenes. It seems like they tried a few things on the set and said, "Hey, that looks pretty cool, why do not you put that in there" and then the director probably said "yeah ... yeah, that's okay." is great!" and went back to sniff coca or something. As far as acting is concerned, I think Daan Schuurmans is the only person who tried to make the film, but in the end, it's for nothing. Because this movie sucks !! 2/10
