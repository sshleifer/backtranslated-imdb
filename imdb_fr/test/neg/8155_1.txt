This film was in a box set with 20 other films, of varying quality, and I can say with certainty that this title was at the bottom of the pile. <br /> <br /> It is useless to review the plot, that there was one, to identify what was wrong, because I do not have all day and life is too short , which reminds me that I just lost about 85 minutes of me watching this tripe. <br /> <br /> The acting was diabolically bad, which made it funny, even if it was only fair, while the comedy elements such as the two idiotic policemen had to make all the fans moan from Laurel & Hardy. One of the only barely fun moments was when the main woman made a joke about her plastic friends, which would have been nice if I did not have to watch them swing each time that she waddled on the screen. > <br /> The lowest I can give is one, and he probably deserves that for having Heather Thomas because she was certainly sexy and well done, even though her game was as bad as everyone else.
