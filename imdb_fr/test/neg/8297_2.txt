I was wondering when anyone would try to turn all this mess of Matamoros into a goreporn image. Anyway, here is some information about Mexico that I watched while watching this movie. <br /> <br /> ~ All Mexican women are super hot - Do you remember this small desert town located in Unearthed? Yeah, well, that must be his Mexican sister city. Do not bother with prostitutes, just do some gentle movements on the hot bartender. She will be as hot as prostitutes and probably does not have children too! <br /> <br /> ~ Half of Mexico is controlled by crazy cultists worshiping Satan. Â¡Ay, caramba! The other half, as all Americans know, is run by drug traffickers. Fortunately, it does not interfere much with the sex trade and our very low-wage factories there. <br /> <br /> ~ Mexican cops are useless. Do not go. Go to the nearest occult bookstore and ask the hottie behind the counter what happened to your missing friend. She will be much more useful than the cops. <br /> <br /> ~ When you are terribly tortured by the bloodthirsty cultists mentioned above, do not recite the Psalms or any part of the Bible. You're going to screw up the mojo.
