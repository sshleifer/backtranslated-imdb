This must be considered one of the most exciting television series in history. <br /> <br /> Jose Ferrer played the main character, Nemo. He did justice to the party and certainly watched the game. But nowadays, I'm struck by the fact that the Nemo it is composed of was designed to look more like a fleeting resemblance to Captain Bird's Eye, taken from television advertising. Or maybe it's the other way around. <br /> <br /> His sworn enemy, Professor Cunningham, was brilliantly overworked by Burgess Meredith. He never seemed to have overcome his days as Batman's "penguin". Although he does not make his penguin "quack" here, he is unparalleled as a manic teacher. Only John Colicos, of the glory of Battlestar Galactica, better described the landscape as a maniacal despot. <br /> <br /> I will never remember the grudge that existed between Nemo and Cunningham, but it must have been serious, since the Prof .... The effects are nothing special, although the sub- Professor Cunningham's sailor is much more beautiful than Nemo's. He also had a team of strange fish-like amphibians that served Cunningham and met all their expectations. <br /> <br /> However, the most memorable aspect of the entire series was Professor Cunningham's secret weapon. The delta beam! He always said "Fire Delta Beam!", After which, a captive crew member horribly canceled the firing movement of the weapon using a complete shrug. Really priceless! They do not do that anymore, and maybe as well. But like all the other series of this era, for those who remember it, it will always have an affectionate place, if it is covered with cheddar, in our hearts.
