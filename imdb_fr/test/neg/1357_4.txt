I'm sorry but I can not even accept some of the comments about this horrible piece of shit ... <br /> <br /> English is not my mother tongue, because I'm a German citizen, do not you do not deprive it. me for inappropriate grammar structures or something * gg I can not understand why this movie has such a rating? 6.3 ??? I hope you are joking? This film has absolutely no sense, not even a good actor's appearance ... <br /> <br /> When I looked at the comments on The Da Vinci Code, who did I think - pretty much the same note, I had to bang my head on the table, because I watched 00 Schneider right after Sakrileg, and oh my god, there are worlds between them. <br /> <br /> The majority of the posters in this painting tear apart each excited film while noting this crime of making a movie with a 6.3 and names Helge as a genius. Of course, he knows how to make money, but I think the main aspect of your opinions is the fact that German is not your mother tongue and you just do not know - or rather do not notice the pile of shit that is said in the sentences. OK, I must admit that some scenes are funny, but overall, a 6.3 is too much for my countryman;)
