Physical Evidence is one of those movies you want to love, but it should really be better than it really is. Developed as a sequel to Jagged Edge for Glenn Close and Robert Loggia, it gives the impression that all participants did it only while they waited for something better. The principle is perfectly usable, it is generally technically effective if it is horribly devoid of Henry Mancini's at least muscular meaning, but you can not help but think that things would have gone better if the one of the main roles had turned out to be the killer (the rumor was originally the case). As the opening scene of Heat (1986), his little known and disastrous personal character, Reynolds has all the ingredients of an excellent villain on screen. As it stands, there are few surprises and a feeling of filming without enthusiasm by the number while it creates a head of intertia as it moves away with disinterestedness toward a will less than great-this one? final. <br /> <br /> Reynolds is doing well, sailing on charisma in what is clearly a star vehicle. Unfortunately, the same can not be said of Theresa Russell. An astonishing and intrepid actress in her husband Nic Roeg's films, which allows her to immerse herself in the dark side of human nature, she is trapped in a part that requires star quality rather than depth, and she do not shovel it. She does not flirt her lines and does not meet the other actors, but that's about all that can be said in favor of her surprisingly stealthy and often amateurish performance that leaves the film aside. Aside from Ned Beatty's attorney, secondary actors add a slightly surreal presence to a Boston where everyone seems to have a very disguised Canadian accent and where the streets look strangely similar to Toronto and Montreal. <br /> <br /> Similarly, director Michael Crichton, who in Westworld, Coma and The First Great Robbery Train showed he knew how to bring an audience to the edge of their seat, seems to handle the action so purely superficial - indeed, in a single moment Not even match and seem thrown together almost arbitrarily. The climax itself has no style and is totally devoid of threats and dangers, and many scenes are played at a price well below what they are worth. It's no surprise that besides the unpublished covers of The 13th Warrior, Crichton has not realized a director since. <br /> <br /> It is quite observable in a kind of TV movie of the 80s, even if it never corresponds to reality. promise of its opening. That's enough reason to see it, it depends on the taste of each.
