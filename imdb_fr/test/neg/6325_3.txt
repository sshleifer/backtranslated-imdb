If you read the plot summary for "Mad Max", you've just spoiled the first hour and ten minutes of the movie. You have also discovered that "Mad Max" is set in post-apocalyptic Australia, which will be useful because otherwise you will have no idea what's going on. The film, made in 1979, really tries to be Stanley Kubrick's "A Clockwork Orange" (1971). Only this film, in all its strangeness, makes sense and leaves an impact. This film does neither, and ends up being a rough sketch of stunt cars / bikes that hangs like all vehicles in the film. <br /> <br /> The first thing that is wrong with "Mad Max" is that he tries to sell himself as a revenge story when no vigilante seems to take revenge until the last 20 minutes. If the first hour was reduced to 20-30 minutes, then the last 20 minutes added, then an extra hour, "Mad Max would be a nice action movie with a big protagonist of the police." Mel Gibson must wait act like a hen wet for 2/3 of the movie and then a sudden epiphany for revenge I have not watched the sequel "Road Warrior" yet and I must admit that I'm excited for that only because I want to know What he has This first film was essentially a waste of time. <br /> <br /> George Miller makes some great action film here, but his exaggerated symbolism is absurd and the unbearable reaction to cheese is every time a character finds something horrible like a burned hand or what has completely ruined those moments, it's a terribly clich√©d technique of movie B. <br /> There is absolutely no Thematic value or subtle criticism of the A company in this film No matter what you might think. A big sci-fi action movie makes at least one point, but the free violence done by weird bikers says nothing of value. Even the evil Toecutter feels modeled by Alex of "Clockwork", even more ugly and totally helpless. The violence of PG simply does not allow the violence of this gang to settle and get a reaction from the viewer, it is content to stir it at best. <br /> <br /> I will give credit to the amount of things that the film crew has exploded and crashed and Miller did a great job in making you feel the intensity of the collisions. Everything else is mediocre at best and then after an hour of mediocrity, you get something good and the movie ends 20 minutes later. I just cross my fingers "Road Warrior" will meet the expectations of the end of the film, otherwise it would be more wasted time. ~ Steven C <br /> <br /> Visit my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com
