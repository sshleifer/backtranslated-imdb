Predictable, bloody, too gimmicky, mediocre. Do not waste your time - there are many better movies. <br /> <br /> The resurrection begins well, but the plot quickly becomes repetitive. My interest level has dropped steadily. At the end of the movie, I was glad it was finally over. The characters are never fully developed. Cinematography is muddy and POV rotations are changing rapidly - though impressive in 1999, they are only used to indicate that the film is trying to replace the plot and substance of the character. Film shooting gimmicks are used for something (transmit tension and anxiety) but are constantly overused and ultimately become counterproductive. A shame overall - the film / story obviously had potential and the producers / directors and actors obviously had technical skills. Disappointment.
