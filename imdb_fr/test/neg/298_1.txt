How can you make a joke about the mafia? This is not the kind of subject to laugh! A close film can not make me laugh, because I compare it to Jane Austen's mafia! Mafia! It was not a good movie but Hoods is really worse! In Mafia !, there were good jokes but in this one, there may be two or three ... that make you smile. Not too bad actors but very bad scenario !! We certainly prefer something serious like The Godfather. I give it * on *****.
