I thought maybe ... maybe it could be good. An early onset of the resuscitator (Jeffery Combs); a lot of tribute to old horror movies; the Troma label on the front ?? this film could be a jewel! I was wrong. <br /> <br /> Frightmare is a boring, exaggerated and half-played homage to horror movies of the past. This is an old story, of young people getting into a house, getting drunk, making love and manipulating things that should not be tampered with. The often We use here the formula of recycled slasher film, this time with the idea of ​​a dead actor, Conrad Radzoff, who is killing. In fact, the performance of Radzoff's actor, Ferdy Mayne, is the only redeeming quality of this film. He does very well the character of Dracula. But for children, it's not very good, Combs having only a minimal part. <br /> <br /> The film lacks entertainment value and has only one nice character and one or two scenes that can catch your attention. . I do not recommend this movie unless you want to watch something, and it's the only movie that remains successful.
