Now I was looking at it when I was a hangover on a Sunday and my aunt and uncle were visiting my 2 cousins ​​(one was 11, the other 9). We were stuck on TV and Passport To Paris had just started. My cousins ​​both said that they watched Two Of A Kind from time to time and said that they could watch the movie if they wanted to. Not being able to get up, I stayed in the living room with them and I ended up watching the movie! I must say that as a person who is not interested in this type of TV shows or movies, I really liked it ... it must be alcohol lol but I admit that it does not would probably please more girls aged two to three. 6 and 13, but it was a movie to pass the time. There is always a movie or show that you do not think you like, but to laugh, you enjoyed it.
