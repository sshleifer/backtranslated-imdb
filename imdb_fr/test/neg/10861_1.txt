This is the first time that I call IMDb a "bad movie" and I could not imagine a more deserving film to honor it. I was hoping to receive fun trash and I found some of the saddest and most crazy garbage. I found a movie that no one could care about, including its creator. <br /> <br /> "Hell Ride", directed, written by Larry "Friend of QT" Bishop, with a simple plot about a hidden treasure and a trio of keys, two biker gangs and a horrific murder of 1976 that must still be avenged. Larry seems fiercely determined not to tell this story, concentrating instead of putting his main character wavering and strangely grinning into situations where he can caress women who claim to love him. It also has a dialog box containing enough metaphors of fire and horror to ignore the word "fire" for life. <br /> <br /> Dennis Hopper escapes total humiliation, others are not so lucky. Sometimes they take the road by bike, which makes Michael Madsen even more sad, because his raised handles seem to add the insult to the injury of having to appear in this film. There is a lot of nudity improved by silicon, but not enough action and no humor whatsoever, which makes us wonder what kind of audience they thought. <br /> <br /> I guess most people watching this movie, including the 1960s trash biker movie fans, will feel cheated. Do yourself a favor and revisit the real stuff instead.
