I'm a big fan of horror movies and I always manage to find something positive in an image, but this movie just did not interest me. This story revolves around a father, his daughter and a girlfriend since his wife died a few years ago. These people face a horrible situation in a city they visit and all the elderly citizens of this city gang up on these people and almost kill them. This film reminded me of a movie called "The Children of Corn", because it really concerns children presented to Satan and his instruments of terror. There are many songs, mambo and a toy tank that completely destroys an entire family in their break, as well as dolls that kill a husband and wife.
