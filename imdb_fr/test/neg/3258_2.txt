Caddyshack II is one of those images that makes you ask "Why?" A sin; "Why was it funded?": "Why was it made?" and 'Why was it made public?' <br /> <br /> To say the least, it's a bad movie. There is no point in emphasizing the superiority of his precedent by opposing a group of almost identical characters in a scenario similar to that of a real estate developer "New Money" who is trying to buy the sanctuary of the establishment's golf course. <br /> <br /> Right from the start, tracking 8 years after the original is a bit weird. I mean, if you want to use a very successful photo as the first, you have a window of a few years to do it. But leaving 8 years means that the formula is barely cool enough to simply follow up, or poor imitation, so you have to reward the fans of the original by giving them at least a reference, or even real contributions. by the actors who made the first so memorable. But there is little or nothing. <br /> <br /> Instead, we get cheap imitations. OK, the death of Ted Knight in the meantime would have made it impossible to return the memorable Justice Smails, but the inclusion of Robert Stack in "Chandler Young" (another WASP elitist akin to the character of Smails) is unimaginative and sorely lacking. anarchic frustration that made Knight's turn so watchable. Jackie Mason's "Jack Hartounian" is a faint attempt to recreate the non-stop sarcasm delivered by Al Czervik's character (Rodney Dangerfield). While the role of Dangerfield was endless, Mason is quite forgettable. <br /> <br /> The legendary ridiculous "Carl Spackler" Bill Murray and his war of attrition against the embarrassing local gofer are replaced by the role of his co-star Ghostbuster, Dan Ackroyd, as an activist " Capt. Tom Everett's high-pitched voice divides the sides in frustration, unlike the expected laugh. <br /> <br /> Randy Quaid, shining like Cousin Ed in the "National Lampoon's Vacation" series, is the complete opposite playing here in the unstable Hartounian lawyer, the disbelieving looks of the actor looking at Quaid's character intended to be hilarious acts of inappropriate violence echo those of the public.You do not laugh, you only ask: "What the hell is he doing?" <br /> <br /> Chevy Chase introduces himself, wisely and occasionally, considering the disaster unfolding around him, as a pro club. Tye Webb "in the movies refer only to the original despite the golf course itself With his deep tan skin and noisy Hawaiian shirts, Chase seems to have just returned from his long summer vacation and needs a paycheck. He stands out enough from events in the real world to attack himself and leaves some, no matter how credible, to his ever-intact credibility. <br /> <br /> Jessica Lundy in the role of Kate, Mason's daughter, succeeds Danny Noonan of the original as a teenager struggling with class divisions. It sounds ridiculous, does not it? At least in the first Danny (an Irish Catholic from a blue-collar family) and his ludicrous attempts to penetrate the world dominated by Whites, Anglo-Saxons and Protestants of the golfers' club, shakers were played as evacuated by the resident Lutheran bishop as well as by the offspring of the local yacht club. Lundy's embarrassment about his father's inability to integrate is hinted at because of his Jewish roots. That aside, it may also be due to the fact that he is a classless moron, but such complexity is swept away, although I stopped worrying about it before they were resolved. . At the end of the day, Noonan was trying to make progress in life. The biggest problem of Miss Hartounian is to convince the table nobles of the local golf club to love his father, who is multimillionaire, to be able to go out with the prodigal white boy of the club. Or so I collected. <br /> <br /> Anyway, in summary, it is poorly written, poorly written, with lame plays and wastes a lot of talent. Bravo if you could stick to his conclusion. It's really a penance. It remains to be questioned, however, why so many of the original actors did not return instead of being replaced by interpreters who, at least on paper, looked the same. Maybe they were not invited. Or maybe I suspect they actually read the script. Stick to the original !!!
