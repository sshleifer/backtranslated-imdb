This film was initially pretty decent, but it never really started, but it became predictable and even a bit ridiculous. Some scenes were pretty well done, photography and cuts combined with sounds, which made it a little more interesting to watch, but as the story was quite slow, it failed to keep the interest alive . And more importantly, it's not scary at all! It's supposed to be a horror movie, but no scene was scary or even exciting. <br /> <br /> To be honest, the actors were not so great either, no colorful characters you will remember for the rest of your days .. <br /> <br /> Overall, this The movie is viewable, but it does not add anything, and once you finish watching it, it will not last long until you've already forgotten its contents. <br /> <br /> The reason I watched this movie was because I read reviews that gave the best scores, but I disagreed and instead, I would note 4 on 10. If you still want Japanese horror, I suggest you watch Ju-On instead! <br /> <br />
