Strangeland is a terrible technological thriller / horror. Dee Snider plays Carleton Hendricks, a disgusting computer maniac who prays young girls via chat rooms. His ridiculous philosophies of pain and suffering are both wrong and totally unfounded. The ideas presented in this film have no connection with reality. It's more like Dee Snider sat down trying to imagine the strangest possible to impress horror fans and maybe some of his old ones, but the end result is: Simply awful. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately for me, as a horror fan, the cover of this film is very beautiful and it immediately caught my attention, which is the main reason why I was prompted to look at him. I assure you it's not a quality horror movie. It is a disturbing, but boring, attempt to suggest what might remain in the minds of people who treat themselves like the Carleton Hendricks in this film. The sad part is that no one does this stuff for themselves. Marilyn freakin 'Manson does not even go that far, and the fact that he has a song on the soundtrack clearly indicates that the movie was not supposed to make fun of his kind of music (it would be a stab at Snider ), it's more like Dee Snider trying to get up from the death of his career and present himself again as a sick man. Dee, it seems that the time has come to let everything die ...
