I think it's a disappointing sequel. Many old characters (King Gator, Anne Marie, etc.) miss me, and I do not like it because even half of the original voices did not come back to make the characters. Charlie has lost a lot of personality and the wicked Red is not even half as bad as Carface in the first. If you're a big fan of ADGTH like me, it's worth it to see just how the story goes, but do not count on the 5-star rating of your book.
