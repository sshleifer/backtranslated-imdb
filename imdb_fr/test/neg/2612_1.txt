This seventh (yes, you read correctly - the seventh) the movie Puppet Master shows how the group of mad dolls was born; by a French puppeteer who uses them to avenge himself on a group of old mummies who want him after learning he holds the secret of life. A wizard, also on the run, learned it before his death. He used this power to bring normal puppets to life. This sequel is basically nonsense, sprinkled on even more nonsense, like most Puppet Master suites. Because of the PG13 rating, we do not even have entertaining puppet murders. Come to think of it, there is NO fucking murder of puppets. If a franchise was to be deleted, that would be it. No more .... my god, please no more ...
