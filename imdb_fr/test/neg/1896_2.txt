I watched the version with pathetic American dubbing, maybe it made the situation worse, but from what I could understand, the movie was pretty bad anyway. It seemed like a small budget. The visuals made me think of a second-rate TV movie, a random white dog substituted for Dogmatix, awkward 1960s BBC costumes, and so on. However, I especially feel that the characters of the film do not behave accordingly, I have never wanted to even try to forgive the bad look of the film. It will always be difficult to capture the sensation of comics in a movie without using animation, and I did not think that this attempt was worth it.
