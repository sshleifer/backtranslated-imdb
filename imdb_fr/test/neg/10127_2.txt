You might think it would be interesting to broadcast a program about ordinary teenagers with superpowers, but it's far from it. Take the concept for example: the main character or characters have a big secret: they hide from their peers. It's like Hannah Montana and it's so Raven. Then the acting is just average. Selena Gomez seems to be half asleep through many scenes. Finally, the jokes are either clich√© or boring. If they do not use, they use a colorful dialogue, but strange, to make us "laugh", they launch various accessories in the room. I really hope this show uses more original and entertaining material. In conclusion, Wisards of Waverly Place is a disappointment.
