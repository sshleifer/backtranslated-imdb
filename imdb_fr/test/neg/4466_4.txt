After seeing the previews some time ago, I could not wait to see Steve Martin in a comedy that I thought could be a guardian. Unfortunately, I was wrong. The problem was that the previews were the only fun parts of the movie. The rest of the film was basically a junk, scenes that were made until death and characters we all saw a thousand times. <br /> <br /> This movie was proof that if you put enough money on the table, you can talk to anyone. Steve Martin is one of my favorites but this one was a big clunker. The only actor in the movie to watch was Eugene Levy; he was the best of a powerful lame group.
