I took my family to see Barnyard last weekend. We could not wait to be there but if my kids had not been there, my husband and I would be gone. Coming from an agricultural community, we found that the fact that all the cattle in the ugly film were drawn was a bit worrisome. We felt like we were watching the cows undoing or something like it was just strange to hear a male voice coming from a female body. After checking some of the production notes on a different website, I thought that the presenters might have escaped from this. I know it's just a humorous and animated show, but by putting parts of a woman's body on a man, I had to suspend my disbelief to such an extent that I simply could not appreciate the movie as I could have done it. I know that udders can be found funny but they were definitely overused. None of the other animals in the movie seemed to have gender-specific body parts, and I would have preferred the bulls in this series to have at least the correct ones if they had to draw them. However, the kids always enjoyed the movie, but then we took the time to make sure they knew the difference between bulls and cows.
