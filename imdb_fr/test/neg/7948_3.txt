Assault on Precinct 13: 3/10: Let's forget for a moment that Assault on Precinct 13 is a remake of a classic action movie. Assault is a debacle. <br /> <br /> Let's start with the Rio Bravo style scenario. About a dozen people are stuck in a rotting police station in Detroit. (If the Detroit location gives you heat and fuzzies at Robocop, it would have easily told Topeka in the opening credits and nothing would have changed in the forest would have made more sense.) The wicked surrounding them; corrupt police officers. <br /> <br /> Now, I know what you think. Corrupt cops? Were Nazis and drug cartels busy this weekend? Of course, they are not ordinary cops. These guys are right on the cover of the latest Tom Clancy video game. Yes we have body armor; helicopters; laser sights; night vision obscures the works. So we have thirty S.W.A.T. members / Special Forces armed to the teeth verses 4 cops (drunk, it's New Year's Eve), 2 girls in party clothes and half a dozen criminals. <br /> <br /> How are our heroes defending themselves? The truth is they can not. They should all be dead within ten minutes. (Not to mention that the characters inside have the annoying habit of walking in front of the windows.) An illogical scenario is no longer a reason to do a complete panoramic of a movie. a B-style action movie. However, with the exception of Laurence Fishburne and Ethan Hawke, all the other characters seemed to be comic relief. <br /> <br /> While the characters of Ja-Rules and Leguizamo are already bad enough. It's the minstrel show of Aisha Hind that takes the cake. Rarely has a more stereotypical African-American character appeared on the modern screen. His performance resembles a brotherhood boy in blackface and drag ghetto acting. <br /> <br /> During the initial assault, a gang member takes control of an ice cream truck and walks around the neighborhood shooting small girls in the head. I have always had an irrational fear of ice cream trucks. After this assault, I have a perfectly rational fear of remakes.
