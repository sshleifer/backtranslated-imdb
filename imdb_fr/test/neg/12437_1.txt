I recently had to look at this for a project in a sociology class and I thought it was absolutely the worst film I ever had to watch. It was like a bad film cinemax with all the "good pieces" removed. A bad actor's game, the fake documentary, the absurd plot and the steering without rudder contribute to make a terrible film. <br /> <br /> Female characters are basically just sex objects. Consider this exchange: "It's hot." "He has a girlfriend." "Do you have a girlfriend?" "No." * The girl takes the boy's hand and drives it behind bushes. the boy goes out and sits next to another boy, the girl goes away * "Did you hit that?" "No, I did not want to take off my pants." "You are stupid." Another girl shows up when the boys go to Beverly Hills, goes in the trunk with one of the boys and if they are stopped by a policeman, you see the car pitching. <br /> <br /> A homosexual pervert, a trigger-like Clint Eastwood, and what appears to be a luchador mask add to the inanity. One of the boys gets caught by a cop, nobody cares. One of the boys gets shot, no one cares. <br /> <br /> Someone said that the dialogue was mostly improvised and it shows. Simply horrible. I would never recommend this movie to anyone.
