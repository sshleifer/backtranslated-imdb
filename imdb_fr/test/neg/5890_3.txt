I just saw this movie last night and after reading all the reviews, I was expecting a good emotional movie about the sport. What I got was something cliché and boring. Yes, I thought it was boring. I saw the star player hurt himself well before the match. I thought they might wait until it collapses until, you know, the game before the "big game", but I guess the first game is enough. <br /> <br /> Parental relations were also very clichés, with the dominant drunk father (I will say McGraw but), and the boy who wants to stay and help his mother (sick?). <br /> <br /> I especially liked the random girls (Melissa and Maria) who stayed in the movie for 5 minutes and who were placed there just to get the boys to action on the ground. I thought "ok, now, how does it work in the plot?" Maybe I missed the point, beyond the point "Well, they play football in a city that likes it, so the girls throw themselves at their feet". <br /> <br /> The sporting action had some good points, but most were so in a hurry! I think the first match lasted longer than the assembly of the entire playoffs! And I was not so sure of the continuity of the clock that ends in the last game. <br /> <br /> I think I could see this movie win the ESYY for best sports film if was the only one to go out. . Honestly, I found it was a boring film filled with people obsessed with pork skin. For a better movie about football, see Remember the Titans.
