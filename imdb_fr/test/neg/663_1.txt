I found myself stuck in traffic jams (I live in Sicily) while I was going to the theater (on a military base) to see Superman Returns, I was 15 minutes late, and the only other movie going on was " See No Evil ", there was no poster. for the film, and just a short description of the film on the schedule ... but my girlfriend and I decided to check it ... As soon as I saw that it was produced by the WWE, I knew that it would be terrible. The few people in the theater were laughing most of the time, and this is the first movie I honestly considered leaving, and I saw "The Ringer" ... well, I would have left, but I was too busy sleeping. The villain's death at the end was pretty good, but other than that, it was just stupid.
