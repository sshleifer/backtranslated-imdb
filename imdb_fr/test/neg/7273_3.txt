I decided to watch this very low budget movie from Poverty Row studio, PRC, because it co-starred the thrilling actor, Lionel Atwill - and I really liked the title. Although Atwill often played in these cheap films, his excellent comedian style always made the films look much better, because his character on the screen was awesome (his real life is also quite interesting - a bit like a strange soap opera). The reason I use the term "Poverty Row" is that it was a nickname given to the cheapest and worst production companies of the day. Most of them were not even real studios, but production companies that rented space and platters from big studios at night! Yes, there is a good chance that this film was filmed after normal working hours, which is common in such studios. <br /> <br /> The story begins when Lionel Atwill tells his friends a story about something he's been involved with since. A doctor falls in love with a woman but he is afraid to talk to him about himself. That's because his job puts people to death on death row - not exactly a glamorous job! Doc asks his friend (Atwill) to give him advice on how to tell him, but no matter, she will not have this man. Later, you realize it's because his own parents were criminals. <br /> <br /> Later, a man is killed and the lady involved - although it is obvious to all brains that her sister was involved (and some nuts) and the evidence against the lady was poor . But, apparently, the jury was filled with people without brains and she was found guilty and sent to death row. Even more stupid is that his former boyfriend was the man who was responsible for his execution. Do not you think that someone else might just be able to handle this business ?! Until that fateful hour, her friend (Atwill) spends much of the film proving her innocence - and proving that the fluffy sister knows much more about the case than she will admit. <br /> <br /> Overall, the film is only slightly interesting and a bit silly. Although it is watchable and Atwill is good (as usual), the rest of the film never really rises above the banal and some of the actors are rather shabby. It's under normal and what you expect from a low-budget movie - and nothing more despite the cool title.
