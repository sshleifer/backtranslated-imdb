Talk about your wild life. Hardly a B-movie, but what a hay ... nerdy sci-fi and lesbian sex. Cody Jarrett, the author and director, has a fun spirit. A chemical company discharges waste that causes mutants in a fish farm. Kristi Russell, star actress, will play Barbara Michaels, an EPA officer investigating this environmental dilemma. It happens that she has just entered into a lesbian relationship with the bartender Trixie (Ariadne Shaffer) and that their love scenes are about as good as this film comes out. A man-sized frog incites chaos; causing a car accident, raping the girl of the boss of the chemical company, raping a girl under the bleachers during a football game, stiff arms fighting a runner in football, raping a nun ... before being shot a bullet in the chest after an antidote was found ready. Special effects ... well, not special; a guy in rubber frog costume without the genitals to prove himself. Robust tadpoles, you still want to watch it? Go ahead, but bribe any witness to secrecy.
