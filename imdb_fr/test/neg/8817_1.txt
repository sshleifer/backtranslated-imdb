(This review does not necessarily expose the plot of the film, but it can change the expectations of the movie and thus make the experience less enjoyable.) <br /> <br /> Never rented a scary movie, expecting to to be on the edge of your seat in fear, and instead ended up screaming with laughter at every stupid turn of the plot? This film has had so many opportunities to impress and frighten the viewer. He was badly cut and jumped too much. to refer to the past seems rather to be an excuse for why the plot was heading in its particular direction. Screenwriters should not have thought about how the potentially excellent plot should have been made, as the bad construction of time throughout the plot discourages the viewer and makes the film more and more tiring to watch. <br /> <br /> Almost worse than the authors who abused what could have been an excellent classic thriller, it was the fact that he relied gradually on an inexpensive tactic to scare. The acting did not make it scary, and the situations just made it scary, so you needed some dark scenes with things that jump to you to make it worth it. Even those were predictable. <br /> <br /> Not even the gore could have saved the plot, and it rivals the gore of the hit thriller Se7en. <br /> <br /> Speaking of Se7en, I have the impression Saw tried to follow Se7en's incredibly fascinating psychological theme, but failed miserably. I was terribly disappointed by the lack of analysis and structure of the plot surrounding the murderer's psychology. The first scenes encourage the viewer to think that it is a psychological thriller. believe me, it's far from the case. <br /> <br /> Oh, did I mention bad acting? At first, Cary Elwes seems to be doing a convincing performance; However, it deteriorates completely in the most crucial parts of the plot. I stayed in tears of laughter at this performance, which is worthy of a Razzie. Leigh Whannell's performance is also terrible and overplayed, though not as bad as Elwes', and the big red flag is that Whannell is also a scriptwriter of the film. <br /> <br /> The end of Saw could never compensate for his total loss and that's what makes it a huge failure. It was a missed opportunity and I do not understand why Monica Potter and Danny Glover chose to play roles in this movie. <br /> <br /> I'm mad at myself for wasting money just to rent it. It was not worth $ 4 at all, and in the future, I will certainly avoid seeing anything that has to do with Elwes, Whannell or James Wan. The great tragedy in this area is not the basic lack of its plot, it is that the potential scenario has been cast and the poor quality of the action adds insult to injury. I will avoid the poor word games involving the title and conclude by saying this: do not watch this movie.
