and I still do not know where the hell is this movie going? I mean really, what is this movie about? Is it to demonstrate the total absence of Sean Connery's Arabic? Is it to show that if he could play the role of a Moroccan warlord, it was natural to play the role of Ramirez in the highlands? Why was Teddy Roosevelt even in this movie? Why is there so much sand that has been used so little? Where was there so many table slaps? Why did Teddy ignore the Japanese with whom he fired at archery? Did he realize that the man was Japanese? Why was there no credible excuse for Connery's accent? At least Jean Claude Van Damme has an excuse for his French accent, whether he is raised by French nuns in Hong Kong (Double Impact), raised in the bayou in Louisiana (Universal Soldier), or having a French mother and raised in Indochina (I do not even remember the name of this movie)? Can someone explain that?
