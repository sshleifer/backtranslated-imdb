I thought this film was a mediocre effort of the British Film Council - it fell flat, hey, see, Tim Robbins is an old man and here is this beautiful young woman who craves for him too. As lost in translation, it is really difficult to suspend disbelief in this context. It's a beautiful film but lacks punch. When Tim Robbins pretends to be psychic, he looks like he has a little migraine. He looks uncomfortable and lives less. The part where he controls suspicious Sphinx employees is laughable. If an investigator came into my factory, the last thing I would do would be to talk to him about my freckle fetishism. It is obviously too intellectual. Clumsy. The city is as it is, a convenient backdrop. They obviously chose the most futuristic city possible (shanghai) as a backdrop, but the city never really came out and did not affect the characters as in the blade runner, for example, where the characters of the city go cut often. slow as a wet week. No chemistry, real high dramatic facts, so so conspiracy.
