Maybe it's because I read Peter Straub's wonderful book before seeing the film, but I was terribly disappointed by this film. In my opinion, the filmmakers removed everything that made the story interesting and unique and replaced it with more common, Hollywood-style elements. <br /> <br /> Fred Astaire, Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., Melvyn Douglas, John Houseman and Alice Krige, then largely unknown. We just do not give them the trouble to do it. <br /> <br /> In fact, I was ready to go half-way, but a friend convinced me to stay until the end, because he was sure it had to get better. He apologized to me during the closing credits.
