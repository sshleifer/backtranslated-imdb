I do not agree to call it a stoner movie just because weed is also making an appearance. I can not even imagine that it even approaches the "Stoner Classic". It would be like calling Singles a "grunge movie". The film definitely walks with an obscure plot. I sometimes wondered if the script had been abandoned and mixed or if they had completely lost it and were simply trying to lose it. Watching this movie reminded me to watch children play and play the story as they go. <br /> <br /> The characters are wooden, the dialogue is taxed and the whole story seems to be completely disconnected. Who was killed? When? What? And that's how you act when your friend overdoses? Total absence of emotion and total disconnect from reality. <br /> <br /> Regarding the guitar soundtrack that accompanies each scene: enough! It was like looking at the opening menu screen where the same track is constantly scrolling in the background, without moving forward or backward. dialogue would improve or something, somehow would focus this mess in a coherent movie. After 112 minutes, this never happened.
