It was not a very good movie, the acting was pretty stinky and the effects were bad most of the time. But there were fun times, but most of them were not supposed to be fun. The most hilarious part of the movie I was part of was a little wheelchair child who falls off (this is not the fun part ... what kind of person do you think I am)? the brother comes running and the way the kid runs is so funny that he stumbles and I really lost the action, I had to rewind him several times to be able to laugh more. So, if you are looking for something to rent but can not find anything, take a look at it and watch for it to work.
