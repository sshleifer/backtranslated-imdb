After 1988, after the disaster, the films of GJS Amitabh lost the quality they had <br /> <br /> Except MAIN AZAAD HOON, released in 1989, which was a great cinematic rest, all the films were in class , except HUM (1991) later in 1991 <br /> <br /> This is another toad of Amitabh films that people rejected in the early 90s <br /> <br /> The film that he did look like a pledge of friendship towards Shashi Kapoor who directed the film and who did not touch a penny The film also had Rishi and Dimple (again not paired opp after RANBHOOMI) <br /> <br /> The film came in 1991 when Bachchan had 4 releases and 3 flops among them INDRAJEET, AKAYLA, AJOOBA <br /> <Ajooba came 2 years after TOOFAN and JAADUGAR both rejected supernatural films. It's another type of shit. Bachchan wears a Krissh mask and outfit and performs magic by turning a person into a donkey. Of course, from 1991, you can apologize. the special effects but the film is too bad to be watched <br /> <br /> The staging of Shashi Kapoor is not good Musi c is bad <br /> <br /> Among the actors, Amitabh was became too old in 1991 and looked tired, his game is good but not tied with his best Rishi does not matter Dimple is fine, the rest is unforgettable
