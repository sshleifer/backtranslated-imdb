After reading the bottom of the box, my first thought was that it was probably a reversal of Saw 2. I could not be further from the truth. It seemed to me that they had given someone with a cell phone with digital camera and $ 10.00 and told them to make a movie. The plot did not exist and the actor either. It was almost like watching a silent movie about grass growth. It did not surprise me to discover later that the whole film was "improvised". At the end of this "movie", I had lost the urge to live and I may have caught AIDS just by watching this piece of cinematic shit. I could have spent about 70 minutes doing something less painful. Like jumping from a building.
