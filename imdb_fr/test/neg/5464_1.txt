It certainly knocked me out - I can not believe anyone made another Australian movie that is even more boring than Somersault. The story is implausible, the characters, with the exception of the characters of Friels and Mailman, are incomparable and wooden, Tom Long has a wide range of facial expressions: happy and not happy, and the "scenes of sex", which could have been very confrontational and disturbing erotic, would have been at home in a low budget porn movie. <br /> <br /> This is the first movie I've seen in 30 years of cinema having me at the edge of my seat .... ready to get up and go. <br /> <br /> The best thing about this movie is the promotional poster.
