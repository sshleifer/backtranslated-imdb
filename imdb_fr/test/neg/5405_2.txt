The scientist Charles and his wife (or assistant) Marissa receive objects and a skull from an ancient Indian cemetery. When cleaning a vase, they are attacked and murdered by a mysterious being, the skeleton man. Then a military team commanded by Captain Leary (Michael Rooker) looks for two groups of four soldiers each who have disappeared into the jungle. They face the skeleton man and shoot him while he kills every soldier. Then, the skeleton man goes to a power station and Captain Leary explodes the installation destroying the supernatural being. <br /> <br /> "boring and insane shit, with shoots and explosions." The foolish story is totally disconnected and makes no sense, and the military team is made up of idiots, insisting on slaughtering the supernatural skeleton man until his total slaughter.Their leader is also the stupidest, with the explosion of an entire establishment that eventually destroyed the supernatural scam of the alien warrior Predator.On DVD, it is possible to use the fast-forward button along the film to reduce the suffering of the viewer My vote is two. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Skeleton Man"
