Oh, God, where do I begin ... First of all; this show is just another stupid and non-funny American comedy that has a pathetic game and a very very poor humor. The American way of doing ridiculous business makes the situation even worse. How come I can hear bursts of laughter when nothing funny happens? Pretty stupid, huh? This series is only for Americans who have never heard that there are much more funny, better and more spiritual comedies - not only in Britain, but also in America (The Simpsons for example). I just can not understand what's so good about "Reba" that it's been a long time on TV. There is nothing new to offer, it underestimates viewers (possible) in many ways and it's just not funny. I could have lived with the fact that there are such bad shows as "Reba", but why on earth they had to make it run here in Finland. If I see a few seconds of this horrible show, the rest of the day is ruined for me. Believe me, believe me, this show is even worse than this kind of American "comedy". It's just horrible. Enjoy yourself; never look at this peace of sh * t. <br /> <br /> Well, I leave the comments for those who now master this language better. Thank you for your (possible) interest.
