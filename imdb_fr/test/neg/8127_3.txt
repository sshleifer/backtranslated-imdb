First of all, let me say that after watching this movie, I felt like I was sold. Note that this is not the fault of the film if IMDb listened to it as a comedy and then as a horror (although I do not know how it came in ... maybe some fools of the movie team) have put). As a horror / comedy fan, I checked against that and I'm really sorry for doing it. Where to start? First of all, to get back to my debut, there is no comedy in this movie. He tries once or twice, but never gets a chuckle at best. My reaction was mainly to roll my eyes and wonder why someone thought that such a tired material would be funny. In addition, there is no horror here. Not a second of tension can be found. You think I'm exaggerating ... I'm not. No tension, very little blood, and not a lot of violence on the screen (sorry, but in a horror movie, cutting just when good things start is a major mistake). Hell ... there is not even nudity. Call me a purist or a minor ... I prefer some in a horror movie if he can not find an original plot / premise. And this tired "reality show that went wrong"? This has been done before and much better. Like in Wrong Turn 2 or ... uh ... whatever the name of this movie is with Edward Furlong. That's how bad this movie is. I do not even remember the name of this movie, but it was better than that. I also appreciated the comment that the timing was good because "reality TV takes over". Has someone from the past posted this with a time machine? You are laughing at me? This thing is a trash ... and not a fun way.
