This film shows some 6.2 stars. It seems inconceivable that the director has so many relationships. I can not explain it. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie at all costs. You only have a few hours on Earth, do not lose 1 & 2 on this pile of delayed steam guano !!! <br /> <br /> There is no story as apparently the director "wrote" (and I guess with a blunt orange pencil) the script of the next day at the end of the filming of the day. The "story" has been described as fanciful, no, it is aimless, there may be enough "story" to fill an advertisement. Do not you hate commercials? <br /> <br /> Now, although the two leaders can act, they have obviously decided not to participate. And likewise, the screenwriter / director can actually write and perform as evidenced by his next work "Toy Love" <br /> <br /> So, to recap, even if you get this movie for free, even if you're paid watch - avoid it. <br /> <br /> To paraphrase The search for the Holy Grail of Monty Python, "Run, run away!"
