Black Film is a genre that requires a certain level of tact, intelligence, intelligence and images. This film has none of that, although they really tried to work with the pictures. <br /> <br /> This is the kind of movie in which your cousin Marky, the driver of the dump truck, always talks about how he will succeed. the movies would do one day. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is wooden and lifeless. The visual effects, while obviously costly to achieve, are the work of a director who has tried to be clever and has failed miserably due to a severe lack of brain capacity. The acting game went from bad to just bad. The story might have been saved by a real screenwriter and director, but I suspect that such people would not have touched her with a barge pole. <br /> <br /> About 1/4 of the way, I noticed some striking similarities. with Simone's scene where Viktor, desperate to get rid of his actress, makes the worst film in the world. I thought to check with IMDb if a similar effect had occurred in this movie, and to my surprise, it was so. I would be almost tempted to give a 2 out of 10 just because it exposes the pretentious groupies, but I will not do it. It's so bad.
