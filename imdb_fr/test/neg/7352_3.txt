It could have been a good movie if more things were explained. Too many holes to find that nice. The end in particular is out of the left field. SPOILER ALERT: How did the kidnapper get home so quickly to Dundee and Dundee come home in two minutes? Get out of wack here. How did Anna find the money? No explanation at all. If cop Pete knew that Lancaster was in danger, why did not he have a cop at the hospital door? This and many other questions remain. Too bad because the premise was there, but just a bad writing and execution. <br /> <br /> The good distribution is lost here. DeCarlo goes from bad to good? The character of Lancaster lacks development and Dureya is only blah as a "bad guy". <br /> <br /> This could be redone with a consistent story and better writing. Of course, it would be a lot more violent with a lot of free sex and everything. The editing would also be jerky, I guess, so let's pretty well.
