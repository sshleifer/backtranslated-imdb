Although the spirit of mencia can be summed up as a clone of Chappelle's show, it's really worse than that. Carlos mencia is above all a jacka ** as funny as it is original, which does not say much. the series contains lame parodies of American TV commercials and political issues, and mencia's "comic" view of politics adds to the mediocre quality of the show. On top of all that, mencia throws himself into more of Jeff Foxkins' joke and stolen line jokes that I can not count on one hand. While from time to time, Carlos laughs cheap, the rest of the time he insults everyone, including exploiting the members of his audience. With the exception of South Park, combined, and the Friday night stand-up, this show marks the end of Chappelle's glory days, which were for those who have never heard him speak before he left for Africa .
