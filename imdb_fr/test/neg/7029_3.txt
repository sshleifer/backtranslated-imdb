This film was awful! Ashley Rose Orr, although she is a talented tap dancer and a singer (a little better than Temple for the latter), is a terrible actress. She embodies the character Shirley we saw on the screen in her films, she plays her character on the screen or on the screen. So we get an excessively biting and totally unrealistic portrait (not to mention uninteresting). If you want to see this side of her, you can just rent one of her movies. The only bright light here is the portrait of Gertrude Temple by Connie Britton. I do not think it was very realistic, but at least it was well played. Save yourself and rent The Poor Little Rich Girl.
