First of all - although I think that Joel Schumacher is at best a mediocre director and more often downright bad (as here), the lion's share of the responsibility for this tragic parody of a film goes to John Grisham, whose the novel is based. <br /> <br /> Placed at an indeterminate time (the 50s or 70s now?), the film begins with the rape and murder of a child committed by rednecks, so well caricatured that their goal seems to be to reassure the racists. that "at least we are not so bad" ?? Cut to the bad guys coming to court when the girl's father, Samuel L. Jackson, fearing to lose his technical sense, cold-blooded weapons before the trial. <br /> <br /> The decor is a "deep south" that probably never existed - the rare black characters live in huts and seem to pick cotton, racist tinted in wool (Kiefer Sutherland is a version of cartoon of a Klansman) are laughable in their malice. The centerpiece is the lawsuit: for the defense, it's the "good guys" - a milquetoast lawyer played by Matthew McConaughey as in a coma, his assistant played by Sandra Bullock's breasts (she does not seem to serve any other purpose narrative) and Donald Sutherland as a drunken-required-lawyer-who-de-sober-to-fight-the-good-fight. For the prosecution, Kevin Spacey pretends to be a demon, while in town, crosses are burned, witnesses are intimidated and local citizens do not seem to care. <br /> <br /> Some of the critics here claim that the film is immoral, since Samuel Jackson is surely a killer and should trust the police instead of indulging in a weak oratory of Matthew McConaughey. To be honest, even if the underlying message "Vigilante justice is good" may seem shocking, everything in the film stinks: the characters are pitiful, the acting, the hectic direction, the scenario and the dialogue almost to the parody. Peter Menzies lush, Technicolor cinematography from the 50's is pretty but derivative. <br /> <br /> And it's been going on for almost two and a half hours !! <br /> <br /> What is left to say? It's a 141-minute loss from anyone's life, it's tedious, empty and tiring, and, almost after the fact, morally repugnant.
