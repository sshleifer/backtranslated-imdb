So many bad reviews, it made me wonder, what do people think when watching a simple movie directed by a very bad director ??? Did you all expect a flawless movie super-success? Raj Kumar Kohli loves multi-starring movies. All his previous works were multi-stars, but nobody was perfect. Take the first Jaani Dushman, for example, with so many faults, but still fun. Jaani Dushman is a Hindi fantasy film about a snake, which can take any form (Armaan (Munish) Kohli) who avenges the suicide of his lover (Manisha Koirala) against the perpetrators of the crime. It's pretty good, with excellent distribution. But I think it could have been a lot better. For example, take the script, can not say it's perfect. For example, take ages: <br /> <br /> Are 40- to 48-year-olds still studying at university? <br /> <br /> There are many more, I will not list more, but there are a dozen more. A good 5.5 is good for this one. <br /> <br /> **. 75
