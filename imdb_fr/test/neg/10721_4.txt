As a big fan of Jim Carey, I sat at the cinema with optimism. After all, Fun With Dick And Jane seemed to have all the raw materials to make this another Carey success. After the first five minutes of good humor, it seemed that this film was going to give results, but it went wrong from the beginning of the plot. The idea that a charming and prestigious VIP employee can suddenly find himself at work in his nearest supermarket It's so hard to believe and it's almost impossible to understand that this guy has become a big criminal. The actors also seem confused with the situation. Of course, the stereotypical, rich and indifferent leader of the operation does not have a hard time making his character one-dimensional, but for Carey and the others around him, the job is much more difficult. One minute, Dick is perceived as an arrogant office pro, obsessed with business, the next minute he's a pesky brothel who barely knows how to chain two words, and he ends up becoming a little thief who can, quite happily, put a gun the head of the man. Jane is also confused with her role and her character never really goes away. <br /> <br /> The idea behind the story is so good and it is a pity that this movie did not succeed in making it work. We can find the strange moment of laughter, but it's usually a more physical humor than anything that is spiritual or intelligent. Carey does her best to save a sinking ship, but her comic talent will never blossom into a character who has so many gaping holes for her personality. Carey shines when he is presented with a strong and bold character (Man on the Moon, The Truman Show, Ace Ventura) that this film has never presented to him, despite all his efforts.
