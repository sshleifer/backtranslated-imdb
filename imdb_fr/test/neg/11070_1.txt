If I could give this excuse for a film a score of 0 or a negative note, I would do it. I was stupid enough to take this DVD in the store, read the introductory text and think, it looks pretty good, I'm going to spend £ 10 and buy it. all I got in the end was a £ 10 coaster. Absolutely horrible, I do not even know where to start. I have no idea why anyone gave more than 2 stars to this idea because I can not think of a good thing to say about it. <br /> <br /> The plot consists essentially of 7 people entering an unexplored cave, one of whom is a journalist. no one else knows they are there. When they enter the cave, they can not go out and get killed one by one by a monster. It turns out that there is no reason for the reporter. One of the characters has past demons where his ex-girlfriend drowned in a cave 2 years ago ... there seems to be no relevance or reason for that either, just a hogwash attempt for to build a character, I suppose? Anyway, the monster turns out to be a guy who wandered into the cave as a normal little kid and lived there all his life. For no reason makes him superhuman, able to shine, to see in the dark, to take bullets, to breathe under water, to be in two places at once and to have a crazy force (able to move rocks, to wear men as dead weight, etc.). <br /> <br /> At the end of the scene, there are 2 women still alive, they wake up naked, just covered with a piece of carpet or other. They then find a picture of a child. The monster then burst into the door, wrapped in a carpet with a kind of animal skull on his head (said in the director's commentary, it was a raven skull, if that was the biggest raven I've ever seen have seen in my life) and literally goes "Raaahhh" as a child on Halloween. I was watching this with my boyfriend and at that moment, he literally burst out laughing. The guy then sees a picture of himself as a child and makes him a flashback sitting under a tree, his face burned, then getting up and wandering in the cave. This is the magnitude of the story that explains why it mutilates people and it leaves you a little cheated for a story. The monster then kills one of the women and brutally rapes the other, cut to end the credits. I know that the rape scene was designed to be shocking, but as a woman, I felt very sick and that's what touched me the most throughout the movie. He could have killed her and cut her up and eat her. It would have been less horrible than the rape scene. <br /> <br /> There are so many things left unanswered in the end. In addition to all that, the scenes where there were both black and black minutes were boring and where the nauseating camera angles were still ubiquitous and where you could not see what was happening was hurting me so much at one point given. I almost turned it off. An absolutely terrible movie. You might as well get the money you were going to spend on it and set it on fire. It would be money better spent, as a smart person says, posted on top of me, once you've looked at it, you can not look at it anymore.
