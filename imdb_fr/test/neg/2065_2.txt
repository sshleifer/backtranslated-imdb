I was an extra in this film, but I would have liked not to be because it's waste. the worst thing about this movie is the music but the actor, the script, the editing, the staging and the story are also terrible. The main reason for its bad side is its budget so low and the only way to make a good movie on a small budget is to have a good screenplay. the scenario that should have been torn before the film was made is not funny, I did not laugh once. What made me laugh was the way the filmmakers probably thought the most important thing was to make the film, no matter if it's total hogwash. the film needed about a million more pounds and a better writer. The only reason I did not give the film one in ten is because I felt sorry for the guy who is going to lose a few hundred thousand dollars by doing that, if you go to see him, make sure you are drunk. ha ha
