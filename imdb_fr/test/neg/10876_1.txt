Or, that's what the filmmakers would have you believe, anyway. <br /> <br /> This film tries so much to be cold, it's ridiculous. Everything from the look of the film, the cinematography, the editing, the dialogues and the acting, is designed in a super cool mode from the start. To make sure no one knows how cool this movie is, there's a soundtrack of really cool rock'n'roll and a western-surf-tex mexican twangy guitar playing all the time. throughout the film. Finally, as a reminder of how cool this film is, all the actors were asked to speak in a hoarse voice, because, as we all know, it's bullshit. <br /> <br /> The plot (if there is one) seems simple enough. But as someone has already pointed out, the director and star of the movie seem determined not to tell this story. Instead, they focus on a plethora of naked babes and dialogues that are supposed to be tough, but are surprisingly quick to tire a contest to see how many times they could pack the words "pussy" and "f * ck" and their derivatives into a film of 80 minutes?). <br /> <br /> This movie was absolutely horrible.
