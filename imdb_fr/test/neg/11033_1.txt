Avoid this movie if you are looking for entertainment. <br /> <br /> It is filled with aspirants trying to be what they are not and Emraan is simply ruined in the role of a tour guide who falls in love with a new go to theater school. Seriously, where do these people come from? It's not because you're pretty that you can play a role or become an actress. <br /> <br /> Asmit Patel must send a letter of apology to all those who look at him accidentally ridicule themselves in this bad excuse for a movie. He plays the role of a tasteless gangster who sucks girls and forces them to fall in love with him and sells them to the highest bidder.
