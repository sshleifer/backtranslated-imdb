It's a fact that this is the first Saudi feature film to be shown in cinemas, but not in Saudi Arabia for the simple reason that we do not have movie theaters in our vast realm ... not just one movie theater! The government has banned the opening of cinemas after Islamic extremists OR religious police (or both) called for its closure in the late 1970s and early 1980s ... accusing the 7th art of encouraging bad sex and things like that ... I do not do it. Do not see a powerful reason why we do not open cinemas !! .. we have many video stores all over the kingdom, we watch movies on TV from some satellite channels, we can install the channels "Showtime" and, after all, the movies in general seem harmless to good I know many people how to go to neighboring countries only to watch some movies. Personally, I have been to Bahrain many times to watch movies in theaters, because it is very fun to watch a movie like at home. The Saudis pay the most expensive movie ticket in the world. We watch movies, while the rest of the world has cinemas in every city. This is one of the problems we face !! .. <br /> <br /> The film is produced and presented by Rotana Filmed Entertainment, a large company owned by Saudi tycoon prince Alwaleed Bin Talal (the eighth richest man in the world). <br /> The title of the movie is a word that literally means "how are you?" but it's also a slang meaning "what's up!", sometimes used as slang to say "bad" about something and sometimes used as slang to politely tell someone to take care of their things and do not interfere in someone else's business. Anyway, I think they meant (how are you) and (what's up!) At the same time, I could be wrong though. <br /> <br /> Male actors are from Saudi Arabia, like Hisham Abdulrahman, who is very famous and has a little popularity after winning first prize in Arabian Realty Show plus as "American Idol" he works in some TV programs like the Arabic version of "Cash Taxi" .. the other famous actor is Khaled Sami who is funny and has a very good sense of humor .. other actors such as Mishal Al-Mutairi, Turki Al-Yusuf and Ali Al Sabea are less famous and work in some TV series. The actresses are non-Saudi and have been very successful talking about Saudi accent. The Jordanian actress But Hamdan in the leading role and actress emeritus Fatima Al-Hawsani .. not that we do not have Saudi actresses but we are few and not like that good. <br /> <br /> A Saudi critic "Rja Al-Mutairi" who writes for Alriyadh Newspaper (the most popular newspaper of the kingdom) wrote about it: "do not expect much of the first Saudi feature film He was born in unusual circumstances and therefore can not be judged according to the usual norms, unlike any other film.It is a fact that the film was a huge financial success during its first days of opening in the Kingdom. from Bahrain is on a Saudi family treats (interacts) with controversial new issues within Saudi society such as: women driving cars, shallow thoughts about the arts, corporate trusteeship by a certain group the differences between being conservative and being an extremist.The ideas are good but you feel that you are lost in the middle of the film.One of the advantages of the movie is the beautiful score of Rajeh Dawood, who was good, m sometimes it does not match or express the content of the image. Turki Al-Yusuf did a great job. His performance was the best alongside But Hamdan. The biggest loser is the lead actor Hisham Abdulrahman, behind secondary actors Mishal Al-Mutairi, Ali Al Sabea and Khaled Sami. good job within the limits of their roles. <br /> <br /> after all, "Keif al-hal?" Even with all its disadvantages, the film is still a good film and it's a very good first stage of Rotana .. and the film has become the talk of people and streets, which is a golden goal to spark lively debate in the Saudi film society in general until they become aware of the importance of the 7th art and other arts "<br /> <br /> PS: another Saudi filmmaker" Abdullah Almohaisen " claims to have made the first Saudi film called "Shadows of Silence." <I have not seen the movie yet, I hope I have been helpful.
