This series is perhaps one of the most boring and funny I have ever seen. While the humor was subtle, and I'm all for subtle humor; the jokes were just not funny. <br /> <br /> The show is about two kiwis over the age of 30 living in New York trying to start their career in music. <br /> I saw this Episode where Brett leaves the other Kiwi behind him during an assault. Okay, the idea of ​​the plot has potential; but I had the impression that half of the episode was just a fill, and the other half was actually important to the story. <br /> <br /> I mean, they continued to explain how the one who was left felt betrayed and had a lot of mistrust for the other guy. I have a piece of advice for writers: mention it once for fools who can not understand it by the way it plays the role and move on. <br /> <br /> And I found the characters boring. The character who left the other behind, Brett, proved too innocent and naive, the one who stayed walked talking about this monotonous and robotic voice. <br /> <br /> A third character, who was the leader of the band, was obviously incompetent, but he was the only character I liked. He also won the show to give him a star. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's a show I have no intention of seeing again.
