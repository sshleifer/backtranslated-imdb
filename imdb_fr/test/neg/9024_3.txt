John Wayne's most passionate followers will be moved to watch The Lawless Frontier. Even for a poverty studio, this one is a stinkeroo. <br /> <br /> Unusual for a western, we have a criminal who is a perpetrator of a sexual crime. Earl Dwire plays a white and Indian mongrel who, for reasons that are not explained, claims he is a Mexican accent, hokey and all. Dwire looks like the Frito Bandito of the advertising glory of the time. <br /> <br /> He and his gang meet up against Gabby Hayes and his daughter Sheila Terry. They do not really have anything worth stealing, but Dwire just wants an excuse to kidnap Terry and get away with it. She hears the despicable fate she has in store and she and Hayes are fleeing the ranch. <br /> <br /> Where they meet John Wayne who is on the trail of bandits. They also meet a very silly sheriff who believes that Wayne is one of the bandits. Again for reasons that I do not understand very well. <br /> <br /> It was a difficult way to make a living by preparing horse operas like these for the Duke. Fortunately, better things would happen.
