I have as much testosterone as the next guy and Raquel Welch is well worth a look; but the fact is that a cardboard cut could work better, and an hour and a half of Mrs. W showing her considerable assets does not produce a film. <br /> <br /> Given the casting, it is surprising that it is as bad as it is. I've never been a big fan of Wagner and his badass Harry is about as convincing as a $ 9 bill. Godfrey Cambridge and Vittorio de Sica, whom I enjoy both, seem to sleep through their lines; and as for Edward G ... well, I can only assume he was there for the pay check. <br /> <br /> This film is a mess: from the non-existent plot to the puerile slapstick action and boring 'caper' music of the '60s. If it had not been Miss Welch, I would have given a 0. That said, she is a feast for the eyes - even better than her delicious cameo in "Bedazzled" - and for that reason alone I gave her a 3.
