It may be that the film I saw is totally different from the one others have seen. However, as the actors are identical, I can only think that the editing I saw in Europe differs from the one in circulation in the United States. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it was the worst movie I've seen in the last five years. (Followed closely by The Waterboy ...) <br /> <br /> Why: Because, in my opinion, this director has taken elements of each thriller that precede it, mixed them, placed in the wrong order with bad music and published it. <br /> <br /> (Examples: nothing happens, the music becomes scary and nothing happens.) The "grumpy" officer grumpy in a way that would let the actor scratch any classroom. There is a moment of buddy coming from nowhere at the end.There is an inevitable scene and in the next scene all the problems are gone.) <br /> <br /> If you want to see a movie smart: see Memento. If you want to see a better thriller: see all the thrillers that come to your mind. If you want to see Patrick Swayze: see Dirty Dancing.
