A post-apocalyptic warrior leaves to save a kind of nun and meets on the way cyber-punks on skates that want to kick his ass. This is one of the most difficult movies to watch. There are scenes of silence that seem to last for hours before someone comes out with the next line that is poorly written, misinterpreted. There are action sequences that keep repeating themselves - and we're not talking about 1-2-3 quickfire action repetition on a particularly good shot that has been made popular by Eastern filmmakers, we are talking about many repetitions of long and bad combat sequences. It's incredibly confusing at first, but it gets annoying as you watch a 30-second sequence for the 2nd, 3rd and 4th time. Any kind of intrigue or vision is lost in the confused continuity, the only thing that keeps this movie in the video player (aside from a friend's bet that I could not look at it from end to end without praying it to disable it) although painful, this film is unintentionally hilarious, I'm not at all a fan of these movies of the genre "so bad that it's funny" was in tears. The quality of the sound and the image is another point to note, but it is forgivable, because it was obvious that the money was a major problem in the realization of this film. Final Verdict - King of the genre "so bad that they are funny", anyone with this kind of video night genre should get a copy. Let's not forget that it's actually the worst movie I've ever seen.
