I am also a fan of SF, among other genres, and I particularly like these movies of the 60s and 70s with their premise "Ideas on the effects" which produced so many smart and friendly stories on the screen. In a nutshell, I totally agree with scott-886's opinion of this film. I heard about this movie, and being what I mentioned before, a SF lover, with a fondness for SF stories with a touch of "Twilight Zone", I was expecting a lot, and my expectations have been raised with critics classifying the effects of this "second best" film at Kubrick's "2001 Space Odyssey". What fraud. "Journey away from the sun", was an ordinary film, convoluted, half-cooked, silly, with laughable amateur special effects (and remember that I love the films of this era and I despise computer-generated images) and that we can fully compare it further. The catastrophes of the 60's SF, such as "Marooned", that "Journey" reminded me a lot. The idea behind all this is not so bad, but the construction of the plot about the history of a planet twin to Earth, on which the same world is reversed, asked a master like Kubrick of the lead. Needs to say that Robert Parish has nothing to do with it, so he presented a boring and silly movie, which looked a lot like a morning TV series of those days. No need to waste your time, even if you are an absolute fan of the genre.
