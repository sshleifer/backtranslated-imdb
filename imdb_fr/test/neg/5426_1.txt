Oh my God, it's so stupid. Completely useless, offensive and repulsive. Why do authors have so much trouble getting Zoey and Chase together? We want them all too! in normal shows, there is actually MORE than one plot conflict in the show, wow, what concept. moreover, you can not even distinguish episodes of Zoey 101 from each other, because the same thing happens every time. Quinn runs Dustin for something strange, Nicole is gigantic and stupid, Zoey is just a little there, Chase drooling after her but she's surprisingly missing it, and Logan is a repeat con. Quinn runs Dustin for something strange, Nicole is gigantic and stupid, Zoey is just a little there, Chase drooling after her but she's surprisingly missing it, and Logan is a repeat con. it's like a bottle of shampoo. and the end of the film, again. So unnecessary that nothing happens. it is as if they had specifically designed it so that the film could fit between two episodes of the series and that the series would remain completely unchanged after the plot of the film.
