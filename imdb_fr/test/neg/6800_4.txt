I could have loved that if I did not like Diane Arbus. <br /> <br /> I did not really capture the unique visual aesthetic of Arbus (as Stanley Kubrick did in "The Shinning", with the binoculars in the hallway, a direct tribute to the one of the most famous photos of Arbus, and one with haunting qualities that none of these film images have), and certainly none of its character (outgoing), its resemblance (thin and Jewish, not the Queen Kidman wasp), nor life, except for some very superficial similarities, it is a fashion that later photographed "monsters" and "strangers", among other things. This film focused on the "phenomenon", as a symbol of artistic and personal empowerment, in a very superficial and predictable way. Apart from that, it could have been an interesting movie about the middle-class fetish, but I was too bored to care about it. <br /> <br /> Maybe if Arbus' name had been left out, it might have been less boring, but if there was not his name in the title, nothing would not have interested me to see that in the first place. A disappointment of "secretary".
