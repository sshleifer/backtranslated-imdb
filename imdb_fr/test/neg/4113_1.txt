Man, I went to this movie because of the great preview. It looked like a beautiful story and pretty special effects. <br /> <br /> I was wrong. I wanted to get out of the theater because of these horrible special effects. A cartoon dino, cardboard, would do a better job than this one. The story was good, if it had been taken by a big movie producer. Who would pay more money for the effect to look more like life. The only thing I liked in this film where plants appear everywhere. <br /> <br /> Worse, where cars, in a scene, two characters walk in the street. If you look at these cars, you will see the following: Taxi, car, motorcycle, tri-pod, big bus. And about 4 times in a row! <br /> <br /> And then there is the "death of the butterfly" which would require all "changes of evolution" to progress. If this guy had not walked on the butterfly, the next dino would have eaten it anyway! So, it's absolute bull. Then, if you change something in the past, the future will be different at the same time. Not in those "waves of time" that they made. But hey, if the future changed in a fraction of a second, the movie would be even worse, but more realistic though. This is just one of those movies you should see when you want to laugh. I spend a lot of money for this movie at the theater. And then they tell me that this film had a budget of 80 million dollars. Where was all this money spent?
