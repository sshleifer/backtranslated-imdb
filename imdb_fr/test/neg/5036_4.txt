The brief existence of The Sex Pistols and the shooting of this film after the controversial and revolutionary breakup of the English punk band have both occurred before my birth. However, I started listening to their only album, "Never Mind the B * &% @ # & s, Here's the Sex Pistols", in 2003, when I was a teenager, and I quickly became a big fan. I did not see "The Great Rock '' Roll Swindle" before 2006, but I saw it many times that year and thought it was pretty good (definitely not great, but pretty good) , although I could only remember bits of it, and did not see how it all connected. Seeing it a third time, almost three years after the second, it did not bother me at all. I'm not even sure what I found so good about most of them initially (I do not remember now). <br /> <br /> This film is a fake documentary, in which Malcolm McLaren, director of Sex Pistols, tells side story of the group and its members; guitarist Steve Jones, credited here as "The Crook"; drummer Paul Cook, credited with "The Tea-Maker"; bassist Sid Vicious, credited with "The Gimmick"; and John Lydon (aka Johnny Rotten), credited with "The Collaborator". McLaren claims he created the band (and even the punk rock genre) as a scam to make money. He tells much of the story to Helen Wellington-Lloyd (aka Helen of Troy), to various places they go together. It's basically a hodgepodge of McLaren lyrics, Pistols songs, live group footage, fictitious (often silly, strange) scenes, several cartoons, and so on. same movie, to tell the story of the manager of the Pistols in a bizarre way! <br /> <br /> It has been proven that McLaren was a liar, I know many have already pointed out, including the group members. He was NOT the driving force of the band, he did not create them (he also did not invent punk rock, and the Sex Pistols were not even the first punk band, although they are unique ). It was the group members who made the group what it was. "The Filth and the Fury", a much more credible film about the group of Julien Temple, who directed this film, is told from the point of view of the group members, who contradict the claims of McLaren. However, the dishonesty of "The Great Rock 'n Roll Roll" is not my biggest problem with it. If it was really entertaining (which I thought I was to a certain extent), I could forget about it, as I obviously did before. During my third screening, apart from Sex Pistols songs, live footage and at least a slightly amusing cartoon sequence, it was rather boring! I found the song "Who Killed Bambi" rather amusing at first, but she soon got tired. <br /> <br /> Does this dummy document deserve to be observed by Sex Pistols fans? It seems like a lot of fans would say it, not to find out more about the true story of the 70's punk band, but short-lived but revolutionary, but entertaining. It was once my opinion on "The big rock 'n roll scam". After the first time I looked at it, I did not remember anything that McLaren had said, and the second time I knew what the director of the Pistols was using to let this film be heard, but I still could not remember nothing. I heard him say! Of course, other aspects of the film were what I found impressive. Now, after my third visit, I certainly remember some of the things McLaren said, but it was still not 100% clear. Like most movies, I guess his lyrics are not memorable, probably because of the way they are presented. If you're a fan of the Pistols, I guess it would not hurt to try "Swindle", but for me, for the most part, it's just an incoherent and boring mess that tries to be funny but that fails.
