I just attended a preview screening of this movie. It was not a documentary masterpiece. Totally absorbed by her subject, the film becomes unable to comment critically on Ms. Faye. The only quality that redeems the film, that is to say, disgusting and sapped, is its use of puppets in an attempt (although failed) to structure a story. But the most frightening experience occurred when the closing credits were launched. The audience stood up and applauded. Like flaming butterflies, 21st century Americans are still drawn to freakshows. The story of the misunderstood monster is rather tired.
