Yes, this magazine may contain spoilers, but you will thank me for it. It's the worst movie I've seen in a long time. I came to this forum hoping to have the same answer as me, but inexplicably, there are several people who like this film and the performance of Spacey in particular. <br /> <br /> Some will blame me for having said it, but I think Kevin Spacey plays quite limited despite the admiration of the world for him. I had the impression of looking at a more nasty version of Kevin's role in "American Beauty". His character in this film is ridiculously exaggerated, until his derisive insults that he throws at his assistant. <br /> <br /> There are banal and boring scenes, like when Spacey attacks Whaley. Equal instead of Sweat and Low. Somehow, I suspected that this particular scene was supposed to be funny, but at that moment, I was ready to press the stop button (it's about 20 minutes in the movie). <br /> <br /> What about the fake homage to "Resevoir Dogs"? Whaley proclaims, "I think I've seen that in a movie already," as if he was going to cut off Spacey's ear. But what does he use to cut it? An envelope! That's right, he'll give her paper cuts! It must be one of the worst scenes ever in Hollywood, and the fact that the actors and the director have tried to make it with an impassive face makes it all the more dreadful. <br /> <br /> I must admit that I do not see the end of this film (my DVD was happily closed about half an hour before the end), but anyone who would like it could tell me that I was wrong and that everything would have seemed logical to me. Well, I do not care what happened at the end, because it could never compensate for all this bad acting and excessive dialogue. I even had the feeling that the actors themselves wanted to get out of this movie as badly as me.
