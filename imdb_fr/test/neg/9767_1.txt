This movie was not good at all. I could see him at a movie festival and did not like the content I had to watch. It's a well-turned movie about a family looking to reconnect after the death of its cornerstone (Gabrielle Union). the film stars Billy Dee Williams as Gabrielle's Union's brother. In fact, Gabrielle Union portrayed the woman in her youth, which should help explain why this woman was the older sister of Billy Dee Williams. It must have been Billy Dee William's worst performance ever in his career. He did not seem to remember his lines in a few scenes. He was an incomparable character, almost never empathetic, who had a daughter when he was married to a white woman with whom he already had a daughter. The two girls are now older, and while the girl he had with the white woman (Lucy) was trying to communicate with him, her other daughter did not want to have anything to do with him. The character of Billy Dee was so pathetic that the only way to get him from Paris to his sister's funeral was to tell him that the funeral had already passed and that his late sister had left him responsible for the management of his writings. . Why did they have to deceive him? Because he did not like attending the funeral. I know. You ask, "but he did not want to attend the funeral of his own sister too?" Yes! He says he did not like to be surrounded by the feelings of emotions shared by respectful people. He did not want to have anything to do with it. Now, are we supposed to sympathize with this hole **? The rest of the performances in the movie were flat with equally flat characters. The director and the editor did not care about the rhythm of the film. Flashbacks were painful to watch. It was a bad movie. However, he seems to be the favorite of black film festivals; a film that glorifies the African Americans' dependence on Caucasians to find a love with which they can settle, even if it is a healthy relationship. When lame love stories like this win the prize for the best festivals in black film festivals, it makes me question the judgment of blacks about movies. In these same festivals, the only award-winning films are educational films about Afro-American culture and black films directed by white directors. I'm not saying that something is wrong with a white person who runs stories written for people of color. The problem with these films is that they never discuss two points of view, which are usually the movies that actually talk to the masses. These films are often unilateral forms of didacticism. These films fail to execute the powers on both sides of the argument around which the film runs. Writers and directors never compose the scenes and sequences that contradict your final statement with as much truth and energy as those that reinforce it. These movies always lean on the argument. What I mean is that it's the people who run these black film festivals that judge a film from pure content, which for me means: direct, play, write a cinematography, edit, and so on. about African-American culture? Are we supposed to expect a film like Constellation to have a chance to play in the world against movies like "Million Dollar Baby" and "Sideways?" What happened to the film to be entertaining? When I talk about entertainment, I'm talking about the ritual of sitting in the dark, looking at the screen, investing huge concentration and energy in what we hope will be an enriching and rewarding emotional experience. Why can not these festivals enjoy movies that send their messages without preaching? Why can not these black film festivals recognize movies that are well-told and brutally honest and tell the truth? "I believe that we have no responsibility to heal social ills or to renew faith in humanity, to elevate the spirits of society or even to express our inner being. : tell the truth." - Robert McKee. Now, I totally agree with that. These same black film festivals write "Hustle and Flo" as if it were this horrible film stereotyping blacks. However, it's an honest movie about a pimp with a dream. A pimp can not dream? I remember the last time I saw a real pimp, he was a human being. And are pimps and prostitution not a harsh reality in our society in general, not only in the black community, but in the whole world? The powers in "Black Hollywood" think that movies like this make African Americans look bad to others, as if they do not know there are pimps in the hood. The truth is that as long as African-Americans in films can accept the truth about themselves and dare to share it with the world, our films will have no chance in the world. This film was awful. The best thing was cinematography and Zoe.
