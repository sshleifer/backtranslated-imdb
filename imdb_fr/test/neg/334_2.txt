I really did not want to write a harsh review of this film because I really appreciate how difficult it is to make any type of movie with an incredibly small budget, let alone try something as ambitious as a science fiction. <br /> <However, this movie is really awful. The acting game is one of the worst I've ever seen and, as a fan of low budget movies, it's a pretty serious charge. There are many aspiring actors who would work on a deferred payment system if they believed in the film and what the director was trying to achieve. I'm sure the actors did their best, like all the other players in this production, but it just was not enough to make it that big. <br /> <br /> Then there is the dialogue. Very poor indeed. There is no excuse for that. I had the impression that the script was hastily written on the back of a beer rug after an epic session. I hesitate to use the word 'laughable' but that's exactly what the script is. I had no empathy with any of the characters. In fact, they creaked me and wanted to bang some of them more than once. Mr. Stirton has overworked himself by taking on too many roles. Clint Eastwood is not him. Again, there are talented people who are willing to work on the adjournment if they believe in the project. <br /> <br /> We talked a lot about the special effects of this film. For the price, they are exceptional, although they are a little overused. It's like someone said, "I have side effects and I'm going to use it, man." The one who did the work of CG was one of the most talented on this team. <br /> <br /> The money was simply not available to make a film as ambitious as this one. Congratulations on your attempt, but unfortunately it is failing to achieve its ambitious goals in too many ways. <br /> <br /> I greet all who participate in the production, really, but for their next effort, they must either get a better producer or turn a blind eye to something more manageable. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I can not recommend this effort to anyone other than the most enthusiastic film student or usual insomniac. If you'd like to see a true masterpiece of low-budget science fiction movies, try the "Dark Star" student by John Carpenter.
