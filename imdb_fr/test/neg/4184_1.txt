Just above the box I'm typing now, I had to choose a number between 1 and 10 and rate this feature. Unfortunately, there is no option for a number less than zero, and I have to put something. If I had the choice, I would not put anything, no number, because there are no figures that express the uselessness of this film. <br /> <br /> If you decide to watch this movie even after reading all these horrible reviews, make sure there are no sharp or blunt objects in the area, this will save you from try to kill yourself in the middle of the movie. <br /> <br /> I do not know how this movie was released to the public, it should be locked up and kept 24 hours a day, somewhere in Fort Knox. I am sorry that this film is even available to me. I feel deceived by humanity, I had no idea that humans could be so cruel. Stalin, Saddam and Hitler had nothing on this Cowell shower bag. <br /> <br /> Do not be fooled by the cover of the film. 1) There are no scarecrows, no one knows why there is a legitimate scarecrow on the front. 2) None of the characters on the back of the case appear in the smelly movie! 3) The slogan says something about "new moon, more victims", there were no huge casualties, no one died. We do not know if the dam's policeman is dead, and I suppose the murderer is not dead, because he looked like he was hit in the head with a big, ball-shaped bat. <br /> <br /> Do it yourself. a favor and stay away from this movie, he lost about 4 hours of my life. That's right, it took me an hour to look at it (I quickly advanced through the 4-minute zoom scenes that reveal nothing in the plot), I watched TV for about an hour after the end, contemplating my life and I started crying for two hours because I know that someone will unfortunately see this movie and that I can not do anything to stop it.
