When The Spirits Within was released, all you said to the fans of Final Fantasy was how bad the movie was, because it did not look like Final Fantasy. It's a different story, for better or for worse. Familiar settings, characters, music, story and exceptional action scenes should amaze fans of the original game. The problem is that it's just not a good movie in its own right. <br /> <br /> During the fight scenes, the direction is often sloppy, the camera angles change ridiculously fast so that the action seems more frenetic. but only serves to make the scenes confusing and confusing. <br /> <br /> The CG itself is exceptional, but I can not say it's the best I've ever seen since Spirits Within had a lot more details about the Characters, though I must admit that Advent Adventist characters moved much more naturally. <br /> <br /> The plot is practically a black hole. It's a giant deus ex machina designed only to bring back Sephiroth for one last fight. The old characters reappear, but serve no purpose other than to please the fans. The development of the character is non-existent and the film resolves absolutely none of the threads of the plot left in suspense after the end of the game. But it offers beautiful scenes of combat with magic, invocations and limits, which is probably what the fans wanted anyway. <br /> <br /> In the end, Advent Children is a very flashy action movie, but totally mentally crazy. it serves more parallel story for Final Fantasy VII than a real sequel. <br /> <br /> By the way, do not think that you hurt my feelings by voting No useful. It just makes me feel better knowing that the fanboys / fangirls feel my objectivity so deeply.
