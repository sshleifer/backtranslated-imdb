I knew it was going to be awful but not so awful !! Because it's one of the most boring movies I've ever seen, nothing happens. All the characters are sad, and the story is stupid and incredibly boring !, Plus the ending is particularly lame! The only reason I rented this piece of shit because I'm a big fan of Michael Dudikoff, but he's lost here and looks extremely bored and shows no emotion whatsoever! And I applauded at the end of the film! It's as if the movie had no plot and nothing to talk about, and Ice-T is awful (even if it's OK for some projects), plus Dudikoff and Yvette Nipar had no chemistry together. There is a scene that the director has tried to make emotional, but it fails miserably because Yvette Nipar did not really show much emotion. However, there is a decent car chase scene, but it's not enough for me to recommend this awful movie! the more the dialogue is atrocious. Avoid this movie like the plague, it does not happen anything, avoid it and trust me, you can thank me after -word. The management is horrible! Fred Olen Ray does a horrible job here, with poor quality camera work, ridiculously inexpensive sets, awful angles, ludicrous use of archival footage and film at an incredibly boring pace. The game is terrible! Michael Dudikoff is far from his usual surprise, he looks extremely bored, and shows no emotion, his character is also extremely dull, I can not believe he signed for this trash, he had no more chemistry with Yvette Nipar (Dudikoff still reigns !!!). Ice-T has almost nothing to do and also looks bored, and he did not convince me at all. Hannes Jaenicke is not very good here, he had a weak character, I did not like him. Yvette Nipar is pretty but was really terrible here, she did not show much emotion and had no chemistry with Dudikoff, and as a result I did not care about her character! Hindle Art (Owen Marsh), Kathy Harren (Katharine Marsh) and the rest of the cast are equally bad. Overall, avoid like the plague!, Fred Olen Ray and Steve Lathshaw should be ashamed of themselves! BOMB on 5
