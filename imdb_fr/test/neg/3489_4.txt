The plot of this movie contains some holes in which you could drive a huge truck, but I think it's not always a top priority in the horror. Two elderly sisters living in rural England have been keeping their brother in the cellar for over 30 years. Now he has escaped and started a killing, focusing on the military who are lodged nearby. "We only thought it was better for him" they repeat and ?? strangely ?? all the officers of the army like these women and do not doubt their sincerity, even if 5 of their men are dead. I do not know if you have to find the revelation near the end with suspense ?? or tedious! In a sense, this movie reminded me of "Arsenic and old lace". In this classic black comedy, two half-crazed brothers and sisters also feed their ugly little brother, but they kill there. The old ladies of The Beast in the Cellar, however, are no less crazy. The "horror" of this film of the early 70s is very amateurish and cheap, but there are some sensible attempts to accentuate the tension. Too many "old ladies" talk about the good old days, and that's rarely what you're looking for in a horror movie with such an appealing title. Flora Robson, who can be recognized by classic moviegoers, plays one of the sisters. She gave the Queen of England an image of the legendary crash movie Errol Flynn, the Sea Hawk.
