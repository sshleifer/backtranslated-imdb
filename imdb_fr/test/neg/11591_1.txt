Komodo vs. Cobra starts as environmentalist "One Planet" Jerry Ryan (Ryan McTavish) and his girlfriend Carrie (Renee Talbert) hire captain Michael Stoddard (executive producer Michael Par√©) to take them to an island in the South Pacific, first reluctant Stoddard because the island is a very secret military research base, but quickly changes its mind when offered a sum of money. In the company of television reporter Sandra Crescent (Jeri Manthey), they set sail for the island and once discovered on shore that the military was financing illegal DNA genetic experiments that led to the creation of huge Komodo Dragon and King Cobra that devoured almost all living things. there and Stoddard & co are the next on the menu ... <br /> <br /> Co-written and directed by the always awful Jim Wynorski under his pseudonym of Jay Andrews, it's just awful, it's Simply hard to sit across and is even worse than the usual "Creature Specs" sci-fi channel trash have the nerve of the air if that's possible. The scenario is terrible, predictable and totally boring, some giant monsters are created by scientists who manipulate DNA, a group of people is trapped with such monsters and must try to avoid being eaten. That's it, it's all Komodo's plot against Cobra, maybe it was to try to rip AVP: Alien vs. Predator (2004) with the title but all the "vs." This equates to a deadlock of thirty seconds between the two titular beasts, at the very end, boring and surely a great disappointment for all those who hope to have a complete mash of monsters. The character is poor, the dialogue is horrible, the pace is slow, the story is predictable and the cliche mounted and all the film is really naze with a lazy scenario that wrongly indicates that both Komodo Dragon's and Cobra are amphibious, this that they are not. Damn, Komodo vs. Cobra is not even worth looking for involuntary laughter because it's so dull and almost nothing happens, although the sight of a woman hiding behind the smallest rock on the beach Cobra is pretty funny for the wrong reasons. <br /> <br /> How does Wynorski continue to get direct jobs? He is probably still the worst director to date. How can he continue to have fun playing movies shot in beautiful places with almost decent castes while releasing such a horrible movie? I think it was cut to get a PG or for his TV show since every time someone swears he is masked by a parrot parrot! There is no violence or gore and the monster scenes are soft, people stand there, the monsters stand there too whistling or roaring and that's about it. The effects of the CGI computer are terrible, it's really a very poor thing that looks horrible. <br /> <br /> With a supposed budget of about $ 450,000, it sounds as cheap as that, the Hawaiian sites are nice to watch, but about that. The acting is mediocre on the part of those who seem indifferent. <br /> <br /> Komodo vs. Cobra is an absolutely terrible "creature chain" from Jim Wynorski's Sci-Fi channel. The movies do not get worse than that.
