I admire secretly Love Thy Neighbor's original television series - mainly because they present the kind of exuberant brusquerie and bad taste synonymous with so many programs of their day - but I would lie (very uncomfortable position) if I claimed that this spin-off on the big screen is something other than an abomination. The first scenes of free vandalism are not only useless, but also disconcerting - we have never been told why the film starts with a hunt for people ruining each other - and nothing improves from there. . At the moment the film unveils the oldest joke of the book - the horrible dragon of a mother-in-law stops unexpectedly - is followed by the blatant revelation that she was developing a faint for the father of the black neighbor, the moving bigot son to ever greater depths of ignorant rage, the most discerning spectators will have extinguished. Take this as a warning, unless you like the fallout from the political radical with terrible acting, static direction and the comical flair of an orphanage on fire.
