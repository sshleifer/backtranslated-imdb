Anyone who thinks this movie is great desperately needs to be examined. It seems to me that this film was made as a joke. This has no advantage. The props cost about $ 10 and the set seems to be able to fall at any time. Why are films like this one made in the first place? This also had two of the most boring characters I have ever met in the young boy on the spacecraft and the twentieth century redneck. This film is almost as bad as "Cool as Ice" with the incredibly talented Vanilla "misunderstood" Ice.
