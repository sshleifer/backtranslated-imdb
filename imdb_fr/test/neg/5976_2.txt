Movies like this give a bad name to independent films! This is simply a boring compilation of vintettes, without any structure. I would not be surprised if the scriptwriter was completely stoned. If you want to see a good stoner comedy, watch "Half Baked". He's not a laureate, but at least it made me laugh. The film was obviously made with a micro-budget. Every scene happens either in someone's house, their apartment or somewhere in the open air. If the writing was good and the dialogue interesting, I would have ignored the budget of the film (as in the case of Edward Burns films), but this is obviously not the case this time. <br /> <br /> I quote Robert DeNiro from "A Bronx Tale" when I say, "There is nothing worse in the world than wasted talents." Everyone in the cast is talented. Luke Wilson, Alicia Witt, Brittany Murphy, Jeremy Sisto - all talented artists! And they've all been in better movies. The actors gave everything, but they could not go too far with such a lame scenario. The only scene I found interesting was Jack Black's cameo, where he sings a song about his life in the woods. And of course, there was the brief strip club scene at first, which I also found appealing. <br /> <br /> The characters are irrelevant and the story hardly exists. Many movies are awful, but at least you understand their intentions. What was the intention of "Bongwater"? The world will never know. <br /> <br /> My score: 2 (out of 10)
