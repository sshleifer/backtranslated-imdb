Evil has never been so bad. They thought so. <br /> <br /> When one of my friends bought this DVD in a half-price bookstore, I did not know what to expect. I mean, based on the title, I knew it was worth laughing, but I did not know how it would be really laughable. <br /> <br /> The first time, I missed part of the dialogue (if you could call it that) because we were all too busy making fun of the plot. It seemed like it was written in less than a week, and they did not have the budget to fix some of the minor flaws. Wait, did I say "minor"? I meant exactly the opposite. For example, the main character is credited with "Ken", but several times in the film, he is called "John". <br /> <br /> If the holes in the plot are not fun enough for you, take a look at the actor. Nobody seems too concerned about the zombie raids in his state, including the main character's mother, who has been missing for days while sitting in front of a fireplace reading a book. <br /> <br /> Budget constraints puts on the film are just as hilarious. Maybe they did not have permission to film anywhere, because during SCENE BIG MOTORCYCLE CHASE, the characters obey all the rules of the road. The zombies, who had just killed twenty people, stop at a stop sign coming out of a parking lot. I do not even do that, but again, I'm not a zombie biker. The end of the movie seems to be short of money. It ends so suddenly that you want more ... On reflection, it ends soon enough. <br /> <br /> So if you're looking for a good time with your friends, look for this movie. It's a super unintentional comedy.
