I usually spend almost as much time writing my reviews as watching the movie, but with Today You Die, I feel it would be a waste of criminal time for me. <br /> <br /> Here are five years. One minute to tell how bad this movie is. <br /> <br /> There was a time, in the mid-80s, when one glance of Steven Seagal was enough to split the ribs; a sullen look could upset you. If he caught you, he would break you like a twig. <br /> <br /> These days, even though he is still capable of causing considerable damage, he is no longer looking at the room. He's gone to seed and just does not know when to leave. He walks as if he were thrown into his pants but still managed to appear constipated, and he has grown. His long ponytail has disappeared, but his hair still looks stupid. That beats me. <br /> <br /> Today, you die is Seagal's usual mix of hard fighting, car accidents, gun battles and fireworks. Seagal mumbles through the dull script, delivering his lines without enthusiasm or credibility. In this third-rate action movie, he plays Harlan Banks, a thief trying to get right to the point, who is accused of participating in a $ 20,000,000 robbery. He gets caught, goes to prison, escapes and seeks revenge. Yawning. <br /> <br /> There are very good car chases and gunfights that mix up boring stuff (of which there are a lot), but reading other reviews on IMDb revealed that they had been borrowed from other films. Seagal has also doubled his body in this one. <br /> <br /> Seagal is one of the most terrible shows of his career, which says a lot, considering that it plays badly recent efforts. The most hilarious is his totally embarrassing attempt against Ebonics (slang of the African-American street). 'I am a man, for' sho '? No, actually Steven, you talk like a donkey! With a ridiculous scenario and intrigues that go nowhere, this film is a waste of time, money and effort. And the last moment, when Harlan Banks saves a child's house, is enough to blow you some pieces. <br /> <br /> Heck, I just watch the clock. I had so much fun throwing this pile of steam that I deviated from my five minutes. It's time to post this comment and look at something decent.
