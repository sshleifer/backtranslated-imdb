It's like someone taking a fantastic video game and putting it in a mixer, and the end result of the scene is what we have to do. <br /> <br /> Now, let me record saying how much I love. Chinese fantasy movies. From fun and silly, to those who focus on the martial arts, to the most dramatic and romantic types, this is a genre that I appreciate very much. Films like "A Chinese Odyssey: The Pandora's Box" and "A Chinese Odyssey: Cinderella" (both written and / or directed by Jeffrey Lau); "The white-haired bride"; "Butterfly and sword"; "Green snake"; "A story of Chinese ghosts"; "Swordman II"; "Zu: Warriors of the Magic Mountain"; "Hidden Dragon Squatting Tiger"; and others. That's why I was looking forward to "A great Chinese story". One of the characters in the film is the "Monkey King" (aka Sun Wukong), an extremely well-known figure in Chinese mythology, who was told for the first time in the stories of "Journey to the West", the adventure epic written about 500 years ago. (The story of the monkey king and his followers is also at the center of the "Chinese Odyssey" movies, among many others). The other familiar characters that appear in the film are Zhu Wuneng (the pig character) and Sha Wujing. <br /> <br /> So, how is all this going? Well, let's take a familiar example to the Western audience. What about the Robin Hood mythology? A well-known story of your time. Let's say our Robin Hood movie starred Wesley Snipes in Robin Hood and Haley Joel Osment in Friar Tuck. Maid Marian is none other than Rosie Perez. Let's also give an Uzi to Sir Robin, because you never know when to squander the Sheriff of Nottingham. They might also need rockets, and while we're there, give them a tactical nuclear weapon, because it might be useful to them. If you think that sounds like a very neat recovery of Robin Hood's story, the movie "A Chinese Tall Story" is for you! As I said above, this movie is a messy mess. During the first 30 minutes, we met not only Sun Wukong, Zhu Wuneng and Sha Wujing, but also the monk Tripitaka (who is actually the main protagonist), kidnapped children, a "millennium bug demon" (who laser beams), an underground tree god, a tribe of lizard elves, an angelic girl in an intergalactic egg, the Lord Chancellor Turtle, a king of the sea dragons, a magical golden staff in perpetual transformation, a girl of chat rooms , wormholes in space Four Celestial Knights. All that would not be so bad - the tales and myths transmitted over the years certainly contain all kinds of fantastic elements. But I guarantee you that Chinese mythology does not include much of the material to which we were subjected in the last half of the film. (Useful tips for filmmakers: the fact that your computer effects CAN offer spaceships and intergalactic warfare representations in search of thrills does not mean that they SHOULD BE FANT.). <br /> <br /> You know that your movie about Chinese mythology is showing bad track when the director asks (and I do not invent it? it's a direct quote from the commentary) "I asked the composer whether or not we could have more rock-and-roll type music when it turned into something like Android. "Is there a hidden story somewhere here? Yes. Yes there is. Most of the adventure follows Tripitaka (played by Nicholas Tse, "Gen-X Cops", "Time and Tide", "My classmate the barbarian") and Meiyan, the daughter of the lizard (played by Charlene Choi and a computer). Choi is the best thing to do in this movie. You may know her as half of the canto-pop band "Twins" and other movies such as "The Twins Effect" and "Just One Look" (a surprisingly good drama / romance / comedy) . Poor Choi, being a lizard and all the rest, is hardly recognizable by her warts, her stuck teeth, her pasty nose and her leaning back. Until computers use and beautify it, which makes the situation even worse. Ts√© is passable, but all the support actors have been catastrophic. Some recognizable faces are lost in the bit parts. <br /> <br /> At one point, I was discussing with myself if "A Chinese Tall Story" was a travesty. I almost managed to convince myself that it was when the intergalactic egg girl (played by a very nice Fan Bing-Bing) came out and illuminated a Marlboro (!) While talking with Tripitaka who practiced martial arts dressed in 'A Spider- Man's Costume (!!). But this is not a parody. Of course, there is the typical foolishness of Hong Kong, but the film is taken seriously enough, with enough scenes of romance and pathos (marked with a sledghammering of violins and evocative cellos) and action and catchy adventures. <br /> <br /> You might think that you could look at this on a Netflix rental and it would not cost you anything. (Oh, but it will cost you very well) <br /> <br /> Is there anything good to say? Sure. The colors are vibrant (they are the best thing about this movie). And the filmmakers were certainly trying very hard. Too bad that all these efforts have resulted in a film that is little more than a bad video game.
