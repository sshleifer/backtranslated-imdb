This movie was a big disappointment. The plot looked great, about a half-human, half-leopard creature in Africa that became the subject of a documentary directed by young American adults. When many of the crew members are found dead, the 2 survivors are interviewed. I would not even call it a horror movie, because most of the movie actually talks about the (bad) adventures of the aforementioned narcissist, about twenty, who include sex and smoking smoking animals it seems - believe me). You rarely have the opportunity to see the creature, and the main actor (who happens to be also the director, scriptwriter, editor and producer!) Is incredibly annoying. <br /> <br /> I was finally so bored by the never-ending dialogue that I moved quickly to the end. I had guessed the end in less than 10 minutes in the movie ... and I was right. So, this horrible film is quite predictable, as if it were not serious enough. Moral of the story: to avoid the films interpreted, realized, mounted, produced and written by the same person. And avoid this movie unless it is played.
