This movie had a pretty interesting plot about clones and organ use, but it fails because the main actor is so boring and whiny that you want to see him die. Not that anyone is very good at it either, but when you hate the character who is supposed to arouse your sympathy, the movie just does not work. Quite funny, it looks like a movie is coming out in the near future with a plot that reflects it with more action and better distribution, although I can not think of anything else, had to look . This film has a super stupid clone who is smart enough to understand that something is wrong in his camp where people drive at a kilometer an hour and fight for no reason. The counselors tell them that when they are ready, they will go to America, but our "hero" has doubts. He looks for the man to whom he has been cloned. There is Peter Graves and Dick Seargent, but they do not add anything to this film that looks like something that was made for television. On the positive side, when "The Island" comes out, the directors of this film can proudly say "we thought about it first".
