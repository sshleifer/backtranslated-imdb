As a young girl, the beautiful Joan Woodbury (as Rita Adams) became an orphan, after her father, the "pigeon stool", was shot and killed. As a young woman, Ms. Woodbury is struggling to keep a job, as the status of ex-convict of her murdered father makes Woodbury a significant economic risk. The Woodbury Rooms with singer Linda Ware (Donna Andrews), who advises Woodbury to make contact with old friends from John Archer Orphanage (Bob Elliott) and Jack La Rue (Mickey Roman). But none of her friends can help when Woodbury is the victim of a scam that takes her to jail. Upon release, Woodbury decides to give male gangsters a chance ?? <br /> <br /> Re-titled "Gangs, Inc.", this is an obviously weak and cheap gangster melodrama. It's still fun to see Woodbury doing wonders with inferior material. She plays convincingly the innocent "Rita" more and more sophisticated; and, she throws a bit like a blonde prostitute. Woodbury must be added to the list of actresses of the past, unfortunately underused in Hollywood. "Paper Bullets" also stars Alan Ladd (Jimmy Kelly aka Bill Dugan). Mrs. Ware, who sang the song "An apple for the teacher" with Bing Crosby, sings some good numbers from the 40s very well. But, mainly, it's the Woodbury show. <br /> <br /> **** Paper Bullets (1941) Phil Rosen ~ Joan Woodbury, Linda Ware, Alan Ladd
