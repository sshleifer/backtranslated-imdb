From 1936 to 1939, Peter Lorre shot a series of very successful films from Mr. Moto. Although technically B movies, they are much better made than the typical movies of the genre. However, Lorre was tired of making these very repetitive movies and told his friends that he wanted to get out of the show. When it was canceled in 1939, Lorre was delighted, but his more complicated and satisfying role plans did not materialize when he moved to Columbia Pictures. ISLAND OF DOOMED MEN is one of those films and it is obvious that the studio does not make much effort, because I think the plot was written by penguins. Talented penguins, maybe ... but the movie did not make sense. <br /> <br /> It starts with a guy who agrees to be an undercover agent of the government. He must infiltrate an island in the United States where something strange is wrong. Now, they could have easily obtained a search warrant to do so. But, since the penguins were writing the movie, the agent takes the rap for a murder he did not commit and spends a year in jail for that. He apparently hopes he will be released on this island, as many parolees are sent there at the end of the term. <br /> <br /> This idea presents more serious problems. First, they only serve him for one year before being released on parole - but he was found guilty of murder and refused to disclose who he really was. They would never release anyone in a case like this. Second, if he was not on parole on the island? He would have spent a whole year in jail for nothing! Third, why not just bring divers, paratroopers or police on board ?! You speak of an artificial plot! <br /> <br /> Once on the island, the officer discovers that the evil Peter Lorre has set up his own private jail and endowed him with types of offenders on forced labor parole. What about men who have to report to their parole officers? This was never explained, but Lorre used them to extract diamonds and they were treated abominably. Now another question I asked was that if Lorre discovered huge diamonds, he was a very rich man. So why not just pay people to mine for diamonds ?! Why create your own version of Devil's Island and defeat and brutally kill men ?! <br /> <br /> Finally, Lorre gets what he has and the slaves on the island are released. Unfortunately, at that time, I really did not care. Overall, observable but rather stupid. Lorre's career only improved when he turned to Warner Brothers the following year. With films like ISLAND OF DOOMED MEN, I could understand why his stay in Columbia was short.
