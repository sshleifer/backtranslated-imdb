The film started o.k. A couple of tourists on vacation in Mexico having fun decide to go hiking. They discover hidden paths and eventually reach this huge temple like a fortress. Angry villagers present themselves and try to dissuade them from climbing, but because of the language barrier, people are shot at and tourists eventually climb. It turns out that the plants are bloodthirsty things that the villagers do not want to approach, so they keep the temple to prevent the tourists from coming down. There are some scares in this movie, but nothing really makes sense. I mean they are plants! Do not bother buying or renting the d.v. Wait for it to come out on the cable.
