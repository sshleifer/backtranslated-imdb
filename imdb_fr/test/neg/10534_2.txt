Steven Segal's film career is a tribute to horrible cinema. I was sadly bored of each of them as soon as I realized that they were even more unrealistic than those of Jean Claude VanDamme. Has anyone ever noticed that he's never touched ?! I mean, give me something to build for ... a fierce battle with a scary villain. TWENTY YEARS and he still films the same fight scenes. Battle scenes can often distract you from the fact that your hero can not act. The boring choreography of a Segal film puts his painful lack of talent as a comedian in relief. Worse still, he is sadly in bad shape. Just what we need, a big stiff guy who thinks he's an important man. There is not a minute of cinematic value in all these films, about ninety minutes. DO NOT look at this unless you want to spend an hour and a half of your life.
