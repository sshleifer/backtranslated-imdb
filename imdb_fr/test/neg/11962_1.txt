I knew I was sitting for 90 LONG minutes when the opening voice mispronounced the word "scarecrow" (it looked like Scare Crew). And of course, 90 minutes later, having seen beyond the drama, the tedious drama, the scarecrow's fists getting closer to the intended target, but the "striking" still, Ken Shamrock "playing ", and the most stupid end illogical my life (ok, no, I resume the latter, in about a week). After going through all this, I openly mourned that I could not go to Lacuna at the Jim Carrey and erase it completely from my mind. Any thoughts that I might have thought that director Brian Katkin could have made a correct movie given the circumstances that I had after watching "Slaughter Studios" are completely absent from my mind now. <br /> <br /> My note: F <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Tara Platt and Lisa Robert become topless <br /> <br /> Where I saw them: Starz on Demand (available until to 22 September 2005)
