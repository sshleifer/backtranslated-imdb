oh well ... it's funny. should have been a sadistic comedy, a lot of horror movies lack common sense, but I think a retarded caveman would fend for himself in this situation. Do not really expect Hitchcock or anything else. It's a good movie for friends, but I would not recommend it. This film lacks the substance of a real horror movie, suspense, shock and good characters. the killer did not manage to be the unstoppable force that I expected from him, and he seemed to be the average "D" angry student able to outwit only silly people. and what's really fun is the horrible game and the lack of emotion of so-called "victims" <br /> <br /> 3/10 expects this one happen on a daily basis.
