Franco Zeffirelli ("The Control of the Snout", "Romeo and Juliet", "Jesus of Nazareth", "Othello") The third stab at transferring Shakespeare to the screen works very well, with the casting of Mel Gibson (" Mad Max "" "Lethal Weapon" and his notoriety prior to "The Passion of Christ") in the role previously occupied by Sir Laurence Olivier (and rightly so, see my account on his "Hamlet", probably the best interpretation of one of the timeless of the Bard (and the most cited) tragedies) and remade 5 years later by Kenneth Branagh as a treatment in its own right, explaining its duration of 3 hours 22 minutes, associated with a casting of dream (and many well-chosen additions and William Shakespeare's contemporary master, Kenneth Branagh, director of "Henry V" and "Dead Again", expertly produced Glenn Close ("The Great Chill"), Paul Scofield ("A Man For All Seasons ") Alan Bates, Ian Holm and Michael Malone y (who would play Roderigo alongside Kenneth Branag h and Laurence Fishburne in Oliver Parker's "Othello" (see my article on Olivier's "scene" version of the tragedy, even though plays only the main role) and with Branagh in the role of Laertes in his version of "Hamlet" of 3 hours true tribute to Sir Laurence Olivier and his classic version of the play; 5 years later, Nathaniel Parker (who will be interpreted as Cassio in "Othello" 4 years later) and Helena Bonham-Carter, in "Frankenstein" by Mary Shelley "4 years later. <br /> <br Zeffirelli wanted to make this film a tribute to Sir Laurence Olivier (who died two years ago) and it works pretty well overall, which made me a little uncomfortable because Zeffirelli lost his way many lines and he gives in a scene one of the lines of Hamlet to Ghost.Helena Bonham-Carter did not convince me as Ophelia.It was too sad and unreal while Jean Simmons (who had immortalized the role in Olivier's version) and Kate Winslet (who had done an acceptable job in the epic and revisionist reworking of Kenneth Branagh's "Hamlet"), with Jean Simmons being the best Ophelia of all time, that's why she was nominated for best actress in 1948 (she did not win "What a shame." Ian Holm said his lines too quickly, not as slowly as I thought, in a scene with him, Laertes and Ophelia. But again, I'm more used to the interpretations of the role of Felix Aylmer and Richard Briers and I think they did a better job than Holm in their respective versions of "Hamlet" (directed by great directors, actors, editors of text), producers AND stars of all their versions of the work of Bard) as Polonius. <br /> <br /> However, the rest of the cast was excellent. The scene where Hamlet faces his mother was very well done, but Olivier and Branagh redoubled their efforts to create even more emotional intensity and suspense. <br /> <br /> I recommend this version only to pass the time, but it is an ideal teaching tool for Grade 12 English teachers (I recommend first showing Olivier's version, then that of Branagh and finally this version). Despite the rating "PG" of the film, there was really nothing unpleasant in the film. Only what the room was asking for. <br /> <br /> The best versions of "Hamlet" are: <br /> <br /> # 1 Sir Laurence Olivier and Kenneth Branagh. Both were so good that I can not decide which one was the best. See my comments on these versions for more information. <br /> <br /> # 2 Franco Zeffirelli. This one was fine. It started well with a scene that is not part of the play, but should have progressed to the beginning of the play, where a guard shouted, "Who's there?" "No, answer me, get up and unfold yourself!" This scene scares you because you sit quietly and then ... you almost jump out of the skin. In short, this scene sets the tone for the rest of the room. A huge mistake on the part of Zeffirelli to omit this scene. It also misplaced many lines (and cut others that I think should have been inserted), such as the line where Hamlet tells Ophelia: "Go to a convent, why would you want to be a breeder? sinners? " this line was supposed to have happened in THIS scene, NOT where it was placed in the movie (after the soliloquy "To be or not to be." This version struggles between cutting too much or too little in an excellent piece of literature Kenneth Branagh would fix it 5 years later with his full version of the tragedy, making his version a more fitting tribute to Sir Laurence Olivier, since many of the actors (besides him) had performed "Hamlet" on stage / or in Many movies, however, Zeffirelli's version of "Hamlet" is true to the game and that's what I was looking for, the configuration for the final duel was the same as in the versions of Olivier and Branagh, but the outcome in the version of Branagh was more violent than the outcome of the two previous versions (more in keeping with the piece, Olivier attenuated it ... and it worked as well) and glued more closely to the piece, with Branag h bringing some harmless touches of his own ... to very good effect. <br /> <br /> This version is not evaluated.
