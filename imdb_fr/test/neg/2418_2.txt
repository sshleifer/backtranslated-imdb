Where to start? This movie is a lot of fun if you're new to rugby, but if you live outside of the United States and follow the game, it's laughable. Various rugby traditions such as the "Haka" which is preformed by the "All Blacks" of New Zealand and only by the All Blacks. The Haka leader is usually the member of the team with the best Maori pedigree. This is one of the most important conventions of the modern game. It has been misused and represented by the writer. The film itself is quite well done, but it is the mediocre scenario and the general execution which abandon it heavily. Taking into account that she is based on a real story, she has many snapshots in the plot. I would strongly suggest to any rugby-interested American to watch this film, and then look at what rugby really is on Youtube, because the rugby depicted in this film has been distorted and biased to what it really is.
