Man stop making sequels to great movies. The original film was a fantastic movie, with fights, sex, and one of the coolest characters on the screen of the 90s. The story is believable, as if you knew bars in the southern suburbs. But here is this piece of junk food Roadhouse 2 Last Call. Let's just hope they're serious about the title and they'll never do another Roadhouse again. It does not have the charm of the characters of the original and the story is not really believable. The Story is more of a Steven Segal type action than even though Roadhouse 2 is a B-movie, it still does not click because some B-movie stock still sells the movie, regardless of its quality. The only reason to rent for not buying this movie is that we finally discover that there is only one question to ask the original Roadhouse. Is the character of Patrick Swayze, Dalton, Dalton his first or last name? Well, I will save you the $ 4.00 rental fee. Dalton is his name as in Dalton Tanner. NEVER MAKE ANOTHER ROADHOUSE !!!!!!!!!!!
