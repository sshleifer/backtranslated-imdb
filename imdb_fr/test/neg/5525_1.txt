It is so poor that it is observable. <br /> <br /> The plot is about a grizzly spacecraft crew going on a derelict Russian vessel, apparently abandoned. <br /> <br /> In the vast expanse of space, the two machines accidentally collide (!) - and the 'Alien'esque' fun follows as a cyborg of the Russian ship threatens our crew. <br /> <br /> The interior of the spacecraft is clearly a set of clean plants (metal walkways, boilers), piping). In this totally unconvincing setting, 'Kody', 'Snake' and the rest of our team of heroes grimace, grunt, run and constantly set their shotguns without firing them. <br /> <br /> Gaffes of continuity are what define this movie, and they are simply incredible: <br /> <br /> Stuff appears and disappears. The shotguns are torn. A cigar is lengthened when it is smoked. The shotguns are destroyed again, just to make sure. The content of a bottle increases as you get drunk. <br /> <br /> The film progresses through the usual shots through a game of intense ham, a work of poxy camera and Ed Wood quality accessories to a climax.
