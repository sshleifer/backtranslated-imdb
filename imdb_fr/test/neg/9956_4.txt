First of all, I must say that I am not usually a big fan of werewolf movies in general. It's not that I do not like them, but that I do not like them very much. There are some that I appreciated ... Werewolf of London (1935, Stuart Walker), An American werewolf in London (1981, John Landis) ... and others that I thought well but nothing special ... The Wolf Man (1941, George Waggner), The Howling (1981, Joe Dante), Dog Soldiers (2002, Neil Marshall) are some examples ... but overall, the subgenre of the wolf Were not my favorite. But since this one was on one of those 50 movie sets, I decided to watch it and see how it went. <br /> <br /> Nonsense to follow ... <br /> <br /> Mad Monster is a werewolf tale, but the werewolf is mainly used as a vehicle of revenge by a mad scientist, Dr. Lorenzo Cameron (George Zucco). Dr. Cameron has discovered a way to turn humans into animals, especially wolves, but has been ridiculed and ostracized by the large scientific community. Forced to leave a prestigious position, he becomes mad and takes revenge on those who made fun of him in an old manor house, where he lives with his daughter Lenora (the charming Anne Nagel) and his assistant Petro (Glenn Strange) with mental abilities limited. With the help of his serum, Dr. Cameron turns Petro into a werewolf and sends him to kill his former rivals. Eventually, the werewolf Petro gets out of control and the crazy doctor and his creation are killed. <br /> <br /> The film also plays a bit like a murder / crime drama, with the pretender of Lenora's journalist (Johnny Downs) investigating the strange behavior of the doctor and the multiplication of murders. The story seems to borrow many elements from other great images that preceded it. There are reminders of Frankenstein (1931, James Whale) in the creation of a monster that is unleashed and the creature that kills an innocent child. I also think of the visions of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1931, Rouben Mamoulian or 1941, Victor Fleming version) and The Wolf Man (1941, George Waggner). And that's one of the problems of this film, in my opinion: it's a mediocre fusion of great movies. It does not add much to the genre. <br /> <br /> Certainly, there are certain qualities that redeem. The performance of George Zucco was convincing, and the scene showing Dr. Lorenzo talking about his visions / hallucinations of his executioners allows me to show his madness. There is a certain reasonableness constructed, at least in the case of his character. But the character of Glenn Strange is not at all convincing and seems to have this comic quality - intentional or not, I'm not sure - that it just does not fit in the film. <br /> <br /> It seemed to me that I liked it more than most IMDb users based on my 4/10 rating, but it was still an underperforming movie. It may be worth watching if you're a fan of early werewolf movies or a big fan of horror movies of the 1930s and 1940s, but it's unlikely you'll be able to call on you if you are not.
