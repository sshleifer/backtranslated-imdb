Killjoy 2 surpasses the first film. What has been improved here is the acting game, Killjoy's makeup and story. It is rather a gore festival, it does not have the supernatural elements as the first. In this installment, Killjoy kills his victims in a more normal way, he fires them and does not shoot them with bullets that were in his mouth. The only thing I did not like about this movie was that the end was a little half-done, in fact it was half-done, they killed Killjoy in a very cheap way. I highly recommend it to anyone who loves horror movies. Seriously, the first movie was good, but the second one is better. ten.
