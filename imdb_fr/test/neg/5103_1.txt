The film itself is just a compilation of scenes that have no meaning for anyone living outside of Russia. I will not deny that some images and techniques were quite revolutionary at the time (filmed in 1928), but the problem with the film is that it has no interest for the intellectual or ordinary man. We are simply looking at an arranged form of images, ranging from a man with an arm that beats a horse, to a toothless soldier at war. Everything in between is clumsy, random, and totally useless. It would have been possible to invent a forum that would interest the viewer, but it would not be the case although the method of the director is quite brilliant. <br /> <br /> In total, we should see this if it is a student art, hallucinogenic drugs, or a pre-Tarkovskian film student.
