It was ok, but really a bit disappointing as I was expecting more laughs. Given the scenario and the main actor (Bill Murray), it should have been a lot funnier than it turned out. It's only part of that that really made me laugh, like when Murray lost control of his semitrailer and was running at full speed on the road from a strange angle. (You have to see it, to appreciate it.) <br /> <br /> The support cast was anything but friendly. Just look at some examples of names: Matthew McConaughey, Janeane Garofalo and Linda Fiorentino. Yecch! McConaughey's role here as a "Tip Tucker" was simply annoying. He was the worst. <br /> <br /> Other than these people, the film had some lovely moments, but overall, it is not recommended. It's another Disney flop.
