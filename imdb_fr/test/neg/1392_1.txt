What makes minority actors think it is acceptable to slander their minority and expect to get out of it? <br /> <br /> Carlos Mencia is not George Lopez. There is a difference. When I look at comedian Carlos Mencia, I think he hates his own people. And more than that, I think he was forced to make his show "Hispanic / Latin / Spanish" version of the show by Dave Chappelle. What a horrible mistake. (Note to Mencia: Please do not make a "Block Party" movie.) As much as I would like to see Santana, Tierra, El Chicano, Christina Agullaria, Jennifer Lopez, Shakira and the casting meeting of "Xica da Silva "On a stage, do not do it.) <br /> <br /> Carlos Mencia likes to use the word" beans "as much as Dave Chappelle liked to use the word" n ". Neither is funny and none is acceptable, even if it comes from "their own people". Carols Mencia also likes to say: "If you are offended, too bad". It is not the offense, it is the defense because of what is said and asked to be accepted. <br /> <br /> Carols Mencia goes further - it disrespects everyone for what it assumes to be comedy. It's not a comedy, it's not funny. There is a finesse in being able to watch and make others laugh about comedy and not laugh at the stereotypes that other races have believed in the beginning. <br /> <br /> The spirit of Mencia needs to be tweaked because Carlos Mencia needs polishing. Find what's funny and not what will create more prejudice in motion and then do it. Until then, the show Mind of Mencia is a pass.
