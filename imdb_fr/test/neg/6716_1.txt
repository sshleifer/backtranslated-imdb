Mr. Seagal has apparently lowered his (already low) standards even further and has now outdone himself in making bad films. The stranger has no substance in the script. His director did an even worse job and the music and score are so fuzzy and misplaced that you do not know whether to laugh or cry. Already 10 minutes after the beginning of the movie, you just want to disable it. However, considering Steven Seagal's past films, you say to yourself, "Hey, there may be some cool action sequences that are worth watching at least ..." ... you're wrong ! This only gets worse as the movie moves on. Everyone (with a few exceptions) seems to kill every person she speaks, whether good or bad, innocent or not. The only good thing about the movie is that it has an end and it has a rather short life span. Summarize the film in two words: STAY AWAY!
