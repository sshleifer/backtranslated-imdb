I would be one of the few people to own a copy of this classic. But I do not only own 1, I actually own 2. It's THAT good. <br /> <br /> Well, when I say good, I mean bad. But I will try to do a thorough examination. I even looked at 'born a ninja', one of the other commentators mentioned here, to compare it to that. And to be born a ninja is worse, but not so funny. <br /> <br /> And is it always funny? ALL about this movie is poor. ALL. The plot is absolutely drunk (note "you'll need to keep me alive if you want to know where to find your wife"). EACH action sequence is stuffed too. Our Danton hero is more than a hero; he can stab people with twigs, take 3 bullets in the heart to 50 cm without even bleeding and attach a rope to a tree that, when an enemy walks on it, knots a knot around the enemy's leg, the lift, and throw it 50 meters into a pile of pics. <br /> <br /> The acting is so bad that it's impossible to comment on it, but you should roll it, especially the jump of the dantons off the ground and the grunt the bad guy. Oh yes, and the wicked: somehow, it seems that they are resurrected 5 times each in the film. Maybe it's just that there were not enough actors, but in a movie of this caliber? I doubt. <br /> <br /> The plot tells that Danton was a soldier of the Vietnam War, and that his colonel is looking for real people for training purposes for his mercenaries. It turns out that the colonel picks up danton, then Danton defends himself. It's just the excuse for a rambo clone, the majority of the film being a massacre of Danton's soldiers. And I really can not explain the plot anymore, because there's nothing else in the movie. It rocks anyway. <br /> <br /> What more can you ask for? Do not get me started. Hand grenades sounding at the actors' feet because the explosion is the size of a match. Scenes where 5 people chase Danton, then the camera is cut off and back and there are 7. grenade launcher it's on the same background even though it's in completely different places. And the worst is when Danton pushes the plastic blocks on the enemies and an enemy is not hit by the blocks. He does not know what to do. He then dies half, without even being touched. It's ridiculous !!! <br /> <br /> But funny. Very very funny. It's one of the few movies I can recommend to everyone, because if you do not find it funny, you're 1 in a million. And for the rest of us, it's magic.
