To say that I was disappointed is a euphemism. An amateur film made by professionals. I was about to leave the theater two or three times (something I had never done before). I was really arrested by Cloris Leachman. It sounds right, the only one I should say. These new women are less modern than the George Cukor women of the 30s. These "act" for us trying to be with her but their "conflict" is exactly the same as always, in the movies anyway. The pleasure of the original was based on a clear scenario, vitriolic and very amusing. A masterful direction and an irreplaceable cast. All the elements that are missing here. Television actresses mixing with models and nominees / winners at the Oscars. There was nothing organic about it. It all looked like a shot, improvised in the moment without a clear objective. 2/10
