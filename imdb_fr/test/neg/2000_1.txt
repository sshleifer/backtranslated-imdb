This is my first comment on a movie here. I must say that of all the bad movies I've ever seen, including Braindead, for example, it's really worse! I promise. Do not even look at him. It's boring, bad acting, bad story and plot, bad effects, the whole movie is a big shit! If I could, I would give 0 stars out of 10, but since the lowest is 1, which is awful, I have to vote for it. But I would say that the film is worse than horrible. <br /> <br /> Do not get hurt by seeing this movie and hoping it will be better because I can tell you now, it will not happen! I was hoping there could be one scene worth watching. There was no good scene at all. <br /> <br /> What a great piece of shit. <br /> <br /> And Coolio in vampire? LOL! LMAO! YARGH!
