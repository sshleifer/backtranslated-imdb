Help, I ended up in the hell of cinema! What a stupid movie it is. Really nothing is good about it. <br /> <br /> Let's spit it out: <br /> <br /> 1) The story is incredibly far-fetched: an anti-EU terrorist group is suing a group of people who are driving delivery of filled transparent bags of xtc pills. And the worst is: they are serious about it! <br /> <br /> 2) The level of play must shame all faces. <br /> <br /> 3) A silver-eyed guy decided to let everyone speak English so that the international market gained ground. The ugliest advertising of all time! The native French and Dutch languages ​​speak well, which makes perfect sense and the result is laughable. <br /> <br /> 4) The soundtrack is totally misplaced and badly chosen. <br /> <br /> 5) The camera, montages and effects are supposed to be in the style of a post-dark road movie, but hardly worth anything and not intended to accompany this story ( read: anti-story). <br /> <br /> 6) Hidde Maas. Wildschut's hero never fails to convince. A real actor. Usually, I would give an extra point just for the sake of seeing it. But no, sorry, not this time, I would not just forgive myself ...
