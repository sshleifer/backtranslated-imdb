There is a lot of so-called anti-war / anti-government. Political films around us that start like a mea culpa and end with "our poor boys are becoming hell, so let the world sympathize, it's not their fault," that sort of thing. I was half afraid that it would be another style in this style even if it dealt with another subject / aspect of the same subject. I almost did not go to see him; besides, I almost did not write this criticism. What have we had here? An Egyptian is taken to a secret off-shore torture center, on American orders, but it is another Egyptian who must torture, not an American: "You see, we Americans have clean hands" and Egyptians are bad a lot anyway so let them harm theirs. Oh, and the good had to be an American with a conscience: many Americans have some, but here the concept was misplaced. Yes, we all know it's called Extraordinary Rendition and it started in the Clinton era and is now being used for reasons that are out of control. Otherwise, it was very disturbing and nervous to actually condemn the United States to be a party to torture; as if the officials were afraid of going to the end, for fear of being considered unpatriotic or otherwise (look at the bulletin board! Everyone apologizes for receiving a face of heavy verbal artillery). Torture is a terrible thing, whether one is guilty or not; In the 18th century, Frederick II, King of Prussia, abolished it for convicted murderers - although I must say that a life sentence for a pedophile is far less than what I want to see. Okay, what about torture? This film has not sufficiently revealed its horror and despair. When you are under torture, (capitals come here to highlight you, I do not scream), you will say anything, even if it's not true, even if you did not do what you are accused, hoping to hope that YOU SAY WHAT THEY ARE PEDDLING, IT WILL STOP. IT IS NOT, BUT YOU NEVER ACCEPT AND KEEP WHAT YOU HAVE SAID WHAT THEY SAID YOU SAID YOU HAVE. Another thing that the film did not highlight enough is that the torture is excessively heavy and indescribable, and that the feeling of staying with you all your life. It somehow changes the people inside. How do I know all this? Do not ask. <br /> <br /> Re-edit: two things: the Arabic used in the film was not the Egyptian dialect. It's a bit worse than shooting a movie in New Zealand with local characters and everyone has American accents. Moreover, the terrible little preacher who incited his ignorant audience to violence told them things unknown to this religion, which should have been revealed. It has not been explained anywhere that any nincompoop can become a mullah / imam; it does not need special qualifications, it is a pause that needs to be corrected: many are acceptable because of their fundamentalist views and the great ally of the United States, Saudi Arabia, finances so many. Thank you very much for this space.
