Based on how little I've seen of this show, I do not think I can see it again. It's not even incredibly credible and frankly Derek's character makes me angry. <br /> <br /> Sorry to see such a spoiled kid follow his path again and again? Why would I want to look at this?!? No thanks, there are many other series that involve sneaky characters (Phil of the Future's Pim, for example) where the wicked does not win or if they do not win in the same way. <br /> <br /> No to mention that I think it's a terrible picture to paint on life with half-siblings. Yes, life is not rosy, but we could try to represent a character who is not downright bad and who wins. <br /> <br /> I suggest you look at this only if you like to see the villain win.
