A boring drama and quite predictable. Mary Tyler Moore is married to Ted Danson who has an affair with Christine Lahti. Moore is friends with Lahti and knows nothing about cheating. Danson dies in an accident and Lahti is pregnant with her baby. YAWNING! <br /> <br /> I am ashamed to admit that I paid money to see him in a theater in 1986. I liked the three stars, but even their considerable talents have not managed to do it. I always knew what was going to happen. As another poster says - it looks like a PG rated life movie. <br /> <br /> Lahti was constantly swearing at one point and even Moore was letting go once! In addition, there are unnecessary shots of topless women playing football (!!!). Other than it's friendly TV. The only good thing about it was Timothy Gibbs playing Moore and Danson's teenage son. Very beautiful and a very good actor. Other than that, nothing to recommend. You've seen it before ... and done better. It's obviously forgotten. Jump.
