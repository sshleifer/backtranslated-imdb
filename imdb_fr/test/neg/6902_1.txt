I can not find any usable value in this movie. He seems to rely freely on the school of thought of King Lion. A father is killed, his son can not fill shoes and tries to flee, etc. type music. They go above and beyond trying to be cool. The problem is that it's really not cool. It's like "this guy". Everyone knows at least one of those "guys" who are older and still hanging out with the younger crowd in a futile attempt to hang on to their youth. They try to be cool to fit in but they are not really cool. It's this movie. <br /> <br /> But, if you have money to spend and you want to pay someone to suck 90 minutes of your life, do not let me stop you.
