Located in the mid-1800s, when the British cleared the wilderness of New Zealand to establish settlements. The daughter of a British army surgeon, Sarah (Samantha Morton), falls in love with the son of one of the Maori leaders. Maori are an indigenous tribe and a dangerous people for Europeans. By the time Sarah's child, whom she calls "boy," was born, her father died. At the age of six, "Boy" is kidnapped by his father's family and Sarah will start looking for him with a man (Kiefer Sutherland), who is deeply in love with her. <br /> <br /> Twice. Oscar-nominated Morton is certainly the star of this film. Sutherland is a total waste. Also featured: Cliff Curtis, Stephen Rea, Temuera Morrison and David Rawiri Pene. This film is rated R for some sexual content and violent battle scenes. I find the title RIVER QUEEN very misleading and the cover of the DVD with Sutherland only and make you believe that he is the big star should be a crime.
