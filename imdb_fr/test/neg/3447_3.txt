Coen Brothers, an aspiring screenwriter-director Paul Chart, relies far too much on ideas from other (better) films, but nevertheless manages to create a goose-bumpy atmosphere. Robert Forster frees himself like never before by playing the role of a psychopathic psychiatrist (ha ha) who makes a killing in the desert. The film is unusual, but in its attempt to stay ahead of the public, it becomes alienating and repulsive (with a role for Amanda Plummer downright humiliating). A final certainly bravura, many bizarre business - and Forster that looks great in the nude - make it an object of curiosity, nothing more. Veteran director Irvin Kershner has produced and perhaps should also be realized (could Paul Chart be a pseudonym?). * 1/2 of ****
