MELTDOWN is pretty interesting SCI-FI. No large budget, very few special effects; but a decent acting game and a scenario of global misfortune are enough to support the viewing. An asteroid grazes the atmosphere and propels the Earth into an orbit closer to the sun. Global warming is quickly becoming unbearable. A determined LAPD policeman (Casper Van Dien) is doing everything possible to save the world from some annihilation, because the times that are rising are devastating. The pressure is strong to save humanity from this solar disaster; as well as protecting his daughter, ex-wife nurse and television journalist friend. The cast includes: Stefanie Von Pfetten, Venus Terzo, Amanda Crew and Vincent Gale.
