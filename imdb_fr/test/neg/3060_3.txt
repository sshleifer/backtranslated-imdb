It's too nice to call it a "fictitious" account of the Barker gang. The names are correct, but that's about it. <br /> <br /> Russell is still hot, I grant you, but that's not the real Ma Barker, who actually took care of the boys cooking while traveling around the country , not planning or participating in crimes. I think it would have been much more interesting to present the true story of a middle-aged woman involved in the criminal activities of her children and friends. <br /> <br /> I must also agree with the critics who found that the shooting scenes were totally incredible. The victims of the Barker / Karpis were a combination of innocent and law enforcement officers who pursued them, but they certainly did not kill half a dozen FBI agents every time they were stuck. (Moreover, as several recent books report, the FBI of that time put forward the idea that the agents come only from legal or accounting backgrounds, insofar as many agents have only very few experience in the field of police or firearms trained agents that we describe today.) <br /> <br /> But the worst sin of all is that the film is basically boring. Nobody changes, nobody grows up. We know that the end of the road is in front of us, but we do not know what shooting will be. <br /> <br /> Only for Russell fans.
