So this is the worst movie you will probably ever see. It's a little higher with "Crossbones" and "Southern Comfort", but if you're a bad movie buff like me, this movie atrocity will be the most fun you've had in years. WHY does the camera emit old-fashioned kung-fu noises when zooming? WHY is this random guy stuffing a Nascar Memorial Plate in his bag? And who is he anyway? WHY do vampires shoot lightning after death? What is it? Highlander? Dracula McCloud? We do not care! Just laugh. This film has no continuity, no plot, nothing, really. Ron Hall's range of emotions is still off. He looks happy when he should be sad, angry when he should be confused. The rest of the cast could not come out of a paper bag. Special effects (rather "special") are randomly placed and never needed. Most scenes are lit with a desk lamp, if they are. Mel Novak has the audacity to look at his line outside of the camera, and it is not even changed. They just keep filming. In fact, half of this film is not even on film at all. It's 1/2 movie, 1/2 sony hand-cam. For most of the film, it seems they left their microphone at home. This film does not only have a few holes in the plot, it's a minefield of confusion and mental suffering! But oh I love it! Thank you Ron Hall for this cinematic abomination. I went out and bought it, because it's so funny. ($ 1.99 on Amazon, and I hurry up!) <br /> <br /> "I have guns, I have guns, I have WEAPONS!"
