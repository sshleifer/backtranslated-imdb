Director Delbert Mann was much better than what the film says. He directed ALL ALL SILENT ON THE WEST FRONT, THAT TOUCH OF MINK, and THE LAST DAYS OF PATTON, among others. This mediocre film, designed for the televised broadcast of Dicken's masterpiece, is so bad that even those who are not familiar with the often filmed story will be dissatisfied. <br /> <br /> Besides the fact that the film is only available by two suppliers and BCI Eclipse LLC), the poor quality of the transfer and the torn and confused soundtrack make the task of finding this film on video not worth the effort. <br /> <br /> I have always thought that if a company is going to put a movie on video and charge the public money to buy it, then they should at least have a progeny copy of the movie and make a good job on the transfer. Unfortunately, neither supplier has adopted such a professional ethic and the result is only valid for bargains in the local discount store. <br /> <br /> The story is told mainly through flashbacks, making the film episodic and talkative. Much of the rich detail of the novel is lost in this translation. The characters of Martha, Traddles and others have been cut off and the relationship between the young David and Steerforth is not sufficiently explored. So we can only wonder why David would stay with him. <br /> <br /> The relationship between David the boy, and the young Agnes is never developed and it is difficult to understand why she and David finally get married. Since Martha is left out, the way Dan Peggoty finds her niece remains a mystery. And the absence of Traddles makes David a very lonely man. <br /> <br /> Some have attributed to this film a good work of shortening the long novel. I do not agree, it's at best an ax job on the book. Everyone who has seen George Cukor's 1935 version will agree. <br /> <br /> The performances of this version of Fields as Micawber and Rathbone as Murdstone are really worth watching. And the more recent versions of Masterpiece Theater (April 2000) and Hallmark (2000) are both remarkable achievements for television adaptations of classic novels. Directors Simon Curtis and Peter Medak, directors of these films, deserve praise. <br /> <br /> My last comment on David COPPERFIELD 1969 is Do not buy it it, there are several better quality versions of the movie available. If it's on TV, change the channel. It's a loss of one hour and twenty minutes of your life. Sorry guys, but I can not rent such a dreadful movie.
