This film is a gay love story disguised as a story of graffiti and friendship. Not one critic has described this film as a gay love movie, and that's the weight of the plot. I do not know if it was to deceive people who would otherwise be indifferent to looking at it, expecting the film to be the same as it was sold ... the acting is abominable. Oh yes, graffiti fears too. This film was a clever way to hide the agenda of the portrayal of young boys becoming gay. Just look at the rest of the films that the director participated in, all with the same subject. Boring, not what I expected.
