I saw and I have the original black and white of 1959 starring Shelley Winters and Millie Perkins and no matter how many times I look at it, I can not help but not crying. <br /> <br /> This version was (obviously) a set, like the 1959, but there were so many errors in the layout. Spiral staircase? Elements that did not exist at that time existed in the film. Doris Roberts, sad to say, can not play drama, she is a comedy actress and that will not change. James Coco was a horrible Mr. Van Daan and Mr. Dussel looked like one of my university professors, rather than the dentist he was supposed to play. In the original movie, Anne walked on the "glove" to Peter's room, which seemed to take more than a minute. In this crappy remake, it took less than 10 seconds. The first review was ok ... This remake is just a remake. How did the director think that humorous actors had a dramatic role like that? I'm sorry but James Coco can not play drama. Max .. Schell was better in Deep Impact than this movie. Mrs. Frank was grumpy, I could not stand it. Referring and comparing to the 1959 version, I like her better, she was better at being the overwhelming mother. On 10 stars, I give this remake 3. Do not waste your time, get the 1959 version and a box of Kleenex.
