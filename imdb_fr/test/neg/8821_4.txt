I had heard a lot of negative things about this movie before I saw it, but I thought that all the negative comments were probably due to the film's limited budget and poor acting - two issues that I can deal with when it's about zombie movies. However, what I did not count on is that this movie is really very boring; If there is one thing you can count on, low-budget zombies, coolness and entertainment - but unfortunately, this movie has neither. I'm pretty surprised, because the two previous horror movies I saw from director Bob Clark - Deathdream and Black Christmas - were very inventive and entertaining, but Children should not play with Dead Things does not solve everything. The plot follows a group of young adults who visit a funeral island to have fun with rituals to bring the dead back to life. However, they quickly learn that playing with things they do not understand is a really stupid idea when their rituals bring the dead back to life and the corpses of the island return to feast on their blood! <br /> <br /> The graphs seem to give the impression that this could lead to a decent movie, but what I did not mention is that the interesting parts do not start until the last twenty minutes ; and since it's a 90-minute film, I'm sure you can guess that it's not a good thing. The opening hours and ten minutes are filled with mediocre characters and even worse characters. I can understand the setting up of a situation so that the horror is more powerful once it presents itself; but please, if you want to spend so long, you really have to make it interesting. All the characters in the movie are exciting and annoying, and personally, I just wanted the zombies to hurry to eat them. The film is not without merit, however, because the atmosphere is remarkable. Lucio Fulci would show seven years later how an isolated island and flesh-eating zombies can mix well; but Bob Clark already did it with this movie. The direction is not bad either, but it is mitigated by poor makeup effects and a flagrant lack of blood, which will probably not please fans of zombie movies. Overall, I really can not recommend this movie. but if you're a fan of hardcore zombies, you might have a good shot.
