Debra Winger's "Black Widow" 1987 is MUCH better. <br /> <br /> It's like a lame version, and Jane Seymour is generally better. <br /> <br /> Chad Allen is also quite poor in this respect. I only play his usual role as a rebellious and boring child. <br /> <br /> Maybe Dr. Quinn was supposed to both be supposed to excite us. <br /> <br /> If so, go ahead Take a copy of "Black Widow".
