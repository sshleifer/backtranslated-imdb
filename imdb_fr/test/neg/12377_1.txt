I would have liked to vote this film to ten, it's as funny as that. If they had wanted it to be so funny, I would have given it a ten. I have to give it a 1, but it's the funniest you'll ever want to watch. See the giant blur flash on the screen! Where is he from? What is it? It flies, it terrifies, it's electrifying, it's on ropes! This bird has a real personality. I was about ten when I saw it for the first time, and when Big Bird appeared on Sesame Street, I was sure they were identical!
