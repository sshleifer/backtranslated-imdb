At the beginning of 'Loggerheads', we present three seemingly unrelated pairs of characters. To make things even more confusing, we are informed (via the titles on the screen) that the action takes place on three separate calendars (between the years 1999 and 2001). It takes a lot of time, but eventually we understand the relationship between the three couples: Mark Austin, a 20-year-old homosexual and HIV positive, is separated from his conservative parents, Elizabeth and Reverend Robert Austin. <br /> <br /> Mark is now a wanderer and arrives in Kure Beach, North Carolina, a seaside town, where he meets George (played sensitively by Michael Kelly), a gay motel owner, who ends up get involved. . Meanwhile, Grace (played by Bonnie Hunt), Mark's mother, decided to find the son she had decided to adopt at the age of 17. Similarly, Mark's adoptive mother has also decided to follow her separated son when he misses her (despite the fears of her husband, a homophobic minister). <br /> <br /> We are told that "we are making fun of us", we are based on a true story and maybe it is his Achilles heel. Director / Writer Tim Kirkman strives too hard to create scenes full of dramatic tension where there is not much to find. Take Mark and George, they are sensitive souls who have something to disagree with. There is a slight tension when Grace confronts an adoption agency director who is prohibited by law from giving her information about her lost son, as well as a slight conflict with her mother who denies having disapproved of her when she got pregnant . There is no spark either between Elizabeth and Robert since the good Reverend has categorically insisted from the beginning that he had no intention of reconciling with his son. <br /> <br /> The "junk" looks like "Brokeback Mountain" in that the gay couple is the good guy and the straight men (the Kure Beach cop and the Reverend, for example) are the bad guy . The biggest disappointment of the film is that there is no interaction (and therefore no dramatic conflict) between Mark and one of his "mothers". Mark is already dead before the birth or adoptive mother has a chance to come to terms with him. <br /> <br /> Kirkman's theme is both a call to tolerance and an exhortation of family members to express their sincere feelings before it's too late! Kirkman's feelings are mostly well-intentioned, but they do not make good dramas. Loggerheads is moving at a brisk pace without providing new revelations (or suspense) on topics such as AIDS, adoption and homophobia. In the end, "Loggerheads" fails because of a lack of originality.
