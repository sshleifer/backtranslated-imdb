Unfortunately, this film is typical of the dilution of a good movie by many sequels. Universal made several serial monster movies in the 1940s, which were pale imitations of the original. The intelligent Egyptologist Imhotep has been replaced by a Frankenstein who drags his legs in mummy envelopes, which shows no sign of intelligent life. This film is entertaining in places, but if you saw The Mummy (1932), you'll be disappointed.
