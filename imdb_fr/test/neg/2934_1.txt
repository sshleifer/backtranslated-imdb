In & Out made me want to throw up. I have never seen such a shameful movie! He seriously wanted to say that being gay is something wonderful and happy, but he has no idea how to say it. For me, it was not a comedy, unless cruel jokes and unhealthy jokes do not please when a victim falls in love. <br /> <br /> From what I've seen, this movie had four (4) major flaws A) The character of Matt Dillion, when he announces to the world this former teacher, Howard Brackett (Kevin Kline ) is gay. No matter how incredible it is that Matt Dillion's character won an Oscar for what appeared to be a serious role on the brink. But why would he say something like that? After all, this has never been a problem for Howard's students, friends, family or family. Nobody. So why would he say something like that when it was not true? More specifically, why does not the film give us an answer as to why he said it? The reason is that there is no answer, and for the convenience of the plot, none is provided. The second flaw (B) lies in the fact that the movie seems to have forgotten what homosexuality is - attraction and same-sex sex. In this film, being gay is like loving Barbara Streisand's musicals and passionate about literature. Everything is based on stereotypes! <br /> <br /> These two weaknesses are found again at the graduation ceremony which must be seen and expected. Matt Dillion discovers the turmoil that is happening in this small town and the film seems ready to let us know what made it say such a thing. When he arrives at the ceremony, he says nothing, and I wondered why in the world he had come. He did not solve anything. Then, when all the public stood up to announce that he was gay, I was so excited that I wanted to throw up! These people stood up to defend Howard from being gay by making fun of all those stereotypes. What the film has forgotten is that he used these stereotypes to show why Howard was gay. They shot themselves in the foot! But wait, there is more! <br /> <br /> During the ceremony, (C) Howard appeared to be tried to lose his job as a teacher, as people thought he would make his students become gay. What the film was trying to say is that homosexuals never recruit and it would not influence his students. But did not we see Tom Selleck's character pressuring Howard, even to the point of kissing him unexpectedly, to get out of the closet when, in my mind, there was none? ? From this, the film clearly shows that homosexuals are able to recruit. The film, again, is shooting itself in the foot. <br /> <br /> And (D) When Howard came out of the closet, did not anyone notice how the screenplay silenced him for the rest of the movie? I counted only three lines he had after: "Yeah!" to his parents, "Hello!" to a student, and "are you ready?" to Tom Selleck before the last vomiting scene. I may be weak, but the fact is that he is not allowed to tell us what led him to decide that he was gay. I wanted to know what he was thinking because I did not think for once that he was gay. <br /> <br /> As a bonus, the film also includes several really shocking scenes. An example in which Howard seeks advice from a confessed priest about what to do for a friend who is engaged and has not yet had sex with his fiancé. "Does that make him gay?" he asks. The priest answered "Oh yes, he's really gay". Uh-huh. Or what about the scene where all the old ladies are gathered around to tell Howard's mother that she does not need to be sad about her son's deep, dark secret because, well ... everyone has them. Then the ladies confessed that she had never seen "Madison County Bridges". Funny? No! Because the film shows that he is insensitive and that he has no idea how disastrous it can be for the family to have one of his members announce that he is gay. I know. I have several homosexual friends and none of their families took it well. It was a bad way to spread the whole situation. <br /> <br /> The last straw that was for me was the last scene that gave the appearance that Tom and Kevin were getting married. The camera went down very slowly in front of the church when ... That's not what you thought! I had been completely disgusted at that time and I could never forgive this sickly joke. I have nothing against movies about homosexuality or homosexuality. "Philadelphia" and "Longtime Companion" were very honest and real about what they had to say. "In & Out" only screams for the politically correct, but has no idea of ​​the corruption in its center. What I understood from the movie is that if you are 99% straight and 1% gay, that is if you have any doubt, YOU ARE DEFINITELY GAY. It's as if homosexuality is becoming a dominant trait in genetics. In fact, if everyone kept telling you that you were stupid and stupid, you'll end up believing it too, right? That's what happened to Howard Brackett about his homosexuality. I left the theater sad and angry. Angry all weekend, actually. It was a critically ill and cruel movie, the worst of 1997.
