I rented this movie with Netflix's permission, thinking I would receive the 1972 version. I sat there staring at nothing while watching this new version, thinking: Gee, the production values ​​were spectacular! I was convinced that the soundtrack was a little over 70 years old. I was even more convinced that it was a 70s movie when it occurred to me (almost every five seconds) that the only thing that was missing between Gene and Finney was a hug intense, a charged look, a passionate kiss. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, although John Knowles himself said it was not a homosexual relationship, it's painfully obvious that yes, that's exactly what it was. When people (usually adolescents) of the same sex have "intense" friendships, it means that these aspirations to love, camaraderie, the desire to express themselves sexually are overflowing. These boys needed to connect, but they were never allowed to. <br /> <br /> In addition, despite the enthusiastic performance of Toby Moore, I have never felt any of these emotions. I never connected to any of the boys, for the very reason that their relationship was not really honest. <br /> <br /> People want to live in a fantasy and think that because it happened in the 1940s, these boys could not. They did not have these sexual feelings for each other. But I say they did - at least in their book, and in this movie, Finney had them, almost painfully, for Gene. "Intensity" suggested by John Knowles was a hidden homosexuality, a hero worship, an idolatry - which in normal circumstances would be expressed in a sexual way. Even if these boys repressed him, it should have been crystal clear, but this film does not even mention it. <br /> <br /> Finally, there is an incredibly strange moment when Finney, who broke his leg, is jubilant with all the other boys in a baseball game. Unless it's just a bunch of nincompoops, they'd know they could not throw their bodies at him. Obviously, this moment of rupture was lost for both the director and the producer.
