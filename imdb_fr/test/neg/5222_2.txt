OK, I'm 26, I've gone through all the hype of action heroes of the 80s, and Chuck Norris, Seagal, Van Damme and the rest of the guys were my childhood heroes, fighting the bad guys, shooting dozens of one-round bullets;) I saw the ad on TV a few days ago - Chuck Norris was throwing fireballs at him. WHOA! "It's a shitty movie to see absolutely!", I said. And indeed it was. Only a lot worse. It's very difficult to see the entire movie - stuffed with religious thoughts, ridiculous monsters resembling zombies, serving Satan, the whole idea of ​​a plot going on in a forgotten community, representing the whole of humanity - it is a burden of Christian fundamentalists. wet dreams. <br /> <br /> I have nothing against Christianity, even in the cinema, but it lacks taste, it lacks almost everything that is related to common sense, come on, Chuck Norris playing an angel, including the job is to take care of the little town where Satan lives?!?! All the plot is so upright and boring, not to mention its foolishness (yes, this is no longer stupidity, it is a foolishness as ... as a lingering child joke). Make a movie absolutely terrible, realized as far as I suppose for a senior. very dedicated people to the Catholic Church, because young viewers make fun of almost every scene. Technically, it's incorrect, the effects are worse than the ones you saw in the early 90s in TV series, the plot seems VERY stupid, the actors could easily be exchanged for cardboard media, not to mention the music that has been to my knowledge heard. played on a childish toy piano. I've seen a lot of movies, even the worst ones (those on the IMDb bottom list) like "Space Mutiny" or "Manos - hands of fate" BUT believe me, nothing compares to this ridiculous, terrible, almost acted movie that makes me think of movies of jokes of students rather than a regular production. Avoid it. Avoid it at all costs. There is not even anything to laugh about. Chuck Norris has officially ended his film career.
