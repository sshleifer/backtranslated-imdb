Not as well done as the inspired "Guinea Pig" movie ("Flesh and Blood Flowers" or "Devil's Experiment") and conveying no real philosophy, this barely-length feature length video adds hardcore sex (with censorship of the mosaic) to his inspiration. The special effects of make-up, which include a stomach break and a disembowel, are pretty good, if they are superimposed. The amateur feeling of production is a distraction. Everything seems cheap and lazy. The lighting is hard and the sound and editing are sloppy. The simple story involves a porn actress who ends up playing in a real snuff movie. Just when she is tired of being a victim of violence, the real violence begins. In the scene of the heroes of the film, an actor cuts the belly of the woman in a graphic close-up, shoves his member and proceeds to his task. I did not find shocking "Psycho - The Snuff Reels". On the contrary, I thought it was a desperate attempt by fans of "guinea pigs" and its bloody guns. Interestingly, this was distributed by Aroma, one of the leading producers of fetishism.
