As a physicist, talking about black holes and cosmology makes my heart beat. However, I found this presentation too slow and insufficiently documented for the interested layman (who is most likely to see it). If you have more than a passing curiosity in this kind of things, go to the library and consult books. You will discover that they explain the current scientific cosmologies with much more detail, while leaving you more amazed than this film. To make matters clear: Hawking is NOT considered the "greatest mind" or "the smartest person in the world", as is commonly claimed even among user reviews here at IMDb. Hawking himself said, "They're garbage, they're just hype, they needed someone to fill the role of the disabled genie, at least I'm disabled." To be honest, he's probably a genius, but among the greatest scientists in history, personalities like Einstein, Newton, Gauss and many others are easily considered even more so. It is not out of disrespect to Hawking, who is undoubtedly a great scientist, but rather not to disrespect others who have done more than him. Anyway, see the movie if you are really in science. But otherwise, I think it would be boring for you.
