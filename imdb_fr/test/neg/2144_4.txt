BLACK EYE (2 out of 5 stars) An action movie of the 70s filmed without imagination seems to have been designed for television. Only a casual word and a secondary plot about lesbianism tell you that the movie was created to be screened in theaters. Fred Williamson plays a tough ex-policeman who becomes a private eye of tough guy. He comes across two or three murders and attempted murders related to a mysterious cane. There are hand fights, a car chase inspired by Bullit, a rather original elevator scene and even time for Williamson to face the rich lesbian girlfriend of his girlfriend (Teresa Graves). There is also a scene with Williamson harassing a poor old man by tearing up some old, priceless autographed photos in his souvenir shop. Yeah, well done dude hard ... maybe you can find a cripple to beat later? Obviously intended to take advantage of the success of "Shaft" (this film and about six thousand other films), this film does not have enough sharpness or originality to make a strong impression.
