My suggestion ..... This movie was really meant to be a "comedy", is not it? !!!! Otherwise, producers, directors, actors and "hairdressers" should really choose another career! Now, the instructions in my memoir require a minimum of "10 lines". How can I add something to that? Hmm ... let me see. Oh yes, the beginning of the movie was quite hilarious with the scene of the "crash accident". Too bad that the plane did not hit the tanker truck and a group of "Martians" got out of the wreckage (obviously hidden) and decided to seize the planet "world" and make a better movie. It would have been a good start! <br /> <br /> T
