This film was awful, especially considering the work he had to do to produce it. Although it's not as bad as Ax 'Em, it's pretty awful. Consider Gladiator's obvious scams and Raiders of the Lost Ark, and what do you get? This assortment of makeup and wooden play is horrible. <br /> <br /> The movie starts like most zombie movies do nowadays. A montage of interesting jumps and a radio show of the upcoming epidemic. We see our hero (Ryn, perhaps the worst "zombie hunter" of the modern era, counted about four or five times that he scratched his head with the barrel of his gun or lowered his eyes while blowing) by cutting the fingers of the zombies. . We will learn later that these fingers are collected for bonuses. <br /> <br /> Well, Ryn seems to be a rebel in his ways of dispensing zombies; going up to buy boyfriend * panting * to his French friend Hans (who is not really French, speaks with a strange accent of the Middle East). While Ryn uses the boyfriend to collect a bounty of Lost Hills, all hell is unleashed. <br /> <br /> And report the atrocity of the movie. Zombies are badly assembled. I have seen comments praising their makeup, but it was quite amateurish in my opinion. Obvious Halloween stickers were used to create the faces of zombies and there were places where a girl seemed to wear a clown mask instead of a freshly peeled face. Oy Vey. <br /> <br /> To summarize the next sixty minutes in a few lines: Ryn is stabbed by Hans (who has made a deal with other zombie hunters, Blythe being the leader), gives him a second La luck comes back, stabbed again by Hans, then shoots Hans and goes to Union City where he discovers that Blythe poisons the cities for profit. <br /> <br /> It's all about the plot. When Ryn arrives in Union City, all the bad guys are gathered in a house that is obviously so gigantic that it takes hours in Ryn to reach the top floor. People die, Ryn lives and the film ends with one of those cynics "will he kill himself?" scenes. <br /> <br /> * END SPOILERS * I'm going to have to blame Nott for most of this mess. The management was awful. EVERY character presented a frown other than Hans, who was undoubtedly the best "actor" of this group of MacBeth. When they reach Union City, a group of zombies attacks the crew and it is obvious that the zombies do not receive any hint or idea about how to walk as if their appendages were rotten. A woman is swinging as if she was swimming in the air during a Sunday walk. <br /> <br /> Some movies are awful. This film is one of them simply because the logic seemed abandoned to let a story flow. Operates from time to time, but in this respect (where the story was already in a disastrous state), this is not the case. <br /> <br /> Avoid it unless you want to laugh decently.
