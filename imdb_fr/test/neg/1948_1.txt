It is easy for a movie that tries to be suspensive to find itself simply uninteresting. It happens quite often. Dark Harbor is not only uninteresting, but it is very badly done. Scene after scene is stuck to an otherwise exaggerated premise. A troubled couple recruits a troubled stranger and then has more problems. <br /> <br /> Some movies create tension by building the story. Dark Harbor continues to add to its history but never builds it. I was hoping that, as in other films, the suspense would finally explode. It never does. In addition, the characters have no continuity from one scene to another. They can act one way in one scene, but then in a completely different way in another scene. At first, you think they are not part of the character, but in the end, you realize they are not really characters. They are only accessories for the final twist. The last ten minutes are trying to be shocking. Instead, it's rather lame and uninteresting. The only thing that shocked me was that the movie finally ended. In less than 90 minutes, the film still seems too long. <br /> <br /> This is not one of those low-budget jewels. It's more like a counterfeit watch that breaks as soon as you bring it home.
