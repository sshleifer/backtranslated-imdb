I've heard people compare this film to Sideways. How this comparison was made, I'll never guess, because this film was in no way comparable to Sideways. <br /> <br /> These two films were as different as Star Wars and the Thornbirds. The only thing they had in common was that both were about wine. <br /> <br /> Although the interviews in this documentary are semi-interesting, they have been ruined by the worst camera work ever done ... attempted. I have never seen worse camera work in my life and compare it to home videos taken accidentally by 5 year olds. <br /> <br /> I give these two stars, ONLY for the interesting interviews of French wine types and for showing how perverse and corrupt American wine companies are (not all companies are dapper and Corrupted?) I would give it -10 stars (yes, it's NEGATIVE 10) for the deplorable, terrible, horrible, terrible, VERTIGO- uninviting, 5-year-could-do-better camera mess.
