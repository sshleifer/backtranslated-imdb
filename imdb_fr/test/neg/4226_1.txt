Humanity is a mystery of murder. These films tend to be popular, <br /> <br /> and the rating of 6.9 that he currently has suggests that it was the same. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this film has no quality that redeems them. <BR /> <br /> Some non-critical examples, for example, include a 5 minute <br /> <br /> scene in which the main character eats an apple. And another 3 minutes <br /> <br /> where he breathes. <br /> <br /> In case you're wondering, it's not really art. <br /> <br /> This is also not a comment on humanity, which seems to be in the desired <br /> <br /> title. It's actually boring. There are many attempts in this movie to say something about humanity. One could think of <br /> <br /> saying to oneself: "How could I comment on humanity?" And the most obvious and boring answers will of course be sex, love and death. <br /> <br /> It's not that these options are uninteresting if they are well executed. <br /> <br /> these are the canonical options. For sex, this movie does its best to make it unattractive and disgusting. In the first five minutes - <br /> <br /> that's why it's not a spoiler - you'll see the bloodied vagina of a <br /> <br /> 11-year-old girl murdered; it's a mystery of murder, remember? Later <br /> <br /> some throw themselves on each other and have what <br /> <br /> the director would like us to believe is "raw" sex, but reality is artificial and too symbolic - but even worse, uninteresting. <br /> <br /> I like to be bothered by movies. This film showed me why: <br /> <br /> Disturbing movies usually show something inside someone, <br /> <br /> their humanity, which they did not know existed and who is a little <br /> <br /> afraid of. Humanity tried to do that and failed. I left the theater, not disturbed, but disgusted, thinking that I had lost my time at the theater. , although having seen the film for free <br /> <br />.
