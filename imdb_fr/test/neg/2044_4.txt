The film is somewhat entertaining, but the biggest film is the ludicrous performance of Shalom Harlow. It's been 4 years since this movie came out and we hope Harlow has taken more training. Maybe she should stick to the more mundane, somewhat corruptive characters she has generated in other performances.
