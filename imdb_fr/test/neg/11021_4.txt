... BREAKER MORANT and ROMPER STOMPER. He also allowed us to watch films such as BOOTMEN and THE ODD ANGRY SHOT. Unfortunately for all the people involved in this debacle, THE WOG BOY will not join the list. <br /> <br /> I could not wait to see this movie just because of the politically incorrect title, so politically incorrect that aired on BBC 2 late at night, the advertiser does not even mention the name of the movie, I m So I was waiting for something as anachronistic as my jaw would sink into disbelief. Incredulously incredulous, I could not believe the financiers thought it would be a major international success. <br /> <br /> The problem lies in the casting and the scenario. I know that Australia, with its small population, does not have a lot of actors, so I will forgive a lot, but that does not stop my criticism of Nick Giannopoulos as Steve. For this type of comedy to work, you have to be impressed by the actor's comedic talents and I'm sorry to say that, but Nick G simply does not have those skills. I had never heard of him and I had not seen anything else. It may be much better at other performances. Here, however, he's just irritating, unconvincing, and I've lost count of the number of times he's been attacked for the camera. The jokes themselves are very flat and predictable, and going back to the script, it seems very underdeveloped. I think that thinking that a gag on a Minster Of Work who was going after a limo was funny at first? You have the feeling that someone in the production should have been more honest and said: "My friend, this scenario is not good enough, go ahead, make it more subtle and structured" <br /> < I was tough and hardness was called in this review. I gave the film four times out of ten and it would have been three if there had not been this really funny sequence where Steve was watching a news program only for himself flashing on the screen and labeled "Doddle blodger". This shows that the writers were aware of the timing and social commentary of the comic strip. Too bad they did not come with a much better written film
