I bought this "movie" in a gas station located in trash 3.99 for a reason: Billy Drago, who is one of my favorite actors. It's terribly scary and good, but that's where it stops. The film itself is a cruel and horrible attempt at Western horror, and does not manage either, let alone the successful fusion of the two genres. Apart from Drago, the acting is so bad that I wanted to put the couch cushions on my ears, the production values ​​are non-existent and the scenario, I do not even know where to start. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs, unless you're a fan of Draco like me. <br /> <br /> Terrible, shameful, unforgivable.
