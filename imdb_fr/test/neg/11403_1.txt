Yesterday was one of those days when we decided to go to the movies. We chose "Ik ook van Jou" more or less randomly, but we were interested in the current state of Dutch cinema. <br /> <br /> The film is based on a book by Ronald Giphart, and I must admit right now that it's not exactly one of my favorites. The film features actors who are best known in the Netherlands for appearances in soap operas and / or talk shows in the afternoon. At least one of them (Kamerling) did pretty decent things after leaving the soap world. So we decided to give the benefit of the doubt to this film. <br /> <br /> And what a mistake it was. This film fails on all fronts. Bad acting (the best performance is actually that of a guinea pig, which pretends very convincingly to be dead). A flat and uninteresting story with unexplained and uninteresting side lines (Why France? Why tell the story to a Ugandan girl?) Mistakes like New York, even if it looks great in the cinema, people do not wear t-shirts outdoors on New Year's Eve in Northern Europe). There is a funny moment involving two little dogs, and that's it. <br /> <br /> So that's what I think, but more importantly, it seemed that none of the people who had left the movie theater had enjoyed it later. I heard one of them say that he was extremely disappointed because he loved the book so much. I did not read the book, but my advice should be: read the book, do not see the movie.
