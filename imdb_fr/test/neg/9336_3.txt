Salomon and Sheba fell into Hollywood traditions not for the quality of the film, but for the fact that Tyrone Power died while doing so. I was in Grade 5 and I remember the huge news of the days when this tragedy occurred. I did not know who Tyrone Power was at that time, but I learned to appreciate the body of his work. <br /> <br /> I often wonder if Ty had any idea of ​​this movie and everything he proved. He was the anonymous producer. Maybe he just did not want to face criticism. Fortunately, Power has met the prosecution witness, although you can see him in close-up if you look closely. <br /> <br /> We have here a biblical stew that would probably confuse the great Solomon himself. Several incidents described in the Bible that the Bible deals with separately are grouped together in the same plot with some additions added by Hollywood. <br /> <br /> The story of the Queen of Sheba is that she went on a trade mission to the Kingdom of Israel, chatted a little with Solomon, came back with a lot of trade and that is all. The story of a love story between her and Solomon is a legend. The ancient kingdom of Saba is pretty much the place where Yemen is and its people would have been transferred to the African continent, so Ethiopia was founded. <br /> <br /> The Queen has never witnessed Solomon's famous case involving the two women with separate claims for a baby, nor has she been involved in the construction of the First Temple. She was not there for the destruction of the same thing either. In this respect, Solomon no more. <br /> <br /> And she was not involved in the dispute over the estate when Solomon's brother, Adonijah, filed a counterclaim. This is the heart of this film. Adonija at the announcement of the death of King David proclaims himself king. Of course, David rallies temporarily and says that God came to him and said that Solomon should succeed him. When David hears about what Adonijah did, he says that's what made God deformed, Adonijah being greedy. After that, Adonijah embarks on the plot. <br /> <br /> It seems that Ty Power collapsed on the set as he faced George Sanders as Adonijah. Sanders and Power have been rivals in many films, including in Lloyds of London, the decisive role of Power. If Sanders is not quite the sophist he was at Samson and Dalila, he still remains Sanders' biblical character. <br /> <br /> When Power died, Yul Brynner was brought to play Solomon and received a wig so that existing footage of Long-Term Power could be recovered. Brynner invests the dialogue with the proper dignity, but I think he probably regretted hitting it. <br /> <br /> Gina Lollobrigida is the Queen of Sheba and she seduces as a biblical temptress in the tradition of Cecil B. DeMille. She seems to have no real conviction and I guess she was shocked by Power's sudden demise and the need to start over again. Marisa Pavan as Abishag can give the best performance in the film. <br /> <br /> The real story with Adonijah is not as elaborate as this film. He contested with Solomon for the estate and gathered around a group of some of King David's court as supporters. Solomon once forgave them, then Adonija asked Abishag for marriage. Abishag in the Bible and here was an adopted daughter of King David in his old age. When Solomon hears this, he decides that Adonijah becomes greedy again and kills him. The Bible mentions a man named Berniah who was essentially in contract with the followers of Adonijah. <br /> <br /> What we have in the film is a spectacular paroxysm that involves a miracle that I looked for and did not find. This comes from the fertile imagination of director King Vidor who ended a long and distinguished career on a bitter note. It was a question of Vidor trying to go out and make Cecil B. DeMille a biblical show. <br /> <br /> He did not do it.
