The brother of the suicide, somewhat bellicose, discovers that he and his mother are in about the same grief (acting), but that daddy is morose and blames himself. Screenwriter-director Dan Harris gives us a dysfunctional family torn apart, characters with question marks that cover them, and then exposes all the points of the story in clear terms: suicide! Secrets! Gay shame! Family disease! In the end, in order to close the situation, Harris wants to make sure not to miss a trick, by giving us a thoughtful material to meditate on, and then spell everything out in an elemental and sentimental way. Sigourney Weaver's puzzling performance as a matriarch of the family is serenely unobstructed and she is a joy - that is, until Harris brings her a metamorphosis (with a new sensible hairstyle). It's the cinematic equivalent of a condescending slap on the head. ** from ****
