As CURSE OF THE KOMODO was for the featured genre, Jim Wynorski's CHEERLEADER MASSACRE is a straight-face parody of slasher movies, such as SLUMBER PARTY MASSACRE. A psychopath who escaped from his padded cell ((.. he was sent to the trash after killing 11 people) is crossing the mountainous countryside of Bobcat County in the backcountry, attacking anyone A cheerleader van, their teacher, two equipment hands and the driver go to the competition when their vehicle runs out of gas while taking a shortcut to avoid having to turn around. Fortunately, the group finds a cabin in front of him, but is the prey of a murderer who attacks each victim one by one.The psychopath released in the county could not have killed a girl because she was in the cloakroom of the cheerleaders while he was away, which means that the culprit is somebody in. Meanwhile, the county sheriff and his deputy seek the comings and goings of their psychopath, while also trying to locate the br igade of cheerleaders gone. <br /> <br /> Shot cheaply on video, Wynorski does what he can with the limited number of The budget must find clever ways to kill off-screen characters without the luxury of effective special effects. In other words, many melons were stabbed. The sound effect let us know that some of the victims who were taken into darkness by a black gloved hand were dying savagely. Wynorski incorporates a scene from SLUMBER PARTY MASSACRE about Brinke Stevens' character, Linda, chased by a murderer with a drill (this murderer and Linda both died, but I suppose Wynorski wanted to associate his film with this one. It was still nice to see her, even though it was a glorified cameo. Tamie Sheffield, in the role of Mrs. Hendricks, teacher of students in difficulty, spent a long scene in the shower soaping naked bodies and fake breasts. The girls who make up the cheerleaders are not very convincing because they are in their twenties. Samantha Philips (.. as a police officer attacked by the psychopath she is looking for) and Nikki Fritz (.. a hiker jogged on a dangerous bridge) do not have to undress. Wynorski's veterans, Bill Langlois Monroe (as sheriff Murdock) and Melissa Brasselle (as Murdock's assisting detective in his case) contribute to the under-plot of John Colton's serial killer research, McPherson. Interestingly enough, McPherson's story serves as McGuffan because, in truth, the film's meat is dedicated to the group of cheerleaders and their perilous situation. I do not know if the slasher fans will accept this film because it takes too long for the murders to burst and when they come on the scene, the violence is not powerful enough or shocking enough to satisfy.
