Beginning to teach Mrs. Tingle, all I wanted was a fun and enjoyable comedy for teenagers that would entertain me because it was the race. Despite a good first half-hour, the film quickly disappears into a dull mess and cliche as entertaining as tearing your eyelashes with forceps. Rusty tongs, at that. Scream writer Kevin Williamson wrote and directed this film, proving that Scream may have been a coincidence. Most of the elements in this film have already been seen a million times in other films; and even if he agreed to steal items from other Scream movies, because it was a compliant tribute; Here, it looks like he's completely out of ideas. The plot follows the smartest girl in the school, played by Katie Holmes. After being caught cheating with two of his friends; the three decide to take the teacher who took them hostage at home. However, it's not just any teacher; it's Mrs. Tingle, the most naughty bitch in school. She also does not get tied to bed, as she begins to play games of mind to turn her kidnappers against each other. <br /> <br /> The plot is very similar to the 1997 movie "Suicide Kings". , and a host of previous films. It's actually not a bad idea for a movie, and if Williamson could have populated it with interesting characters; it would have worked very well. Ms. Tingle's character is the most interesting of the film, but she is massively one-dimensional and looks like all the other characters in the movie. is simply a caricature. The acting is largely devilish, with the exception of Helen Mirren in the lead role. She is suitably perverse in the role, and although she does not have much to put in her mouth; she clearly likes to play the central figure. Teen actors are not worth mentioning, only Katie Holmes standing out; And it's really only because of his star profile, not his acting skills. Williamson dressed almost every scene with soft and dull rock music, which would be really boring if the movie was not absolutely terrible anyway. Honestly, this movie has some pretty good moments; But basically, if you want to see a good example of teen comedy - it's not the movie you want to see.
