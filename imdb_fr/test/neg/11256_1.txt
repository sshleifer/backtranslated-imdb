Inspector Dave Robicheaux tries to associate the murder of a local prostitute to the mafia of New Orleans, Julie Balboni. But during his investigation, Robicheaux is dragged into a series of surrealist encounters with a troop of Confederate soldiers - what an abominable plot and it was worse than I expected. it was very slow and very skillful in the acting game. I could not look through, it was a waste of time. Another FLOP, I would give it less than 1 if I could please people, do not waste your time, 1: 42m of time lost. Actor Elrod Sykes and his girlfriend lead under the influence. While Dave takes Elod to the movie theater, the actor tells Dave that he found skeletal remains on the set of a movie.
