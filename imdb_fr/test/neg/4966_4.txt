I was only a cautious enthusiast when renting "All Boys Like Mandy Lane" because I immediately remembered hearing and reading a wide variety of opinions? both positive and negative ?? in the short space of time between its brief cinematographic exit and the distribution towards videostore shelves. Supposedly, it was the most ingenious and refreshing new horror film of all time, with non-stereotypical teen characters and unpredictable twists for change. Okay, the basic concept may seem quite innovative, but inevitably, the scenario quickly returns to the same old and irritating slasher shots, and once past that point, even the stunning stylistic brands can not save the film from a terrible mediocrity. The opening sequences are really fantastic and literally bathe in a melancholy atmosphere, which makes it even more painful to watch the movie go down to the "ordinary" level of rudimentary slasher film. After the sublime intro, featuring a drunken macho drunk kid calculating his jump from a roof to impress the titular beauty, "All the Boys Love Mandy Lane" turns out to be just another horror book and a movie of uninspired horror on a group of idiot children stoned and excited in an isolated ranch before being killed by a not so unknown maniac. All the pretentious decor of the film collapses faster than a dilapidated house of cards: one never explains why Mandy herself behaves so coldly and so haughtily towards all her admirers (because she grew up orphaned, can Oh, oh yes!), the boys illustrate pretty quickly that they would choose sex with any random bimbo and not exclusively with the "divine" Mandy and the final turnaround. although undeniably staggered ?? is just crazy. The central part of it is rather boring and does not even offer any really horrible excitement (gun shootings? Please!) Or genuine silly rancor. My generous rating 4 out of 10 goes entirely to the gritty and disturbing 70's filming style (with faded colors, bizarre but gorgeous photographic images, ??) and surprisingly wonderful soundtrack. Director Jonathan Levine chose to play Bobby Vinton's classic song "Sealed with a Kiss" during the trailer and the closing credits, while I was initially convinced that the film would inevitably feature the song of love "Mandy" by Barry Manilow.
