I have seen tons of garbage, in all languages, on all subjects and trends in film production. From each period, each director and any type of budget available. That said, I really have to declare: <br /> <br /> This is one of the three worst movies I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> It's terribly bad. It's pompous. It's sinister. It's incomprehensible. It's boring. It's a very bad mess. It's a piece of you-know-what. <br /> <br /> And, what is more important, it misses a point. And even if he had one, the characters are so unreal and annoying that it is impossible to neglect the lack of cohesion of the whole. <br /> <br /> It's just weird to be weird. <br /> <br /> I felt really sick looking at this basket. The theater where I saw it (Lincoln Center in New York) was full in its infancy. In the end, half of the audience was gone. There was a question-and-answer program at the end, but no one stayed there. With the exception of about two sickos, all the others ran to the door, myself included. <br /> <br /> Save 2 hours of your life. It's probably one of the worst ever. <br /> <br /> If there is a movie theater in Hell, this film will be broadcast 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, for eternity ...
