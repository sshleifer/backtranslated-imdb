It's definitely not worth spending money or time. It's the same used plot that a guy and a girl meet and fall in love with. But it's with a Western touch. But that fails miserably by describing a love story or giving it a western touch. We never think that the hero and the heroine are in love. There is no depth to any of their characters. Probably, with a better distribution, some justice could have been rendered to the characters. Finally, it's a movie without fun, without acting, without theme, without intrigue, without comedy, without action, without thrill, without romance (I associate romance with something more passionate). This is definitely not a movie you would like to go with your family. All in all, if you're looking for a movie with content, it's definitely not an option. I will wait for the day when Bollywood movies will be something that I can watch and that I can call my friends movie "to watch absolutely".
