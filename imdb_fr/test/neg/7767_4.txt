I did not expect much from the movie, so I'm not so disappointed. Carrie was ugly, Mr. Big had colored eyebrows with colored pencils and Samantha had not said f ***. <br /> <br /> Charlotte's child was boring to watch as she was in too many scenes - the title could easily have been "SATC: Parents' Night Out". The camera angles were just not very good, especially regarding Carrie's face. <br /> <br /> There was a symbolic black woman thrown into the character who has no proper outlet and too few appearances of gay friends who seemed to be thrown aimlessly anyway. Samantha comes and goes from Los Angeles strangled the flow of stories, especially when she participates in Fashion Week and nothing happens. <br /> <br /> The film seems to have been shot in a hurry because it could have been good, but scenes were simply projected to show different outfits or to give viewers a chance to go back without adding much to the story of the film.
