Where to start ?? I think only three other films led me to post a review on IMDb, and all of them were positive. Regarding ..? <br /> <br /> Injurious, horrible, tragic, embarrassing, catastrophic, stupid, irritating, completely and utterly frightful. <br /> <br /> I'm stunned, drop a theatrical release. I think I'm literally in shock. <br /> <br /> I am not "snobbish". I did not expect a great movie or intense character, but it's really beyond a joke. We simply have to demand more of the movies we see. <br /> <br /> Avoid. Like the black plague.
