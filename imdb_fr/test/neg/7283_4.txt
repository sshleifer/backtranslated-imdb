HANA-BI has many moments of calm and slow pace. Unfortunately, during the many thoughtful interludes, the viewer must meditate on the recent scenes we have just watched and many questions arise and annoy. <br /> <br /> For example, why did not the wheelchair guy drown in the ocean get stuck in the sand and the tide rise around him? <br /> <br /> Can it be true that Japanese police are so inept and unskilled in arrest procedures that they do not remove the suspect's ability to seize a weapon beforehand? These Japanese police officers did not seem to have any experience of handling a suspect. <br /> <br /> Why does the right eye of the main character not blink? Having a flashing eye was distracting and it was unexplained. <br /> <br /> How did the main character spend all his money so much to borrow from loan sharks? He was not seen playing. As a junior government employee, his wife must have full health insurance. <br /> <br /> What was the single man doing on his own in the middle of nowhere in the nature park? What was his reason for being there? <br /> <br /> How did the gangsters find the main character and his wife in the far-off nature reserve? It made no sense. <br /> <br /> And again, how did the gangsters later find the main character and his wife in the distant mount? Fuji resort? There was absolutely no indication that these gangsters knew in which country were the main character and his wife, let alone the precise and exact place at the right time! <br /> <br /> And a third identical question, how could the young detectives know which feet of the Japanese coast find the main character and his wife? The Japanese coastline must be vast. Were all these characters supposed to have psychic powers? <br /> <br /> Two last questions: the pretty girl trying to fly a kite on the beach - where did she come from? She seemed to have no means of transport or companion with her. And why did the world keep trying to steal what was left of her kite after it was torn to pieces ?! It was weird. Python-esque involuntarily. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, I loved the background music. It was dramatic and fluid and added a lot to this movie. Photography, images and works of art were pleasing to the eye. <br /> <br /> One last point, the woman was too pleasing to the eye. Not once, she was never close to looking like a dying sick person. She looked very healthy. On the contrary, these people seemed depressed, mentally ill and not physically. The husband treated his wife as perhaps a newly deprived homosexual man would treat a respected woman ... a love of friendship, but no tenderness. <br /> <br /> A mixed film, for sure.
