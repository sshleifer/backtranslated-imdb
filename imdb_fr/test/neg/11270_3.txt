I have seen almost every Kurosawa movie and dozens of other Japanese movies. Compared to these other films, it is a rather average to mediocre film. The plot features two brothers at war - I did not care about any of them - and it is very confusing to know who is allied with whom. The music and cinematography are pretty good, but the special effects are sometimes terrible - the rubber heads fly with the same realism as the average game in high school! In addition to these complaints, the end of the film completely destroys and depreciates the entire image. It turns out that the end is not true but was completely "falsified". What is the purpose of this, then? If you've ever seen this movie, know that there are LOTS of better movies, so do not give up!
