If you see the title "2069 A Sex Odyssey" in the video store, ATTENTION! The cover contains Tori Wells and three other pornstars "80" and has a copyright of 1986. If you're like me (and I hope you're not), you'll think that "the porn of 80s? Tori Wells? Alright! " Deception!! It was manufactured in 1974 and nicknamed the German stars! There is nothing wrong with German pornography in the 70s, but it's not my cup of tea, and nothing looks like what the cover suggests. Once I got mad about the obviously misleading jacket, I watched it anyway. It's a bad movie. Sorry, I guess I did not really get past the rage.
