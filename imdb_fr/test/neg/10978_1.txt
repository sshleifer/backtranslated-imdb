I had a hard time getting interested in those boring or tasteless characters, all of whom lived fabulously hilarious and urban lives. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was sometimes infuriating, and sometimes the story seemed hard to follow - was it me or were entire scenes deleted? <br /> <br /> It looked like a poor sitcom turned into a movie. The stereotypes and jokes about "men's groups" might have been fun in the early 90's. In fact, that's where much of the movie's humor comes from - and boy, it's getting old quick. <br /> <br /> Apart from the seductive Irish, this film was a failure. And not even in a "so bad it's a good way". The last 20 minutes have been particularly painful. Maybe if you've never met homosexuals or never thought of homosexuality before, then this movie might make sense. Otherwise, honey, you'd better rent The Boys in The Band or Beautiful Thing.
