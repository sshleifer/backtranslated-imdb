After reading other reviews on this site, we did not know if we would be able to criticize this movie because it did not sound bad enough. However, 2 minutes into the movie, we knew we were going to have another flop. No summer is complete without ice cream, but this movie served a melted, acidic and broken ice cream cone (you know, the one that leaves you clingy and dirty and looking for a wet nap). The biggest problem with this movie was the plot. what was that? It seemed like a psychotic glacier walking around the neighborhood. That's all. Nothing else happens. First of all, what are the qualifications to become an ice cream merchant in this crappy city? 1. Spend several years in the most ridiculous psychiatric hospital you know. The hospital was rife with clowns, graffiti, fake plastic sunflowers and oversized syringes in the head. 2. Have extreme hygiene and a mutant face to scare children. 3. Make sure your truck is full of body parts, roaches, and do not forget white eyes! <br /> <br /> The actors in this film are pure B-Movie caliber. Who is other than ... a version of Macaulay Culkin to the trailer bin !! Even his bratty charm could not save that kick in the pants. There seemed to be no rhyme or reason for any of the murders in this movie. The concept of the film stank! Who would kill an ice cream vendor during a shootout? Gangsters? Fiends? Vanna White? Who? We are still struggling with this issue. <br /> <br /> Whoever was in charge of the wardrobe of this film should be immediately put on the Hollywood blacklist. Did they honestly think that a pillow under a child's shirt would make the audience believe that he was really fat? Have they forgotten the arms, the face, the legs and all other parts of the body? Secondly, this film was shot in 1995. Yet the wardrobe seems to have been chosen in a lame film of the 80s, as evidenced by the big brother's stifling white pants. <br /> <br /> Looking at this production, we both developed severe cases of ADD. We ended up leaving the room to wander aimlessly. Repeatedly in the film, we found that looking at a white wall behind the TV set was more fun than the movie itself. We were stunned by the fact that this film does not go to the bottom of the list. After that, we took out the tape from the VCR and left it on the black top to melt it like a low quality ice cream cone.
