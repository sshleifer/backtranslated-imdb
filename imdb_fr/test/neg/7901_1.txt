I gave Soul Plane the benefit of the doubt and I thought there would be a comic value. I'm not black, but that does not mean I can not appreciate black comedy. I know it because I like to watch Wayans, Good Times and others. <br /> <br /> I've seen crappy movies and I'm not easily pushed back. As for Soul Plane, I did not even bother to finish it. I do not know if they managed to land the plane and I do not care. It would be unfair to say that I did not find some fun games, but I also laugh at YouTube videos of skaters falling on their feet, which does not say much. The men in the movie looked like a group of hot and howling hyenas who sought to "get" when and where possible. And we wonder why all these stereotypes do not seem to disappear. To summarize: Soul Plane makes the Harold and Kumar series look like The Godfather.
