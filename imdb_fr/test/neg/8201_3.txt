This is a very low budget film, placed in a unique place in a valley protected from the effects of radiation. The cast, an older man and his daughter, a beautiful visitor, a couple (a difficult purchase and a girl), a vagabond, a donkey and a man affected by radiation, interact during the aftermath of a nuclear explosion. Added to this is an entity that watches women take a bath. <br /> <br /> They all have firearms, some are wounded by bullet, some are accused of having children, others are murdered, others drift and, well it is the film. Harvey Cormann's first film, he shows a certain simplicity in the making of a film. To avoid expensive decorations, the actors cross curtains to enter and leave the house (the studio). Filming scenes filmed in the hills near Hollywood are the backdrop. <br /> <br /> I would not say it's worth going out, but it's interesting to see how films with human subjects were filmed in the 50's.
