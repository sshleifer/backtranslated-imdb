Tom is about to enjoy a delicious Jerry sandwich when an enormous bird of prey lowers and flies off with his snack. Not at all happy that his sarnie was flown under his nose, Tom runs after the pursuit, determined to recover his piece of mouse. <br /> <br /> As much as I love Tom and Jerry, I must say that this one is a little stinky: the story is rather banal; he introduces a poorly designed peripheral character who lacks charm; and he blurs the old 'dress up the cartoon character as a woman' gag to death. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, 'Flirty Birdy' rivals 'Fraidy Cat' and 'Mouse in Manhattan' for the title of the weakest Tom and Jerry caper so far.
