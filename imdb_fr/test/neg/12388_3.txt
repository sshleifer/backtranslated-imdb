Oh, well. Not another chicks movie where men are all pigs and women will even get for the abuse they have been subjected to. The only difference is that in this film, everyone is a pig or has brains. I hated this film for the moral question of why it is fair to send a man to prison for life for a murder he did not commit. Is it a more immoral act than its abuse and cunning? This film shows all the situational ethics of bad writing. I saw it in the "Best of Britain" series of the CBC. If it's the best in Britain, it's no wonder the British film industry is in trouble. <br /> <br /> David Tennant is the only good thing about this movie. He plays his character so odiously that I run the risk of spitting on the next person who speaks with a Scottish accent. Kate Ashfield tries to play the victim but ends up being as immoral as the character of David Tennant. They deserve each other. <br /> <br /> Parents do not mind Brendan, who is obviously psychotic. The English police are so incompetent that they are unable to give tickets. The British Police Union should sue the authors of this film for defamation. <br /> <br /> This film is not worth the electricity needed to play your DVD.
