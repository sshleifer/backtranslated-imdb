Of all the movies I've seen, this one, The Rage, must be one of the worst to date. The direction, the logic, the continuity, the changes in the plot and the dialogue made me cry with pain. "How could anyone offer something so bad"? Gary Busey is known for his "B" movies, but it is a "W" movie. (W = waste). <br /> <br /> Take, for example, about two dozen local law enforcement officers and the FBI surrounding a mobile home with a jeep car. MA is inside the jeep and does not understand why all the cops are about. In a few seconds, a huge shootout ensued, MA being immediately murdered. The cops explode in the jeep with Gary and the company that annihilate them. The cops fall like dominoes and the jeep with Gary goes around in circles and is not hit by a single bullet / lead. MA is killed and Gary does not seem to have noticed, but this guy is hard. Really a miracle, since the six-ball shooter held 300 balls, there has not been such a miracle.
