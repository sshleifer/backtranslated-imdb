This film was not very well done. they almost totally ignored the book. I guess they were trying to save time. The only advantage is that the actor who played Finny was cute. Part of the dialogue between the main characters appeared a little cheerful, which was not the case in the book. The main parts of the book have been cut again. You lost the final effect that was not as haunting as the book and that left me badly lacking. Moreover, the strong language, although brief, was very useless. In addition, I was surprised (not pleasantly) by a new character who was nowhere in the book. One of my favorite characters (the leper) has been misinterpreted and portrayed. In the film, he seemed more sinister than the real leper in the book. Overall disappointing.
