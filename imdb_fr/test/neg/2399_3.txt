I'm sure the people who made this film think they're doing something politically correct, because they manage to criticize the American wars in Afghanistan and Iraq by suggesting that the US is waging a good war, but do not deny afterwards, thus sowing the seeds for future trouble. Moreover, they do it without making Islamists the enemy AND without making Republicans the enemy, because it is the Republicans who are in power and who do what is supposed to be a great thing: to bring down the USSR in secretly providing a war in Afghanistan. <br /> But seriously now. . . do we really want a film that repeats several times "let's kill Russians!" as if it was the best thing an American with red blood could do? And are we supposed to find this adorable Congressman because he surrounds himself with women with big hair and revealing clothes? Even his so-called smart assistant, still professionally dressed, continues to look at Charlie as if he's just the most wonderful, handsome and tallest guy ever. As if she were Nancy Reagan to her Ronnie. Julia Roberts does an amazing job in her role, but basically, the women are really humiliated in this movie, and it was really annoying.
