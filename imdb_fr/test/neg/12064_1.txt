I'm a fan of slasher movies, especially Scream 1-3, but this one is killing one after the other. To my astonishment: the second part is much better and you summarize the whole story of the first part! So, do not waste time on this one and go directly to Part II, you will not regret it, because Part 2 is actually a TERRAIN and is quite ironic. Part one: 1 of 10 Part two: 4 out of 10
