I have vague memories of this film that is funny. After reviewing it, I changed or I thought of another movie. <br /> <br /> It looks like we're supposed to be nice to Jackie Mason's character but nothing in the movie really arouses that emotion. It is remarkable that he is truly the only person to whom a tender dialogue has been established with his family. Nobody is allowed to become a character even vaguely human. <br /> <br /> I do not even like golf, but over the course of the film, I really found myself rooted for Robart Stack and the guys at the club, really hoping they would beat Mason and Chevy Chase.
