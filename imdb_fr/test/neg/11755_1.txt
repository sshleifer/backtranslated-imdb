I know that curiosity killed the cat, but I just had to see the remake of Psycho, especially after recently making such a trip to Hitchcok and know his job. I saw the original movie Psycho although since I was a child, I knew to respect it and not only that, it was an excellent film! One of the best, actually! The first thing I said when I heard about the remake was "How do you redo perfection?" I stayed at that too, but I think I have a more open mind now and thought it might be a way to introduce Psycho to a new generation. <br /> <br /> But that turned into a total insult and a slap. the face of the original Psycho. I know that it was said, but I watched the filming of this film and the director said "Oh, I just want to update it and film each scene taken as the original" ... what's the problem ? ! Okay, but I want to judge this film alone, despite the insulting blows of the original. I mean, the acting was not up to par, but honestly, it looked like the actors were just watching the original and just memorizing the aftershocks from there and making it their own stupidity . <br /> <br /> this movie, I wanted to slap Anne Hasche, she said "I've never seen the original, I just wanted to work with Gus." Ooh, that made me angry, because frankly, it's not just that, she really sucked in this role as Marian, she was not convincing, not to say that her scene of Shower was really horrible. Vince Vaughn did not ... just say that the movie was horribly ill prepared. It was a sin against the film and alone, it was actually a bad movie. It was too much and destroyed what could have been a new introduction for a new generation. But for Gus, quit the movie to do the one who KNOWS WHAT HE DOES! <br /> <br /> 1/10
