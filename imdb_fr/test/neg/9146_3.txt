A tedious effort on the part of the director Budd Boetticher and the beautiful actress Nina Foch, but not devoid of blandness, this film is, as one of the other critics indicates, a quintessence of a certain type of film series. B. This is just not the right kind. And a promising premise and an overactive fog machine are wasted. <br /> <br /> Basic plot - Nina, a nurse on war leave because of her nerves, has a nightmare. She meets a dashing man at the resort where she breathes a little and realizes that he is in the dream, even if she has never met him before. Meanwhile, it turns out that our dashing man is working as a spy and is about to leave for an additional secret mission that must not fail. <br /> <br /> Of course, there are Nazis. And holes of intrigue. And intelligent people acting in the way most likely to bring them to scratch totally useless, so that the race time can stretch beyond one hour. In the end, the film becomes a competition between which groups of spies can act more stupidly. If the FBI and the OSS had acted like this crew, we would have lost the war in 1942. <br /> <br /> The film itself is turned quite flat (despite the best efforts of the fog machine) and the game of actors - as it seems to be the case in many British Columbia hotels, which TCM has shown recently - is oddly uncommitted. It is less stylized than what might be found in a similar budget Warner Bros. movie, but also less fun to watch. <br /> <br /> The strength of Boetticher is of course a rather factual style that allows acting in his westerns Randolph Scott to come to the fore. The problem here may be that such a style will not work if the screenplay is ugly and the actors get tired of their five-movie schedule a year.
