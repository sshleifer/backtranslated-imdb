... If only Disney had stayed away. See, I think this film has some potential. Well, at least the situation of the main character. Remove all the stuff from Jordan Cahill, and you have the beginnings of a decent movie! Of course, you also lose more than half of the film, but hey. Not that bad. <br /> <br /> So here you go: you take a typical teenager from the very preppy suburbs (Danielle Panabaker, who is actually a decent actress) and whose best friends often shout Jordan Cahill (I guess that's a direct quote from the film, this film almost always involves this particular phrase). Except, of course, TPSTG wants more of life. Enter the character of Brenda Song, a sophisticated person who exactly meets the needs of TPSTG (honestly, I do not care about the real name of the character, I like the acronym better). The two new friends are going to see Jordan Cahill (one to drool, one to make fun of drool), and they come out with his mobile phone. Hijinks ensues and everything goes well at the end. <br /> <br /> If only Disney, or any big movie studio, did not have such a bad opinion of 8 to 14 years old. Or maybe if the 8 to 14 year olds were expecting more movies for them. It's a sugar shit like this that makes me more sure of not knowing who to be more disgusted (a little movie called 'High School Musical' comes to mind ...)
