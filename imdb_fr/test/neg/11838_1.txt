This film does not even deserve a 1/10. This film was a scam. <br /> <br /> I swear that at least 30 minutes of the film were copied DELIBERATELY from Carnosaur 1, 2, and 3.The entire movie "Raptor" was based on the film and it was really a pathetic attempt to be a copy of "Thriller, Action Packed, Dinosaur". I loved this movie series and seeing it appear in a film that can not afford or want to copy it without making its own models is what America is becoming. and you'll know what I mean. <br /> <br /> - Spencer
