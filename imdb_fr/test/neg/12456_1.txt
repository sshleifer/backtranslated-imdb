I will not even waste more time describing how bad this movie is. Bottom line: it was horribly done, there were huge holes in the plot and it went absolutely nowhere. The only good thing about this is the description that my digital cable gave for the movie: "A married man whose business is in trouble has an affair with his secretary." Huh? Bad movie apparently, although it could have made things a little more interesting if one of the descriptions was true. <br /> <br /> --Shelly
