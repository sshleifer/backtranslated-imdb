For an independent film, it's probably a little better than a 3 out of 10, but in general, it only gives a 3. The effects are not horrible and at least some adults play adult roles rather than than all children. Horrors movies at low budget indy do. The acting is very wooden, but at least they had a better "display" than some movies in the category of the leanest budgets. It's filmed a lot inside a building rather than in a friend's basement. The plot as a whole is not the worst. It's Resident Evil's fault about an evil society invading a small town and an epidemic turning people into zombies. I would have liked to see some kind of creature rather than the big bad guy being just another "super" zombie. I try not to write spoilers but this review has one so be forewarned !! ALERT SPOIL !!! Some actors do not just seem to shrug their shoulders in front of zombies (the same are recycled again and again, but at least they have more than 5 people playing them). But one of the plot twists does not really fly with me. The member who comes in is proving to be on the payroll of the evil corporations. He coldly kills one of the other employees and then meets the chief villain in an office to talk about cleaning the mess. The member has just shown us that he is also a very bad person and speaks as if he could clean him up (that is, kill all surviving witnesses) without any problem. But 2 seconds later, he helps them. There was no real emotion of "change of heart" or anything that gives me the impression that this villain is killing an innocent guy a few minutes ago and then it's all about 'take everyone away from his savior. There was no incident or anything that made me buy that. It is worth watching if you are a fan of low budget movies, otherwise you will not enjoy it.
