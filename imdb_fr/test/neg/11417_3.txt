To put it simply, it was a pompous poopie canine. Too scenic and everyone is the total queen of the melodramatic drama at every moment. After a while, I began to wish that all the characters of the film were not so remanent. <br /> <br /> And this movie has another of those really boring things recently arrived in fashion and should not have: all the scenes are in a kind of faded gray-steel. Hmmm, the last time I checked, candles and torches are quite capable of putting a pretty wide spectrum of colors. In fact, the light they emit tends to be more in the warm, orange-yellow range of the spectrum. So where does all the blue-steel-gray light come from? <br /> <br /> This movie features whimsical decors and fictional CGI effects, but it's still awful. It's a pathetic junk food for today's moviegoers who are easily satiated by this pathetic junk food. <br /> <br /> I really like vampires and werewolves as movie devices, but it was a total hack job. <br /> <br /> "The Wolfman" of Universal Studios in 1941 is infinitely superior to that even though its fx effect is quite primitive compared to what could be done nowadays. <br /> <br /> I'm done with this franchise. The first movie was reasonably correct. The second is a bit entertaining. But this one, I could not even finish until the end because it was so boring.
