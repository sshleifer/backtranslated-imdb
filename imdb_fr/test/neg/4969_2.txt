I finished looking at Mandy Lane about an hour ago and felt the need to go home and come here to warn anyone who is about to spend money on the DVD - DO IT NOT. <br /> <br /> The secondary characters are Shallow, the failure of the act is more serious than that of Matthew McConaughey and until the end, the plot is anything but obvious. On nine out of ten, you can see the next scene arrive 5 minutes before the start. The whole movie is more or less without motive or message, and the half-way revelation of "the killer" completely kills the little interest you could have left at that time. What could have saved this superficial and tedious film is a decent splash, or at least worthy of the genre "Slasher" - It also fails. <br /> <br /> If you need a background movie for an evening you can come and go without missing anything, I recommend you to buy Mandy Lane from All The Boys Love. <br /> <br /> If you want to sit and focus your eyes on the screen for more than 15 seconds, I do not.
