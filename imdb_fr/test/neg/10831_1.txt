When I first saw this film, I was literally rolling on the floor laughing (especially when they were chased by the water, and when the guy crossed the peoples' gardens, I want to say that it would hurt to go around the clothesline?) effects! this film clearly had no big budget. or so the guy left his child in charge of the checks. the water that came out was like a close-up of a beer can that had collapsed. what did the actors think? did they really believe it was a good movie? or did they really need this money? not that they would have won a lot. When I saw this for the first time, I was like, "God, how old is he?" When I watched the news about it and saw that it had been done in 2003, I thought my TV was broken. <br /> <br /> it's really a disaster movie, for more than one reason.
