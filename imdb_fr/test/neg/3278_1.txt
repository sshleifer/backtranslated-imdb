1 Bolo Yeung is in the film ten minutes total, including when serving cold drinks to his boss. 2 many street thugs who look like case keepers are instantly mastered by the Asian superhero who speaks like a clandestine alien on the back of a manure truck. 3 (thug) let me do that - shirt, gay model like muscles - heee-haaw! hee-heeew! hap hap! - He died on the floor with his neck, elbow, chin or broken balls - 4 half-price sex scenes where the broad white comes out of nowhere digs the Asian superhero. 5 Norton (former action star C) only pretends to be an eccentric and fashionable arms smuggler who treats white slutty, hand-picked girls in a nightclub where they happily follow an idiot pretending to be a millionaire (you harvest what you sow) 6 yes, the local police captain is involved and, yes, the first murdered policeman is the former teammate of the super-hero patrol (yaawn!). 7 The action scenes are wrong, like A) hee-haw! The Chinese try a spinning kick B) a lean Chinese leg in the throat of a thug C) ending his death, his head looks like him too, like the false guard Walker Texas 8 final actions finally <br /> <br /> huge garbage. These people are good enough to just double their roles or double their bodies in other C movies and be collectively awarded the highest number of "stunt men provided by the county jail".
