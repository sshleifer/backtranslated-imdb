As you watch the filming of this DVD - they tell you what you are trying to do here - they tell the biblical story of good versus evil again and try to preach it in front of a main movie audience. In a modern society such as ours, this is where the film fails. There are far too many sheep described in this movie. People are too empowered for this type of preaching today. <br /> <br /> In terms of interpretation, direction and technical functions, they are completed correctly. Chuck Norris is actually acceptable as an angel because the unpredictable appearance of Norris as an angel is no more absurd than Tommy Smothers was in the 1960s.
