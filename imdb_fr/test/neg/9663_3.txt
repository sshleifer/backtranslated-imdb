I admit - I was attracted by the hype - and I did not stop to look at the sources. "One of the best films of independence of the year (1999)", shocking "and" a must ". <br /> <br /> Well, I wasted my money, but everything was not bad in this movie, they have at least understood the gore, as well as some of the most unique murder methods seen in a long time.There is even a scenario (a bit) and that's about all. <br /> <br /> But for an exploitation film there is a surprising amount of content - but no exploitation We have gay sex - in a way We have 3 interracial girls - maybe We have a prostitute Vietnamese psychotic - a beautiful oral sex and a feminine version of Gene Simmons (I do not understand this part) We have an honest kindness, Capone, who is among the best actors of this film, it is not a compliment. Finally, a government conspiracy has been launched in - I do not know - try to link the revenge / random / theme murder by Jimmy boy for the Vietnamese psycho seems sane ??????? If nothing else, this film proves that Americans do not have a lock on this type of film. Latinos can do shit as well as others. Congratulations to anyone who is involved in this feat that has overcome and made a career.
