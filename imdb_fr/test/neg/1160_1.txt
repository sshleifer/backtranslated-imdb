Please people! Do not bother with this misguided joke. The management was totally wrong from the start. Where is the story of her mothers' emotional interference and general madness in the family of origin? Why is ED described as that great imposing character, full of anger and hatred? What is this shit? The writer and director obviously did not research history and simply wanted to take advantage of the famous Gein name. The fools who made this movie took so many liberties with the truth, it's ridiculous. If you want to see a brilliant film of Gein. Return to the minor classic "Deranged" to see how Ed really was. There is humor in this film, and Ed is described as a lighthearted, sad and lonely man, according to HISTORY. Where is the background story here? There are just poorly organized shocks (which are not shocking) that we have seen before, and more accomplished too. Take the worst scam of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre and add it to this list. It had to be given one in ten because the evaluation would not accept ZERO. I want my money back. If anyone considers this film "stunning", they may be backhanded.
