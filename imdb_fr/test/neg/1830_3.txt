Finally had to see this movie last weekend. What a disappointment ... it barely reaches the level "made for television". Given the list of actors, I would have expected something much more sophisticated. The film lacks a good story, well, in fact, no story in this regard. It has no credibility, but a lot of predictability. Save money and time.
