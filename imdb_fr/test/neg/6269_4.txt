It's amazing that there were two films with the same story released in 2005. It came out one day before the one with Tom Cruise. Did not they do that with Truman Capote the same year and the Zodiac killer last year? Interesting. <br /> <br /> Writer / director David Michael Latt did not have Steven Spielberg's budget and C. Thomas Howell is not Tom Cruise. This is a pale blockbuster imitation that has brought in $ 588 million worldwide. <br /> <br /> The action was minimal and most of the time, we had the complaint of Rhett Giles, who played the role of a pastor who abandoned his god. <br /> <br /> Gary Busey was scary like an LT army.
