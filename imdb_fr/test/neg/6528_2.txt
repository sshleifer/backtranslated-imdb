.... and now I'm at episode 7. I was really hoping it would be over now (not to mention the cancellation, once everything related to the show - including the actors - had been cast with toxic waste in the middle of the ocean somewhere, never to be seen again), because this series is really terrible. <br /> <br /> Placing this program in the category "comedy" is at best misleading! It's so hard to believe that Ben Elton could write something so bad. This may underline much of the contribution of other writers in everything with which he was connected before. In some episodes, I did not even laugh once! <br /> <br /> Oh, and I can not believe that Ardal O'Hanlon actually stopped doing "My Hero" and started doing it instead, his decision-making skills were obviously impaired that day - maybe he just does not know how to read and does not realize how poor the "Blessed" scripts are. Understand that my hero is not a masterpiece, but it's a million times better than this piece of junk. <br /> <br /> And to annoy me even more, I bet the DVD will come out as Well, when there are so many big TV series that do not go out!
