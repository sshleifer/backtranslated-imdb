It's really one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. Rod Steiger, who plays Charlie, his ornate grandfather, hopes that the brighter he is, the better his performance will be (his Cue Buzzer). Rod Steiger is one of the last legends of cinema and seeing it in this movie (although End of Days is the second worst film I've ever seen) is really heartbreaking. From the bad story to the nonexistent direction, it is clear that the only reason this film was shot is that the producer's last name ended at DeLaurentis. The only good thing about this movie is that it's so bad, it's really hysterical. Look for the flashback scene where Rod found a Superman Jor-El wig and a big black mustache. We only hope that his film in succession, I Believe in America, from Uber producer Kevin Arbouet, will buy it and leave a good taste in everyone's mouth.
