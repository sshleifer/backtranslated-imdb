As many have detailed here with a level of seriousness that I find amusing, it's * not *: <br /> <br /> A FILM. (cue drama) <br /> <br /> It's so bad, it's good, totally surreal, Jackie Chan stunt man for all. The fighters are totally bouncy and Jackie is definitely put in its place. <br /> <br /> This is the movie you want to see with good friends on a Sunday afternoon - surrounded by snack foods, ready to roar with laughter, cheer up the good guys, boo the bad guys and shout ceaselessly, "WHAT?" when something totally weird happens. Very funny !!
