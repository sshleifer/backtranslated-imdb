I can not seem to find the words to express how much I thought this movie was. The initial precept was promising, but in all respects later, it was totally awful. Let's go over the main points. Terrain - good initial idea but really terrible development. There were a lot of points when I thought "no, nobody would do something so stupid". The end was incredibly anti-climatic. Characterization - all the characters were completely bland or grotesque caricatures. I keep trying to think of someone who was not - maybe the mother, but that's all. Music - intrusive, inappropriate and generally terrible. Direction - totally amateurish. Cinematography - doubt they have heard of it. Camera angles / stability / zoom levels often very bad. I am totally disconcerted by the quality of this film. It's the worst film I've seen in movies for years, if ever.
