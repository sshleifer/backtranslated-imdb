You know those movies so incredibly bad that you have to laugh? The half-breeds were not one of them. Which sounds good, right? But no, it's not. This is not a bad attempt at a horror movie that is fun to watch because it's lame or badly played, or it has bad effects or anything like that. No, half-breeds are just boring. They do not even try to scare before the last 20 minutes. These are just children running in the African bush country and getting their foot in elephant dung for the first 75% of the movie, and it's not even funny. The last 20 minutes, however, are HILARIOUS. I have no idea what happened, but it was really fun to see this CGI leopard tearing the throats of all those white men I could not see anyway. If you're in the mood for a bad horror movie, do not rent this one because you'll go to bed before you start having fun. If you accidentally rent this movie, I recommend you fast forward to the end and skip any scene in the light of day. You will not miss anything. You will not know which character is what or exactly what happens even if you look at the whole story in the background.
