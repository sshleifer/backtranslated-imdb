What a mess - and I'm not talking about "destruction" in the title. I could talk about the hackneyed conspiracy, the unpleasant effects, the (remarkable) grimacing actors as they deliver the worst lines of their careers, etc. I'll just say there were no palm trees in Chicago the last time I checked, and stay there. <br /> <br /> Hmmm ... it takes ten lines for this to be published on IMDb .. OK, well, I think a DVD with outputs could be interesting. Maybe Dennehy will reveal what favor was called for him to appear in this case. Maybe Dianne Weist will show us the bag of money she had to take to get him involved. Maybe the leaders of CBS will apologize ...
