I saw this movie yesterday and found it awful. it was useless and just stupid. the alleged conspiracy involved a future husband who was too involved in the world's problems to establish a link with his fianc√©e and the other people in his life. He disappears on his wedding day (in a tuxedo no less) and associates himself with an assortment of crazies. <br /> <br /> We saw him with a bunch of people heading to Atlantic City and everyone agreed. that it was a terrible movie. He was trying to be deep but it was not; it was stupid and offensive. If I was not on a bus, I would have left the film. Anyone considering viewing the movie or renting or buying the video you have been warned.
