Dean Cain, the super-man once, plays Max Hooper the super-thief. He can penetrate any business and steal anything at the right price. Unfortunately, his latest hold-up ends him in a tower in which someone else set fire to hiding his own attempts to steal the product. Now, the thief is forced to be the hero saving everyone in the building. Unfortunately, the other thief is still in the building and the F.B.I. & C.I.A. are outside waiting for Max. <br /> <br /> The film is barely passable. Dean Cain is a fun actor who has done a lot better with improved material, but he is struggling with a weak scenario and a rather mediocre direction.
