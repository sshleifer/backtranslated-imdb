If you're a fan of the original series, do NOT watch this movie. <br /> <br /> I should have been skeptical about the insights when Aeon was expressing his motives for murder. In the series, Aeon had no family and no motive for his adventures saves selfish interests. It is obvious that the chimpanzee leader felt that the film should satisfy the demographic of the "bad guys" by making the character deadly, while having a good reason to kill people. <br /> <br /> You would not have thought it possible, but the film is more two-dimensional than the cartoon. The characters are all described as intrinsically good with some conflicts of interest that eventually get resolved. All dogs go to heaven, and the same goes for all the characters who die in this movie. <br /> <br /> The selfish, twisted, perverse and dominant characters of Aeon and Trevor are untraceable. In the end, they literally grow to form a lovely couple, like Annie Hall. The only character who stays true to the series is the Relicle, the floating machine in the sky. I guess if you've ever thought "well, I like Aeon Flux, but I'd like it to look more like every other hilarious sci-fi Hollywood-free movie," then you're expected for a treat. <br /> <br /> They did not even have the right look. I guess a black metal bikini was too hard to ask, but the whole thing is wrong. 400 years into the future, it certainly looks like 30 years in the past. Instead of a resolutely urban post-apocalyptic world, the viewer's eyes are offended by a sixties frutopia of egg-shaped furniture, paneled walls, earth tones and many plants. Bregna was a dystopia, not a utopia. <br /> <br /> Speaking of Bregna, it's the only city in the world after the movie. The show is clear that there are two cities, Bregna and Monica, which were one. In the film, the "Monicans" are only fighters of the freedom of fairy tales in Hollywood. They also have as much technology as the Bregnans, which is not the case of the series. <br /> <br /> The only possible conclusion is that the real screenwriter of this film was a high school student and he wrote it. the day before, it was due to the studio directors, and he never saw a full stream of Aeon. The inconsistent amount of inconsistencies in the drawing is disconcerting. Beyond the use of certain names such as Aon Flux, Trevor Goodchild and Bregna, the film has nothing to do with the show. the blade runner, the Logan race and the raider tomb, which came out of a dull brown mess.
