Snake Island is one of those films that, while watching its incredible stupidity, make people regret that the camera was never invented. The real reason why Plan 9 From Outer Space will retain its Worst Film Of All Time honored title for a while is not so much because of its seriousness. That's because it's the most entertaining bad movie you can see. Snake Island is the other type of bad. Snake Island is so terrible that it is atrocious. A stupid premise combines with a script written by monkeys that type one-touch typewriters over overlapping transparencies to resemble dialogue and create the most obvious problems here. Filmed entirely in South Africa, the environments in which the film unfolds are pretty much the only thing that can truly be considered well done. Many snake shots consist of close-ups that look so surreal that one begins to wonder if these snakes are computer-generated images, puppets or real snakes that have been fed very harsh drugs . <br /> <br /> The stars of William Katt, if you can call it that, as an author traveling to an island on what appears to be a ferry. Coming with him is an assortment of very generic and ill-defined characters. Everything is a matter of random screenwriting to determine who will survive until the end, but Katt certainly seems to consider returning his agent. The rest of the cast seems to belong to Home And Away Theater School, where contemplation of an unpleasant plot point is accompanied by gaping and open eyes in every direction. The special effects are often worse, with a memorable scene in which a double-barreled shotgun resembles the rather flat sound effects that accompanied gunshots in games such as BioForge. During this time, the snakes continually explode or jump at random. It would have been more accurate to call the movie Snake Holocaust. <br /> <br /> Of course, no Z-rated horror or science fiction movie is complete without free scenes of nubile women undressed. As every woman in the casting almost undresses, the movie starts to become less Snake Island and more Snake Island Orgy. But as for all the worst batteries, all that is really in this case is a lot of installation, without real profit. The sex scenes never evolve and the death of the characters is so flat, so uninteresting that the whole movie becomes useless. Unless you plan to watch William Katt run through a sweltering forest with ill-fitting cricket gear and crushing snakes in all directions with a cricket bat, a reward. For the record, I do not do it. I thought Anaconda was the worst film ever made on predatory snakes. I was so very very wrong. At least Anaconda had a snake that we could be afraid of if they were suspending disbelief for a long time. Some of the shown snakes that kill the human cast are not bigger than the laces of some of the pairs of combat boots I've worn. <br /> <br /> So we have so far the checklist for bad horror movies. The lame and unrecognizable actors are taken into account, as are the mediocre sound and visual effects. The dialogue is so miserable, so untimely, that I've seen better writing and interpretation in some plays at school where I played in many moons before. Unfortunately, where Snake Island falters, this is the most fatal area to all bad movies. Essentially, he forgets to be so bad that it's funny. It's so bad that it stops being good after the opening credits and becomes painful as soon as the cast starts to speak. Compared to William Katt's performance at Snake Island, Jon Voight's performance at Anaconda was as Oscar-worthy as Russell Crowe's performance in Gladiator. Not that Voight or Katt are necessarily bad actors, but with a material like this, you have a hard time saying one word naturally. By listening to certain lines, you feel as if you are the victim of a violent crime. The mind tends to erase the experience, whether it is mainly a self-defense mechanism. <br /> <br /> Because of the aforementioned failure to be bad in an entertaining way, I gave Snake Island two out of ten. My special score for movies that are so bad that they can not be good, but not bad enough to entertain. All this is so boring or useless that one could just as easily look at the test pattern. The right way to spell "shit" is S-N-A-K-E-I-S-L-A-N-D.
