I was deeply disappointed by this film. Twice, I was tempted to go out because some segments of the movie were so demoralizing and depressing. The film contains elements that hint at all the bad things in life (pornography, murder, suicide, fornication, hatred, gang warfare). The graphic nature of the violence in this film was particularly disturbing. <br /> <br /> And Richard Dutcher does great harm to the LDS Church by describing missionary attitudes, commitment, spirituality and obedience as non-focused and non-conformist. <BR/> <br /> My biggest objection to this film, however, was that it was the opposite of the film of well-being. <br /> <br /> Dutcher's army of God was acceptable. His Brigham City was pretty good. This film, in terms of casting, theater and theater was his best. But to be inspiring or uplifting, it was as horrible as possible. In fact, this film demoralized me so much that I'm sorry I went there. I lost interest in supporting Dutcher in an SDL themed movie with a ticket purchase.
