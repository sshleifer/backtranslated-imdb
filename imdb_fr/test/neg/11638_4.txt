Made with films left by Nana's production, On a Charleston Tune of 1927 is described as a vacation movie intended for all concerned, and this is the best way to see it. Jean Renoir seems to have never thought enough to even edit the footage together. The plot is a simple reversal of racial stereotypes ?? in 2028, a black explorer goes to a post-holocaust Paris where a white girl teaches him Charleston (he naturally assumes that it is a savage whose dance is a prelude to his eats before yielding to the tempting rhythm of music 'White Aborigen'). There are many surrealist touches, be it the gorilla that eats the flowers in Catherine Hessling's hair, the angels that the girl phones (Renoir and the producer Pierre Braunberger) or the fact that the black performer Johnny Huggins plays his role in the blackface minstrel while Hessling the dance ability is almost completely nonexistent, and there are some interesting casual experiences with the slow motion, but there is not enough to keep it for two reels. An extra air of surrealism is provided by the fact that this dumb musical has absolutely no score on the new Lions Gate DVD ??
