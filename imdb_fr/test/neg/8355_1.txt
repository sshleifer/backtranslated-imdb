This film is as bad as "The Birdman of Alcatraz". I am not referring to acting, but rather to the principle of the two films, which attempt to portray psychopathic criminals as heroic figures. Moreover, it bothers me when respected actors such as Alan Alda (and Burt Lancaster) respected play this role, because their status tends to give credence to the director's intention to place the subject of the film in parody of society. > I was in college during the last years of Caryl Chessman's life and his appeals about the death penalty and his books were very timely. I remember the wave of opinion that the death penalty was a mistake and that Chessman was the victim. <br /> <br /> Catch people. Read the story. Chessman was a criminal and sexual predator. At night, he furrowed the streets of Los Angeles with a police light stolen from his vehicle. He stopped cars with attractive women inside on the pretext of making an arrest of the traffic; then kidnapped and raped women. Rape is the worst trauma a woman can experience and many victims say they prefer death to horror and humiliation. <br /> <br /> Chessman got exactly what he deserved, it took a decade too much. No sympathy for the devil here.
