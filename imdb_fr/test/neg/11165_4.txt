I recently found this film on one of my husband's VHS tapes (the blank variety he uses to record TV content). The film seems to have been shown for the last time in the 80s and I do not remember seeing it since. It has not (to my knowledge) been published on DVD or VHS, but I'm going to get a copy. <br /> <br /> The film tells the story of three young people: two girls, one at the edge of puberty. and the other much younger, and a young boy who is going to live with their mother's brother and his dumb Irish young wife. His wife also has two brothers who live with them. The children's uncle is a controlling maniac who forces his young wife to wear a silver necklace while she watches a puppet show ridden by him and his brothers in his toy store. <br /> <br /> The eldest daughter and one of the Irish (the youngest) develop a love for each other while living in the same house. The girl helps her aunt in the shop while her brother helps his uncle to make objects in the workshop. <br /> <br /> The film contains many troubling elements. There is the treatment of his wife by the uncle as a kind of idiotic possession (illustrated by the necklace) while the Irish engage in dance, alcohol and a somewhat forbidden love. It is interesting to note that I have seen much more explicit themes in other movies shot in Hollywood today. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, even if it is not a film for children, it contains many fun and magical moments and the one that the Irish makes beautiful paintings.
