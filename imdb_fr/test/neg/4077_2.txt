I want to say that I went to this movie with my expectations far too high. I thought it was going to be funny because it was the sequel to Bruce Almighty who was really funny and starring Steve Carell who is an excellent comedy actor, but the boy was bad. <br /> <br /> The movie is advertised as a sequel but it really has nothing to do with the original since the only people who take over their roles are Morgan Freeman and Steve Carell but Steve's character is completely different, he is no longer the idiot he was in the first, he's a nice guy. The story is different, the actors are different and it's not funny. <br /> <br /> All the actors involved (Steve Carell, Morgan Freeman, Wanda Sykes, John Goodman, Ed Helms and even Jon Stewart in a crappy cameo) have talent but none of them seems to be use and it seems that the film is just for the price. <br /> <br /> Now the plot is clearly inspired by Noah's story, but there are so many wrong things in the movie, I do not know where to start. I guess the big problem is that everyone around Evan thinks he's crazy despite everything that happens to him, he grows a huge white beard in two days, he gets help from animals around the world, he builds a giant bow in a few weeks, in real life, people would not make fun of that guy after that, they would say he is the new Noah. <br /> <br /> The special effects are good, but God! is the greatest film flood ever filmed in Evan Almighty? Should they really waste such good special effects as a filler for this shitty movie. <br /> <br /> Jim Carrey seems to be a clever guy, since he has stayed away from three of the worst sequels ever, Son of the Mask, dumb and fool, and now Evan the Almighty. <br /> <br /> It was a huge disappointment and Tom Shyadac should be ashamed of himself.
