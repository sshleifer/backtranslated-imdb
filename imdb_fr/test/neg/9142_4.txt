What a desappointment! I liked Jon Cleary's books about Scobie Malone, but there is little resemblance between him and Malone, a movie film. In the books, he is a city detective, who devotes himself to his wife and does not get involved with punches. For the film, the character was spiced up, in a hinterland copper who uses his fists and is not afraid to throw himself into the bed with a gorgeous girl, although what she and her other sexual interest see in him, I do not know. ; Taylor was 39 years old and her face was puffy. <br /> <br /> But the stamina of his character is remarkable; he arrives from Australia by plane, seems to go directly to the Commissioner (looking rather to stop him during a reception in black tights), saves him from the assassination (fights in the process), goes to the casino with a girl , leave with another and take him to bed. That's the time difference! On the way back to the Commissioner (showing a good knowledge of the streets of London), he is beaten by the bad guys, but he is always the first to lunch! It is also remarkable that the Commissioner's limousine has its windshield and headlights repaired miraculously a few minutes after the assassination attempt and that a character has a touching faith in the precise timing of a clock-activated bomb. <br /> <br /> is the disdain of Joseph the butler for Malone. And at least, the film avoids being a travelogue to London, although some scenes take place during the Wimbledon tennis week.
