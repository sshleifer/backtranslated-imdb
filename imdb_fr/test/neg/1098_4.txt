This movie is very similar to all other modern horror movies. It is predictable in the way it builds and progresses and never succeeds in bringing anything original or shocking to the screen. This is really the biggest disappointment of the film: overall, its main concept was promising. <br /> <br /> You can call this movie a great shot of modern horror film and traveling. It contains all the elements that make modern horror movies often not very good to watch. One of these is a little child who is moaning and very naive. Why do they keep putting that stuff in the movies? The same goes for dramatic aspects involving the family. It just does not work for the film and is far from interesting or effective. Instead, it often slides the movie into parts and makes it boring to watch. <br /> <br /> Thus, all snapshots are present, but they also fail to display these snapshots on the screen. As a horror movie, it's just a very poor thing. He does not handle his horror or tension very well. For fans of the genre, there is very little to appreciate. The movie's story is not too well connected and built into the movie. Too often, the movie sleeps in places and never lets its horror fully trigger. <br /> <br /> The film is also often too dark (probably to try to hide its budget rather low) and it also shows very little gore, especially because you simply can not always see things so good. <br /> <br /> You can see by watching this film that the director JS Cardone does not have much talent for the genre and does not know how to properly manage his current ingredients. He made some attempts in the past but all his films have failed so far. he continues to try unfortunately. Who knows, maybe with the right people behind the camera (like Tobe Hooper, who was initially attached to the direct realization), this film could have been something decent. <br /> <br /> It's a badly shot movie, with mostly big strangers in it. The most important name in the movie is Ben Cross, but his role is just too small and not relevant enough for the film and its story. He did not even seem to have much fun playing. <br /> <br /> Just ignore it. <br /> <br /> 4/10
