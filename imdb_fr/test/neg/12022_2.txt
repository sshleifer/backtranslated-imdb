I'm going out to fight here because this film was so well shot and shot that I'm twice as angry about its de-evolution as I would have been with less work. Without revealing the plot too much, I can only say that the first part of my set of 2 VHS was a disturbing and unpleasant pleasure from bizarre but plausible plot developments. The main character looked like a naive, but he was also intelligent and very open. The events with which he is quickly forced to contend are the separation of his parents, the culture shock when his Pakistani roots collide with a complete collapse of English society stuck in the 60s, the dubious transformation of his father into the venerable Buddha of Suburbia, and the transformation of her cousin into a feminist activist while her best friend suddenly became an icon of the booming punk movement in the seventies. Among other things. <br /> <br /> What made me so angry is the amount of detailed work that each actor has devoted to the creation and establishment of their characters in the first part, so that all this turns into very bad porn episodes the second part, far too much to justify the development of the plot, and much too explicit to appear even erotic. My biggest pet peeve is when the filmmakers let their personal fetishes intrude on the truth of their film. This is for me a supreme example. <br /> <br /> I felt like I was invited to a party of very intelligent and funny aliens, but the doors are not locked and the guests are not allowed to interact, and we are all forced to watch bad movies of seventy sexual exploitation instead. What an insult to the hard work of these incredible actors! Why not just make a cheeseball movie to start? And why throw a big main character who can actually play, then cut him every time he gets ready for a great performance? I felt almost as if he too was tired of endless sex scenes where all he was doing was lying there, pumping his pelvis for another naked and breathing actress. <br /> <br /> Conclusion - The first part is a minor genius, the second part is the perversion of second serial. I know that the book is quite explicit, but I felt that these great actors were exploited in real life like their characters in the movie, and that made me pretty angry and very uncomfortable. Only John Waters can achieve such a dubious degradation of actors and conspiracies and make it seem artistic. My suggestion is to only look at the first part, to throw the second into the proverbial garbage pile and you will love the Buddha forever. Score A + F = 0
