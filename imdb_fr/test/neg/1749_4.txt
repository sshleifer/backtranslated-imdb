I liked most of this movie. As other reviewers have mentioned, the scenario is quite interesting. Overall, it's fun to watch. <br /> <br /> But the end, I think, is completely sloppy, it left me perplexed. Yes, do you expect people to cross and cross each other twice in this kind of film, but in four-way? Well, if the plot warrants it, why not? <br /> <br /> But it's the wrong part, it's absolutely not necessary. After a certain point, everything is conspicuous without any meaning. (here is the spoiler). After the airport scene, Enrico and his accomplices already have the money. I could not understand the need for the rest of the scam. Is it necessary to rub his nose to Federico because he got himself? I do not buy it. <br /> <br /> So 6 out of 10 for 3/4 of the film and 2 out of 10 for the end.
