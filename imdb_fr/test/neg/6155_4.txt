Combine good casting, bad writing, good orchestral notation, bad dialogue and good story idea with lots of potential but never realizing then you have Slipstream. <br /> <br /> Just buy the movie for a dollar, it's worth it, but not much more. <br /> <br /> It's good to see Mark Hamill act again. <br /> <br /> There should be a decent sequel made to remedy the damage of the original. Or at least pay him the proper attention he should have received in the first place. <br /> <br /> Berstein's score demanded your attention as early as the opening credits, however, the long shots of drifting planes and the even longer revelation of interesting plot points obscure his attention. <br /> <br /> It's really easy to play with a movie like this, after all, it's the producer of STARWARS and the director of TRON and an impressive cast, but that's what he is. And it's not a lot. <br /> <br /> Favorite Line- "We'll get there, ah ah! ... (BOOM!)"
