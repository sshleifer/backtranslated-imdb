There is no way to say with words how much these Vice Academy films are really formless, without peace and without laughter. You must experience one by yourself. For the third time in a row, writer-director Rick Sloane does not even show an ounce of writing or talent. There is nothing here that a person over the age of 5 can believe or laugh, but (very brief) nudity and other "intrigue" elements make movies inappropriate for children. Which leads me to believe that they are really intended for adults with the mental abilities of 5 year olds. Elizabeth Kaitan replaces Linnea Quigley - she is wonderfully bubbly and cute, and her beautiful big smile is pretty much the only thing that can make the viewer smile. But watching her and the other girls in this movie is like watching a bouquet of flowers in a desert covered with horse manure. (*)
