This is perhaps the worst remake ever produced by Hollywood, and that says a lot. I will go further than that and say that this movie is so breathtaking, so deliriously bad that it MUST BE SEEN. I do not know if I can even solve all the problems, like the fact that the casting director seems to have pulled the names of a hat, or that the character of Richard Gere can give free rein to his mind. do not be afraid at the end (I'm sure people who say, "It's just fiction, we do not care") would not have a problem if it was a former Al Qaeda operative who only wanted to return to his home country) - so I'm just going to devote my comment to absolute hilarity, which is mainly the scene where Bruce Willis tests his weapon. <br /> <br /> In the original version, you will remember, the jackal practices his death on a pumpkin. The pumpkin explodes on impact, an effect known as "euphemism". In this version, Willis sets up a pumpkin target, but he does not use a sniper rifle. It uses a huge remote-controlled gun that costs tens of thousands of dollars and can only be stored in the back of a huge visible van. (This man likes challenges). He reveals the barrel by removing a tarpaulin. Jack Black, who is there to watch him, jumps up and says, "Those ROCKS!" That stuff ROCKS! about 18 times (I guess Willis did not have to disassemble it first, he just lifted it, tarpaulin and everything in the back of the van, when it probably weighed several tons). The scene then turns into a Austin Powers movie. Willis misses the pumpkin and leaves a tree, then Black goes in the mud, his pants falling and coming off the whole arm of Black. The pumpkin falls to the ground, unharmed. <br /> <br /> If I can recommend this film for ONE reason alone, this is for the character of Diane Venora, a strong Russian man who forges romantic ties with Gere despite a disfigurement of the face - a gesture bold for a man. Hollywood function. In the middle of the movie, I really liked this character, so it was a shame that she had to be killed. I would have liked to see a movie about her. Other than that, this pile of shit is only useful as an objective intelligence test. 3/10.
