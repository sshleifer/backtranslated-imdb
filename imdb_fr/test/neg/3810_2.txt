I do not understand what the big hype was about this movie. All the horror sites said that this film had most of an "old American slasher" movie that would satisfy your needs. - Even though it looked like an old American movie, my needs were still not satisfied. <br /> <br /> My big problem with this film is that we are now in the 2000s and not in the 1980s. The horror of the 1980s is the past and should stay in the past. Horror movies have changed so much that old movies now look ridiculous and unrealistic. Although they are fun to watch, they do not offer the same realistic coolness as recent movies. <br /> <br /> Hatchet is corny, unrealistic and horrible. If we wanted to watch an old American movie, I can go back to series 13 on Friday the 13th, to the Nightmare on Elm series or the Halloween series. I have to admit that the film is better than some of the horror films released, but that it is one of the worst. The jokes are not funny and the actors are horrible. <br /> <br /> Personally, I would stay away from this film and never look back.
