I was reading in a Stuff magazine some of the bloodiest and bloodiest films that Asia had to offer and I immediately jumped on Netflix to quench my thirst. Boy what mistake I made. This film is one of the worst films I've seen. First and foremost, no plot, what I was expecting from the plot (see: "Revenge") has turned into a series of events that occur in order to spend their budget special effects of $ 14.89 and wasting time in the studio. They should have kept their money and not waste their time or yours. <br /> <br /> When a major turning point in the plot occurs, Tetsuo II: Body Hammer is given a new identity and I did not buy it. A rollback is given that should answer our questions, but I seemed to have turned on Showtime at 3:47 and dropped ACID. The film continues and is unleashed, with nerdy graphics and special effects (Olympic). <br /> <br /> Do I have to look bitter about this movie? Yes. Did I see Iron Man? Was there a plot? Was it so symbolic that I did not understand? NO. Was there a body hammer? Beat the hell of me. So, follow my advice and stay away !!!!!! <br /> <br /> (I must admit I had so much fun writing this and laughing at this movie that if you want to laugh, look at it !!!)
