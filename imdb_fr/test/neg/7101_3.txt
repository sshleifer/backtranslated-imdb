"Tank Girl" was, I suppose, supposed to be the "Buckaroo Banzai" of the 90s and was marketed as such. The comparison is certainly appropriate; Both films have so much going on in each movie setting that, as impossible as the story can be sorted out, it's certainly not boring. <br /> <br /> "Tank Girl" is fun enough if you turn off your brain before the movie starts. Otherwise, you will end up with a migraine like me.
