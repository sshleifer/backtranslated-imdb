This has some of the most stupid fighting scenes of all time. If I were a veteran of a war, I would cry when I watch this movie, not because I will remember being in Vietnam, but because it is a poor representation of any veteran of this war. Even though the troops are wearing M16s, this film is unlike anything in Vietnam. The Viet Cong uniforms look like old Japanese uniforms left behind by a World War II film. The decor is obviously something bad in the back of Hollywood. The most serious scene contains an American soldier who is fighting "in hand-to-hand combat" as in a bad martial arts film. After dispatching several enemy troops, he said, "Hey, come down here and let us kick buttocks!" to a helicopter in the air. He is then shot. This film is a trash.
