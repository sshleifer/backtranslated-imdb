Oh Sex Lives of Potato Men, what demon did you create? It's a movie you watch, smile a little for the duration, and when you talk to others who have seen it, you can not help but smile while talking. But it's not that Sex Lives of the Potato Men is actually a fun movie that makes you smile when talking or thinking about it, it's just that the movie is so weird; is so insulting and not shameless in its attempt to make a sweet laugh to do with sex and sex life in general that you can not help but have your mouth burst into a smile. Remember that what follows the smile is a sag of the head; a consequent jerk of the head and an elevation of the forefinger and thumb on both eyebrows as you rub them gently to try to remember your time looking at this basket. <br /> <br /> But that's what the movie is, it's trash; it is a trash very brave and shameless but a trash anyway. Anyone who has had this idea, wrote it on paper, then circulated in the industry trying to achieve it must be very brave or very desperate. It's strange to have a film that talks about something, but it does not have a decisive story under any circumstances. This stems from the idea that European cinema is essentially artistic and that its stories are ambiguous and open and that themes take precedence over most other things. In Sex Lives of the Potato Men, the same situation and the same joke technically are repeated many times. It's an idea that is: "sex is a very, very funny thing." These ideas may be better suited to an American film. So it's not surprising that after a while of watching, things start to get a little spooky. <br /> <br /> The film begins and ends in the same way, creating a sense of circular travel; a circular route that went nowhere and where nothing has been done. Three types sit around a table and discuss. Their boss joins them and the conversation is limited to all the stories, situations or crude and disgusting scenarios that everyone can think of. The strange thing here is that every time a man says something nasty, the other grimaces, but has a story as dirty to give back, creating a contradiction in what these men find to cross the line and what they do not do. The men are Dave (Vegas) and Ferris (Crook), two people reunited by Tolly (Coleman) whenever the film deems it useful to present a third face to crack naughty sexual jokes or to break strange stories. They are employed by Jeremy (Gattis), a man who has deeper problems but the film seeks to exploit for reasons of humor rather than to study. <br /> <br /> What is the situation in The sexual life of potato men? The three or four men are in crisis and for the duration of the film, we will adopt the role of the unfortunate fly while we attend the delusional game that these people engage in a week or so. If the humor around Dave and Ferris is disgusting and repulsive, then, for Jeremy, things are just phantasmagorical. It all starts innocently and there seems to be a woman he loves and who also loves him in return, but when the essence that Jeremy is a stalker comes in, that's where the jaw falls . Jeremy's character is used and presented in such a way as to make unrequited love and criminal harassment in general simply "fun". Jeremy sits in his apartment, listening to classical music and writing abuse letters to Ruth (Davis), echoing a kind of psychotic character more associated with Hannibal Lecter writing his letter to Clarice in 2001, Hannibal. But whatever sympathy we may have for him at this stage, it is absolutely false when, later, the true origin of their relationship is revealed. Suddenly, as a public, we feel cheated from feeling sorry for ourselves earlier and, for whatever reason, he acted the way he did at first, it just seems cowardly and unpleasant. To say what it was would spoil some surprises in the film. <br /> <br /> Sad enough to see how, in one of Jeremy's letters, he writes about one thing or another excluding him from having "No artistic vision?" just a big bazaar. "I hate when the characters echo the movie they are in. The sex life of the potato Men do not explore the psyche or the special interest of a fetish, nor why they feel the need to do as much sex as possible, he just uses them as a front to rack up jokes and ridiculously ridiculous situations.Rather than taking group sex and exploring what drives a person to look for it, this in fact a silly joke (tickets with numbers !?) Rather than falling into the mind of a fan of sadomasochism, the film asks someone to hang on the ceiling of the basement and warns all world of the imminent presence of "vinegar and salt." Ferris covers his face with sewer and the camera goes on to the next scene without much fuss. It is a relief that the film did not have any audiences abroad. This is an aspect of British culture, and even of the British mentality which, I pray, will be confined to our shores and ignored accordingly.
