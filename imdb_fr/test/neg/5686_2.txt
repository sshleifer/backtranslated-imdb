This film was rented for free, I had no idea that it was a very bad film. I rented it for Thanksgiving because we eat turkey and then the family watched a horrible movie. So you wonder what makes this movie so bad that you only gave it 2 stars? Dialogue. The lack of dialogue makes it a perfect film for a deaf audience. In fact, if you rent this, simply set the volume to zero and insert any heavy metal CD from your favorite artist. I know you will enjoy it better. The plot of this holiday turkey was so cluttered with tech and geek that you need a translator for the story. Now, for all those who like the good effects of sci-fi ... eh, they are not really better than video game trailers or cut scenes in worse cases. The actors, uh both, are not much to look at either. They do not say much throughout the movie. Many technical aspects will make you laugh as in the scene where the hero attaches to a missile that he pulls 70 km from the city (she never showed how she landed). The scene that precedes we see a robot sentinel shoot it with a cannon at about thirty meters and it misses several shots. We are also told that the political division between antagonist and protagonist is bio-technology (genetically improved humans) vs. cyber-technology (machine-enhanced humans) but both appear to be improved cyborgs or humans. What told me it was a bad movie at the rental store is the cover that looked like a video game wallet and there was only one copy, good new versions have many copies.
