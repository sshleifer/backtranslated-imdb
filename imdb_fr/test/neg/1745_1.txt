If this is the best thing in Finnish cinema today, I would say that these big euros of taxes devoted to supporting "culture" have been wasted here in a horrible way. Paha maa is the worst example of an attempt to produce a Finnish "European film" for a wide audience. I'm sure they wanted everything to be at the cutting edge of technology, smart and touching at the same time. The result is shit. <br /> <br /> In summary: - The story is pretentious, naive and not very believable. The same goes for the characters. I can imagine them thinking about a film where "everything would be fine and people would be hurt and feel very bad inside, because the Finns are very depressed too, and themselves." -Estemem is so bad ", which brings us to the fact that ... <br /> <br /> - The film is loaded with clichés, mainly about" Finnish mentality ". The way he treats people's problems and their causes could be straight out of an ordinary women's magazine or bull book to cheap psychology and self-reliance. ("We feel so bad inside!") I'm sure they also watched Kaurismäki's films to find out what people like about his films, that they misunderstood him and that they have told a boring and depressing story about people going. through all kinds of s ** t without any other artistic purpose than maybe social pornography. It's a shouting shame they threw at Tolstoy here. It's just a sign of trying to be smart. And not to be. <br /> <br /> - I think, however, that the worst fault is the total lack of vision and depth. The film is very original. It is also frustrating to watch endless sulkiness and suffering without any revelation. I can go through this kind of spirit ** ck if the film is funny or turns out to be an elaborate joke, or better still, something sublime like for example in. von Trier to break the waves. There was none at Paha Maa. In fact, I started laughing for a moment because the turn of events was once again too predictable, excessive and incredible. <br /> <br /> Who does this shit? And who likes that? I hope they pretend.
