Worse than a mediocre thriller about an abused woman who struggles after being circumstantially linked to the death of her husband and sister. Determined to prove that her husband is alive, she follows in the footsteps across the state, her danger increasing with each stop. The traditional pair of "good cop" and "bad cop" partners pursue her. One is convinced of her innocence, the other is more interested in closing the case and returning home. This pair is often able to pinpoint their suspect but never capture it. All the main actors find themselves in an isolated desert city and the truth begins to reveal itself, causing fatal consequences for some. <br /> <br /> Wow! It was a bad movie. The police pretended to be tranquilized. Cops could not find a suspect if he was at the police station (this happens twice) and all the others are as one-dimensional as possible. Avoid this one at all costs. <br /> <br />
