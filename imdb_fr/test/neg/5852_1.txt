I do not know if I'm wrong or if everyone says that this movie is good, sincerely, I just want to help people who have doubts about seeing it, renting it or even worse doing it really!). <br /> <br /> Trailers and very early previews may seem fun in one way or another, but it's not funny at all, it may fall into a series of -les scenes here that tend to be very bad jokes, very bad acting, tasteless scenes, cheese effects; <br /> <br /> As a final comment, the movie would have been funny because of the basic concept, but believe me, it's really very far from that.
