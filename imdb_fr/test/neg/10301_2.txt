I work at Memorial Hermann Hospital (TMC) and also worked at Texas Children's Hospital, Women's Hospital and West Houston during Allison's stay. First, the images of the hospital are sadly suburban. The Texas Medical Center has a diurnal population density similar to Wall Street !! There are huge skyscrapers of buildings and professional hospitals. The TCH was the largest children's hospital before doubling in size, TWICE! Methodist, with its 1,500 beds, is one of the largest hospitals in the world. The Texas Medical Center skyline is larger than Memphis. Still, the best images Hollywood can muster are those of a tiny hospital in the middle of nowhere (except for the real photo of the hospital taken decades ago). In addition, they combined several real-life characters and all represented them in one (super-nurse). I actually know the medical technologist (s) working in the blood bank. Two where actually worked at the time, but the film shows only one pregnant MT. There was one pregnant MT and another MT having used the valuable rolodex patient antibody (look for "alloantibodies" for more information). I will not mention their names (confidentiality). There was no nurse in real lab life. Hollywood has combined these two technologies (the most likely to save time and money). In the film, military helicopters (real) had to transfer our babies (USIN and PICU) to the UTMB to Galveston! Why can you ask, while we have the largest children's hospital just down the street? Because Texas Children's Hospital refused to take them. You read correctly, they refused !!! Being employed by them, I was ashamed. Needless to say, I am no longer affiliated with this facility. All other comments would be repetitive in relation to those already posted by people who actually live here or have lived the experience.
