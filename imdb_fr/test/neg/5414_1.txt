Where to start? A guy has an Indian jar he's cleaning, and suddenly Skeletor attacks. He hits a woman's neck with an ax, she falls, but gets up and seems not to be hurt. She runs in the woods and there is the basement of a shopping center in the woods. She meets a public service worker and Skeletor attacks again. Fortunately, like any good utility worker, he has a gun and shoots the guy. It does not work, everything starts to burn. <br /> <br /> Cut to some people walking in the woods. Even if they have been walking together for some time, they sit down and introduce themselves to each other. Would not they probably have done this at their first meeting? Anyway, they are "infiltrated" members of the Delta team (infiltrators, I guess, because they will not have to pay to dress them in uniform). The pretty girls are diverse, such as those of a sniper school instructor and, oh, I do not remember the rest. It does not matter. They all end up taking out their weapons and immediately start to aim at various things. ? Anyway, they meet an old Indian sitting in the woods. He wants beans. You know, like pork and beans? He's mumbling stuff, I can only assume it's the premise of the movie. I trusted myself to hear the principle of advertising, because you can not understand anything he says. <br /> <br /> So, they walk a little more in the woods. All dialogue is a load of quasi-military and macho BS. I mean all this, as in every word. Like "It reminds me when we were in Kabul" or "It reminds me when we were in Laos". Skeletor attacks again. Let me give you a glimpse of a basic attack. One of the female characters is crouched behind a tree and she points her gun at the guy who approaches the horse. For some reason, she does not shoot but shouts repeatedly for someone else. Then, as she approaches Skeletor, she jumps from behind the tree so Skeletor can hold her with her spear. Then everyone starts shooting. Bullets cause sparks of trees. Apparently, the people who made this movie never shot a tree with a bullet. They do not make sparks. <br /> <br /> Casper Van Diem suddenly drives a semi-trailer truck trying to overtake Skeletor. He is missing and the truck stops. Van Diem is injured. Apparently, he slipped on the seat and hit his hip against the crank of the window. He crawled out of the truck and exploded. Later, he dies in the woods and everyone says a bunch of quasi-military BS, macho. They meet a few guys in the woods and explode their status as "infiltrators" by immediately identifying themselves as belonging to the army. They hit the guys for whatever reason, and then they leave. <br /> <br /> There are other things happening, people mumble, the camera shakes, etc. <br /> <br /> I think it's an end, finally. <br /> <br /> My theory is that the Sci-Fi channel starts to get upset a bit after everyone denigrates their movies, so they aired it to remind all of us just how bad movies are can be really. You think our movies are bad? Well, you have not seen bad. THIS IS BAD !!! Well, now that everything is settled, the rest of our movies are pretty good in comparison, right? <br /> <br /> Well, it's just a theory.
