(Only light revealers here) <br /> <br /> Stealing Sinatra is a half-witty comedy about dimwit kidnappers, dimwit victims and a few other parallel stories launched in order to waste some time. </ You will see poor performance in this movie. The drama is forced and the humor does not make sense. Whether you watch the kidnappers threaten the victim who does not want to be silent, or the victim's father who responded to the criminal's death threat by "Care for Tea?", None of this is credible. This corresponds quite to the category "wannabe film". <br /> <br /> You will also listen to a zany repetitive piece of music throughout the movie. It's pretty unprofessional, and adds nothing. It's really a sad attempt to make a painfully ridiculous film in your mind. <br /> <br /> However, if you are able to look beyond all this and suspend a lot of disbelief, it is possible that the scenario is adequate. <br /> <br /> I voted 4/10.
