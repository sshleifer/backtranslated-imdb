Once upon a time there was Theresa Russell, who made a few half-decent films. I hope that one of his efforts of the last ten or two years will deserve a mark of at least 6 or 7 (out of 10). However, DARK WORLD is only the latest in a series of disappointments. The first 90 minutes are very difficult to watch. The lines are delivered by the main actors as if they were read during a first rehearsal or even a casting session (in which the actors do it for the sake of their agents, but do not really want the parties for which they are perfect (reading). The sets and props seem somehow "off" (what kind of police service would allow a detective to place an entire wall in the living room on a shelf full of file holders?). The screen is constantly cluttered with time and meaningless dates that appear without rhymes or reasons. Now, if the screenwriter stood here after the festivities, he would be sure to say how all of these gaps are REALLY clever clues to the plot that turns upside down in the last five minutes of this failed . Well, for members of the public whose only other cinematic experiences are television: THE MOVIE and SURFER, DUDE; they might be forced to nod in agreement. But it is hard to believe that a person who has seen 10 or more films in his life - and who is neither a close friend, nor a relative of a casting or a member of the DARK WORLD team - can crack for a duck so lame. Despite what the d.v.d. This box could make you believe that this film has about as much resemblance to SUNSET BOULEVARD (dead narrator device) or Hitchcock (schizophrenic protagonist device) that a bottle of Jim Beam drained and filled with urine!
