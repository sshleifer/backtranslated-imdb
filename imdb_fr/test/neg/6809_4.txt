Dustin Hoffman's first feature film is not as bad as it sounds; a Spanish-Italian co-production filmed in Italy with the director under the pseudonym "Dan Ash" (!), the film is uneven but entertaining and deals with a plethora of dark characters in search of a million dollars hidden by the gangster Cesar Romero (who, despite his third bill - after Elsa Martinelli and Hoffman himself - expires even before the credit sequence is over!). <br /> <br /> Hoffman's performance is obviously as nuanced as in later films but succeeds to avoid embarrassment by playing what it actually looks like to an amiable klutz - an American Treasury agent. Sicilian origin (called Puzzu, subject to accidents) that his office sent to recover the money and ordered to stay "discreet" but, instead, still has problems - although it ultimately turns out incredibly ingenious in finding the booty, defeating the crooks and winning the girl (Martinelli as a daughter of Romero, who is a bit spoiled here) !! <br /> <br /> Yet the best moments of the film are provided by suave gangster Riccardo Garrone: apart from his pretentious character and the hilarious use of dialect, he is surrounded by a trio of negro who will not prove an obstacle in the realization of his various projects! Moreover, given the history unfolding in Rome, it is strange that the investigating officer is a Spaniard (probably a requirement of the co-production agreement)! <br /> <br /> Over the years, I missed Hoffman's other Italian comedy - ALFREDO, ALFREDO (1972) - many times (I guess, mainly because Leonard Maltin only notes it * 1 / 2 in his "Guide to Movies and Videos" ... but MADIGAN'S MILLION gets a BOMB!); With Pietro Germi in the staging of the sumptuous Stefania Sandrelli, the references of this film are certainly more respectable, and I really hope that it will soon return to Italian television ...
