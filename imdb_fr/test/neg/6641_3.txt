This movie is stupid. There is no way out. But Dumb and Dumber is too. Remember, Dumb and Dumber is a lot funnier than that. However, for my part, I love seeing stupid movies (Tail Sting) and laughing with a group of good friends about the seriousness of the situation. Call me insensitive, but watch this movie, and you'll see that the only way to laugh is to laugh instead of laugh.
