I rented this movie the other day, because I love novels, but it must be the worst I've ever seen in my life. I can not believe Sam would fall in love with Kelley after exchanging a couple of words at a time when she had a great, long-time boyfriend who was totally devoted to her. I thought Kelley was a major idiot throughout the movie, and he never changed at all. Josh Hartnett was the only good thing about the movie. I thought he had done an excellent acting job and I will start watching other movies from him.
