Big spoiler here: this movie is B! AT! D! But take advantage, it's good, it's good. <br /> <br /> Bugged is the kind of film you can not believe, with dialogues, plots and a direction so embarrassed that Uncle Ned's personal video at Carlsbad Cavern looks like an IMAX experience. Since this is a Troma movie, the gross recipes are plentiful, but they are even more ridiculous than usual. <br /> <br /> Most of the production money seems to have been spent buying soft drinks and sandwiches for the actors and the team. The brilliant dialogue is best summed up in the immortal, "% @ # $! What was it?" what comes second only after the shouting cry "Now what?" <br /> <br /> Anyone who knows how people act in a desperate situation is foreign to Ronald Armstrong, the screenwriter / director. When one of the friends is found being eaten alive by something grasshopper / termite / chiapet, Armstrong asks the survivors to immediately spend time with "cute, but silly," "Divine". While she is caught, Divine prepares a hot mixture of poison and oatmeal on the fire, stirring, smiling, stirring, smiling, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The killer insects are as scary as the pi√±atas, which they look too close to. The effects used to move them include dragging them very quickly on the slabs, with the legs pulled back. <br /> <br /> The highlight of the movie would probably have been the house that exploded, but they were either short of money or never had, so instead of seeing even a miniature go up in flames, they simply leave the screen blacken (eat your heart in ILM). <br /> <br /> The distribution is almost entirely black. How can the NAACP systematically censor something really funny like Amos and Andy (which portrays characters that are certainly no less similar than those of 99% of all white comedy shows), but does not say much about something like Bugged. Well, it's better if they do not know how degrading this film is (as it would be if it were played by one ethnic group, frankly). Before you put the kabosh on Bugged, gather friends and get ready for Plan 9 movies from Bug Exterminator.
