John Wayne is without a doubt one of the most popular and beloved actors of all time. His career spanned forty years and he starred in such films as "Angel and the Badman", "The Green Berets", "Sands of Iwo Jima", "Rio Bravo", "North to Alaska" and "The Undefeated" . <br /> <br /> The film cited above is considered one of his best assets, unlike this effort of 1934 "Randy Rides Alone", forgotten for years, which is not surprising, like it's nothing memorable except for its very short duration of only 53 minutes. <br /> <br /> A young John Wayne plays Randy Bowers, who for reasons never really explained, arrives in a living room in the middle of nowhere and finds that everyone inside has been killed. Looking around him, a detachment arrives and finds Randy on the spot. He is arrested, accusing him of being a member of a gang and demanding to know where the rest of his gang is. He is put in prison accused of murder. Sally Rogers, whose uncle owned the living room and was murdered, arrives at the prison to see Randy to clarify that he was a member of the gang (she was hiding in a secret room when the shooting took place place). Sally does not believe that Randy is a killer and does not recognize him. So, as long as the sheriff is away, she slips him the keys and Randy escapes. While fleeing the sheriff and his detachment, Randy falls in the hiding place of the gang in a cave which was responsible for the murders. Randy undertakes to erase his name and bring the gang to justice. <br /> <br /> "Randy Rides Alone" can be a fun movie to watch, especially if you're a fan of John Wayne. But at the same time, there are far too many defects that can not be ignored. The film is also extremely dated, as you would expect. we have the terrible shot with a camera that makes everyone seem to move very fast, and the dialogue is terrible. The acting is not great either, and Wayne's character is very woody and he looks like, with the rest of the cast, some wooden puppets directed by someone (here is the director Harry Fraser). Harry Fraser is at the helm and does a pretty good job but the story is thin as paper. We can not help thinking that he's missing about ten minutes at the beginning of the movie, while Randy comes out of nowhere in the saloon and tries to meet someone. An explanation of why Randy was there was given later, which turns out to be a bit like a P.I that was sent to investigate claims that someone is trying to take control of the city. To be honest, I did not really understand it, most of the time, I was hoping the movie would end. <br /> <br /> That said, I did not find this film absolutely terrible. I enjoyed a few and I found it quite amusing sometimes. But it's really not a good movie, and it's really not worth looking at or spotting. <br /> <br /> Overall, "Randy Rides Alone" is incredibly dated and is a tiring Westerner with very few redeeming qualities. It can be fun, but overall, it's not a good movie and it's certainly one of Wayne's weakest releases.
