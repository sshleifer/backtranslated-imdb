Oh my lord, what were they thinking about this one? It's not only frenzied, but worse, a very good original has been hailed. Jane Fonda, believe it or not, played a leading role in her life. Even better than where she plays the bitch in the other so-called performance of her life. Maybe she's just flat like a scammer. What other time, wow, what a waste of time. But she and Segal team up wonderfully. If you even have a glimpse of something fun in this baby, grab the anvil on which he was beaten. <br /> <br /> Because very very little of this one remains, to these horror. Nothing in this baby is really funny, except maybe a few moments when Dick and Jane are swollen like lepers and can not kiss ..... and uh ....... oh, my God , that's all? Well, it looks like it. <br /> <br /> It's really such a bad movie.
