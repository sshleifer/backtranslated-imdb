It may have been * An important movie * and that's why people rank it so high, but honestly it's not very good. Looking back, it's easy to see that Chaplin (probably all Hollywood) was incredibly naive about the extent of what was really happening in the ghettos. So you can not fault it too much for the shift that affects a modern viewer, but the disconnect remains. <br /> <br /> More disappointing, the movie is just awkward; it's as if Chaplin had no idea that the sophistication of movies had progressed since the era of silence. The pieces of the tray, those that involve both the Jewish barber and the dictator, do not meet; they sit like discrete blocks of stories progressing in fits and starts, moving SOMEWHERE without reaching resolution. Some are funny, others are less. <br /> <br /> The charm of the film lies solely in the person of Chaplin himself. His parodies of Hitler's speeches were the best part of it all, and it can not be denied that he had a physical grace that was lovely to watch. But almost everything he surrounded was worrying. Hannah was TOO DAMN American. The assault troops were TOO DAMN American. <br /> <br /> Oooh! Oooh! One last thing! I do not know what to do with Garbage as the source of evil behind the throne. It almost looks like the film says that without harmful influences like Garbage, Hynckle would not have been such a bad guy.
