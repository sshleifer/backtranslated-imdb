This film was a lamentable attempt to recreate a crucial moment in English history. The film version of Cromwell's growing involvement in the war is marginally accurate, but the overall historical accuracy of this film was very poor. This film implies that the war was triggered for religious reasons, but that the American Civil War was in no way a Catholic-Protestant union: both sides were Protestant. Cromwell has never been present at the Battle of Edgehill, nor has he ever "saved the day". The royalists did not win, the battle ended in a draw. <br /> <br /> As noted by another presenter, Cromwell was certainly not one of the "Five Members" who had to be sent home and arrested. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie was ok. The producers tried WAY too hard and it was not so good. <br /> <br /> could certainly have been better.
