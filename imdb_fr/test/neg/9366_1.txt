From the beginning, this film drags and drags. Clumsy overdubs explaining the story, the monochrome game, the boring scenery, the total absence of humanity, verve or style. The actors seem to be addicted. Potentially an interesting story completely ruined. Has anyone realized how difficult it was to produce it?
