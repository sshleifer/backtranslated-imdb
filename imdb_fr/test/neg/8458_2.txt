I used to think that "It Came from Hollywood" was the worst film I had ever seen that showed clips of horror movies, science fiction, crime and drama. Of course, I had not seen THAT beauty yet. <br /> <br /> What's wrong with "Terror in the alleys"? Four things: <br /> <br /> 1) This assumes that most of the highlights of shock movie history began in the 1970s, when filmmakers such as John Carpenter and Brian De Palma arrived. And what bones are thrown at true classics (black and white movies) like "Frankenstein", "Dracula" and "The Wolf Man" are either shown with Martin and Lewis or Abbott and Costello next to it or not at all! <br /> <br /> 2) The clips are mostly so short and so far from their originals that they only give momentary shock to the viewer and, for those who are not familiar with these films, will not make sense (indeed, the moment when the shark jumps out of the water at Roy Scheider in "Jaws" manifests itself very much like the effect of a visual gag, whereas, in the context of the original he was powerful.) <br /> <br /> 3) Did we really need Pleasance and Allen in the audience reminding us that "it's just a movie" or that most of the violence in horror movies "is, unfortunately, against women"? So, is it an accusation against the filmmakers for adding these scenes or against moviegoers who cheat the cinemas and look at the same kind of fodder time and time again? Sorry, it's a whole bunch of worms to open for a more deserving movie. <br /> <br /> 4) And above all, why is the film so SHORT? It's not like there are not enough movies like that to use. If they had just opened up their resources and used EVERY film available, they could have had a film like "it's fun!" Who would have been comparatively more entertaining. Damn, even dragging Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing (Cushing was alive then, notice) and better still, even Vincent Price would have been more than willing to do it, I bet! What joy it could have received from the public! <br /> <br /> But no ... all that we have left is a sad little film that claims to pay homage to these films, but only the spectators are left feeling deceived in less than 90 minutes with which they could have gone to watch a REAL movie. Do not mistake yourself; It was nice to see what clips they were showing, but if they could have done more with the merchandise! <br /> <br /> Two stars. Another good idea left the pose "in the aisles".
