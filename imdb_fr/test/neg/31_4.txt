It hurts to watch this movie, it really did ... I wanted to like it, even go there. Shot obviously for very little money, I looked ahead and told myself to appreciate the inspiration. Unfortunately, although I enjoyed the film at this level, the acting and editing was terrible and the last 25 to 30 minutes was a difficult territory to shoot. A 95-minute film should not drag on. The ratings given to this one are good so far, but I'm afraid the friends and family have had a say. What about these transitions? Dear editor, You've just bought your first copy of Adobe Premiere and you've set yourself the primary goal of using all the zany transitions that accompany this stupid program? Anyway ... better actors, a little more passion and more attractive montages, which makes it a decent film.
