Leave me alone. How can we say that this is a "good movie about hockey"? I know that movies tend to do a pretty good job - a poor job of portraying hockey to the general public. And yes, it was done at a time when the United States had not embraced our sport as much as it does today, but really. I have played hockey all my life and I have watched more, and this, my friends, is pure madness. The scenes on the ice were amazing ... the particular case I'm talking about is the "sword fight", uh, I mean the "batting fight" at the end of the movie ... during which everyone is standing and watching, not with fascination as it really happens, but wondering who will win the duel between Youngblood and his sworn enemy Rakkie. Yes, the ice cream story is a little better, I underline LITTLE. <br /> <br /> I do not know, maybe it's useless to continue ... I mean, let's face it: the film is right. Hockey is just a big battle on the ice ... oh yes, with a small piece of vulcanized rubber bouncing back - from time to time in what is vaguely called a "goal". Youngblood is either dreadful or hysterical, I can not know which one ... maybe someone else will have more luck.
