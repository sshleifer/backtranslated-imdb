This is one of the strangest things on TV. It is located in a beautiful and sub-populated Midlands, called Leatherbridge, which seems to be the saddest place in the country. It has a bar with no staff or visible client, a university without students, a police station without criminals and a medical office with more doctors than patients. The story is dramatic - each episode revolves around a strange medical problem posed by various extravagant extras who can never act and, for some reason, the doctor always ends up solving the problem at home. Quite entertaining for its pure comedy value, but I can not believe that this thing masquerades as a serious drama. Bonkers.
