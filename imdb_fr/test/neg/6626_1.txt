Is this a bad movie? Do not take my word. Consider the following news stories about people who have tried to watch this movie: <br /> <br /> · While watching this film, the brain of Mr. Harold Faber of Sandusky, Ohio, s is forcibly expelled from his skull. NOAAO NOOO NOOOO. <br /> <br /> Mrs. Louise Robbins of Enid, Oklahoma, a 69-year-old retired housewife, performed a ritual seppuko with a butter knife while watching this film. <br /> <br /> · Janine Hosmer of Columbia, South Carolina, gave birth to a severely deformed baby as she watched the movie, even though she was not pregnant. <br /> <br /> · While watching this film together, Mr. and Mrs. Lawrence Wells of San Francisco, California, spontaneously exploded with such force that Mr. Wells's left tibia was found more later sunk in the wall of a house in Marin County. <br /> <br /> There have been many similar incidents. <br /> <br /> Of those who have not experienced more serious effects such as those described above, at least 75% have become uncontrollable, violent and naturally crazy after watching this movie. Of the remaining 25%, most had been crazy before watching the movie; the others were blind and / or deaf or in a persistent vegetative state. <br /> <br /> I do not say: do not rent it, if you wish. I only report what was in the newspapers.
