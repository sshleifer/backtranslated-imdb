I rented a copy of it from Netflix - big mistake. The DVD version entitled "The One-Armed Swordsmen" was made by crazy people who thought that combat sequences would be better understood, better glued in one chapter than in the context of a coherent and sequential story. Part of the story has been left in separate chapters, which you can select from the main menu, but the DVD is still a mess. Do not rent or buy. Not that the original story has something wonderful, a complicated nonsense. Although I enjoyed seeing Wang Yu at his peak after all these years, this one is a total waste of time. I had dishwashing detergents that made a better movie than that. The choppy DVD version shows us that, as stupid as a Chinese script may be, you must read a story to worry about the sequence of combat scenes. <br /> <br /> But "The One-Armed Swords" offer you the chance to see both Wang's pillar and Shaw Brothers, Lo Lieh, beat the handsome boy David Chiang - it's always a pleasure to see this happen. Lo plays here a kind of second-rate villain and shows why some people really need orthodontists. The film is also honored by the participation of Taiwanese actor Chang Yi as a magistrate. <br /> <br /> Another comment above mentions the obligatory battle scene in the hostel (there are actually two) where Wang and Chiang are attacked by a group of comic barbarians using what looks like Caveman weapons. Bruce Lee makes noise while they fight. It makes no sense, but it is acceptable if you do not expect clarity or common sense. It was fun to watch anyway. <br /> <br /> Another peculiarity of this production is that there is no important female character. There are some female roles, but they do not play any serious role in the action or plot. <br /> <br /> If you can find a copy of Shaw Brothers' original movie One-Armed Swordsman, the one that explains why he only has one arm and why he uses a broken sword, go for it.
