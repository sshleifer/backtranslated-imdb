Does anyone else think that "Reba" is basically a "Roseanne" scam? Just look at the characters from both families, Connors (Roseanne) and Harts (Reba); the eldest blonde bomb girl (Becky Connor and Cheyenne Hart) who is married to a moron (Mark Healy and Van Montgomery), the sarcastic brunette girl (Darlene Connor and Kyra Hart), the little brother (DJ Connor and Jake Hart ), and the weird parent (Jackie Connor and Barbara-Jean Booker Hart). <br /> <br /> And of course, there is the biggest similarity, Reba Hart and Roseanne Connor. "Reba" tried to copy the sarcastic and tough style of her mother without giving her the same adorable qualities as Roseanne's. Or maybe they have made it too kind, because Reba Hart seems to hesitate between being mean and scary (hence Van's message to his wife Cheyenne "I'm not afraid of you, I'm afraid of your mother! ") and be gentle and caring with little transition between the two. Roseanne at least managed to make it clear that she was cruel to be kind, because she was always mean and sarcastic, and every time she tried to open up, it was difficult for her. As incoherent as Reba's character is, it is difficult for her to be credible. <br /> <br /> But even if the characters were not completely ripped off by "Roseanne", nothing could have prevented the series from going below normal in the plot area. The writers try to give substance to the show, but they really can not give up the old jokes long enough to have any impact. And you'd better believe that jokes are lame; it's as if they were written by a twelve-year-old boy who thinks that any joke is hilarious. Although from time to time they come out with something funny (I do not pretend I did not laugh at a few episodes), these gems are too rare to make "Reba" witty. <br /> <br /> Overall, "Reba" is a very mediocre show with obvious "Roseanne" scams, sub-equal intrigues and sub-sub-equal humor, and (let's face it) a terrible game. In fact, the series could be a little better if all actors were replaced, especially Reba herself, which is more a quality of community theater than quality of sitcom in prime time. <br /> <br /> I give it a 3 out of 10 just to be fair to the good jokes that do it.
