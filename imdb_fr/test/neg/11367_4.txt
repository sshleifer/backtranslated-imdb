I actually liked some things about this game. I loved the prospect in the first person and I wish I had that choice in the first three games. There is nothing better than seeing monsters up close in your face. The graphics were not really bad, but I would have liked to have more things to interact with even if it was only a shooter. The music was good. The things I hated were: the movement was nil and aiming was total pain. The story was too weak for words and too much of the same without originality. The inability to save was terrible !!! Some of us have a life and would like to save money to finish the game later. I also thought that the weapons were nil. This game is fun for a while, but it looks nothing like the first three and is only good if you just want to shoot. I would recommend it for the novelty of playing in the first person, but that's about it. Play at your own risk.
