If, like me, you are actively seeking out what the world's cinema has to offer, the rarest and strangest (and often the most horrific), you should not look any further than Hong Kong's supernatural horror production at early 80s. Often mixing bizarre black magic with kung-fu and silly comedy, and usually containing many critters (snakes, worms, eels, centipedes, etc.), these movies are as weird as they can . <br /> <br /> Succubare is a good example: a hill tribe whose women prevent their men from going astray with unpleasant spells (which, if they leave, causes them to fill up with creatures that are writhing and die of an excruciating death), Thus, the martial arts and many animal kills (most of which are perpetrated by a geek who has absolutely no connection with the story), this film is just strange. <br /> <br /> A prolonged scene in which tribal women search for snakes and insects, casually throwing creatures in baskets on their backs, are quite fascinating; a tribal feast that sees a poor ox struck in the head and torn is totally disgusting; and moments that show crawling worms in open wounds and vomiting on the floor will cause the appetite for delirium to wane for a moment. <br /> <br /> However, it's the living animal that really qualifies Succubare for legendary status among movie fans out there. It's naughty to watch and yet strangely convincing: the geek chompe a snake, slaughter a big juicy toad (nasty!) And devour eagerly a mouse (nibbling his head and the rest after). <BR /> <br /> Not a good movie (damn it, it's not really a bad movie), Succubare is only recommended for people who think they've seen it all. He gets 4 out of 10, which is probably more than he deserves, but I respect him reluctantly to make me feel slightly sick.
