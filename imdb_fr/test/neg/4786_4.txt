It seems like people are drawn to shows that have pathetic lives without any purpose. For me, I sincerely thank NBC for its efforts to bring new changes to television by making free laughs. They seem to always have a lot of success, like The Office. When I started looking for the first time, it seemed to me that it could be a resounding success. But after a few episodes, I really wanted to go to church and give every penny of my bank to pathetic people presented in these poor, poor and shameful regions. And the end where they together show Earl and his brother in bed, it seems to me that this show is trying to show the bad side of life, like street beggars or people who have trouble paying the rent and have no idea what real world normal people in society are like. I just seem to be always disgusted when I look at the filth in which the people of this show live. It's like being in Venice Beach, California, it's beautiful but there are so many hobos. Believe me, I'm not a rich guy, middle-class, and not a clean freak either, a bit neglected, but it seems to me that the series just does not seem to stick to all the abominable people who are there. to have a leg. I just wish they would show a little more class, not all dirt and poverty, trailers and just below average life, it just seems to be depressing me. For me, this show is nothing more than a showcase of what not to do in life, what not to be. It also shows me that education is the most important thing you can have because apparently these two do not have the least intelligence. It's a schmuck-u-mentary.
