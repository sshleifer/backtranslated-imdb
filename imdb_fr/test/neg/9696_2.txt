I will do without the obvious scrutiny of factual inaccuracies. They are too numerous to be named. A much shorter list would be what they got. 1. Dude named Noah. 2. Arch with animals on it. <br /> <br /> If you want a much more accurate representation of Noah's Ark and the destruction of Sodom, go and praise "The Bible" (1966). He describes the story of creation through Abraham attempting to sacrifice his son Isaac. It's a much better movie, and it may be that the abomination called "Noah's Ark" (1999) has led you to look for such a movie. http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060164/ <br /> <br /> I really could not stand the whole movie. As I read other reviews, I can see that even atheists have found it grossly inaccurate. As a Christian, that was intolerable to me. Maybe the worst movie ever. This film has no interest either, except perhaps to present his computer animation below normal. <br /> <br /> It was a total mess? Maybe not. God can use evil to work well. <br /> <br /> Romans 8:28 says: [28] And we know that all things work together for the good of those who love God, of those who are called according to his purpose. <br /> <br /> Genesis 50 says: [20] But as for you, you thought evil against me; but God wanted to save the world, as it is today, to save many people. <br /> <br /> In the second example, Joseph's brothers wanted to kill him, but God turned their evil into a very good good. He may have done the same thing with this movie. <br /> <br /> People were so amazed at his lack of biblical foundation that they probably broke the old dusty Bible and read the story for themselves. To know more about Lot and Sodom, they would have to go all the way to Genesis 19 before God destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah. At that time, they read about half of Genesis, so they might want to finish. The next book is Exodus, on which the movie "The Ten Commandments" was based (and much more precisely). If they saw this movie, then Exodus becomes an easy read. So now, they have read at least two whole books of the Bible, simply because they watched a pathetic movie on Noah's ark. I'm sure that's what happened to someone. <br /> <br /> God acts mysteriously. .
