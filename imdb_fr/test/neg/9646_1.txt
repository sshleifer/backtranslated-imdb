I usually like Sion Sono's work, but this movie was completely delayed. But unfortunately, not enough delayed to make it entertaining delayed. I sat there, speechless, wondering when it would end. The plot is just a whisper of meaning. I think it was intended to be campy. I mean, haunted hair extensions - how could it be otherwise? But the humor, as it was, fell flat. Not funny. Not scary. Not gore. I would say that Sono may have been involved in this project, but he also seems to have written this boring trash. I still have a few lines to fill. What remains to be said? I guess I could finish by saying: better luck next time, Sono-san.
