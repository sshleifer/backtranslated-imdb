One of the most boring movies I've ever had to watch is completely a formula. Just cutting a movie in a movie, you can predict every scene in the movie just by knowing the genre, because this movie adds nothing new. The dialogue is never funny, interesting or intelligent. The acting is weak and the soundtrack is annoying - basically, everything seems to have been done by an amateur filmmaker. Nothing fresh, unforgettable or entertaining in this movie, combined with the fact that it's LONG, gives him a low tip. Sorry, fans. <br /> <br /> General Note: F
