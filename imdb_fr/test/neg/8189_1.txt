This person is a so-called artist who must use blasphemy, vulgarity and slander to make others believe that he has talent. I have often seen comics use a little of each of them with effect, but when all you can say is interfering, it is a sign of a drug-affected mind. I wonder where his brain will be twisted and fried in a few years of abuse. Poor man!!! I admit that I could not watch everything - too stupid for words. What is amazing is that someone thinks himself philosopher! No wonder self-respect and decency are diminishing and the evil is increasing. Could it be that the UFC could have been a factor in his sleepy brain?
