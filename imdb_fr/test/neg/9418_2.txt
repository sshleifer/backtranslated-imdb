When you see Barry Corbin in the cast of a movie, you can never be sure that it will be a classic or a trash. Guess in which category SOLO belongs. Apparently derived from WEAPON, a popular science fiction novel, SOLO stars Mario Van Peebles as a human-looking robot who decides to think for himself and is therefore destined to be eliminated. He hides in a Mexican village, obviously to save money on pitches and extras. I suppose paying in pesos is cheaper than paying in dollars. William Sadler is in the party and is part of the robots and soldiers sent to destroy Van Peebles. Van Peebles manages to beat them easily, of course, while Corbin observes all this with perplexity from afar. The film is a horrible scam of THE TERMINATOR and CYBORG series, and apparently has nothing to do with its sources. It is horribly written and interpreted, and the big fight at the end is downright comical. Van Peebles, a decent actor elsewhere, is a scream as he claims to be a robot covered in synthetic flesh. It looks like he's doing the robot dance most of the time.
