Very bad scenario and acting. I was very surprised that the director managed to convince his casting with his empty story that does not tell us anything new. Everything is in the clich√© of the "mentor" and the "talented immature pupil". The characters are neither interesting nor sympathetic. Artistically, it is also empty and insignificant. The colors are very impersonal and light. Only the poster can be attractive. Al Pacino tries to give depth to his character without success. Too bad, because sports betting can be a really interesting subject to which many could relate. But I absolutely can not comment on this film because I left the theater 20 minutes before the end. Everything was so predictable that it was a long time ...
