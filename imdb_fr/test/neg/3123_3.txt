I will not lie, I rented this film because it was an "artistic" film with explicit sex possible. I had this scene and Catherine Deneuve's breasts (briefly shown), but the rest of the film is just the long, pretentious European art movies with phrases like "Did I have a mother or father, I do not know "(paraphrased). Generally, delivered in long monologues. <br /> <br /> If you are curious about the transition from "art" to porn, this could be interesting, with the use of the fast forward button (I was still too slow!)
