First of all, playing is so terrible except for the actor who plays Spencer. Mirinda Cosgrove does not deserve her show. She should have a stick with Drake and Josh. The only person I love, apart from Spencer, is Nevel Hes Super Bad @ $$. > The episode I hate a lot, it's Imyourbigesstfan I hate this young fan of Icaly She made me almost kill me Fake is a good word to describe this Please do not look at this Leave us all return to Doug Nick's version only please do not look I hate Icarly Oh also Nathan Kress is a Fredie Wannabee Highmore
