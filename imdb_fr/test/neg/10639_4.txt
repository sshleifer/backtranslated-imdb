This fourth installment in the series is the last to be released in theaters, although it looks like a movie. It's OK, I guess, but nothing special. The acting game is the worst of the series so far. and as in the third film, there is not much imaginary. In addition, the phrase "directed by Alan Smithee" is never a good thing. it's an acceptable film in the Hellraiser series, but not much more than that. This is a slight drop in quality since number three, and a huge drop since the first two. For me, Hellraiser IV: Bloodline is a 4.5 / 10
