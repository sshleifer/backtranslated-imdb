I gave this movie a rating of 1 because it's by far the worst film I've ever seen in my life. This movie was made in 2003 and I saw movies made in the 60s with better special effects. I wish I could go into the details, but the words can not describe how bad this film was. I could have done better with a video camera at home and $ 20! I pray that Chuck Norris will never make a film again. Now, if you think I belittle this movie because it has a Christian theme, you're wrong. I like the fact that IL 'Chuck decided to make a movie that at least was trying to make God beautiful, but why would he hurt a poor viewer like me through such a shitty movie? All this film can be summarized in 3 words: RE DAMN DICULOUS.
