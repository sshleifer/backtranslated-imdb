"A scientist has developed a serum that grotesquely distorts the victim's hands and head.The scientist decides to use his serum on a concert pianist to extort money to heal him and take his daughter for a woman ", according to the newspaper. Synopsis of the DVD cover. J. Carrol Naish (as Dr. Igor Markoff) plays "The Monster Maker" in the low-budget fashion Bela Lugosi. <br /> <br /> M. Naish serum causes a real disorder, "acromegaly", defined by American Heritage as "a chronic disease of adults characterized by enlargement of the bones of the extremities, the face and the jaw, caused by hyperactivity of the pituitary gland ". Ralph Morgan (like Anthony Lawrence) plays the man with a certain dignity. The pretty blonde Wanda McKay (as Patricia "Pat" Lawrence) is the girl desired by the mad scientist Naish; in the first scenes, Mrs. McKay and Naish are moved with hilarity. <br /> <br /> Watch Tala Birell (as Maxine) for a surprisingly good performance; she plays Naish's assistant, who looks a little like Garbo and has been suffering for a long time. Ms. Birell definitely steals the film; and, you must question Dr. Markoff's reason by throwing it aside. Glenn Strange (like Steve) and a crazy gorilla (Ray Corrigan) add to the fun. The monster makeup (Maurice Seiderman) is very good. <br /> <br /> **** The monster maker (1944) Sam Newfield ~ J. Carrol Naish, Ralph Morgan, Tala Birell
