The Lifetime channel aired this in October, but I only had time to watch it now. It's still the old eternal triangle ?? Dave Ford (Matt Long), a boy from the small town of Connecticut, has a quick chat with Emily Darrow (Emmanuelle Chriqui), his best friend's best friend, on the eve of his departure for the New York Law School. , think of her for five years. he does not make contracts and briefs, he finds her again when he returns home after the death of his father on the eve of a major exam five years later, and begins to be in love with her again. But director and co-screenwriter Matthew Cole Weiss goes beyond, all in a flashback while Dave admits to having murdered Emily, her husband and one of her lovers in front of (here is the spoiler) a lesbian cop who is also a Emily's flame. Weiss exaggerates the "flanging" effect with which Dave has the chance to see pieces of his previous life scroll past his eyes long before he's really dead, cutting them even while Dave and Emily have sex and ruin so soft-core porn shots that even give some Lifetime movies otherwise rather dumb at least a little to draw the audience. I could not help but think of James M. Cain and see how much better he wrote in his classic crime novels (all adapted to hit movies) "The postman always rings twice", "Double Indemnity "and" Mildred Pierce. "It does not help either that the film ends with the wicked (the wicked, in fact) triumphant and the decent, so naive and stupid, the hero seems to head to the injection table deadly? or that the actors who play the characters that Dave and Emily are cheating are both more beautiful than they are. Incidentally, although this film was directly broadcast in the United States, there were white spots on the soundtrack indicating where the words were sworn, so I guess it had a theatrical release somewhere in the world.
