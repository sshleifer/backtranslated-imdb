Even though the writing was terrible, the acting was atrocious, the only thing that saved this "poop" was the chest count, but that was not enough to make me look again. In the end, I am more stupid to watch this movie. It was a new low for Troma. Lloyd Kaufman starting the film with a garbage bag and farting noises should have made me understand what I was getting into. This is by far one of the worst that the Troma team has achieved. The best place to show this movie would be to the disabled, meaning they can not get up to change channels. In conclusion, this is not a quick recommendation to watch this movie just for the breasts.
