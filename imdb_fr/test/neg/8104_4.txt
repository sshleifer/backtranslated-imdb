This movie is really an excuse for making movies. The pace is poor, the budget must have been depressing and the interim game is reduced (that is, except for Bela Lugosi). The sound at that time is also terrible, with so much extra noise in the background that it gave me the impression of a jet taking off for the whole movie. If it bothers you a bit, do not watch this movie. <br /> <br /> If you succeed, you will find that the idea behind the film is very good. A German plastic surgeon (Bela Lugosi) was hired by the Japanese to intervene on several Japanese agents and turn them into portraits of outstanding businessmen that the Japanese have kidnapped and killed. After finishing his job, he was betrayed by the Japanese and thrown in jail. He flees and then goes to America to take revenge on his patients after a series of high-profile murders. <br /> <br /> It seemed that Bela Lugosi was the only decent actor in the film and, to be honest, the rest of the actors were completely forgettable and heavy. The main actress ended up being rather boring and stereotyped, while the police officer in charge of her case was the common, chauvinistic and always correct dominant male found in many films of this period. <br /> <br /> I also found that the work of the camera was totally devoid of inspiration, often taking the exact same angles for the same pieces over and over again. After a while, the film tends to go down and give a "slowness" to the action, which is more or less non-existent anyway. <br /> <br /> For me, the idea is fascinating. and with a better scriptwriter, director, screenplay, material and actors, he could become an excellent film. Unfortunately, these disabilities hold the film for the moment, and I can not recommend it to anyone except the most open-hearted moviegoer.
