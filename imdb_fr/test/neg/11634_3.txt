Two years after leaving the small town of Grover's Bend after meeting the Krites, Brad Brown returns to spend time with his grandmother in time for Easter. Meanwhile, Krite eggs begin to hatch. As they cause problems in the city, Brown and the city's inhabitants, as well as extraterrestrial bounty hunters who have returned to finish the creatures must fight the bloodthirsty hairballs before clearing the city. <br /> <br /> The original creatures. was a minor attempt to rip off the family horror film "Gremlins". He became a cult favorite on video tablets and had enough success to justify a sequel. This suite minimizes the horror and makes comedy all its attention. Unfortunately, the comic part is extremely clumsy and childish. The acting game is tied with the rest of the film. It's just that the film suffers from a weak scenario. The visual effects are pretty well done. <br /> <br /> Note: D + Review by Mr. K. Geist.
