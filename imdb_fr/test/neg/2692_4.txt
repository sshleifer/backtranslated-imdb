Last week, I watched a Macbeth production from the Royal Shakespeare Company. He was 25 years old, filmed without props except swords, no furniture except chairs. It was RIVETING. The acting was great - all the actors formed Brit. Contrast this performance with this ... yawn yawn yawn. Al Pacino, as Shylock, was tragic, heavy and could not lose the New York accent, despite the long ... pauses .... between ..... lines .... everything was soporific, even the "comic" scenes were hardly worth the smile, let's laugh a single belly. It's supposed to be funny. They tried to make it tragic. It was neither, just boring. I give him four points for costumes, landscapes and Jeremy Irons, who is gifted to play a dull, depressed and serious guy (can it be anything else ???)
