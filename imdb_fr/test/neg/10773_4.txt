I'm not quite sure I agree with the director of this version of The Scarlet Pimpernel. I imagined Sir Percy Blakeney was an aristocrat apparently very calm and apparently lazy. This Sir Percy Blakeney seems to be invaded by overwhelming energy and volatility. I did not appreciate the evangelical style of Houdini, James Bond or Mission Impossible that Sir Percy designed. In previous versions, wit was the escape tool, not the technology. The characters of Marguerite and Chauvelin are not adequately described. There seemed to be little energy or chemistry in the interaction between the characters. <br /> <br /> I do not want to attribute any blame, because the reason for my dislike for this film could be simply a question of difference of interpretation. If the director's interpretation had coincided with mine, I might not have been irritated by what seemed to me to be bad characters. <br /> <br /> I had by far preferred the 1982 version. Anthony Andrews was quite effective, as unfazed and calm. dandy. Jane Seymour and Ian McKellen were too. In my opinion, the style of this period piece seems to have been lost with this last adaptation. I recommend staying with the previous versions, that of 1934, or that of 1982. <br /> <br />
