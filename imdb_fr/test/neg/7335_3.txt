The film starts very well with a fake instructional film about the habits of Swedish housewives. After that, we get a detailed reconstruction of post-war Scandinavia with many amazing cars, electronic equipment and interior design; a minimal jazz score, beautiful cinematography and elegant titles. There is also a strange Scandinavian rivalry, as in "Riget" by Von Triers. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, after the set up, the "cooking stories" crumble like the 9/11 twin towers. "jealousy" just looking in front of them. Corny dialogue filled with gay symbolism stale in vain: "I do not like white swans, I prefer bears and wolves ... have you ever tasted bear meat?" The music becomes much worse than Yann Tiersen at its worst. <br /> <br /> Too bad that the director has done everything to create this beautiful scenery, just to fuck in the air afterwards.
