The most obvious flaw ... horrible, horrible script. This film had a potentially good story, but it was ruined by a bad dialogue, problems of continuity, things never explained, gaping plotholes, secondary intrigues that went nowhere and utter stupidity. Not to mention the staggering and clich√©d staging of Sandra Locke. Even two great performances could not have saved this film. So it does not matter if Devon Gummersall and Rosanna Arquette give horrible performances. The fact is that they are better actors than what this film would have you believe. The best Arquette, Rosanna Arquette (Silverado, After Hours, Susan Search Desperately Susan) has good moments - like a big scene at the beginning when she painfully removes her handcuffs - but gives a low overall performance, in his image. And Devon Gummersall (Dick, When Trumpets Fade, and the brilliant My So-Called Life) are far worse, acting without conviction or emotion whatsoever. But I will not blame the actors, who have been good in other roles. The script is awful and the wrong direction does not help. Do me a favor ... avoid this movie.
