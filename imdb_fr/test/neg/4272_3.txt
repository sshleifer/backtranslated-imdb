I always try not to be harsh by criticizing something I do not like, but after watching this mini-series, I was so disappointed that it could not help my irritation. On the one hand, it is true that the series remained faithful to the novel and of course I found it very nice, but on the other hand a terrible casting, a mediocre acting game, especially the main characters ?? Like Funny Price, a theatrical print, I mean a theatrical way of acting gets you up and running from start to finish. I am convinced that this budget, even if it was small, could have been improved and valued. It's up to you to watch this series, but personally, I do not advise you to spend your time on this depreciation of the screen.
