Fuck shit, the beginning took over where the first stopped (good start). Then it comes down from there. It looked like you were watching TV and continuing to switch between this teen drama, a Predator movie and a shitty police show. The characters that are presented in the first ten minutes have nothing to do with each other until the last 45 minutes (characters from the teen drama and Alien story). <br /> <br /> Then, in the end, the producers quickly ran out of money and decided to end the film. So they decided to drop an atomic bomb on the city. <br /> <br /> PS- What's wrong with the cameras, so zoomed in, you can not know what's going on? Seriously, filmmakers, do a good job with the fight scenes and go where we can see the fight.
