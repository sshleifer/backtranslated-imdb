This is the worst waste of time I know. not even near the first. The difficult scenario to follow - the plot was weak - at best. It all looked like three stories trying to tie them together and make a movie. There were some good lines here and there - and the attempt of the message was admirable, but they went from Houston to New York to get to Dallas. It was really hard to tell what period the present time was taking. The movie was just over an hour and we felt we were sitting there watching the movie all afternoon. Mayve points out her points to be honest - but a son should not have to do everything Kronk thought he should do. Do yourself a favor - Look again Kuzco.
