All those who criticize the Sopranos for their stereotypical portrayals of Italians have not seen anything until they have watched this cornball gangster movie that portrays a family so irritating that you almost want them to be deleted. > <br /> The parents of this clan are not so bad, but their two little boys - a total kid, a disgusting cutesy-poo - are unbearable, while their eldest son and daughter Pollyanna, good for nothing rival for the scorn of the public But the grandfather of all is, well, grandfather. As played by Chic Sale (in full "Dag-nabbit!" Mode), he serves as a moral compass to the film, adding many diatribes to "dang, dirty aliens" for good measure. If these are the good guys, it's no wonder that the actors of that era who played the bad guys became the big stars. <br /> <br /> It's not that there are outstanding performances among criminal actors, perform better than the raspy Leeds family. Incompetent police do not even have enough time on the screen to get things done. Only Walter Huston, in his capacity as public prosecutor, raises the content covered with clich√©s in his vain attempts to instil a certain lucidity into these dolts. <br /> <br /> The film deserves the credit of being an early entry into what will prove to be a very popular formula of witness silence, and it does not bend in its description of the underground lifestyle, but it exists simply better examples - and less xenophobia - of the genre.
