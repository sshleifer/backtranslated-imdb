I'm not surprised that so many people have fallen for this one. When I watched this movie, some viewers next to me sobbed whenever you were "supposed" to sob - or at least feel "touched". Like when Hunting said he did not like the girl. Like when Robin Williams character (sorry I forgot the name of his role) said to Hunting repeatedly "It's not your fault" (oh Lord, just thinking about this scene gives me flesh of chicken). I could not have worried less about what would happen to the characters. Many people are sobbing for Hollywood-made characters with whom they can not even identify (think Titanic, yuck!) ... but it really only made me cringe and want to get out of the theater. I guess I just refuse to be psychologically and emotionally manipulated by all this. <br /> <br /> My friends, it's not me who is condescending ... these characters are, and without any good reason, because they are unreal. Even worse, nothing is new or surprising. Even the character of Robin Williams is completely clich√©. <br /> <br /> I gave him 1 in 10. It's probably not that bad; it's just pretty mediocre ... but so many people went to the extreme extreme and gave it a 10 so I thought only one balanced vote would not hurt.
