It's the worst film I've ever seen in my life. Unless you are in masochism, never see it. It was an unbearably long, useless film that was painful and depressing, and will always be at the top of my list of bad movies. Whoever wrote this film is a sadist. I almost cried at the end, that's how bad it was. I would like to give him zero stars, but since this is not an option, I give him one.
