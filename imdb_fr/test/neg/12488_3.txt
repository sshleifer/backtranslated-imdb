What happened to RGV? There are so many things that do not fit in this film that you have to stop and decide where to start - the worst and the first - the music. Each scene was accompanied by this pretentious background music that told you the atmosphere, pathetically enough, I might add. Second, lighting - do we really need dark scenes where we wonder if the projector still works? And finally - if you are going to indianize the godfather and godfather 2 - know that many of us have already seen the film. Nayakan was a GF1 scam, but it was better done and more entertaining. I found a similarity between the company and Sarkar and, if Ab Tak 56 of RGV was brilliant, these two films leave something to be desired. People will no longer be impressed only by corrupt politicians. Maybe RGV should see Maqbool, which is good enough to be RGV !!
