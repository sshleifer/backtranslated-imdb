I found the first bit of intriguing stop-motion animation and the short film mostly live with the girl in whatever country she was interested in, but the other 11 short films really did not stir up my interest or make me think of anything at all. The music and the 8mm footage all seemed so random that it just seemed random. I would not recommend it to anyone unless you see it for free. <br /> <br /> As far as music is concerned, the sound has not been so obvious. I rented the DVD because I thought it was animation stop motion or SMA mixed with real action and that only the first short film was SMA, the second had a small stop motion mixed with the action mainly real. There were pieces of paper cut out of one, and the rest consisted of pictures taken on the outside of an 8mm camera with the music bed. I could not see anything.
