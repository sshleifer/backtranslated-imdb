No, it's sick. It's not sick. It made me want to throw up because I spent $ 2 on it. It's boring, delayed and boring. I did not see the MST3K version, which sucks because I bet the MST3K version was funny. It's sad that people are wasting money on this kind of movies. I'm surprised it's not on the list of "100 worst movies of all time". <br /> <br /> TromaDude Rating - 0 Stars on *****
