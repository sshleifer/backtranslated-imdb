Years ago, the feature film "MA2412" tried to form a kind of "regional blockbuster" in Austria. One thing is certain: I hope that no one from outside will ever see this one. Maybe if you know the original sitcom, it might be interesting to watch what director Sicheritz did in his series. I think he missed his chance and lost time and money. <br /> <br /> So far, many filmmakers and screenwriters have failed to make a series concept compatible with a 90-minute film (think Alf, Inspector Gadget ...). You can see how difficult it is by looking at "MA 2412". In my opinion, the result of this attempt looks like an endless TV episode (and not good). He does not succeed in delivering the plot, the humor is too much effort and the staging seems very blurry - as for the visual style. <br /> <br /> So, in summary, I would not recommend this one ...
