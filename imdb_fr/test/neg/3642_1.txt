When I saw Zoey101 with my sister for the first time, we thought it was waste. Nobody is so rich and lives in a dormitory off the Pacific coast. In the show, Zoey is a popular mega rich girl that everyone always asks her for advice. Zoey is always the one with the right idea and everyone agrees with her, no matter how stupid her idea is. She is always perfect in all areas, including her perfect figure. And she is a dietary maniac, she talks about carbohydrates as if she knew what they are. When she sees that her friends are eating chocolate, she confiscates it. And another thing that bothers me is that she always chews a piece of spearmint every time you look at it. And everyone wants to do something with her, for example, in one episode, a man from Logan offered $ 4,000 for her and her friends to applaud him for everything he did in his pathetic life. And her friend Nicole is an extremely perky monster who shouts a lot. And Lola dresses like a lady Hoochie Houdini. 80s called they want there hairy back hair. Can also shave the hunt. This show sends a bad message to children around the world to make them believe that if they do not own the latest I-Pods and branded clothes, they will hate each other. <br /> <br /> This show is a big congratulations. <br /> <br /> We hate you Jamie Lynn, <br /> <br /> Best wishes Ryan and Kara L
