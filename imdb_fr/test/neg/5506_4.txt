I can not help thinking that this is Franco's "crash" in the "thousand days of Sodom" of the Marquis de Sade. People (in this case women) abducted to serve as slaves to a privileged elite? Check. The perverted sex? Check. Torture including flogging? Check. Victims chosen at random to be killed? Check. <br /> <br /> Thank God, Franco did not do all the work to make film lovers discover the delights of coprology (and even coprophagia), another perversion that often comes up in the tedious saga and disgusting of Sade. <br /> <br /> I hoped that this film would fall into the category "Too bad, it's good". But even the acres of bare flesh and the many sexual encounters did not make up for the lamentable dialogue, the dreadful acting, the elusive plot and - just to put the hat in sheet - dubbing AND English subtitles (a belt and braces disappear from women's costumes). The Alsation gave a very professional performance though. <br /> <br /> Of course, I could be wrong about Sade's angle. After all, I did not realize that the actor playing the role of chief custodian of the "prison" was a transsexual. I have to pay more attention to the size of people's hands in the future. <br /> <br /> According to another review, the film was banned in the UK. Well, this is obviously no longer the case, although I imagine that the scene of nipple needles has been cut off to satisfy the censors. On the DVD that I watched, it was only visible on the Spanish trailer (that, if you ask the question, I looked at it to compare it to the English version). <br /> <br /> The DVD also features an interview. with Jess Franco, although you need a better spanish than mine to understand it. Unless I'm wrong, it's not dubbed or subtitled. And it is specified that the person who sodomizes the character embodied by Franco is Ajita Wilson disguised with a mustache. It's a little ironic, since he had the required appendix removed surgically.
