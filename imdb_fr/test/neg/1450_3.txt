Strengths: Mary Boland is deliciously comfortable, as always (I do not get tired of the panic in her throat, especially in "The Women" and "Pride and Prejudice"). BATHROOM. The short role of Fields is amusing, although the famous billiard scene is a little welcome because it seems to last ten minutes. The crazy antics of the film, typical of this period, are excellent. In addition, a nod to Alison Skipworth's wonderfully grounded mistress; I would love to see more of her (she reminds me of Marie Dressler, another commendable personality). <br /> <br /> Less: Gracie Allen. An irritating and shameless presence whose irritation remained unmatched until the rise of Adam Sandler. This almost falsetto-like nasal, with an accent of unknown origin, ages in its very first scene. It's the first Burns-Allen film I've seen, and while I'm trying to live at least one film with all the stars of comedy, it's definitely a team I'll never do call. His timing and his interpretation of the material are totally out of sync. An infuriating and mediocre talent. <br /> <br /> The end result: an acceptable comedy, but gags are rare. And after only an hour, you can expect it to be not a Hollywood comedy. Recommended only to Boland and Fields fans who want to see all their work.
