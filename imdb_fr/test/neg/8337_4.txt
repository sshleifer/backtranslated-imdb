Whimsical madness about lava springing from La Brea tar pits in Los Angeles. Even if you try to suspend disbelief by ignoring this ridiculous principle, you will always be shocked by stupid dialogues, absurd plots of intrigue and incredibly fearless scientific intrigue punctuating the screen. <br /> <br /> I have a theory: every successful actor is doomed to appear in at least one bad movie at some point in their career. It was Tommy Lee Jones's turn. Although it makes a decent effort, the script is so pathetic that it even burns (oops, sorry for that). Most of the actors are also suffocated by the worn writing. some of the actors simply call in their roles. Anne Heche deserves special recognition from the Temple of Shame for her clumsy portrayal of a scientist. She is about as convincing as Pee Wee Herman in his role, and even he would have done at least a better acting job. <br /> <br /> Since the scientific intrigues are too numerous to list here, I would rather suggest that you show the film with friends and play the game "Find the scientific absurdities". The loser might be forced to listen to tidbits of the movie's lame lines like "Everybody looks the same" again and again. Here's an example of the kind of nonsense you can expect: a plan to blow up a building is designed and developed, and dynamite is set up and triggered in about 20 minutes. <br /> <br /> Let's not forget the film stereotypes of the disaster: divorced fathers, scientists ignored by all, odious cops, tough street kids, wealthy teenagers, greedy investors, etc. . all are present and in abundance. The film also hits you in the head with an implacable barrage of politically correct. <br /> <br /> For cheese lovers and nonsense only. All other spectators: beware.
