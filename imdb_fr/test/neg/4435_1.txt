According to legend, during the 2001 screening: A Space Odyssey, a world premiere in Hollywood, Rock Hudson shouted, "Would anyone tell me what this movie is about?" Well, I beat Rock about 19 minutes and 59 seconds. This film had absolutely no sense. Who were these people? Where were these people? What were the rules of the game called Quintet? Are there any rules in Quintet? Did Robert Altman and his cohorts prepare the film as and when? What was Paul Newman thinking when he signed? Fast Fast Eddie may have seen Zardoz and thought, "Well, if Connery can get involved in a futuristic movie that makes no sense, I can too." Maybe the good things are on the floor of the cutting room and all we see is the inconsistent things. In addition, have all the actors been able to keep their hats fun? You have never seen such weird hats in the same place in your life. The Quintette just confirms what I've always thought: when Altman is good, he's great, but when he's bad, he produces things like Quintet.
