In the literal sense .... <br /> <br /> It reminds you of the role playing "cops and thieves" or "cowboys-indians" that you played with your 8 year old friends. <br /> <boring and uninspired, the script has obviously been written so that acting and dialogue seem to be part of the plot, but all it does is present it. I can not believe that John Badham associated his name with this piece of shit It could have been better done by a high school movie buff to whom the camera, film and editing were given <br /> <br /> > Intended to be a fill factor on the science fiction channel, when they have abused the rest of their library, and barely better than paid programming is downstream.
