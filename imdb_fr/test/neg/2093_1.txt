I can not believe that anyone can give the green light to this event, let alone play the role voluntarily. I will never be able to recover those 90 minutes of my life. <br /> <br /> This must be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Some movies are so bad that they are good. It has gone so well that it's so bad it's terrible. I did not really expect much, it was a tight budget, a bandwagon, a movie B, but it still exceeded my expectations. Even TV movies have higher production values. <br /> <br /> There were (very) mediocre special effects, a shocking dialogue, a dreadful acting and a completely unexplained scenario. Who cursed him and why, why did the 6-inch snakes turn into 15-foot snakes? Has anyone ever heard of garter snakes or highly venomous pythons? 100 passengers? 3000 snakes? So many promises, no livery. <br /> <br /> Some comments would have you believe that this movie is worth watching during the last five minutes. This is not even worth a rental. Stay inside and watch a low-budget TV movie, you'll enjoy it a lot more. <br /> <br /> Why was it made? Oh yes, to shamelessly enjoy the Internet phenomenon that is SOAP. Shame on you, Mallachi brothers, shame on you
