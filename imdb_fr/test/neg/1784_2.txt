If this film had been shot two years earlier, it could have been much better. But unfortunately, it was made during the decade without any idea of ​​what a horror movie should look like or act upon. When I heard about this movie for the first time, people on IMDb rated it as the sequel to Camp Cheerleader Camp. Oh how wrong they were. Yes, Betsy Russell was there, but Uma Thurman was not. I would really like to find the person who started this rumor. I'm sure many of us would do it. I will not give anything because frankly I do not remember how this film ends even! I'll just tell you to watch a real horror movie about the camp ... The Burning with Jason Alexander, Fisher Stevens, Holly Hunter and the Fast Times geek at Ridgemont High. A word for the wise man - It's not because a horror movie has the word camp in the title that it's worth watching. Oh, and something else, any horror film made between the early and mid-90s has never been considered, even remotely!
