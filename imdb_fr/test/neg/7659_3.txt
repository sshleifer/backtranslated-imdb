With a distribution composed mainly of minor stars (Alain Delon, Robert Wagner, Eddie Albert), special effects lousy (it's true, it was in the 70s but "Alien" and "Star Wars" are from of the same decade), and a scenario that is so laughable that we would want to cry, it is a "flight" that should have been EARTHED. <br /> <br /> Even Oscars winners Cicely Tyson and George Kennedy can not keep this "bird" in flight <br /> The implausibility of the third film - the plane is submerged in the Bermuda Triangle - is much more believable than this turkey. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs "The Concorde"!
