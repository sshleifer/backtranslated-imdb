The only good thing about this movie is its latest twist. In 97 minutes of film, we can only record one idea, which was totally lost in this film, I must say! For more than 90 minutes, this film is a collection of clich√©s, bad acting, stupid ideas and revelations, total lack of suspense, stupid deaths, terrible special effects ; all this in a pathetic and unoriginal plot ?? until the last three minutes, where, FINALLY, a good idea appeared! It's not exceptional or an extremely original idea, but at least it was a good "decent" idea, the only one of the whole movie! I will not spoil it, but I must say that I think this idea with better plot, FX effects and, without a doubt, better acting would turn into a good movie. If you watch this film and can bear it until the end, you will know what it is ??
