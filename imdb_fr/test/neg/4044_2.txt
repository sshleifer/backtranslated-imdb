Having to make a movie as horrible! In fact, I'm more embarrassed that I'm sitting through the whole thing. It looks like an old 80s sci-fi movie with super-fake "special effects", queer images and a very nerdy dialogue. Maybe that's how they wanted it to look, maybe they think it's cool to make movies in the 80s fashion as if it would come back to fashion. Who knows ... <br /> <br /> If you think that the promised miracle will save the film, you will be disappointed - the so-called "babes" are manic and downright ugly. They can not act at all, I do not understand why they could not at least have beautiful girls if they want babies without talent! But I guess when you make such a stupid film, you do not have very good choices, hot girls do not queue to do that kind of pitiful shit!
