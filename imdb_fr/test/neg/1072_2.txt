Honestly, Mr. Thalluri ... if you make a dramatic film in a secondary school after a group of teenagers for a day of school and you waste your time and jump in the air ... if In this case, you can not use exactly the same narrative device of visual stories of "Elephant", which uses a camera that passes from one character to another and displays scenes 3 times from different angles . You simply can not do that because it's such a scam that it's hard to believe that someone gave it more than 5. <br /> <br /> Where "Elephant" (released 3 years ago before this film)) uses shootings in schools (or more exactly in Columbine) as the central point of his scenario. 2:37 uses teen suicide and, given the critics, the shock value of this topic has worked. It's the same slow story that tells, a lot of dramatic piano music leading to a finale that you know from the beginning. At least the characters seem to have done their best to be a little different in this department. So you have an atypical gay guy who looks like a stoner / skater, a boy in love who can not care for his gay side, a brother and a sister of a rich family who both have their own problems and that's it the nose to plunge. <br /> <br /> You also have a spoiled bastard chick and one of the most ridiculous characters of all time ... a guy struggling with health issues that wets his trousers because of "syndrome 2 "urethra who has never heard of the invention of diapers but rather pisses her pants in the classroom, then changes herself and gets EVERY DAY! WOW, as difficult as this film tries to be realistic, it's the most absurd thing I've ever heard. He is beaten in the bathroom and obviously ashamed of it, but he does not wipe the blood of his nose as he walks through the school with wet pants and a bleeding nose. It is the new-age realism that leads directly to the "twist" and the final character who turns out to be the victim of suicide ... <br /> <br /> After watching the "very realistic" life of teenagers (one day, incest included) -rape, teenage pregnancy, bulimia, parental pressure for the notes and appearance and the gay topic mentioned previously, much like your daily "very realistic" soap opera ... trying to to be) we watch a girl we met once at the beginning of this film and who has no other reason than the guy she had a crush on left the room while talking to her (in a thoughtful piano playing sequence BTW, seen somewhere before ???). And it's even better ... before slicing her wrist in a long and painful scene of "Yes" and "No", she asks the urethra-guy if he's OK, always smiling, then cuts himself off wrist with scissors in a toilet school. <br /> <br /> Now you have a movie that is a total Elephant scam, fails with a really sloppy story (the entire thing about rape-incest was pretty amazing too, by the way) shocker. <br /> <br /> What's going on ?? Is it enough to take pseudo-dramatic music, boring stories and add a shock topic above and people think there is a deep and deep message here ?? I think Elephant is already overestimated, but this movie was the original, while it's an obvious scam that fails on many levels. In my life, I've never seen a film concept more bravely stolen ... and believe me, I've watched a hundred horror movies, so I know how much you can go there. This is a total disappointment in all the departments ... it's neither realistic nor stolen nor cursed slow and I wonder what is still useless ... another romantic suicide (many give this point to the film that makes me ask if they only watch Romeo + Juliet all day because there are dozens of films that deal with the subject in a clear, unromantic and more REALISTIC way) or this ridiculous installation ... Come on! I am still trying to determine if the 2-urethra type or suicide itself is more unrealistic and ridiculous.
