Talk about false advertising! What was it doing in the humor section of my video rental location? I think there was perhaps a laughable role in the film. I can enjoy black comedy, but it only had darkness without comedy. The film was generally disturbing and not very funny. Yes, Kevin Spacey was good as a Buddy and the rest of the cast was good too, but in general, the movie falls apart because we do not really see enough reason for Guy (Whaley) to lose his head so badly . The end was disappointing too. What would be Buddy's motivation to let Guy get away with what he did? It's not really explained at all. Why would Buddy choose such a plan? Would not it be more like Buddy had screwed up Guy completely by handing him over to the police? The end did not seem to make much sense to me, no matter how I looked at it. <br /> <br /> In general, I did not like the film despite the good acting of the actors. Spacey essentially plays the scenery for most of the film, but towards the end, he gives Buddy a bit of humanity. The story was just not as good as the cast.
