This documentary is plagued by problems. <br /> <br /> How arrogant is it to make a documentary about your own family? I understand that you think the subject is interesting. I was bored with that. This is not a fascinating story for me, and I do not see why you would think that was it. <br /> <br /> I do not want to sound mean, but I have to say that most of the people in this movie are just not attractive. And it does not matter, everyone is not pretty. But your camera technique, which is to stick the lens to their face to not stop you from being overwhelmed by their unpleasant appearance, because it fills your TV 47 ", is not nice.I had to raise the hand two times faster to protect myself from warts, wrinkles, bags under the eyes and yellow teeth.I really try not to seem inhumane, but remove the camera so it's not like if there were perfect strangers in my face, the work of the camera in this "film" is amateur-like, that's the kind of work you see from everyone with a camcorder at a family picnic if you want to do it for a living. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I do not see how this problem is important.
