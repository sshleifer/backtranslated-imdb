My name is Earl (2005) <br /> <br /> Review: ...... I've already seen it. <br /> <br /> It's something else. First of all, how is it so high? I can not understand that. This "show" is filled at the top with either annoying people, stupid people, or just unthinkable. The "gags" are hideous. <br /> <br /> I saw an episode where Earl's brother's wife wrapped herself up and washed with dead fish. No kidding. It was not funny, it's disgusting. Then she and the extremely stupid brother of Earl (and I mean stupid) then had sex. I almost vomited. <br /> <br /> This must be one of the most desperate comedy attempts in a long time. Jason Lee is a talented actor, but is trapped in a helpless role in this horrible "comedy". <br /> <br /> Earl is currently in jail for the current season. Let's hope he gets the chair just so that this show is put out of his misery. <br /> <br /> The last word: This show would be fun for those who think the guy from Larry the Cable is funny. For the rest of the world, NOT A CHANCE. Avoid like the plague.
