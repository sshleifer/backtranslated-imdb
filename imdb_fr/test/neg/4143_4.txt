I wanted to cheat this movie, but I can not find it myself. <br /> <br /> Presenting a duality of fighting styles, it's Li versus Li in a rather decent battle for supremacy. <This is one of those movies where the story tells the story. Li's game is extremely amateurish, hesitant and rigid for most of this movie ... until the end. At first, I was wrong in making him believe that he was doing just that for one of his two characters. You know, show a difference in personalities. But it seemed like a lack of experience or a lack of talent. It got a little better, more relaxed, towards the end. But that was not enough to save his performance. Jet Li's acting game improves as his career progresses. I do not hate his role. I just hate it. <br /> <br /> I must also say that the effects were very "B". What are the effects? <br /> <br /> The story itself had great potential. It was only creative, bold and fresh. Unfortunately, the budget was not enough to improve the lighting, the effects, the quality of the film and some theater lessons, or the director did not care enough to deal with these small details. He also does not care about science in science fiction. A fact that greatly detracted from this film. <br /> <br /> The fighting sequences were a bit one-way because it seemed to give more to one character and little to the other. But overall, the story was made for a very nice attempt. <br /> <br /> As nice as it was, I could not help but think, throughout the project, that you can not help but look at what it should be, rather than he is. <br /> <br /> He scores 6.0 / 10 on the "B" scale. <br /> <br /> This is a 4.2 / 10 (on the "A" scale) to have a good plot, of ... <br /> <br /> the Fiend :.
