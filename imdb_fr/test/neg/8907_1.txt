Honestly, it's a very funny movie if you're looking for a bad action game (Heather Graham could never defeat him ... she has three titles for a reason to protect the culprit!), An incredibly bad dialogue ("You like ... ribs? "), and a plot that only a mother could approve, this is your Friday night entertainment! <br /> <br /> My roommate rented this under the title "Terrified" because he loved Heather Graham, but terrified is what we felt after the final credits. Not because the film is scary, but because someone has actually paid money to do that shit on a reel of film. <br /> <br /> horrible movie. Some unnamed actors offer an unintentional comedy, but nothing is worth watching. The dramatic climax of Heather Graham has also been one of the most pathetic and disturbing things I have ever seen. I give no prize to this film and God have pity on his soul.
