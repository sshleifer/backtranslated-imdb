I had a kick from Reynolds who told his lawyer, "Look, I did a lot of nonsense in my life, but I did not kill anyone." Obviously, he had forgotten his career that had slid down the slope after he started making stupid movies like "Cannonball Run". The physical evidence was originally thought to be a continuation of "The Jagged Edge," which Glen Close soundly rejected. The verdict is in place, avoid physical evidence.
