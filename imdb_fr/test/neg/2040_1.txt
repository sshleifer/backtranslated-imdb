An art student in Rome is possessed ... or something like that. She dreams of being nailed to a cross and Satan raping her herself. He owns it (I think) and turns her into a sex addict. That's about all I could take and I turned it off. <br /> <br /> A "exorcist" scam useless. I caught this on a cable in the 80s and I was horrified ... and not in a good way! This film is supposed to be a horror movie but becomes nothing more than a sex movie disguised as a horror movie. There are tons of useless female nudity and the actress who plays the main role has to degrade more than once. We see her being raped by Satan (a very sexy guy), masturbating, getting closer to his own father ... I have to give him points for his courage. Add to that the dubbing, retouching (the rape scene seems to have been a little cut), the unhealthy game and a story that makes almost no sense. The only disturbing sequence (she is nailed to the cross) almost works, but the "special" ugly effects ruin her. This is one of the few horror movies that has been so bad that I stopped watching. Jump.
