It did not take long after Halloween launched the slasher boom for this category to be cursed by continued mediocrity. By 1983, the genre was already struggling to publish more than three decent offers a year, and in 1988, the epic film became practically the horror movie guy. At that time, major studios all knew that repeating the tired formula was no longer a lucrative direction, leaving independent and mostly inexperienced filmmakers to perpetuate the legacy created by John Carpenter. Although there are still an impressive number of features hitting the shelves out of 88, most of them were poorly produced and, taken as a whole, they were eminently unattractive. That said, there were some jewels among the rubble. Scott Spiegel's intruder in its raw form was a superb disgusting classic, while Evil Dead Trap proved that the cycle was not yet at the end of style and panache. William Lustig's Maniac Cop has been successful enough to launch a franchise, and two years later, Dead Girls and Mirage are the last breaths of life in the sick category. <br /> <br /> It was the continuous release of schlock like Berserker, Blood Lake and Rush Week who cursed the slasher film at eight years of darkness. It finally took the budgeted flamboyance of Wes Craven's cry to provide the necessary resuscitation. Having never heard of Demon Warrior before imagining it unexpectedly, I immediately assumed that it was part of the low eyebrow basket that resulted in the fall of the slasher phase. That said, the film features an intriguing concept that sits comfortably alongside Scalps and Camping Del Terrore, a welcome addition to the Amerindian influence catalog. <br /> <br /> A truck stops on a forest road two rednecks ridiculously dramatized. Hillbilly lumberjacks are only on the screen for about 10 seconds, then are murdered by an invisible threat. We then meet a troupe of five young adults heading to the same place for a rifle practice on some of the local wildlife. The region belongs to Neil Willard and has been passed on by three generations of his family. His grandfather stole the land from an Indian healer who would have left a curse on the property. According to legend, every ten years a demon warrior with extreme hate for man dominates the forest, taking revenge on those he considers responsible for the looting of the tribe's house. It would not be much fun if these myths were a lie, as usual as clockwork movements, a maniacal assassin arrives with the taste of blood. Will children be able to stop this ghost killer ??? <br /> <br /> Demon Warrior is better described as a larger reimaging of Fred Olen Ray's scalp, budgeted (but still cheap). The ghosts of both films are virtually identical and the director even throws a scalping sequence to confirm my suspicions. Things start well: Friday, first-person cinematography at the 13th edition and some shock shocks composed with finesse by director Frank Patterson. Thomas Callaway did a good job with photography and the tribal drum score is a refreshing change from the traditional synthesizer waste of the late eighties. Thrills of suspense are juxtaposed with some embellishments of credible directors and there are even some attempts at humor. The killer looked really scary in demon outfit and the inclusion of a bow and arrow as the main weapon of the murder was a skillful touch of the director. <br /> <br /> Fred Olen Ray's famous slasher was remarkable for its extreme and incredibly disturbing atmosphere. Unfortunately, despite twice his budget, Demon Warrior never approaches the film he imitates so desperately. According to the rumor, most of the actors were chosen by Texas Baylor University and have not even been paid for their inclusion in the feature film. It goes without saying that drama is catastrophic. I especially enjoyed the hilarious John Langione ?? an American Indian "Italian" (do not ask) who describes as much emotion as the trees of the forest that surrounded him. Warrior began with some credible glimpses of the director's panache that made me believe that this could be a welcome inclusion in the Slasher Index. Unfortunately, the poisoned cocktail of hateful actors and an end shot directly from stupidsville seriously changed the initial plan I had in mind for a rating. It's unfortunate that the drama has been so badly shattered from the bottom of the thespian barrel, because sometimes Demon Warrior has shown flashes of potential. <br /> <br /> In total, Patterson's film is a mixture of mixed ideas ?? some of them were good, but most of them were incredibly mediocre. Because this was published at a time when the slasher genre had been diluted to avoid scissor censorship, there really is no gore to mention. Even the scalping sequence is relatively unsteady compared to the graphical representation of Olen Ray. Demon Warrior has a moment of unusual credibility, but not enough often to justify a purchase. Not as bad as the Berserker, Blood Lake and others, but not as good as that ?? ..
