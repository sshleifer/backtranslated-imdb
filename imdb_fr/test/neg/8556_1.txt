How can this propaganda be described as a family film? It's nothing more than a PC, insult insensitive to the faithful of churches in small towns. The film portrays a woman as the great white savior of some small Midwestern town, and all the other inhabitants of the city (mostly men) are just damsels in distress, unable to honor, who can not defend themselves alone and must rely on main character for redemption. This film is just a story of love that the producer has with a small arrogant, arrogant and arrogant acorn, that he expects from the public he admires. <br /> <br /> The person who directed this film probably spent all his life in a requestor-friendly church, and had the freedom to throw garbage on the little church members like wacky lunatics and not the majority . The same people who donate money to the Salvation Army at Christmas, collect donations to help missionaries, the poor and the homeless, sing, make friends and make friends. What is wrong with this humble group that offends these selfish traitors? Most Christians in this world stand in front of a train and give their lives to anyone in difficulty, even if they do not agree with it. Most Christians would not mind whether the pastor or a church staff member takes his coat (or outer shirt). They would not condemn her. This movie is ridiculous!
