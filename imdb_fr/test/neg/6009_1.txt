This is by far the worst adaptation of Hemingway to date. Rock Hudson was a bad soldier and quite incredible as a hardened soldier / adventurer attracted by the war. Jennifer Jones was way too old and Vittorio de Sica seemed to think he was playing in another movie. They tried to make a large-scale epic of a discreet romantic novel and the result is terrible. As if that were not enough, everything is so slow, so long and so old that it is practically unassailable. Rock must have thought he had rejected "Sayonara" and "Ben Hur" to make this shit horrible. <br /> <br /> 0/10. To avoid.
