Yes, Pigeon and Coburn are excellent, and it's interesting to watch them, although Coburn seems rather sober and drab here. It's nice to see Seattle, Victoria and Salt Lake City from the 1970s, as well as cars and vintage clothing. That's all good in this boring movie. The dialogue is incredibly bad, as are most actors. Ray and Sandy's motivations seem forced and improbable. I have already witnessed this "pickpocketing" operation several times. There is a long accumulation that leads to nothing. Better watch an episode of "Streets of San Francisco" or one of the many great crime movies / capers. To name a few, there's Bedtime Story, redone in Dirty Rotten Scoundrels, The Lavender Hill Mob, The Grifters, Paper Moon, The Sting and, better still, House of Games.
