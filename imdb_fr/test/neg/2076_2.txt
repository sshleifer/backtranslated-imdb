When I saw this in the cinema, I remember creaking after playing poorly for about a minute or two after the first scene started, then immediately said, "No, it must be better". It does not have. The performances are quite uniformly in teak and pine, and there is NO sexual chemistry in this film, just the uncomfortable postures of a reasonably charming and discreetly talented actress who seems to be born to adorn the cover of "Interviú". If the scriptwriter thinks that making Mérimée a character is a creative stratagem of breathtaking originality, he should perhaps say more. And Aranda, if he had thought about it a little more, would have understood that Carmen's story was crying for a thoughtful, iconoclastic and parodic deconstruction, and not this case of letting your brain-at-the-turn of ersatz passion and comic dialogue. This is the worst of contemporary Spanish cinema. <br /> <br />
