Returning home after a day at the beach, four young men took refuge in Lord and Lady Alexander, after a torrential rain, after their car ran out of gas. They do not know it, but the house in which they stay must be the place of a satanic ritual. Jane (Camille Keaton), the only woman in the group, must be sacrificed. While his companions rush to his aid, one of them accidentally kills Lady Alexander. Things get really out of control and everyone who attends Black Mass is also killed. The four try to escape, but quickly discover that there is no way to escape what they have witnessed. One by one, they meet their destiny. <br /> <br /> Gong in tragic ceremony, I was convinced that I would like it. Slow gothic horror burns right in my driveway. I also like many other Riccardo Freda films like The Horrible Dr. Hichcock, The Ghost and I Vampiri. The tragic ceremony seemed to be a sure thing. Unfortunately, things do not always go as they should. The biggest tragedy with regards to the tragic ceremony is the time I spent watching this clutter of film. With a few minor exceptions, nothing in the film has pleased or worked for me. The characters are incomparable, the plot is incoherent and schizophrenic, and the pace is terrible. There is a secondary plot about cursed pearls that goes nowhere and serves only to confuse things even further. Also, nothing interesting happens for most movies. By the time the four leaders realize that they are in danger, I had already gone beyond the stage of solicitude. And I do not understand the critics I read who praise the game of actors Camille Keaton. I guess it's a fantastic performance if you consider emotionless dizziness as an actor. The three main men are the very definition of non-descriptive. They do not do anything to stand out. The support troupe includes some favorite genres such as Luigi Pistilli, Luciana Paluzzi and Paul Muller, but none should do anything. In fact, Muller's main contribution is a two-minute monologue at the end of the film that tries to explain what happened in the last 80 minutes. It is a weak attempt to summarize a very weak film.
