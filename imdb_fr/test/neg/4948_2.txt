It's a terrible movie. Angie Dickenson is part of the class and still doing well, but she does not get many roles and she probably needed money to make this movie. By the way, she is on the screen less than 10 minutes. Oooh, wait, there's a feature film in this film: Meg Foster has a small role in this movie. Now, Meg has been on the screen for 35 years and is not particularly great, but she has the most frightening eyes of all the actresses I've ever seen. By your name, you probably do not know her, but look her in the eyes and you will recognize her. In summary: the acting is horrible, the story is bad and even the filmography is appalling. A screen that goes black every time the director wants to change scene is pretty weak. Look at something other than that, even Mr. Ed starts again!
