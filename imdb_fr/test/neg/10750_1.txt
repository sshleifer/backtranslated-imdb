Some people thought it was funny because they liked the political issues discussed in this article. However, I am so tired of the state of the two-party system in our country that I can not stand the propaganda on both sides. I was hoping for a horror show, but I had "cute" zombies and partisan bullshit. I watch my horror movies to be scared. It did not even try to be scary. In addition, it does not have the spirit of Romero in his political / cultural satire inscribed in his films ... it was a flagrant story, without imagination, which was difficult to bear for me (for the wrong reasons). On the bright side, if you hate Bush ... you'll love this (I do not tolerate hate or Bush with this statement)
