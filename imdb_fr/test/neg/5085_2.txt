I thought it was difficult, if not impossible, to watch, not because of the horrors he portrayed, but in the way they were described. Imagine what Costa Gavras could have done with this real horror story. What I am opposed to is the idea that the need to denounce, to which I subscribe, is enough. Why not show it to us with the power of a powerful cinema? I feel that the filmmaker's eagerness, perhaps even his legitimate anger, did not allow him to see it clearly from a cinematographic point of view. Or, if it was a cinematographic point of view, I mean, a choice, then, I did not like it at all. I was more disturbed by the way the film was shot than by the film itself. Well-intentioned, I'm sure, but unfortunately, it's not enough.
