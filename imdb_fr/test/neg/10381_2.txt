Blackwater Valley Exorcism is a movie about a girl possessed. Shall I describe the intrigue further? The Exorcist and The Exorcism of Emily Rose are two terrible and terrifying movies. Classics (IMO). The Blackwater Valley Exorcism (BVE) is not. Not far away. It's certainly not as bad as a low-budget copy of The Exorcist could have been. From start to finish, you will have the impression of a production "made for the chains of Sci-Fi". This is one of those films that will probably be ridiculed by the movie Mystery Science Theater 3000 (or a similar show). <br /> <br /> Makeup and effects were absolutely laughable. The game was terribly bad. There was not a single performance that did not make my eyes roll or laugh. Oh, except maybe for Jeffery (Re-Animator) Combs as sheriff. The scenario was not great, but it was certainly not something special. <br /> <br /> It seems that almost the entire film is centered on who is sleeping with who or who is with the girl possessed by the demon in the other room. Oh, there is something I learned from this movie. Apparently, if your teenage daughter is possessed by a demon, all you have to do is lock them in the room. Let's go there. And if your daughter is possessed, do not worry too much, because all that it does allows her to talk with funny voices, eat rabbits, try to look down on you and put fog machines in their homes. bed. Other than that there is nothing disturbing. Apparently, she was possessed by a low-budget D-List demon. <br /> <br /> There have been no horrible acts committed by A-List demons such as intercourse with crucifixes, painful body deformities or even projectile vomiting. <Br /> <br /> Film totally ludicrous. Not worth a discounted rental. <br /> <br /> 2 of 10.
