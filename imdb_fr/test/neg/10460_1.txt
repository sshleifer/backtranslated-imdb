While trying to build a major shopping center or complex or something, a wealthy landowner ignores the ancient Native American artifacts buried on the land and releases the Bone Eater ... a creature that kills people in search of his friends or something like that. <br /> <br /> Indeed, this film was to be an original of the channel Sci-Fi. If this were not the case, the director should never direct anything. The effects in the movie are at best laughable, and the Bone Eater is nothing more than a movie animated by a CGI image, which will be added later in frames. The actors do not even look so frightened when they see it (probably because they do not really do it, and they're just terrible actors). It's an excellent comedy, even if it's supposed to be pure horror.
