This series takes a classic story and makes it a waste. Robin is somehow mystified by a man-elk in the forest and is involved in all kinds of druidisms and satanic episodes. The story is more about him avoiding the evil sheriff than helping the poor. It's barely observable. And to top it off, they kill Robin at the end of series 2 and replace him with another actor. Some people may like this show as a fantastic show but it's NOT a Robin Hood show. If you want Robin to fight on behalf of King Richards against Prince John and the Sheriff and if you want Robin to feed the poor and oppressed, watch the BBC's classic or most recent series.
