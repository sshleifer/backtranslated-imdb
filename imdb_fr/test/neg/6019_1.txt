Why does the poster and the work say "Clubbed is one of the best British independent films I have ever seen." SCREEN INTERNATIONAL ", while it was a quote from the distributor French magazine REPORTED by Screen International (an influential publication in the field of cinema). See www.screendaily.com/ScreenDailyArticle.aspx?intStoryID=39811 which reads as follows: <br /> <br /> "Pretty Pictures has acquired all the French rights to Neil Thompson's Clubbed .... James Velaise, President from Pretty Pictures, said: "Clubbed is one of the best independent British films I've seen in a long time." "<br /> <br /> Is not that deceiving? The distributor is obliged to say that it is good. Are the other quotes real?
