This film was horrible and at the end I wondered why someone had bothered to do it. Now, everything was not bad, I studied film and this film was very well mounted and had a very good movie, with interesting angles, very beautiful lighting and excellent camera work. I wish I could see him at school because it would have made a good movie to write an article. BUT ........ Since I graduated and lost most of my film claims, I realized that a movie had to be entertaining first and foremost, this movie was long and boring and I did not do not know when he finally got to the point that it was worth my time. <br /> <br />
