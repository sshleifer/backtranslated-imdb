I'll give him this: he tried. He tried to do good and even involved Luke Wilson. Luke Wilson is good, but he can only do a lot. He can not compensate for the fact that the story was very imperfect and that the characters were underdeveloped. <br /> <br /> The "gag" with the bully was asin. He was never funny and I got tired of the gag very quickly. And the barefoot kid was a little weak too. He hitchhiked to Florida? Yeah, okay. <br /> <br /> The film sometimes resembled a children's movie with this mantra emphasizing: stupid adults, intelligent kids. And that becomes boring. <br /> <br /> But the only laughing moments was the police cart that Wilson drove around him when he lost his squad car. I loved this little cart, especially when Wilson turned on the sirens. But other than that, nothing else was worth my time. "RE-"
