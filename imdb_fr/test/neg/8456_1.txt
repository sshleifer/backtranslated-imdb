So you have several models on an island, and they are chosen one after the other in the style of Agatha Christie. We get someone lost at sea, pushed off a cliff, poisoned by a solvent, chased off a cliff, jumped, etc. Nothing very graphic. <br /> <br /> Before all this begins, a woman inexplicably dreams of a killer in a strange human face mask. <br /> <br /> The owner of the magazine is an unlucky journalist who has had an affair and someone has already taken pictures of her before her age. <br /> <In the end, everything is a business affair or something else, <br /> There is a montage of a photo shoot in the style of the 80s, most swimsuits being unique, surprisingly. A couple is quite translucent. During editing, there are camera clicks when the camera frame appears as a square or a white rectangle in the image. The photographer is pretty bad at framing!
