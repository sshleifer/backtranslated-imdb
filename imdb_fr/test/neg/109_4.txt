Ben (Rupert Grint) is a deeply unhappy teenager, the son of his unfortunately married parents. His father, (Nicholas Farrell), is a vicar and his mother, (Laura Linney), is ... well, let's just say she's a somewhat hypocritical soldier in Jesus' army. Only when he takes a summer job as an assistant to a disgusting, eccentric, famous and now forgotten actress (Julie Walters), does he finally find himself in the real "Harold" fashion. and Maude ". Evie is deeply unhappy herself and it is only when these two sad bags meet that they can put their common misery aside and take the road of happiness. <br /> <br /> Sure, it's nerdy and sentimental and very predictable, but it also has a tough side, and Walters, who could sleep her way through this sort of thing if she wanted to, is excellent . It's when she puts the madness aside and finds the pathos in the character (as if she were hitting the bottle and throwing in the sink) that she was at her best. The problem is that she is the only interesting character in the movie (and it's not because of the scenario that does not favor anyone). Grint, on the other hand, is not only unhappy; It's a bit boring while Linney's starched dog is completely unidimensional. (Still, she has the English accent at short notice). The best we can say is that it's a bit nice - with a soft focus.
