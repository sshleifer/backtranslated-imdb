Forget all anxious documentary! This movie is really a comedy about a 40-year-old porn star whose goal in life is to sing songs from Junky Circuit Party. The only problem? Colton Ford does not know how to sing! And the film is cut when it seems ready to start singing. Yet Ford and his equally insipid friend, Blake Harper, lament and hide in their camisoles, determined to make their dreams come true. Even more funny is "manager" Kyle who seems to have the I.Q. of a turnip and whose lips injected with collagen resemble a bee sting him. How can cultured men be so self-delusional? Bwa ha ha! Regarding the documentary, the filmmakers do not seem to have POV and the film is poorly structured and extremely irregular. Very little basic information is provided on all three tracks. Such inclusion might have given the impression that these three people were more than the old stereotypes of West Hollywood.
