What a horrible movie. Full of clich√©s, disturbing scenes, very bad acting and an atractive scenario. It's hard to believe that the same people who wrote The People vs. Larry Flint and Man on the Moon wrote this trash. Dude, that makes my list of the 10 worst movies of all time. This guy, this director, if you can call him that, did he understand that the first problem child was bad enough? Let's do a sequel for her !! ?? Amazing this piece of trash like this one can be shown to kids let alone be released! 1 out of 10 *
