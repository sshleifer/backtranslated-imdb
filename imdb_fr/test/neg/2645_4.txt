It was one of the most mixed films I have ever seen. Everything in the movie seemed to be joined to justify another item that had been stuck. There is even a talking buff who wants to rub his wet nose for magic to happen. Even the brutal father seems to be stuck just to give the kids an excuse to fly into a wagon. It was laughable, but in an uncomfortable way because of the serious subjects that seemed to be used just to stage the plot.
