"No one really knows how power was created, even the Book of Damnation did not record its beginnings, but those who control it have always been driven out." The Ipswich families have formed a silent alliance. blah "After that intro, we suddenly see Take That. Or was it N'Synch? The Backstreet Boys, maybe? Well, I do not know who they belong to, but one thing is certain: the descendants of Salem are boys. Can you distinguish them? I could not If you can tell me which one is which, I would appreciate it a lot. These boys group boys are so similar ?! Seriously now. Is it a horror movie or a movie for teenie-boppers? It's sad that the kind of horror (anyway weak) has been kidnapped by teenagers. And it's one of the most teenagers I've seen so far. The film is visually sound, but the cast is so bland, the game so horrible, it was an attempt to finish the film. As bad as the cast is (after all, the boys' bands and models are rarely good actors), the absolute "star character" in this respect was the guy who played the villain, Sebastian Stan. This guy is overexploited with the worst of the film's story. I have rarely seen anyone make funny faces that are so boring and ridiculous in such a short time. Worse, he has the biggest baby face among all the boy faces in the cast. I mean, it's a joke.
