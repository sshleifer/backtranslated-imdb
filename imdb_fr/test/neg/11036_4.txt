A pretentious collection, but to varying degrees, offers "stories" mostly useless. <br /> <br /> But let's start from the top. <br /> <br /> Kaurismaki: If one wondered what Finnish love / romance was like, maybe this little dull quirk is an indication. Moderate feelings, non-emotions, apathetic faces and a very depressing prospect of moving from Finland to Siberia! I guess the rest of this story will be "For our honeymoon, we are going from Siberia to Greenland". Aki, obviously, did not know what to write for this little movie. So he invented a half-crazy "story" centered on a group he particularly loves (or maybe his friends) because we can watch them and listen to their music more than the two main characters. <br /> <br /> Erice: First of all, I never heard of this guy before ?? and now I know why. Beautiful black and white photos and practically nothing else - unless you get bored stupid can be considered an asset. But you'd be surprised how many film critics and film students love boredom in movies, so I highly recommend Erice's 10-minute rehearsal festival to these two groups of humanoids. <br /> <br /> Herzog: Not a movie, but probably part of his documentaries about tribes of South America. This is not a short film, but a report, but considering how the first two entries were boring, the strand of Herzog is almost refreshing and offers interesting moments. If nothing else fits perfectly with the pretentious concept of "time" of the film. Jarmusch: As we had expected, this once-interesting filmmaker (with the brain of a peanut, a talented dumb savant) once again serves us as drowsiness. He has become lazy and can not be bothered to write anything interesting, either for his own movies or for a collection such as TMO. The only positive side to watching how a weak veggie actress spends 10 minutes in a trailer is that she is played by the charming Chloé Sévigny. Otherwise, ignore these nonsense. Oh, and by the way: I do not think a young actress listens to classical music; Was Jarmusch trying to be surreal by making Chloé listen to this kind of music? Lindsey Lohan maybe listen to opera? Maybe Drew Barrymore is a jazz fan? Who am I to say they are not ?! <br /> <br /> Jim Jarmusch is a jerk. Oh, yes ... I already mentioned this ... <br /> <br /> Wenders: Here's the real shock of the whole movie: Wenders can really do something good !!!!!? All that I have seen of this overrated charlatan has so far been dull and useless. However, this little story is made with style (atypical) and is the best part of the movie. This leaves someone wanting to know more, even if the story has a resolution. <br /> <br /> Spike Lee: Oh, dear Lord ?? What can I say here? Lee gives anyone who looks talented in comparison. Like Herzog, he does not choose a story but submits a report ?? and a left-wing political propaganda report to that! CNN, but in black and white and one-sided, of course. Naturally, "We Wuz Robbed", the delayed title of this little sleep inducer, talks about how the poor, credulous, and infinitely idealistic Democrats WUZ ROBBED of Bush and his team of THIEVES, EVIL EVIL. This is by far the most stupid and boring entry of this movie, and I had to use the fast-forward button to not sleep. Spike Lee is really a product of positive action. God knows how many truly talented (black) directors have never had a chance to make movies because this little pretentious and talentless still has many opportunities. And he is wrong EVERY TIME! Now, it takes a kind of talent, right? <br /> <br /> Kaige: Chinese history is based on solid foundations. It's good, nothing more. <br /> <br /> In summary, there are many better movies you can waste your time on, but if your time is not precious (as it seems to be the case with mine) you can watch this little movie. <br /> <br /> "Ten minutes, it will be an eternity in the hands of anti-masters of the cinema.The time is precious.Lose it for better films." - Fedor Miklowitz, 1588
