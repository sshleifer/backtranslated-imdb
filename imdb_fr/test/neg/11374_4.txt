No matter who PC Enforcers is responsible for this film, you're doing something I never thought possible: taking really talented actors (Davis, Hardin, and Taylor) and making you want to never meet them in a space closed. The feelings behind the story are so stupid and idiotic that it's impossible to understand or imagine which audience would find this image attractive, far less funny. Architecture students maybe? <br /> <br /> Only one scene is visually intelligent: Marcia Gay Hardin sashaying, all wriggling and rhythmic, reaches a bar to breathe more style and energy in ten seconds than the rest of the movie added and multiplied to the tenth power. As for other members of the cast, they probably will not want to put it on their resumes.
