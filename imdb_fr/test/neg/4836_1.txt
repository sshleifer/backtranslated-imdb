and it's only January, I'm always sure! <br /> <br /> This is by far the worst Swedish film I have ever seen and, to be honest, Swedish cinema is not very good in general. It has been claimed that it was "original" and maybe it was seen like that for those who have never seen an English-language film, for us who have been to the cinema for the last 10 years, we do not can not help but feel like Måns Mårlind and Björn Stein have spent a weekend watching the most successful films in recent years and have tried to combine them to form a Swedish package. What can I say, the result can just be ... poor. First of all, the story is weak at first, and even worse, when it's not a mediocre story, it's a wish that combines with very bad stories - first and foremost a failure to attempt to move the Swedish action to the matrix, then a very bad moral story combination. And if you thought it could not be worse, you'll notice all the "cool stuff" that was thrown in there for no reason, but in an evil way, trying to show that Sweden can also make Hollywood movies - which we can not and should not try. For example, the main plot is tempted to deepen it by allowing young people to play a game called Storm that has absolutely nothing to do with history or, for example, the internet that talks about "Storm" while, suddenly, these are the main characters. conscience - really, I do not think even Stein or Mårlind can see a point with three quarters of the movie, much more than trying to show poor additional effects. For the actors, I have to admit that Eric Ericson does a very good job, except that he does the same work throughout the film, even though Storm Storm is trying to be a film about DD's personal development. It does not change in the least. behavior. Jonas Karlsson, well to be honest, I thought he was a rather respected actor, but judging by Storm ... he must be ashamed of this film, his character and his scar. Finally, Eva Röse is just beyond criticism, both her character and acting. The only reasons Storm manages not to get a 1/10 is for Eric Ericson and, what can I say, at least he tries.
