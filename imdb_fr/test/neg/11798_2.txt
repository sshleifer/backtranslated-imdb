Imagine if you want: four teenagers have the mission to spend the night in a haunted house in St. Francisville, Louisiana, to check for the existence of the paranormal. If you look at it in the dark and late at night; you will probably have hair on the back of your neck several times. Otherwise, this fake documentary is a very lazy scam of BLAIR WITCH PROJECT. What needs to be dialogue is very lame and the actors are quite nice, but seem to lack genuine personality. It seems like it's an eternity before something really scary happens. This film is excellent for "sleep nights", when you have your eyes barely open and everyone is yakin and snackin.
