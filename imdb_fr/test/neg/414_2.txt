I am historian This film is so bad that it hurts. Tried to look with an open mind, but if you are going to dive into a movie or anything like that, do at least some homework about the history, the places, the church protocol, et cetera. Stop playing the dumb audience, please. Some of us who put on our shoes and ventured to the theater when something of this nature, worthy of a theatrical release, arrives in town. A little research, all that I ask. But again, the book he's based on is kind of a joke. So, basically, they took a novel with a lot of mistakes and decided to make it a script, to pour in millions and millions of dollars and to do a theatrical release distributed around the world incredibly promoted and nobody never took the time to do some research on the subject. I know several of my colleagues who would have done it for the only credit or at least for giving it to a body of students in the form of a mission of several weeks to study various aspects ?? or just pay a few dollars to someone knowledgeable just to go through it, because believe me, there are many hungry historians who would have jumped at the opportunity if the opportunity arose.
