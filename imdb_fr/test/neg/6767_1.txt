THE RAP, the book on which this movie is based is one of the most difficult books I have ever read. Still, I could not lower it. Raunchy, crude, rude, lustful ... you name it, he had it. He also presented some of the best characterizations of all the novels I have ever read. <br /> <br /> Well, with regard to the film ... it was deplorable. I mean, Tim Mcintire as Wasco? Wasco was the meanest mutha ... who was talking about WASCO ... Mcintire as Wasco, it's like we're pointing to Tim Conway as Charles Manson. <br /> <br /> What happened to the main character of the book? Small Arv. It does not even exist in the movie ... Fast Walking was NOT the main type of book. Why even name credit this thing with the RAP? This film did not capture the spirit, the atmosphere, the meanness or the drama of the book. <br /> <br /> For me, it was not just a disappointment, but a total loss of time and celluloid.
