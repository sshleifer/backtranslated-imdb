Stay away from this movie! It's terrible in every way. Bad action game, a thin parcel recycled and the worst end of the story of the film. I rarely watch a film that causes the irritation of my adrenaline pump. In fact, the only other film that immediately comes to mind is another film called "People in a plane in trouble" (Airspeed). Please, please do not look at this one as it is totally and totally pathetic from start to finish. Helge Iversen
