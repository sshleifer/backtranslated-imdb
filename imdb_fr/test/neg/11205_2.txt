Look, this film is terrible ... "the intrigue" involves twins who are neglected by their egocentric parents and left to the charge of a succession of nannies and babysitters, that children chase in being completely heinous. Finally, Beverly D'Angelo, former convict, will be their new nurse. And D'Angelo is watching a TV talk show on the sale of children and decides that she will try to sell the twins ... well, oh, you do not want to know. All this is very unpleasant and not at all funny. In fact, the advertiser announced this film before it aired on the TV channel I watched! Do not waste the time of your life on this rubbish heap, you know?
