I chose this DVD in Walmart cheepo bin because the cover showed one of the planes I flew in Viet-Nam (C-123k). I was not flying for Air America, but I knew I was a C-123 pilot and I knew a lot of who knew it, including those who had flown in my reserve unit at home. I am not a film critic, but I wonder about the subliminal motivation of filmmakers and authors who make films like this one. The best part of this film must go to the cameraman. Flying fire and waterfalls (although quite like in the cartoon) are excellent. The film begins with the favorite guy in Hollywood in 1969, but the fact is that Nixon did not launch Air America, he did not start the lies. Johnson was responsible for Air America and Nixon inherited the lies, the war and Air America. It's neither fair nor accurate to portray Nixon as a liar about Air America. All presidents have inherited the lies of their predecessors. Nobody was smart enough to fly a C-123 was stupid enough not to know what he was joining. It makes the character of Downey incredible. A C-123 was a crashed plane. It could easily fly on an engine or on both auxiliary reactors. The three mates pulling a duck with a shot are more likely. The pilots flying with Air America were civilian employees of the CIA and not reckless renegade soldiers. They had a good reason to behave and believe in a future if they survived their extremely dangerous job. They had double the time for a retirement pension. They did not have to sell drugs or guns to get a good pension. The drug was legal and a way of life in Eastern Europe, as it is still today in Afghanistan. If individual pilots were trying to make money, it was not CIA policy. The CIA fought communism, not drugs. The author based his story on "war stories". The drivers love the BS who buy them a beer and listen to them. The writer and director who had trouble talking about Viet-Nam and Nixon. Watch the movie and remember how it starts - it blames Nixon for what has been around for years. Remember that he did not become president until January 20, 1969. <br /> <br /> My favorite scene is landing in the jungle. Air America pilots place planes in places that aircraft designers would never have thought possible. There were many funny stories that could have been shown. Instead, the director chose to use the oversized rubber scene to show just how stupid the CIA was. This scene shows that the director and the writer have cracked for a conversation in a bar pilot and that the joke is close to their heart. <br /> <br /> MDS Fort Valley, Virginia.
