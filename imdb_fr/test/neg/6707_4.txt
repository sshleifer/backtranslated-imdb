In simple terms, I was incredibly disappointed. I'm a big fan of Asian Horror, and I can watch unoriginality (I myself liked "The Red Shoes" and "Phone"), but it was just mediocre. <br /> <br /> The film has a lot of elements of very high quality: the photography is catchy, the visuals are cool, the staging is inspired, the acting is very good, the music is soft for the ears and the CGI is amazing. But, as it is a horror movie, we should be scared, which will not happen with this movie. As with most South Korean horrors, this is not original from start to finish: there is the long-haired, vengeful female ghost, menacing tufts of thick black hair and puddles of water, and towards the end, a twist that * almost *, but not quite logical at all (twisting is easily one of the best qualities). And, to the great irritation of the viewer, when the film does not recycle (sometimes, it is so accurate that it could easily be called plagiarism) images of another film, it makes you jump. A lot. And by jumps, I do not mean jumping things or anything, but VERY loud noises and screams in the soundtrack used to make the audience leap six feet into the air (there are even a few moments of "do-jumping" which are simply exasperating). And when it is not archiving other movies, it's boring and difficult to handle. <br /> <br /> And it's a shame, because "Ryeong" could easily have been really good, and it has everything to do to make it good, but it's the boring overuse of loud noises and completely predictable jump fears that end up ruining the movie. This is a perfect example of its quality: there is a moment when one of the characters looks at a corpse and without sound, the corpse turns around. It's totally predictable, but the use of silence in this scene is brilliant. And unfortunately, it's as scary as the movie did to me. <br /> <br /> Certainly, "Ryeong" has some good features, and even some jumps that are not as predictable and work. A very good and sad story is used to explain the events, and the turning point is rather unpredictable. These are the only things that separate the film from any other Asian horror / ghost film. But the problem with these is that even if they work, they have already been used (fans of J-Horror will easily realize that the great unveiling was inspired by "A Tale of Two Sisters"). fifty minutes to go forward. <br /> <br /> So in the end, "Ryong" really seems to be a really messed up opportunity. Tae-kyeong Kim hoped that the plot and other interesting features would serve as a diversion so that the public did not notice the huge flaws. But he failed and well ... We noticed everything. <br /> <br /> My rating: 4/10.
