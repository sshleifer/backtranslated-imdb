I just watched this movie and I was pretty disappointed. At first, I did not expect much, because the premise of the film does not suggest any size. Unfortunately, he can not even offer such stupid entertainment. The main problem is probably the acting game. Although I have seen much worse actors in much worse movies, the story would require that some people act as violent maniacs, others like people trapped in a really stressful situation, and they fail to do it. Although I watched the German version that I watched with the original audio, it is by no means a bad voice off or otherwise. On top of that, the German DVD seems to have been cut, the murders are all pretty much left out, which means that with the exception of some semi-bloody scenes closer to the end, the German version does not not as a film for "Gore- dogs", either. I can not comment on this for other versions of course. The plot has some dumb moments thrown here and there and the beginning is just hilarious (never heard of a demon visiting a psychiatrist?). Too bad the movie takes too much seriously, if it had been shot as a horror comedy and changed a little here and there, it might have worked better. The end is just a huge disappointment. <br /> <br /> If you really have nothing better to do and can not stand boredom anymore, you could (and it's really a "weak" power) consider this movie. If there is something else to watch or do: Choose this alternative.
