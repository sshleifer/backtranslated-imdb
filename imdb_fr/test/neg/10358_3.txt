Cruddy, innocent..not smoking, drinking or riding a bike, but Jeremy Slate (good actor) and Jocelyn Lane (good actress) make this morally possible for a bad biker movie, a time later (biker). They knew it, we knew it ... Adam Roarke and Slate are wasted ... but they survived. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10. Best performance = Jocelyn Lane. Lane is really the ONLY catch of the final biker exploit movie after RUN, ANGEL, RUN (who also has good actors - like Don Stroud, etc.). It was finished. They knew it. They were trying to make a living. But, Jocelyn Lane (shot from two bad movies of Elvis, TICKLE ME and another bad) in yellow and leather is the modern pervert with J. Slate fighting for honor. It's worth the trip, but it sucks. But check. Good non-biker, non-smoker, non-alcoholic, type "biker" with hot girls.
