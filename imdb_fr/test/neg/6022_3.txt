This film was a complete waste of time. It's just a gangster movie. It contains a very predictable plot. My feelings are insensitive to the characters and the dialogue is mediocre at best. Half the time, you're looking for something else to do, because the movie is so boring, since you already know what's going to happen. The other half of the time, you desperately hope that the protagonist is carrying a pair of bullets or just ends his life by jumping off a bridge or something. In addition, the secondary characters are mostly unidimensional. There is no depth to any of the characters in this movie! No depth!
