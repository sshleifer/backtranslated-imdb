It's a standard action movie, as we have seen many times before. Not a lot of action in this one though. Again, this is the guy who protects the president. He is macho - as usual, and at the same time sweet and melancholy - as usual. Does he have the courage to take a ball for the president ?! And then there is the girl and the usual curator who flirts. Stereotypic and predictable at the last minute.
