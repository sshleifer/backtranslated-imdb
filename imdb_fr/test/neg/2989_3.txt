I have seen comments from Turks (which I am not) stating that this film is fantastic and accurately portrays Turkish life. All I have to say is ... Turkey must be one of the most boring and depressing places in the world, because in my opinion, that's exactly what this film was for me. If I were Turkish, I think it would have had a bigger impact. But if you are not from Turkey, I would advise you not to lose two hours of your life on this subject. <br /> <br /> "Distant" seems to drag on forever. Many scenes are laboriously long, useless or very little. I do not understand the goals of the director including even a lot of scenes. It is stated that the director used his own car, his apartment and his friends to make the film ... Well, guess what? This shows. It seems small budget. The acting is poor. If it's a cultural affair, then so be it. I just do not understand the purpose of basing a movie on this story. It's incredibly boring.
