A big disappointment for what was presented as an incredible movie. Incredibly bad. Very pretentious. It would be nice if, one time, someone created a leading role for a young woman who was not a prostitute. <br /> <br /> We do not learn anything about this character except that he seems to be a hopeless alcoholic. We do not know why. As usual, Nicholas Cage has an excellent performance, but I think that role and scenario have let him down. And how, after being unable to play throughout the film, can he have an erection on his deathbed? Really terrible and I felt that I needed a bath.
