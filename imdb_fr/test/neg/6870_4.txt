There are really very few positive things to say about this movie. Walter Pidgeon is a very unconvincing hero and more when he tries to be "undercover" as a villain who, we believe, drinks too much and strikes his wife a little. Margaret Leighton, as a wench / undercover sergeant, is a bit more convincing, but it's still hard to believe that a hood worthy of the name would not have seen her charade in less than a minute. The plot, about a sellout, is stupid, and the action hangs rather than handles. David Tomlinson, who plays Algy in the same way that David Tomlinson seems to play all his roles, is the only glimmer of hope in a completely dull affair.
