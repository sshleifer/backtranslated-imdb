From Kreestos: <br /> <br /> The dialogue is terrible, terrible, drivel. Act poor. Many flaws of the plot. I do not recommend it at all. <br /> <br /> From Wikipedia: <br /> <br /> Artistic Licenses The manuscript of the score is attributed to two copyists [1], both male. , not a woman as it is described in the film. <br /> <br /> The copyists neither contributed nor modified the score. In fact, they were reprimanded by Beethoven for any deviation from the original score. <br /> <br /> The film takes place in 1824 during the composition of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. Throughout the film, Beethoven has been hard to hear but quite capable of understanding people who speak loudly. In reality, Beethoven had lost much of his audience seven years earlier (1817). Beethoven has never known permanent deafness; his condition fluctuated between total silence and terrible tinnitus. The Ninth Symphony was composed at a time when Beethoven's audience had seriously deteriorated. At this point in his life, Beethoven's conversations were mostly facilitated by the use of notebooks. It can be said, however, that he was also able to read people's lips, as evidenced by his insistence that people face him when they spoke to him. <br /> <br /> In the film, Beethoven alludes to Moonlight Sonata. This is an anachronism since the Sonata No. 14 "quasi una fantasia" was named "Moonlight" only several years after his death.
