If you're an ordinary guy like me and you like acting, good storyline, good scripts, new ideas, or having fun, you might want to ignore this one. Honestly, I was bored of the opening credits until the end, but I tried to give the film a chance and I watched it all the way - I was only disappointed at every turn. <br /> <br /> unbelievably below normal, but I'm not sure if the actors themselves are to blame or if it was a ridiculously woody and horrible dialogue associated with an even worse scenario. The plot is very vague and underdeveloped and I think the audience is supposed to draw deeper meaning from it, or to be able to look beyond it, but honestly it would be a waste of time. <Br /> <br /> The film has a kind of crude sexuality that is useless to show tattoos and lingerie. Nobody seems to have any motivation, except to earn money through some kind of "investment" agreement that is never explained. The links between the characters are not very clear and there is little or no character development. <br /> <br /> This is a subculture movie meant for a very specific audience or absolute shit, but you can decide for yourself. <br /> <br /> I gave him a 2 because it's definitely one of the worst movies I've ever seen, but it's probably NOT the worst.
