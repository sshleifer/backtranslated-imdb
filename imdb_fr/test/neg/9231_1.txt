It is unfortunate that some people find this film interesting to watch. I am Russian and I am disgusted. There is nothing in this film that deserves praise, except cinematography. However, I am not one of those who find beauty in death or perversion. I think this film is poorly designed and made. There is nothing more irritating and even enraging than shameless speculation in art (if you can call it a trash art). Balabanov wanted to shock the audience with an omnipresent evil and managed to create a desperately dark movie. But the biggest shock is the work of Balabanov's original leadership. I would never advise any of my friends to watch it. Huge disappointment!
