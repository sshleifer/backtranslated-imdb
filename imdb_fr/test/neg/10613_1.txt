Young writers, young writers, young actors, buses filled with producers, what could go wrong? All. Even lame is a description too good, suggesting that three legs out of four worked well, while none of them worked. Barely enough intrigue recycled for a 48-minute television hour, stretched to 90 minutes. The audience spoke on the screen, so bad was the story. Dirty cops steal drugs from the evidence bin. How many thousands of times has this been done on television? Bad cops frame the good cops. Again, how many times? There was not an original piece in all this preparation. Giovanni Ribisi made a valiant effort to fill the lack of script, pulling the only bursts of laughter from the entire film. And the idea that he and Claire Danes are working from a real scenario with an adult director and photographed by a real director of photography intrigues me. Note to screenwriters: Purchase one of these story generators. It can not be as bad as snatching a bad television. Note to author: There are other plans than close-ups. Even the charming and interesting face of Claire Danes eventually becomes tiring in close-up. Note to Director of Photography: Teach yourself to a professional for a few years - you have a lot to learn. Note to the Chronometer in the lab: Try at least to persuade the author and the filmmaker that they do not know what they are talking about. Note to Claire: I hope it paid for your new condo. It's time to get professional management and start reading the scripts before you log in.
