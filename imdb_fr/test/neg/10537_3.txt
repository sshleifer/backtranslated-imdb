This is, for different reasons, a very very bad action movie. First of all, Seagal is terribly bad. He looks old and fat, plays like he has to fulfill a boring obligation and his fight scenes require a creative edition or a simple replacement. Second, his opponent is a very weak villain. He's a smart and naughty mastermind that Chestnut does not deliver. So what about action? Well, both parties are shooting at different places in Alcatraz prison all the time. They shoot fiercely and badly, because compared to the amount of ammunition required, the death toll is rather low. There is nothing to save this movie. There is not one good line and not one good joke. The psychological interlude with 49er One and Judge McPherson is ridiculous. So what does he have? Well, the usual Bell helicopters, silhouettes parading in the blue light and slow motion, bullet-riddled doors and 1000-watt lights through the holes, characters flying through the air, tons of weapons coming from nowhere, bold black guy and a thin wooden box containing 25 tons of gold. The pain continues until the last take, a hopeless approach to lighten closing credits. California beachboy Don Michael Paul was writing and performing. At least this mountain of boredom comes from a simple mind.
