I guess I was actually expecting a Bollywood remake of "The Fog", but it's more like a Bollywood remake of "I know what you did last summer," with some elements of "Scream", somehow, somehow, and not very good either. Apart from some very entertaining numbers of songs and dances, it's pretty awful. It obviously has a decent budget and yet, it wastes warmed leftovers that were not so tasty at first. A young woman is threatened by a scary guy not registering for a beauty contest, because he wants his sister to win (fortunately, she does not look as scary as her brother), but she comes in when even and wins, and of course the scary guy comes after her and is killed, after which a game causing "hides the body". Of course, the body disappears and nobody seems to know why, but someone knows it and waits for the end to reveal a ridiculous scenario. Some clever dance numbers, especially the dance number celebrating at Simran's party, the girl who won the beauty contest ... are very colorful, well played and really fun, and they are completely lost. terrible movie. I would much rather watch an old Ramsay film than this piece of shit, though somebody thought it was not necessary to make them available, which is a crime in itself. But not as serious as this movie. I took one for the team watching this one, so follow my advice, do not bother. 2 out of 10
