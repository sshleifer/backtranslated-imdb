I do not really remember this film except that there was a distinctly free destruction of lighting. Almost every fight scene included the unnecessary and indiscriminate destruction of useful fixtures, even though they were equipped with 70's cheese-style cylindrical shades, which would remain true to the story. On one occasion, a raucous lamp was destroyed in a domestic battle scene between the brothers in the living rooms and dining rooms of their mother's house, the appliances of the two rooms having been removed. However, the most malicious destruction occurs a few moments later in the office of a bookmaker and includes, but is not limited to, the overturning of a device with a ceramic horse head base, which is therefore disintegrated, and the severe gash of a cylindrical hue The guy falls back in during another fight of punches. Later, this lamp is also knocked down when the guy is shot down, resulting in additional damage to the plastic-covered shade. <br /> <br /> This film encourages a particularly wasteful attitude towards lamps, but we must not forget that lamps, whatever their inexpensive construction or their left and very heavy appearance, remain valuable for the enlightenment they provide. However, if you feel the need to break a lamp by proxy, I would highly recommend this movie.
