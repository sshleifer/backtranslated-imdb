I rented this movie because I noticed the cover of the video rental store. I saw Nolte, Connely, Madsen, in her forties, and I thought, "Hmm, that can not be too bad." Unfortunately, after looking at it, my impression was "not too good". <br /> <br /> It's a kind of scam in Chinatown, but the worst part is that, other than Nolte, the other team members do not have enough time to do it. 'screen. But it's a decent movie to see once, I guess. And Melanie's role was so small that she did not give him a chance to be a nuisance.
