When I'm sitting after watching Ashes of Time, Wong Kar-wai's 1994 film? more precisely the reissue 2008 and the reissue with the word 'Redux' slapped at the end of the title ?? I wonder what was wrong I wonder why the movie just did not work. I wonder why the film failed to score important points in my book. In particular, how did the film drag the film down and make it the worst film of his career for the director? <br /> <br /> Well, it's not too hard to really understand. Let me just say that it is a shame that Kar-wai has fallen so suddenly into this hell of mediocrity and misery, especially the fact that in the same year he published Chungking Express, one of his persistent legacy and an absolutely sublime film. So ?? What did not go well? It would be appropriate to consider Ashes of Time as an experimental film. Our director essentially installs his inimitable style of film making and places it in a completely different setting, atmosphere and atmosphere; the result is a catastrophic film that is everywhere and simply does not work. It would be even wiser to call Ashes of Time a failed experiment. Audacious, bold and innovative, but a failure anyway. <br /> <br /> Let me elaborate. Those who have seen the films of Mr. Kar-wai, a Hong Kong-born filmmaker who has marked the art world since its beginnings in the late 1980s, will know that there is a primordial aesthetic that links all of his films together; for the most part and frankly, they are all colorful, stimulating, lovable, subtly humorous and meaningful evocations of life, love and loss. The same formula is transposed into ashes of time; However, the usual setting of Hong Kong is omnipresent and, instead, we find ourselves within the framework of ancient China and the land of the legendary warriors of martial arts and clan members. <br /> <br /> entangled in this place. The quasi-adventure / caper story is the typical love story of Kar-wai, this time involving a hit-elegist who settled in the middle of the desert and executes fixed-price murders. However, I have to stop there; The description of the characters is a useless thing to do. Why? Because no character in Ashes of Time deserves to be mentioned. What a bland cast and what a waste of talent (the case of Ashes of Time includes almost all the usual collaborators of kar-wai). <br /> <br /> In addition to that, the film is essentially endless. frightening narrative structure, almost non-existent. One of the main reasons critics of Ashes of Time criticize it is that it seems to have no plot, much less a semblance or an indication of it. You can certainly see where they are, even after the first two or three minutes, maybe less, of the movie. Perhaps it is simply the atypical framework of ancient China that is unusual and inappropriate for the typical Kar-wai film style. I like to think, however unfortunate, that Mr. Kar-wai has just gained a lot of time here. <br /> <br /> One thing that a proofreader can actually compliment in Ashes of Time, although complimenting is stellly isolated, is another director's trademark? wonderful aesthetic, colorful and happy. What joyous color is composed on the screen, what glorious textures are painted for us and what breathtaking landscapes and images are captured for us throughout the film. We can at least consider this as a sign that Wong Kar-wai is still at the center of his concerns and that this film is so atypical and hides its generally commendable nuance. Although the visuals are not enough to allow us to fully absolve Kar-wai from this disastrous venture, are they enough to make the film worthy of interest? and at least we do not leave the film with a completely scathing mood, now that there is something we can think nicely about. <br /> <br /> The film is essentially a film "art wuxia", following the manner of the legendary Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa. However, one thing distinguishes Karwai's film from Kurosawa's best films, and that is that in Japanese director's films, everything just gels and works. In Ashes of Time, nothing seems to work. Kar-wai's attempt to make a truly profound film about wuxia, not to mention an intellectual and provocative film in general, is a futile undertaking. <br /> <br /> Kar-wai claims that doing Ashes of Time has exhausted him, and that he needs time to clear his head. This must have been a tiring effort on his part, as his efforts are incorporated into the film and transferred directly to us ?? I mean, just watching the movie is an exhausting effort, and now I need time to clear my head of this unpleasant shooting experience.
