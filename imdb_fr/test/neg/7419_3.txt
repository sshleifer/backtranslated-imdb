A minute in THE UNTOLD and the techniques of THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT and PREDATOR have already been ripped off. Does this mean that we will see many trees? We are going of course. Will we see an Austrian bodybuilder blow up things? Although this film has the budget of a TVM, the answer is a categorical no. Does anyone like these soft porn shows like BEDTIME STORIES? Well because there is a scene that looks like this type of shows. Unfortunately, the only thing you see is cellulite. Do you like it when the screen goes black during a TVM? Great because it happens between each scene of THE UNTOLD. In fact, this also happens at every scene. Did you enjoy MILLIONAIRE - A MAJOR FRAUD? Fantastic because one of the characters looks like a bearded, Major Charles Ingram, the competitor who tried to rip off the show to a million pounds. Seriously, one of the characters looks like Major Ingram. I was still expecting him to say, "It's a bear, it could be a bear, but it could be a crowbar <Cough, cough>, yes it's a pied-Ã -terre <Cough>, it's really a bigfoot <Cough> Yes, "I'm going to turn it. Final answer Chris "<br /> <br /> Oh, and have I already mentioned that all the above is the good? <br /> <br /> The INVITABLE is not the worst bigfoot J movie I've never seen this distinction give way to NIGHT OF THE DEMON, which I saw more than twenty years ago, and I think I've seen less than a dozen worst movies ever. , THE UNTOLD is still a very bad film in almost every aspect, including editing.As other critics have pointed out, it seems that whole pieces of the film are missing, while there are other pieces where the scenes are put together in the wrong order, it's a very bad movie that deserves a lot less than its 5.1 rating, I give it 3 out of 10 and I'm very nice
