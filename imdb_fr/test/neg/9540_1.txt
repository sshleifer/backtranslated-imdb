Move on Manos. Move back Boogens. It does not take a baby genius to know that Malibu Beach Vampires (MBV for the rest of this book) is now and always will be (unless someone makes a sequel to Zarkorr The Invader) the worst movie of all time. The only horror of this thing is to watch. I wonder if it was an attempt for someone to meet girls while making a movie. If that's the case, the girls are not like that, it's not a movie. It's dreck. No wait. I dishonor the word dreck by calling it dreck. Ulli Lommel (celebrity Boogey Man) would call it "uber dreck" or Schei√üe. It should be used to torture prisoners. If you find it on a shelf of a video store, move away slowly and warn the authorities.
