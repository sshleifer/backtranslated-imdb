Poor Diane Arbus (whatever she is). According to this film, not only was she a brat on the upper side of the East, spoiled but sweet, she was a bad wife, a bad mother, a terrible business partner; Moreover, there is no evidence in this image that she was an artist, except for the bold statement of the prologue. <br /> <br /> Nicole Kidman, who is incredibly more attractive today than 25 years ago and looks younger, is indeed giving a great performance; but what can an actress do with a woman and a mother who seeks and falls in love with an incredibly strange guy who looks like a werewolf and lives in the apartment on the upper floor? Set in the early 1970s, Manhattan was a virtual magnet for monsters and quirks of all shapes and sizes, most of them not like human hairballs; So why is this case worthy of a 122-minute film? <br /> <br /> Robert Downey Jr. was one of my favorites, but I would say that his well-known and prolonged use of drugs has resulted in casualties. One would think that he would be reluctant to play a film about drug use as casually as smoking cigarettes. <br /> <br /> FUR has already been beaten at the box office, but considering those who scored a score of 10 for this unfounded slice of junk, I would say, stain, McGee.
