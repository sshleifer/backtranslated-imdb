From time to time, it is highly recommended to the aristocracy to watch a silent movie about the hard life of ordinary people in order to remember the privileges and comfortable life they have enjoyed since the beginning of humanity or even before. In comparison with the difficult and difficult work that ordinary people have to endure every day since the aristocrats rule the world. <br /> <br /> And that's what happens in "The Love Light", the first film directed by Dame France Marion who will be famous then in the silent and talkative world thanks to her work as a screenwriter; better for her, certainly, because his career as a filmmaker does not impress this German count. <br /> <br /> The film tells the story of Lady Angela Carlotti (Dame Mary Pickford), a cheerful Italian who lives surrounded by a "picturesque painter" (an important difference of opinion between upper classes and classes inferior, aristocrats prefer to live surrounded by "picturesque luxury" ??); she has two brothers and a secret admirer, but she only gives him indifference. Fate begins to work hard and very quickly, the war is declared and the two brothers of Lady Angela enlist and died in the next roll. But the fate is even more cruel and Lady Angela, meanwhile, falls in love with ?? a German!! And to make matters worse, she does not know that her Teutonic darling is a spy and that the light signals she sends him every night from the lighthouse, she keeps thinking that it is a signal of love, does not want to say "Ich Liebe Dich" but "sinks any Italian boat at sea" ?? <br /> <br /> Fortunately for Lady Angela, her German spy will soon be found by the neighbors of her house where she hid it strange indeed, because it is not an easy task for a German to go unnoticed but the German spy will prefer to die before being captured by these Italians. <br /> <br /> From this German love, a half-Teutonic baby will be born (the perverse Destiny at full speed ??) but an avid neighbor who has a particular idea of ​​motherhood will take away his son with the consent of a Catholic nun who pushed the Council of Trent to the extreme ?? It is a fact that will put Lady Angela on the edge of madness. <br /> <br /> But in the meantime Lady Angela's secret admirer has returned from the war and you may think that Lady Angela's painful life will finally improve; a huge mistake because Destiny tells him that the returning soldier is blind. But as we say in Germany, it can be a blessing in disguise and Lady Angela will find her son and start a new life with her blind darling in a poor Italian village in what is supposed to be a happy ending for the common people. <br /> <br /> As said this German count, he was much better than Dame Frances Marion continues his career as a screenwriter, because as can be seen in "The Love Light", she had a lot of imagination to invent incredible stories, ja wohl! ?? but a completely different subject is filmmaking, and her silent debut lacks emotion and rhythm despite Lady Pickford's efforts to engage the public in her many scandals. The non-existent film narrative causes the spectator's indifference, which makes it a kind of film where only Lady Pickford herself arouses interest and not her circumstances. <br /> <br /> And now, if you will allow me, I must temporarily take leave because this German count must send Morse signals from the north tower of the castle to one of his wealthy Teutonic heirs.
