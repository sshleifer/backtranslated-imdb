What can I say about THE PLEASURE PLANET that I have never said about many other tedious porn movies? Very little . It's just another film with a very weak plot, used to set up very unconvincing scenes between non-male actors who spend too much time at the gym and bimbos who have obviously had silicon implants. In fact, the sex scenes in this movie are a little less compelling than what you usually see in this type of movie, with members of the cast grazing their hips giving painful expressions as if they had constipation or something of the kind. No wonder many people claim that sex is overrated, they have probably watched too much of these movies on cable channels late at night
