I could not stand the woman playing the mother. I wanted her to be quiet. She had a weird way of talking and the lines she had been given to read did not make it any better. I did not know why the men of the city were so involved with her to cause all these problems, except that in a city populated by men she seemed to be the only woman over ten years old and under sixty years old. Even after a terrible tragedy, her voice was devoid of human emotion, she seemed to be unable to grasp the events of her life. She delivered her replicas with the same emotion, that she say "I love you", "I hate you", "the bank seizes", "my dress is on fire". Was it shot in Ireland? The sun was blazing throughout the film and the characters seemed surprised by a downpour during the grape harvest. I lived in Ireland in the summer of 2002, the wettest summer of the century. Almost everything was still harvested. If Irish farmers could only harvest for long dry periods, the country would have starved itself hundreds of years ago. It seems that there is not much money to make the film. The black and white flashbacks seemed to have been filmed with security cameras that can be obtained at Sam's Club.
