The '70s were without a doubt the golden age of the horror of "made for television". This is one of those that was probably shot as an ABC movie of the week. This is the old story of a house and / or ghost with one of the new owners. The film promised, but it never came true. Everything is too hasty. Tension and suspense need time to develop and grow. And there is nothing new. We have already seen everything and better. <br /> <br /> One last thought: I do not understand why the character of Robert Wagner would fall under the spell of the deceased movie star when he will be married to Kate Jackson for the sake of God! !!
