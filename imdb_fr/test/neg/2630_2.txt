It's easily one of the worst movies I have seen in many years. I started watching the movie without much delay and that's exactly what it delivered .... not much! In fact, it resulted in even less than I expected. My first reaction when I saw the first parts of the film was that I would probably end up calling it "4". I thought the photographs and the haunting atmosphere seemed reasonably good. <br /> <br /> As the film progressed, the odds continued to fluctuate in my mind, mainly because of the pedestrian play and the conspiracy to be just stupid and tasteless at first, to be at the once silly and repulsive towards the end. At the end of the film, I was ready to give no more than a "1". <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time and money with this one.
