* THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS ... OR MAY NOT BE. WARNING IS THE SAME FOR ALL * <br /> <br /> Dang it. Just when I thought that SCIFI Channel had used all its ridiculous ideas for cinema, they gave us this. In fact, the plot itself is nothing that we have ever seen in movies like Snakes On A Plane, Deep Blue Sea, etc. This means that a monster / animal / some kind of threat is hiding in a close environment threatening a person. In this case, a stranger in a train. Wow. <br /> <br /> I must say that when I saw this thing for the first time on a cable, I could not help laughing. No SCIFI movie had prepared me for that; it was so incredibly pathetic that I could not believe it! The actors are all a group of stereotypical characters. But since they are not so famous (to say the least), I did not expect much from them. Except Diamond Phillips. No comments there, but I think the guy was desperate to find a job. The problem was something called "special effects", horrible even for the SCIFI channel standards. This model / toy they made us believe it was a real train (not to mention the model / toy helicopter, bigger than a train wagon), the meteor arriving HORIZONTALLY from the space, the extraterrestrial "baby" (a sock puppet, and I'm not fucked), the regular aliens who looked pretty ugly ... while they were static; when they started to "move", it was awful, the explosions (the terrorist literally exploded!) And what about the helicopter explosion! How many barrels of gas were they carrying? a school problem correctly!) ... And I will not talk about this fateful end, at that time, I did not know whether to continue laughing or start crying. If I remember correctly, I did both. <br /> <br /> It's an ideal movie to laugh, alone or with friends. But be warned; it's so ridiculous to have so many levels ... and you need a lot of suspension of disbelief ...
