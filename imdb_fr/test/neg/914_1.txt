Oh my god, I suffered from watching this film FOUR times at my sisters. Was it a story of cheap sex and firearms and inexplicable acts at a very cheap price, unless you have to look at it, Ja Rule just proved that he could not act Ving Rhames also played the most formidable role in any of his films. No part of this film made me laugh or startle or feel any emotion. I would be surprised if people really appreciate this movie. but it would be in my five worst movies of my life, the music was not good and the screenplay was composed by a couple of guys who ordered a pizza and sat down, they wrote ten points and turned into movie. absolutely terrible
