After looking for this farm for months and then accidentally buying it cheaply, it was disappointing. I heard about it on a DVD-R site and it sounded crazy. <br /> <br /> But no, what I got was a very bad movie about martial arts. Kung-fu-ing was not that bad, but the rest of the movie was pretty awful and made the movie look really long, much longer than 85 minutes of execution. <br /> <br /> A good thing to note, the monkey was funny for a few seconds (especially when I think they took the only close-up of his face from another movie), and the black guy that popped up halfway was funny because of the only line he said, which in itself made all blacks look like complete simpletons. <br /> <br /> But that was not enough, unfortunately. <br /> <br /> 4/10
