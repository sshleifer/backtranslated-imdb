Is it possible to give a score of 0 out of 10? Because this one deserves it. Although I'm not a big fan of Jane Austen's books, I attended this one with two women. Well, at least we had a big laugh about the seriousness of this movie. Robert Hardy was the only actor to have a total charisma, although he did too much as usual (almost as bad as William Shatner). But that was not enough to save this stink of total suckitude. It's often difficult to separate the girl's dream sequences from what's really happening, and there are so many holes in the story that you can barely understand what's going on. Too many loose ends and the end looks like a paroxysm "again next week". The lead actress is too sordid and looks odd to be a hero, the main actor is too clumsy and effeminate to be a convincing hero and the music looks like some kind of cheap animal project from the hippie girl of the director (I mean the saxophone, mixed with a kind of opera and opera, so in conclusion, I suggest you blow up the budget and order a DVD of it as soon as possible. like disappointment.
