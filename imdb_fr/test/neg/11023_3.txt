Since I bought the DVD, I've watched as many things as I did about my wallet. <br /> <br /> The plot has Kirk Douglas as the first successful novelist who hired Laraine Day a secretary falls in love and marries her. Complications ensue. <br /> <br /> Douglas is generally perceived as an intense actor, charged with very dramatic roles, sometimes of heroes, sometimes of rat. It is not bad in this completely comic part. The problem is that the piece is not particularly comical or anything else. <br /> <br /> The plot continues. A dozen "weird" characters come and go, mainly Keenan Wynn as Douglas's friend who just makes twisted comments. Thelma Ritter was better at this kind of thing. <br /> <br /> Well, if the plot is weak, it could still have been saved by a spark in the dialogue, but there is none to talk about. Some gags are stupid. Others do not erase this bar. Here is what I thought was a fun line. Douglas has just hired Day and wants to drive her to the beach house and seduce her. Day is troubled and notices that she has never heard of a writer working in a beach house. Wynn asks if she liked Douglas' previous book, "Last Year's Love". Yes, of course she did it. "Well, most of" The Last Year "took place in the beach house." Ha ha. <br /> <br /> Nice casting, including support, but a failed comedy. There have been better sitcoms on television.
