The film begins in a rather promising way. The use of images and short clips gives a more complete picture of the story, which would normally require a considerably larger budget than the one presented here. However, it started worrying while it was going on, combined with another over-crowded Max Payne-like voice in the movie, was starting to look less good. I was hoping it was just the introduction of the story. <br /> <br /> The story is what really caught me and brought me to this movie. The idea that a researcher created a virus that actually protects the cells that it infects from other infections was an interesting scientific idea. Then, the subjects who had the most bizarre disorders searched for the scientist and offered to be his human experiences, which made me think that it was a very good little film. However, the introduction did not go well. <br /> <br /> It seems that the film changed pace as the film turned to recorded interviews with the four main characters of the film, the test subjects. Although the acting is not superb, there seemed to be plenty of character development possibilities throughout the film, and the recordings were very well done with a varied mix of characters. However, these disappeared in the film. They were not used anymore after a few short clips and I felt that it was a missed opportunity to offer a good development of the character by thinking about it, but that was not the case. <br /> <br /> images are increasingly disconnected from history, repeating themselves often to represent something that is still happening. This disconnection and repetition are reflected in the annoying and distracting comments. He started reciting words one after the other. Short sentences, devoid of meaning, and which recite no scientific criticism too relevant or interesting. If there was something to describe, four or five words would be used, it was too long, repetitive, circular, loop, ... you see the idea. <br /> <br /> This could have been the case to reflect confusion and character, slowly becoming caught up in his own thoughts, disjointed by lack of food and water. What it really did was that I completely turned away from the voice and at the end of the film, I noticed that I had not listened to some of the ramblings. <br /> <br /> Many times. that an event occurs, the camera shows all the characters one after another for their reaction, which seems to be somewhere between confused and thoughtful. There are repeated fades of the same scene at the same scene, for example a sleeping character becomes black, then comes back to the sleeping character again. Look, we know that the character is asleep, we know that time has passed, please continue. Overall, there are too many atmospheric cuts and long shots hanging over time. <br /> <br /> The acting was not bad, and the characters were good, but not exploited or developed. When they interacted, there were really cringeworthy moments. For example, when one of them asks if he is hungry, the camera looks at each of them and returns to a group photo, they pause, look at each other, turn to the camera and slowly say "No ". He raised a sneer or two. Their dialogue was slow, brilliant, and they were totally or totally useless; there seemed to be no middle ground where the dialogue fell. <br /> <br /> However, there were some good scenes, but they were really hard to come by unless you look at them in isolation, and here's what it looks like almost happened with this movie. The film was considered as a series of scenes and not as a complete narrative. <br /> <br /> Nowhere is this seen more than in the main scenario. The characters are infected with the virus that kills animals, the one that was designed for them. We are told that it develops in stages in something dramatic, and that is what we expect. What we get are the characters who eat tons of food together, all vomiting once together, water coming out of their mouths in unconvincing streams, then falling asleep, these are the phases that take place all very early in the film. Then they all say "good" together when asked how they are doing, and that's it. It's the virus done, nothing else happens. <br /> <br /> It could have been much more done with this movie, so much more developed with the virus and protecting it from all kinds of damage. He could have explored a serious change in these characters as he infected them and taken them, he could have developed these characters, show them making decisions and doing things that relate to their characters. , shown in the flashbacks of the interviews. <br /> The end is not even confusing, intriguing or provocative. It just shows that something is happening and that's all, albeit in the long, extended style with the irritating voice on it. I really struggled with this film and saw a number of members of the press go out (including a famous TV critic coming out in the first twenty minutes). I stayed, but I missed the time lost.
