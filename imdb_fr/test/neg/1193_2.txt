I am a big fan of the LoG. I thought the first two shows offered the best comedy this country has ever seen and the third, albeit different, was wonderfully dark and imaginative. The thought of seeing Tubbs, Edward and Briss on the big screen made it wait until July 3rd. Yet somewhere, everything went terribly wrong. Writers had no history and no real ideas. The game in Old England showed the brilliance of the League, but these scenes did not fit well with the film. Geoff provided the best of too little, mostly poor jokes and the performances of Lipp and Briss were very disappointing. If you like the League, save time and money and watch episodes of the TV series again. And even. A massive disappointment.
