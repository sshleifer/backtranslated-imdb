I just watched this movie with some friends. They told me that I had to see him, but from the beginning I knew that everything would go from bad to worse. So I can only give a 1 to this film because the effects that were used were so badly used and thought that everyone could see that there were no "real" ghosts. I think the worst thing is that this so-called "old haunted house" contained a whole series of new objects and some "well-placed objects". I could have imagined effects that would have been much better than a ghost spilled chair (or should I say thread). Then later, when they examine the tape of the chair, he turns around in a different way. Uh Oh it's a big mistake of continuity. If it was really a good film, they would have taken it and all the other objects of the "old house". This film is like a house scam on a haunted hill and the Blair witch project is embedded in a poorly thought out and poorly assembled movie. I would be ashamed to show you something so unpleasant in terms of acting, effects and good video shots of the girls' chests and the ease with which the camera falls when something "paranormal" is happening. product. This film is an insult to people looking for ghosts and getting real pictures of ghosts on tape.
