As someone has already mentioned on this chart, it is very difficult to make a fake documentary. This requires extraordinary skill, steady pace, patience, a "director distance", a plausible premise, a "narrative flow" and a REALLY credible acting game (aka BIG game). <br /> <br /> This is not the case with "Love Machine". He begins to show his fake hand after 20 minutes (and there are 60 minutes left to watch), and the viewer begins to realize that he is being cared for. It's downhill. <br /> <br /> Director Gordon Eriksen has just peaked too early. But, to be fair to Eriksen, his problems started early: as he explains in the supplements, he started wanting to make a real doc, could not get funding and opted for a cheaper way to to make his film. <br /> <The premise - people who have a secret life by publishing on a pornographic website - was perhaps more interesting in 1997-98, when the film was shot. Eriksen does a lot of tricky things - an "invading" host, portable cameras, zooms, blacks and grainy whites - all that, I suppose, to create a sense of authenticity, but it just does not work. The film is confused and forced, but what ultimately lowers it is the credibility of the actors and the rather awful dialogue.
