The first time I saw this was when I was with an appointment and she thought it was a great movie. I did not do it. <br /> <br /> The second time I saw it was last night on TV. It still sucks. <br /> <br /> Like a love story, it sucks. If Julia is a street prostitute, it's disgusting. For me, she was a librarian with a miniskirt and heels. She did not have a hard shell for her. She was not tortured, anxious, enraged, hungry, or anything else. His character "HOOKER" was so imperfect, like comparing a cubic zircon to a diamond. The two just do not fit, no matter how they look. <br /> <br /> The only casting that I deserved to watch was interesting, it was the two slutty saleswomen, who were very well chosen. They did such a good job that I hated them for a few seconds on the screen. They had a real definition, for minor roles. OK, the movie was not totally devious ... the two ignorant sellers saved the movie. <br /> <br /> Aside from these two saleswomen, the rest of the cast ... including the big names was just shit. Everyone was passionate about the ass or had no reason to talk in the movie, except to congratulate Julia Roberts or kiss Richard Gere in the ass. <br /> <br /> It was a movie about how you walk. High heels and tight skirts in Beverly Hills, people look at you and the guys who work in the hotels are speechless as if they had just received a baseball bat. <br /> <br /> In reality, the women Those who are dressed excessively in Beverly Hills are prostitutes and prostitutes to a higher degree, but as they do not wear the beautiful jewelry to the Madonna nor the varnished boots they can despise those who wear it. <br /> <The cast of the hotel was incredibly sad to watch, and anyone with a real character had less than a minute of time on the screen. <br /> <br /> It's an insult to romantic movies, comedies, dramas and even prostitutes who face wealthy clients every day in the hope of living their lives perfectly. <br /> <br /> The story is about Jul ia Roberts being PIMPED (yes PIMPED) by a multimillionaire in business suit and limousine. <br /> <br /> She is still detained and told how to act, how to move, what to wear, what to say, where to go and what to do. He's more controlling than a street pimp, but the Disney / Buena Vista people butter him to make it easier to swallow. <br /> <br /> If Richard Gere had been a black man with a gold tooth and an AK- By his side, instead of being a briefcase, this film would show how a woman must struggle to get out the harshness of prostitution. Same story, different characters will have very different perspectives. <br /> <br /> Oh yes, change the white man to a black man, an Asian or a Spaniard, make the land contract be changed into a gun or narcotics business. and the whole concept of romantic comedy is cast. <br /> <br /> As far as I'm concerned, Pretty Woman is always a junk, dressed in ribbons and bows. <br /> <br /> I did not do anything. I did not like it 15 years ago when I did not understand it and was driven by Hollywood hype. I hate now that I can see beyond the pretty decorations called "love". <br /> <br /> This movie is NOT a romantic comedy. It's a story about how to control a woman as long as you have the means and the income. <br /> <br /> It's an insult to strong, weak women and women in general, as well as to my television screen. <br /> <br /> Do I hate him? Yes. Is it afraid? Yes, would I recommend it to you? NO ... well maybe if I really hated you. <br /> <br /> Will this notice be published? We will see. <br /> <br /> Anywayz, that's all for now.
