How? I wondered why I had not seen this in the movie theaters, or even in one ad, and after seeing the movie, I realized that I had been duped HARDCORE. I'm a big fan of Transporter and a big fan of Blade, so when I saw that, I imagined a deadly fight scene between two badasses, a lot of rifle shooting, a lot of stuff. Instead, I had the movie Ryan Phillippe with a brief overview of Statham and Snipes. The guy doing the audio and video in the crime lab had more time on the screen than Wesley. It was like hiring a Jackie Chan movie to expect a bunch of kung fu and Erin Brockavich. I'm expecting bad Hollywood movies, but actors like Snipes and Statham should treat the fans better.
