I saw this movie when it came out. Let me see now - this guy who had already skied on Mount Fuji managed to accumulate funds and hire staff to document what seems to be a daring and audacious act on the surface: crossing the highest peak in the world. Well - and here's the spoiler - what's going on, do you see, after a lot of people have managed to help him get closer to the top - and a life is lost in the market - he Put on his skis, get to the path is very very short, how his PARACHUTE OPENS ... and that's it. And instead of engraving the images to hide this surprisingly anti-climatic end to an embarrassing debacle, the guy goes ahead and releases it. SPOILER ENDS I admire the incredible courage and effort that the film crew had to deploy to obtain breathtaking images. ANOTHER SPOILER - Oh yes, one of the Sherpas is killed by falling into a crevasse. The narrator, who quotes the "break-neck skier", casually remarks that, according to the Sherpa religion, since the body of this man can not be found, his soul will travel the world forever and never know how to rest. he replied - because it was meant to allow this clown to "hit Everest". I do not remember having ever seen a more meritorious piece of celluloid. This is not to be missed.
