There are good movies and bad movies, and then there is Moscow Zero, a film so bad that it's a month of being alone with an insurance salesman is an attractive entertainment alternative. <br /> With an incomprehensible scenario about the gates of hell opening in a labyrinth of tunnels under Moscow, the film is a series of repetitive and insane shots of a little girl crossing tunnels, red lights floating and strange shadows on the walls that are useless for fear. or tension, but rather arouses the viewer's reaction "here they go again with the girl (or lights)". <br /> <br /> Directed by María Lidón, who for reasons that I can only conclude as a shame, was presented as Luna, the film stars Vince Gallo in the role of Owen, an American priest who goes to Moscow in search of Sergei (Rade Serbedzija), a friend and colleague disappeared in the tunnels. It appeals to a series of inhabitants of the city who, with the exception of Oksana Akinshina, are all described by Spanish actors who attempt with limited success to influence the Russian accents. <br /> <br /> On the way, they cross each other with members of a kind of leather-covered underground religious mafia led by a corpulent Val Kilmer, whose career seems to be in freefall to such an extent that he has tended to appear in this way, and the servant Sage Stallone (Sly's son), who seems to have been cast simply so that the name Stallone could be included in the marquee of the film. <br /> <br /> In addition to watching the troupe try to make their way through the tunnels using a comic-drawn map, and repetitive shots followed or evaded by a girl at pale face, not much else happens. The dialogue switches regularly between English and Russian, the actors frequently intervening in each language. Entire conversations are half-spoken, one in the other, the only apparent reason being that they want to, which adds a frustrating dimension to the viewer. and especially trying to understand the wildly paved story. <br /> <br /> The only thing that Moscow Zero gets right is its title, which could not have made a more accurate description of this film unless the word Moscow had been omitted.
