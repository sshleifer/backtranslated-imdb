I was expecting a rudimentary comedy of a sexual, sexual and rudimentary nature when I sat down to see that ... it turned out to be pretty accurate ... only it was a lot sicker and more disgusting than I was would have thought so. I do not know if director / screenwriter Gr√©gory Poirier is ill or if he has been deeply disturbed sexually, but I doubt that a normal person could make a film like this. I probably could have taken it if it was just that, if the only thing that was wrong was that it required a hard stomach ... but it's not. The movie is also horribly nasty and disturbing ... every character who has more than a second of time on the screen is an extreme ... sexually, mentally or physically. I do not know if it's just the director's sense of humor, but I just thought it was ... wrong. Just wrong. Even in a comedy, it's supposed to be serious. The plot is stupid. The acting is bad. The characters are incoherent and badly written ... all. There is not a single sympathetic character in the movie. The humor is disgusting and goes too far. The film is so incredibly bad that I really do not think it's worth it. If you like R-rated comedies with lots of sexual insinuations and graphics, check out The Groomsmen, or, better yet, American Pie ... or Road Trip, my favorite. But do not look at that. I can not describe how bad it is ... you should experience it yourself. However, this is one of those times when I would say you had better ask yourself. In this way, you can imagine that this film goes very close to the bottom ... without knowing that it crosses it, and much lower than that. This film is mostly like a group of excited teenagers who have come together to form a film crew. Whenever one of them had an idea, they filmed it and later she put everything in place. It lacks structure, consistency and taste. I recommend it only to teenagers in heat who have seen all the other raw comedies of R-rated teenagers and who make fun of the quality. Everyone ... does the sensible thing; avoid that. It's not even worth seeing the loot. Believe me. 1/10
