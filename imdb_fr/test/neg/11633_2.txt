What a terrible result. The reason why I give this film two stars instead of zero because it is a film that has violence, bloody and critters, but is poorly planned. And this terrible sequel was made by none other than BUM-BUM-BUM-BUM !!!!!!!!! Mick Garris! The leader who brought you the remake of The Shining that almost pushed Kubrick to roll into his grave when he found out that it had been made. Garris is also the man who brought you the sad aftermath of THE FLY, THE FLY, which was a wonderful film, but Garris's film almost ruined John Getz's career. Anyway, if you really want to see the trilogy of crappy nonsense in order, do not do it. This is the mistake I made: renting the first or the third or better yet, DO NOT CACH TO THIS LEVEL! This film was so bad that I can not believe it, avoid this shit. Shame on you, Mick!
