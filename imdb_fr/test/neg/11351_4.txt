An incident on and off a mountain road is Don Coscarelli's entry into the Mick Garris Masters of Horror series. Coscarelli is famous for being the man behind cult jewels like the Phantasm series and the irresistibly bizarre Bubba Ho-Tep; but it does not bring any of the qualities that made these awesome movies in this TV episode. The plot is a run that follows the common idea that an innocent is pursued by a madman. This time, she is a young woman riding on a mountain road. After a head-on collision, she finds herself hunted by a maniac with a white face. The whole chase sequence is really ridiculous, with the young woman stopping from time to time to set traps; Only a few seconds later, the maniac comes along. This scene is shown with scenes showing her with her husband - who has just a wealth of information on how to escape from crazy killers; with lines such as "expect the unexpected". The only highlight for me was the presence of Tall Man, Phantasm, Angus Scrimm. Coscarelli does his best to implement as many horror images as possible; with things such as the corpse of a rotten dead baby - but as everything is so stupid overall, it's hard to take this piece seriously. This is the first episode of the series and the first one I saw; I really hope they are better.
