As a person who has read all of Baron Orczy's books and has seen most of the films that follow, I must say that the 1980s version, with Anthony Andrews and Jane Seymour, was better than this one. It was better written and stuck in the spirit of the story than this one, which seemed to do everything possible to get people shot. This new adaptation is less playful, but does not have as much depth either. Although there is good acting, the actors did not have much to work. Fine costumes, however.
