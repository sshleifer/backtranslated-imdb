There are actually good reasons why a person should take the risk of becoming completely crazy watching this show. The breasts are beautiful, although some are not so real, but they usually come in pairs, which is good. Watching the beach on your screen is also a very relaxing experience, as it is a great place to relax and not worry too much about being eaten by a rubber shark. It is always good to remember that David Hasselhoff is a god. Not the god, but a god. This is not so much about his acting skills, because he does not, but his hair speaks a lot. In addition, there is no KIT in this series, which is good, since Mr. Hasselhoff said in an interview that he always thought KITT was gay. Of course, this could make him an idiot, but given the other statements he made recently, it should not surprise anyone. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell, this is the kind of show, is totally harmless for people. It gives us a lot to watch and laugh, which many intentionally humorous shows do not really give us. I must say that it is not surprising that Borat fell in love with Pamela Anderson. I like to watch the show. No, it's not a good show, in fact it's pretty awful, but I like to watch it. It's basically like a B movie that should last a decade.
