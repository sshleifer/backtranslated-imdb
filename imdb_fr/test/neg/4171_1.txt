Apparently, I'm swimming against the current rave reviews on this movie. I have not seen it since I was 4 or 5 years old, but there is one thing that I distinctly remember ... <br /> <br /> Bunyip was terrifying !!! Terrifying inducing nightmare. With the scary music and the little girl and the kangaroo running / jumping to save their lives ... <br /> <br /> Child, I also remember the animated Hobbit ... no worries. Watership down? Did not blink. Dot and the kangaroo? He always haunts my dreams. And I have several friends of the same age who also think it was scary. Maybe we could get a group rate for therapy. <br /> <br /> In short: a weird film for its time.
