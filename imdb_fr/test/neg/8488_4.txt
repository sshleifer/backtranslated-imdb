In fact, Son of the Mask made me laugh a few times ... mostly because of the caricature jokes that made Bugs Bunny and Roadrunner so funny. The CGI is very impressive and is widely used in this film. Garfield, for example, is not comparable to CGI, but I would give him the same vote. <br /> <br /> Everyone knows the story ... which was not so bad for a KIDS movie. Yes, it's a children's movie ... and should be treated as such. Jamie Kennedy is not very good in his role. His attempts to act "crazy" are not very good and the action in general is mediocre. <br /> <br /> Everyone is not so bad. <br /> <br /> Basically, my children aged 2 and 5 were looking at the whole thing without complaining. At least I could witness that. <br /> <br /> There is no chance that this movie is worse than ** shudder ** Class of 1999 <br /> <br /> 4/10 for the CGI and some laughs.
