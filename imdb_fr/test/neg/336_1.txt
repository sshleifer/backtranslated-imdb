I am proud to be able to sit through everything. I think "if I paid the rental fee, then I will at least watch them". I found the exception to this rule - the planet. I do not know what the exchange rate is, but reading the other reviews, I can only guess that Â£ 8,000 must be around $ 150. I'm going out with me, but this movie reminds me of old movies from Steve Reeves of the 50's. He was a bodybuilder turned actor. He was in those terrible nicknamed Italian films that featured Reeves as Hercules or another muscular hero. When you watched these movies, you could not tell why those movies stank, but you knew they knew it. Mike Mitchell is the new Steve Reeves. That's it ... that's what it really was - a new story from an old Italian film "Spaghetti Sand and Sandals". And, I'm careful, where was Reeves born? Glasgow, Montana. This movie is not so bad that it's pretty fun to watch - it's just bad.
