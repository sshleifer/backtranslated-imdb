I enjoyed Oceans 11, I found it very nice, helped by the performance and direction. However, I was disappointed by this movie. Do not get me wrong, this is not a failure, thanks to the outstanding performances of Brad Pitt, Catherine Zeta-Jones, George Clooney and Matt Damon in particular and the efficient staging of Steven Soderbergh. However, the film really suffers from a really lethargic stimulation, part of the movie was so slow that I almost fell asleep between a key twist. Secondly, the plot is very complicated and there are a lot of twists that make it hard to follow. The camera work was not as innovative as in the first film. While in the first film, it was smooth and professional, it was jerky and clumsy here, and the music was not particularly memorable. The screenplay was not as witty or entertaining, and the film was anti-climatic. At the end of the day, everything felt a little too lazy, despite the expert gaming and the sense of direction. So much potential, but really a missed opportunity. 4/10 Bethany Cox
