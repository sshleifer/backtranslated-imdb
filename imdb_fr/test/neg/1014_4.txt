The third in the series finds Paul Kersey (Bronson) becoming a vigilante to avenge the thugs who murdered his old friend. I do not know why this film pushed me, but that's what happened. I found myself asking Bronson to wipe the floor with these punks. Every time he blew one up, I felt good. This film does not take itself seriously, but what if it was? There is a good build-up of the fireworks finale in which Bronson is unleashed. But when it comes to acting and intrigue, it simply does not fit. If I lived in this neighborhood, I would go out as quickly as possible, but it seems that people are asking for trouble. I know this mentality is necessary to save our streets, but there is a limit here, people. I had to give him a 4. Of course, there are good "blowing" scenes, but that's about it. At that time, Bronson was 64 years old. I'm sure if these thugs really wanted to, they could get away with Bronson. Bronson takes the place of a Schwarzanegger or Stallone in this film. This film gives you a sense of joy. The common man can save the neighborhood, save the day. To summarize, it's far from the original Death Wish, but it's pretty good if you're looking for just an hour and a half of filming.
