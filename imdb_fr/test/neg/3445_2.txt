OK watch this show is the worst show on nick @ night. I like so much shows on Nick @ night and I love them. When this show came to Nick @ night, I was so pissed off. It's such a boring show and it's nerdy. Of all the times I watched, I found a slightly funny episode. This show presents some of the stupidest and most stupid jokes of all time. This show sums up terrible. Give accessories to Fresh Prince of Bel-air and George Lopez. This show is boring and not the least bit clever. This show should have been canceled much sooner. I do not think it deserves to be played Nick @ night alongside great classical shows. This show lacks intelligence, good jokes and style.
