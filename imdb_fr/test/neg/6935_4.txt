Eugene O'Neill is acclaimed by some as the leading American playwright, but for things like The Iceman Cometh, The Journey of a Long Day at Night, The Emperor Jones. Strange Interlude is an experimental piece he has concocted, where the characters on stage look at the audience aside and say what they really think before resuming the conversation. It was a nine-hour production with a dinner break on Broadway. So you can deduce that a lot of things have been sacrificed here. <br /> <br /> For the screen, the voice over for thoughts is used for all characters. This is probably a better technique for the screen. Sir Laurence Olivier did very well in his version of Hamlet. But Bill Shakespeare gave Olivier a much better story than O'Neill to his players. <br /> <br /> Players like Clark Gable, Norma Shearer, Ralph Morgan, May Robson, etc. are much more animated in most of their films than they are in Strange Interlude. The story takes place over a period of 20 years. Norma Shearer is a young woman whose design is killed during the First World War. She starts to play a little, although this part is not shown in this version. She meets Alexander Kirkland and his friend Clark Gable. She also has as eternal suitor, Ralph Morgan, a friend of Henry B. Walthall of his father. <br /> <br /> She marries Kirkland, but her mother, May Robson, warns him and shows him that madness is galloping in this family. to quote another literary work. Since Kirkland needs children and Shearer and Robson think the Kirkland train will slip if he does not find it, Gable is recruited for breeding. Of course, you can see all the complications it can cause and O'Neill is exploring them all. <br /> <br /> Gable is terribly missed in a O'Neill production, but he was a promising MGM player and did what they told him. Shearer is doing what she can to lift a very dreary story, but she seems defeated at first. Perhaps the best of the film is Robson, who really bites his dialogue. <br /> <br /> Strange Interlude ran 426 times on Broadway in 1928-1929, starring Glenn Anders and Lynn Fontanne in roles Gable and Shearer. Maybe no one could really have saved the film because, two years ago, Groucho Marx had made the joke in Animal Crackers. After seeing what he did, I do not think the film made public took it too seriously. <br /> <br /> And since it's not the best of O'Neill, me either.
