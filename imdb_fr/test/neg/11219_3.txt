Even though the movie was only a little bit so, subtitling was by far the best I've ever seen! Most of the time, the spelling is terrible and the subtitles are not synchronized. I use subtitling even though I can hear well but find a lot of actors muttering. In addition, several times, the sound track cancels the dialogue. Thank you!
