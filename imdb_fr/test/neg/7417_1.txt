It definitely looks like "amateur" time. The way this junk was published is beyond me: the acting, the story, the characters, the so-called special effects, etc ... that's wrong. Why Lance Henriksen accepted that will remain one of the great mysteries of cinema. Perhaps he desperately needed money or perhaps was under the influence of an illegal drug. <br /> <br /> It's useless to try to explain to you what this movie is about. It deals with the legend of the big foot but does the worst possible way. In fact, this stinker has a smell of direct video output. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs! 0 * out of 10 *
