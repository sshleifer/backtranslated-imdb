Although presented as one of the most sincere Turkish films with an amateur distribution, Ice-cream, I Scream is more like a caricature of sincerity. <br /> <br /> The plot opens with the dream of Ali, a roiling ice cream seller in a town in Western Anatolia, where he sees himself successfully using the same marketing methods as the big ice cream companies. He dreams of playing in the television advertising of his product with beautiful models in bikinis and dancing around him. While his dream turns into a nightmare, he wakes up with a big erection next to his gigantic wife, who refuses to make love with him for 6 years for no apparent reason. Is it because he does not succeed in his work? Apparently because he says he was selling better at a time when there was no pressure from global ice cream companies. But that's what he says. we do not really see him suffer so much: he always sells well, he travels the neighboring villages while his apprentice stays at the store and sells ice cream to the inhabitants of the city. Ali criticizes large companies for using sweeteners and dyes when he uses real "sahleps" (roots of powdered mountain orchids). Ali buys a motorcycle with a bank loan to become a street vendor and gives ads to a local TV station that prefers to broadcast even the news bulletin in local dialect. His wife does not like his ways of doing business, they always argue and Ali threatens to do very bad things in a moment of frenzy. <br /> <br /> In a very successful day, his ugly bike is stolen by the mischievous little boys driving the city. In search of his stolen bike, Ali goes to the police, blames the big companies for the theft, but, of course, nobody takes it seriously. Irritated by the harassment of his wife, Ali goes to a tavern and gets drunk. One of his friends at his table, a socialist in the city, gives a didactic speech and criticizes globalism. Without any real connection, he tackles the subject of the global freeze. Ali goes home and decides to kill himself with poison. His wife wakes up and stops him. An old neighbor takes him on a night walk and advises him to live. According to him, Ali can even sell hot drinks to sahlep if the world is facing global freezing. When he returns home, we suddenly see that his wife has understood his value, treats him as a hero and praises his manhood. Meanwhile, the thieves became ill by eating too much ice cream. They confess to the doctor that they stole Ali's bicycle. Ali forgives them and the happy ending comes. <br /> <br /> Although the plot may seem promising, it's the story that makes this film insincere and corny. First, the director does not make much effort to tell the story visually; everything is based on dialogues. And the dialogues never stop to show us that cinema is actually a visual art. Even Ali's problems are not convincing because we do not see him, we just understand him from his words. The director presents his film as a loyal fight of Ali against big ice cream companies, but the film does not contain any description of big companies. We do not see their pressure enough. The film really ridicules Ali for thinking that big companies are behind the theft. And when his bike is found, it solves all the problems: Ali becomes a happy and powerful husband. Not a true critique of globalism. <br /> <br /> Second, the movie is corny because of its rude humor. Maybe the people of this part of Turkey are cursing so much and making so many vulgar jokes in their daily lives, but vulgar language and rude humor are not enough to make a funny movie. I might have accepted it if they were vulgar and "smart" at the same time, but it's not a smart joke, they're just tacky. Maybe I'm wrong, maybe the Americans may like the eastern version of humor at the American Pie. But American Pie never claimed to be an Oscar nominee or have a political message! If you think you can laugh at seeing only the big erection of a man in his shorts (and we had to endure that joke twice!) Or an old village woman saying "f ** k you", so you can find this funny movie.
