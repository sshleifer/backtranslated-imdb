The afternoon of Gaud√≠ can be considered as a poor exercise. Marcia Gay Harden and Judy Davis have rotated a good casting (the weird character of the new age of Juliette Lewis has been incredibly taken from reality, I know a young American woman who push fangs like her !!) but GA does not show great thing beyond his overflowing plot. <br /> <br /> Although the making of films is entirely imaginary, there were some noticeable script inconsistencies. Two samples: you pay 14 euros to enter the chapel where Cassandra and Frankie met, NEVER at 7 o'clock, and you can not leave a terrace without paying the bill (they will charge you on the spot if they do not know you ) or get off the taxi CELA quickly (you, the Americans, always tip the drivers, even if they did not expect it, but the sequences depicted in the movie were ridiculous). Do not believe me, reader: come see for yourself. <br /> <br /> If you have not been here before, you may not care about all that, but good movies should be credible regardless of where you come from. Here, no one knows the GA, and I will make sure that it does not change in the future.
