I found it almost impossible to understand the character of Ricci in this movie. If she was supposed to be depressed, I think the screenwriter and director neglected to research the depressors before shooting this film, because Ricci's character was more of a representation of a selfish and worthless shoebag than victim and a survivor of depression. <BR /> <br /> The forced attempt at introspective narration was as ridiculous as the painful interactions between her and the people around her. <br /> <br /> Sorry but I could not buy it. This is directly to the schlock video. I'm glad I did not pay to see that.
