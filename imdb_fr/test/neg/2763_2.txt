If this movie faithfully portrays J. Smits's acting skills, I think he made a big mistake when he left the television. Did not he watch movies "starring" David Caruso, especially "Cold Around the Heart"? As far as the ability to act is concerned, what about Mary Louise, she did a lot, a lot better. Yes, this is a horrible scenario, poorly edited and totally devoid of continuity, but competent actors can and have overcome similar obstacles. A very big disappointment.
