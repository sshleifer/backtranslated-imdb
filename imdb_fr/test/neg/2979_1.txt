It sounds like a long-running comedy-routine that could have been told in a ten-minute short film. In addition, technical credits are higher. The movie really looks like a movie school diploma project. <br /> <br /> The cast is a mix of seasoned professionals and talented newcomers, but the problem is the superficial scenario.
