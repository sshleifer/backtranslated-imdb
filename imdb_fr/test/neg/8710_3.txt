I watched this series out of curiosity, wanting to see if this was possible and with ALL this modern technology, on the sidelines of Cecil B. DeMille's classic epic of 1956, starring Charleton Heston, Yul Brenner and Sir Cedric Hardwicke. Of course, I was disappointed. Yes, they had all the correct biblical characters, but they did not give us any spectacular theatrical scenes that caught your interest throughout the first film. If you want to have a mini-series, you must have some "riveting" scenes, the "Burning Bush", Separate the "RED Sea", drowning "Pharoh's Army", "Building the Pyramids of Sethi", could have be made with current technology at the scale of blockbuster movies such as "The Lord of the Rings" or the Matrix. Obviously, they did not want to leave a lasting impression of "faith and sacrifice," which is indispensable in these difficult times.
