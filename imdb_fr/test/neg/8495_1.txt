This is without a doubt the worst movie I have ever seen. I say that without hyperbole, and believe me, I've seen a lot of bad movies. It is embarrassing and annoying that millions of dollars are invested in this film and that hundreds (thousands?) Of craftsmen have spent so much time doing what screenwriters and producers should know to be a colossal failure. <br /> <br /> When a 90 minute movie feels like it's long, stretched, boring and incomprehensible, you know something went wrong somewhere. In addition, Jamie Kennedy (whose work I have enjoyed elsewhere) is simply terrible in this role; Clearly, he was never screen-tested because no sensible producer would have considered it entertaining, particularly under the guise of The Mask. Simply horrible. <br /> <br /> Personally, I'm looking forward to seeing the critics of the leading film critics, because I know they're doing a better job than me in destroying this wreckage train. <BR/> <br /> Producers of this film should be embarrassed, and more importantly, never be allowed to make theater films again.
