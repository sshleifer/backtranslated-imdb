I hope the people who made this movie read these comments. The choreography was horrible, the plot was not complete and the actors where the low-budget rangers figured 5 stars in this junk. <br /> <br /> The fight scenes so slow that you could actually see the actors expect each other. perform the next move. Camera clashes and insufficient lighting could not hide the cheap effects. The lightning was just stupid. The weapons looked like a fantastic final game, and the double bow and arrow was dull like anything I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The next movie you decide to do is to try to invest in wireless microphones, better write and try to spend time on your stunts. <br /> <br /> Honestly, there are shows on television These games are nocturnal and are assembled in a few hours that look better than this one. <br /> <br /> Stick to the martial arts (unless it's as mediocre as your acting), then take the quilt.
