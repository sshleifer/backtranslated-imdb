Not only does the VHS and DVD cover (at least in Europe) show a scene that has nothing to do with the plot of the film, the acting is so bad that the film needs to be made fun of him. If you have nothing to do, you are with good friends and you want to laugh at a movie, it's supposed to be serious, look at Tycus and Peter Onorati, a man who will teach you how to bring down the bad guys with boxes. empty cardboard! The shame of Dennis Hopper, like Travoltas, featured in his own "battlefield land". For those who want to watch a good film about the destruction of the Earth by a terrible force, please do not choose Tycus, but do yourself a favor and look "Armageddon" for the twentieth time!
