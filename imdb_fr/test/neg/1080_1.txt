It's a Hollywood remake of a classic British movie. All that entertained the original "Italian Job" was bled from this sore of a film "scripted" by Donna and Wayne Powers and "filmed" by F. Gary Gray. I'm surprised that Troy Kennedy Martin (the writer of the original movie) allowed his name to be used in the generic ear of this pig. Martin has worked on some of the finest film and television projects of the last 40 years. Even being vaguely associated with this stinker is NOT a good thing. <br /> <br /> The humor is forced, the drama is laborious, all the characters are friendly criminals cookie cutters (with the exception of the handsome cracker / rally driver sure) and the plot corresponds only to the original on the following points: <br /> <br /> (1) Three Minis (modern versions manufactured by BMW, but nevertheless minis) <br /> <br /> (2) Using the names of Croker and Bridger for 2 main characters <br /> <br /> (3) Disruption of a city's traffic control system to allow it to pass safely. <br /> <br /> (4) Uh, that's it. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, you get a bland and unbelievable American engagement movie, in which a group of merry pirate buddies end up getting the best of their bad partner. Believe me, it takes them a lot of time. The actors do their best with what they receive, but it seems they have all accepted it as a polishing exercise after reading the script. The unusual nature and typically British flavor of the original movie did not survive after being introduced to the Hollywood hamburger machine. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and watch the original 1969 film instead of this chest injury. It's amazing that Noel Coward did not make Aunt Nelly, jumped from his grave and kicked the teeth of everyone involved in this lukewarm mid-throat remake. <br /> <br /> Italian Job? More like an Italian Jobbie.
