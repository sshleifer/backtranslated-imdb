An extremely detailed book, exhilarating, interesting, rich in detail and fast paced. It's a shame that the film has none of these qualities. not only the moderate portrayal of Tom Hanks or Robert Langdon Laughable, but the name changes to key characters, huge deviations from the original script and a low Irish / Italian accent from Carmalengo Performed by Ewan Mcgregor, designed for the worst book in to film EVER. <br /> <br /> As a big fan of the A & D book, I was hoping for a more sumptuous and true-to-life film, where it would begin and end exactly like the book, leaving me wanting more. . <br /> <br /> Everything the movie really did made me depressed in the first 10 minutes. <br /> <br /> What was impressive was how ... sorry! I could not even finish this sentence without laughing. <br /> <br /> In short - Vittoria was the symbolic hottie, a second for Audrey Tatou and there were very good Alfa Romeos. <br /> <br /> I would recommend reading the book to understand that, if Ron Howard has to insist on making another book to film, I would be happy to be able to save Â£ 6.40 for a KFC zinger meal and some wings chicken - much more entertaining and deeply satisfying!
