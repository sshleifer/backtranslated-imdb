What is that? Kelly (Jennifer) seems to give up any moral behavior as soon as she arrives on the island. She finds this exotic and exotic Juan P (Manuel), although she witnessed it when he slapped his ex in the face, which he also later justified in the film, true or false? These two guys are the first to meet on the island. Kelly is totally lost in every way and the big Juan P can fish and build a house a little bit. Mr. handyman. They seem to have a good time. Then Billy Zane (Jack, the husband of Kellys characters) introduces himself and of course, two days without knowing what his wife did with this magnificent Juan P, he is a little jealous. Billy Z is the stereotype of the rich guy and maybe not the nicest man in the world. He does not like Juan P (to hit his girlfriend on the dock, who can blame him?) He is also arrogant, but he paid a lot of money to rent this boat and Juan P who is the server / all can not not even go get him a beer by hand 20 min Billy is probably the guy you want to hit in the face if you meet him, but at the same time, he is, not to be held responsible, suspicious about the glasses Manuel's diving dive to Kelly and Billy have just lost some dear friends! How convenient it is to have them, anyway!). However, for some strange reason, Kelly likes this girl to hit Manuel and starts to hate Billy for his jealousy. OK, Billy reacts excessively, for sure, but Kelly does not do much to convince him either. She spends more time with Juan P and even wants him to sleep with them since he was so nice (and even if Manuel shouted at her and called her to ask her intimate questions.) But Kelly is so indulgent ...). Yes indeed. And then she starts to have sex with this Juan P. It must be said that Kelly and Billy seem to have a working relationship before this incident on an island, at least they have an intimate sexual relationship on the boat and talk like the people if they liked each other well. other. Now you can think that this scenario is possible. But for real, is it? Are you fooling your husband after two days on a coconut island just because he is jealous and behaves like a drunkard at the bar? (I would not disagree if the relationship was really bad but the director does not give much clues if this is the case). For Christ's sake, Juan P did not really show himself to be a good person. Catch fish and build a wooden house to slip into someone's panties, does that show a good side? Anyway, do not try to become friends with Kellys' husband (which would be very simple by leaving them alone for most of the island, just be respectful). He does not care about their relationship (and Kelly can not understand that), he just wants to have sex with Kelly. The Kellys character is just not reliable (if she was stuck with Billy and another attractive girl, would not she be angry or what ?!). Or maybe she is? Billy Zane plays a not very nice person, and Juan P is not really better if you really think about it. And poor Kelly is so confused, and think that making love with Juan P will solve everything because her husband is so strange and so aggressive toward poor Juan P? So ... for all who read this ... What do you think? If you played Kelly, would you consider deceiving your husband, knowing that someday you'll be back in real life and that suddenly Billys may not be that awful after all? . He is too jealous. And if you are the character of Billys, what are you saying, is he totally in his behavior? And the character of Juan P, what do you really think of him? One thing is sure. Fuels exist! Ps ... The voodoo thing is so totally wrong here! What was that? Seriously! Someone tell me?
