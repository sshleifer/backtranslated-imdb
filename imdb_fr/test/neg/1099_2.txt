It begins in Pennsylvania in 1913. A gang of children is killed in a mine explosion intentionally triggered by the owner of the mine. Cut to 2006. Recently widowed, Karen (Lori Heuring), her teenage daughter Sarah (Scout Taylor-Compton) and her granddaughter Emma (Chloe Moretz) move to a remote house near the mine. What they do not know are the ghosts of the little children who haunt the woods and kill everyone around the night. <br /> <br /> Horror movie slow and boring. The premise is obvious and has already been destroyed. In addition, history has enormous gaps in logic. You never know why these children kill someone or why they eat the body afterwards (yes, it's shown). They are already dead - why do they need food? And why have not they been the main villain of history for a long time? He was around the area. Why choose this moment to attack it? In addition, the characters are not the least friendly. Sarah meets the worst. He has some saving grace. The location is beautiful and disturbing at the same time, some of the murders were VERY bloody and brutal and the kids themselves looked scary walking silently into the woods at night. But overall, I got bored and fought to stay awake. You can skip this one.
