I fully understand the historical significance of Rocketship X-M, but that does not make it a good movie. For starters, the plot (or what is there) is dull and lifeless. Five astronauts take off for the moon ?? they are baffled and end up on Mars (huh?) ?? Cavemen looking at Martians throw stones at them? they return to Earth and meet a burning death ?? The end. Believe it or not, but this complicated description makes the sound much more interesting than it really is. To make matters worse, the character of John Emery, Karl Eckstrom, considers it necessary to make lengthy speeches on all subjects, from the nature of man to the dangers of nuclear weapons. It's just a shiver of a minute (sarcasm wanted). <br /> <br /> Looking at Rocketship X-M nearly 60 years later, I would say that women's representation is funny if it is not so sad and misplaced. I could cite a number of examples, but an exchange of dialogue took place just after takeoff between chauvinist pilot Floyd (played by the irritant, Lloyd Bridges, with plastic hair) and Dr. Lisa Van Horn (only female member of the crew). and the constant object of Floyd's often frightening attention) that pretty much illustrates the film's attitude towards women: <br /> <br /> ?? Floyd: "I was wondering how a girl like you had been involved with such a thing in the first place." <br /> <br /> ?? Dr. Van Horn: "I guess you think women should only cook, sew and have kids." <br /> <br /> ?? Floyd: "Is not that enough?" <br /> <br /> I think Floyd should have stayed with the cavemen!
