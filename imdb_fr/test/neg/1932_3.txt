This film has more to offer than a sumo wrestler and the result for the spectator is indigestion. There are some good performances, but the secondary intrigues are external and largely unresolved. <br /> <br /> In addition, I found all the characters inconceivable, and if you can not identify yourself with at least one character, there is nothing to be excited. In short, it's a classic example of trying to do too much with too little.
