There was a time in the United States where everything was possible in a movie, so came roughies, horror-filled movies and explicit scenes. The best known are forced entry and hydropower, but of course, they were made with a little budget. All showed the 42 in New York, but hey, there were other mills out there that showed no budget problem. Wet Wilderness is an example. After shooting the underground scene after a while, copies were available, but as in other journals, some copies were cut abruptly at the end. But the version I looked at was complete. Well, I'd call this one more of a porn, then a hard one, there's a serial killer around him, but he likes to watch others make love instead of killing them, when he kills that is done off screen. The acting game is the worst I have ever seen. And I imagined that the so-called actors did not like what they were doing, for example at the beginning, when the lesbian scene watched a girl stop playing and pull a pubic hair out of her mouth before continuing to do what was happening, or when the mother rides the black, the girl is sitting in the grass upset by the ants! But it's the story that made it famous, incest and racism is what made it famous. When there is blood, observe the two girls who are sitting waiting for a signal to act. My God, it's worse, but it's an advantage to have if you like Sleaze and Grindhouse. Make sure you have the full version.
