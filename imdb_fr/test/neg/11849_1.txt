<br /> <br /> ********** SPOILER ALERT *************** <br /> <br /> If you like JURASSIC PARK 1, 2 or 3: <br /> <br /> If you happen to enjoy very bad movies for their entertaining value, if not for their quality (example: John Carpenter's DARK STAR, highly recommended) <br /> < If you like movies about dinosaurs in general, <br /> <br /> THEN KEEP AWAY FROM THIS KINEMATIC CRAPSTERPIECE! <br /> <br /> Shameless use of CARNOSAUR 1 & 2 footage Take advantage of the scene, for example, where the security guard is facing his loss, at the mouth of the Alpha T-Rex. For some reason, he loses about 50 pounds and appears 10 years younger. Why is that? Simply because this scene was raised directly from CARNOSAUR, which was a shabby movie in the beginning. <br /> <br /> The end was a true copy of CARNOSAUR 2, for those who have the misfortune to sit in this video loser. Again, we see Mr. Rex fighting a bulldozer - which turns like a forklift - through the miracle of -ta-daa! - archive images of CARNOSAUR 1 & 2 mentioned above. Of course, the end is exactly the same. the beast falls to his death as the complex ignites. <br /> <br /> A real insult to the intelligence of anyone. <br /> <br /> But it's always better than watching Rosie O'Donnel's show. <br /> <br /> Rating: 1/2 * on ***** <br /> <br />
