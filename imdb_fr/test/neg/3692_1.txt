In Moscow, priest Owen (Vincent Gallo) hires a team to guide him into the underworld to find his missing friend Sergei (Rade Serbedzija) as he searches for a legend about the existence of demons and the entrance to hell under the city. <br /> <br /> I bought this DVD based on the name of Val Kilmer and the interesting pictures on the cover. I am totally disappointed because this movie is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I do not understand how Val Kilmer agreed to participate in this production. IMDb offers two shameful critics who promote this film. These are usually fakes that have been written by users with only one comment on this site. There are two ways to watch this annoying and awful film: my wife and I napped several times because of the monotony of this useless story and we used the DVD rewind button to repeat each lost scene. However, the correct way should have been the use of fast forward or stop button, to put an end to this crap faster. My vote is one. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Cidade Sombria" ("Black City")
