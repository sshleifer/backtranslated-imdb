Crazy Six is ​​a torture, it must be the worst film of Albert Pyun. Even Blast and Ticker are better! I can not believe how annoying this movie is! How did this even get the green light? I saw this film about 3 years ago and the only thing I can remember is how bad it was. It's not a bad movie, it's just bad, bad, bad, bad, bad movie. <br /> <br /> 1 of 10 (½ on *****)
