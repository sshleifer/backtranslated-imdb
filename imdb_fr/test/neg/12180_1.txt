Charles Bronson gave viewers many great moments on screen. But this film lacks everything a thriller / action movie should have. There are some action scenes in the movie, but they are really nil. And when the action scenes fail, does the story save the movie? Not at all, is my answer to that. The story is even worse than the action scenes. It's very simple and boring and although I'm a big fan of cinema, I almost fell asleep a few times. I do not know how they managed such a failure. A small budget, maybe? Regardless of this, it seemed that not all actors had any interest in being in the movie. When this happens, the result is really bad.
