For me, film criticism is an extension of my love of cinema - and horror cinema in particular. The criticisms I've written so far are about movies that I love, respect, and admire, and I have enthusiastically rewarded them with praise and perfect ratings. I have always been passionate about horror cinema, so it's a great pleasure for me to be able to share my thoughts and ideas about big horror movies with others and, hopefully, to help expose people to horror movies. movies that they might not look for otherwise. . I only recently started reviewing movies for IMDB, and initially intended to focus only on my personal favorites, looking at those that I believe have lasting value and value for the kind of horror. However, the existence of movies like "Graduation Day" is, without pun intended, a thorn in my side. Totally devoid of all merit, this hodgepodge of untrained ideas of 1981 is led by an amateur, misinterpreted and, in every sense, a total embarrassment for the horror cinema. A few years before and after the release of this film, we watched the appearance of national (and Canadian) films such as "Halloween II", "Prom Night", "Terror Train", "Madman", "My Bloody Valentine" ". "The Prowler," "Just Before Dawn," "Final Review," and "Hell Night," etc. These films, though of varying quality, clearly aimed at getting something in terms of script, script, script, script, direction and overall tone.All films released during this generous Slasher era would not be artistic merit or commercial success of the original "Halloween" or "Friday the 13th "but these films were all well done and clearly contributed to the development of horror cinema." "Graduation Day", an abominable joke about a masked killer stalking members of a high school track team, was led by Herb Freed, who can only hope that he will never again try to defame the horror genre with such parody.The task of creating good horror movies is best left to those who have a sincere love and respect for the genre. It is a miserable one at all possible levels, including terribly wooden performances, exceptional special effects, an irritating musical score and, above all, a story devoid of the slightest hint of tension or suspense. Useless exercise of film wastage, "Graduation Day" is a total shame for horror cinema.
