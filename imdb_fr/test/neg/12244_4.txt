With so many horrific parody movies, it's unfortunately a breath of fresh air for the genre. Compared to classics like Airplane or Naked Gun, it's awful, but compared to the recent movies of usurers like Meet the Spartans and Disaster Movie, it's very clever and original. Do not get me wrong, however, it was by no means a good movie. I laughed a few times and there are some inspired gags, but any reference to pop culture falls flat, like most of the movie jokes. <br /> <br /> Lambeau Fields (David Koechner) was a bad coach choice in the past, but now he's back to teaching college football, and this time he'll do a good job. His wife (Melora Hardin) feels far from him and his daughter has a big kick to football to annoy his father. The parodies of various recent movies come into play, as do many visual gags and flawless stupidity. <br /> <br /> The highlights of the film are gags that do not rely on references to recent movies. The parodies of Radio, Rocky, Dodgeball, Friday Night Lights, Invincible and many other sports movies are not funny at all. It's mostly the little gags that make you laugh, like a weird scraping crotch scene or a chewing tobacco joke. These little disposable laughs can not carry the movie, and in the end, it's hard to watch. <br /> <br /> The characters are surprisingly developed for a sporty spoof movie, however, I'm sure the characters were built on clich√©s of the genre. Nevertheless, they are not too bad. David Koechner can remove the lead actor from a movie. Too bad they gave him so much lousy material to work. Matthew Lawerence has a good comic timing in a role not always as comical as a footballer dancing ballet with a father in disguise. Carl Weathers completes the cast by playing again in a sub-par sports film (Not the Rocky movies ... Happy Gilmore!). Overall, this is a crazy comedy. Sometimes it's funny, but most often it's just very annoying and predictable. <br /> <br /> My note: * 1/2 on ****. 90 minutes PG-13 for language, sexual humor and drugged humor.
