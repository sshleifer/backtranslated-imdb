why oh why have I ever lost my time watching this movie? it was given to me on video by a friend and I thought that I would look at it, it can not be so serious surely. First of all, acting is just awful and we're supposed to believe it's real? Secondly, this movie blatantly tries to copy the witch project Blair and does it very badly. so if you want the fear of your life, I would say that a special Halloween Simpson would be a lot more scary. but, if you just wanted to laugh, then maybe the bullshit of this movie would be enough. but overall, I would like to avoid this movie at all costs or drink a lot of alcohol before viewing it. the best bit? it's only about an hour and a half, thanks god.
