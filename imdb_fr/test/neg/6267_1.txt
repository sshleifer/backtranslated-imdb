I normally finish all the movies or books I start, even if they are poor, just because I hate to give them up. It was so badly done that I was incredulous. <br /> <br /> I'm not just looking for the magic of Spielberg - I rent foreign movies and I rent very old sci-fi movies (more recently Soylent Green) - rent). I like both the Hollywood action and the slower development of the characters. Different films have to be approached differently to be appreciated. I did not find any element that bought this one ... The action was so wooden that I was not in the least on board. The development of the character was virtually absent - you do not feel sorry for anyone, or even identify with him. Finally, there were so many pieces that could not be summed up. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time, better watch dry painting ...
