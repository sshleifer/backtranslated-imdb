How many times do I have to write boring and not funny words on this page until I get to ten lines. George is an original actor like Alfalfa of the little rascals. Although this is probably a slight for Alfalfa. How many times do I have to sneak into these overpaid overpaid actors before I learn that there is only one law in the movie industry. Take the money and make a movie - even if it's shit. They spend millions to make this film but can not take a few moments to watch the final result. And Renee GoAwayZigger should stop taking the illegal drugs in which she finds herself and consult a doctor for the facial problems she is wearing. At least, I hope it's her drug because she's pretty unappealing when she talks about the mouth. This movie was neither funny nor dramatic and these hacks should just stop doing shit like that. George and Renee, you should be ashamed of yourself and stop being shabby.
