It's by far the worst film I've ever seen in my life (I'm approaching 47)! The description on the back of the cover corresponds to the text scrolling from the beginning of the film. The next plot was nil and even a bunch of corpses would have had more life in their "game". I traveled the full length and I was really relieved when the death of the last character marked the end of my suffering! The location was either a sort of vault or a dirty beach. I guess this home video equipment was used as a camera and the lighting was not up to standard. The dialogues were uninspired and meaningless. As are the faces of the actors. Which brings me to the theme "makeup": at first glance, they understood it as gadgets in some teenage magazines, "my first makeup" or similar. What made me buy the DVD is the name "Lovecraft" printed on the cover. The only connection with the works of this brilliant mind was the use of the name "Necronomicon", which was wrongly translated as "Book of Light". The 4.70 euros I paid for this DVD was a total loss because the DVD went into the recycling box without further ado.
