A petty and degrading and degrading adaptation to the classic children's tale not only lacks the charm of his ancestor, but lacks any talent whatsoever. Mike Myers should not only be ashamed of his horrible performance that is a real scam of what Jim Carrey did, but he should also stop acting together. It is so annoying that you would want to beat it if you could jump in the movie. The sets are ugly and the cinematography is very poor. I've seen a lot of bad movies this year, but it does not just take the cake, but it's definitely one of the worst movies ever made.
