From what I remember seeing from this film, it was not good. I always say that if a film is good and can hold the attention during the most difficult moments (example: a war between Tylenol and the Sinus), it is a film that did its job. The fact that I am asleep during most of this film only proves that he could not hold my attention, and as a result, he did not finish his work. Why am I a victim of Tylenol Cold & Sinus when I had a movie in my arsenal? <br /> <br /> To begin, clerk makes no sense. The acting was mediocre and the global story left more doors open than it was impossible to close. I think when I swear I saw Affleck and Graham (brother and sister in this film) kissing. It made no sense. Then there was a scene with Affleck and his roommates saying he was sleeping with one of them, almost breaking a perfect lesbian couple. I guess it was meant to show that most are not as engaged in a relationship as Graham, but for me it was nothing more than a charge. I have this suspicious feeling that the director of this film sleeps with Affleck. His role in this film was atrocious. I mean, I've never seen him do a "good" acting game, but it was by far the worst. Oh, I just had another moment in the battle that goes through my head and I confirmed it with IMDb.com ... what did John Stewart do in this movie? It was another time when my eyes opened just for a moment in one of those battles that seemed to last forever. <br /> <br /> And frankly, it's Heather Graham; we do not care about her after a while. . It's just not interesting - it's just bland, boring and basically stops acting after a while. As they start desperately throwing wacky characters into the mix to re-roll the movie, it simply does not work and instead of just talking about one day - they start adding more characters to the mix, so now is simply strange, tedious, boring and really. really long. Luke Wilson's slow play style slows down an already crawling movie - why were these two men married? Committed is a really awful movie - the kind of "fashionable comedy" that leaves you speechless and depressed and bored. <br /> <br /> Note: * on *****
