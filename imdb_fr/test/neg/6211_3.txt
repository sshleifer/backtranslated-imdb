First, let's discuss the story. It's a copy of the movie "Hitch" with an added Indian flavor. A guy, who is a guru of love, and another man who is apparently a sucker when it comes to ladies, and how that sucker's appearance becomes a charmer with the help of the love guru who forms the story. Salman Khan is the guru of love and Govinda the lame. <br /> <br /> Hi Khan now tackles the performance of the artists. He exaggerates throughout the film. He tries to be funny, but he fails a lot. You can see Salman screaming throughout the movie, no real actor is seen in his performance. Govinda is in front of Katrina Kaif (Oh, my god, she's a girl, real beauty) is a 50-year-old guy in real life, and Katrina is a girl in her twenties. In the film, Govinda looks like Katrina Kaif's grandfather. What a pity! Come to the execution of the film. This film looks like a B-Movie and a bad imitation of the movie Hitch. Where Hitch looks like a film with a purpose and a depth, this film is shallow and without purpose, nowhere is there justification or clarity. <br /> <br /> Forget this movie because it's nothing boring, a typical Bollywood dish. In fact, I give 3/10 because it's the lowest I'm going.
