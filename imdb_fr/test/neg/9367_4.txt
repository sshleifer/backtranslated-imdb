I attributed to this presentation 4 stars. They are all for the script, which was slaughtered without any recognition in places. What can we possibly say? They took one of the finest pieces written in the last century and methodically stripped him of his heart, his humor and his humanity. I do not really blame the actors, who probably do their best with a mediocre staging and incomplete characters (because the very complete characters of the stage version were torn - and their ideas - ripped off). I blame the director a lot, who seems to be trying to find a way to undermine the script. There are so many awkward pauses, awkward moments reconstructed and clumsy lines readings unimaginable in this TV movie that I sometimes forgot to like the play. I'm not among those who think that genie pieces are automatically inferior to the film (quite the contrary), but this piece of genius in particular has been extremely poorly served by this release. Now, I hope they'll do a * real * movie of this piece. The world deserves it.
