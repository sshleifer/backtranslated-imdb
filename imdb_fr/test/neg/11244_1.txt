I just watched this movie last night. Less than 30 minutes after the start, I was hoping it would end. <br /> <br /> The beginnings were promising; the first 10 minutes. The premise of this film (friendship that goes nowhere after spending days (and years) together in "separate" beds in hotel rooms) is simply not believable. He kisses her somewhere on the way and she feels Ohh, so terrible about it. <br /> <br /> Very little substance to attract your interest. The acting game just does not fit. He is very passive. Regardless of the amount of film shown, the viewer never develops any kind of attentive connection with the characters on the screen. You learn that his next sentence will be as boring as the previous one. ("Do you have a cigarette?", He does not smoke, he wants her to quit, does not she know it now?) <br /> <br /> She calls him mid-night to visit her after a year of absence, she enters through the door, they do not even hug, do not kiss and do not express any kind of emotional connection. He does not even lean forward to lift his suitcase to help him in. This is not how real people behave, nor the best friends. <br /> <br /> When he receives his phone call in the middle of the night (she's been in town for a day), he shows little interest in seeing her, behaving rather like a burden for the night. At this point, they have known each other for two years and he has not seen her for a year. Not credible, not real. <br /> <br /> Supposedly, he wrote a book on Entropy and Enthalpy, but you never see him writing or reading or discussing any of his physics interests with her, even if she would not able to handle the discussion. We learn that a watermelon in L.A. costs $ 50 (it's not the type of silicon, remember) it has no problem to afford this fruit. We also learn that the airport is closed when some very real snowflakes fall from the sky. I'm sorry but was it also in L.A. <br /> <br /> We never see how these two characters survive, we never see them at work. We never see them struggling, they are always on vacation. They have an infinite time, they have no worries. <br /> <br /> Nice life. Unreal life. Unreal characters. Bad title. Bad movie.
