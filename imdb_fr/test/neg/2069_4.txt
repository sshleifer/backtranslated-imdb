For those who expect the cover and story to tell another Bollywood entertaining Indian production, beware: no musical dance number or production value song can brighten the mood in this story a bit Tired of arranged marriages in British Indian culture - As Roopesh Parekh wrote, the script jumps around topics worthy of discussion to conceal them with usual avoidance tactics. Harming Singh Kalirai leads as a traffic officer, trying to keep disparate subplots to the point of becoming Keystone Cop's tactic. <br /> <br /> Jimi (Chris Bisson) is a medical student who is gay and has a lover Jack. (Peter Ash) and they live with Aunt Vanessa (Sally Bankes), obese, alcoholic and moralizing, and Sally's chubby girl, Hannah (Katy Clayton). The Patel family from Delhi visits the Jimi family. She takes their beautiful girl Simran (Jinder Mahal) to England to find a husband. Jimi's parents (Saeed Jaffrey and Jamila Massey) and his grandmother (Zohra Sehgal) decide that Simran is the girl Jimi must marry and arrange an engagement and wedding in the Indian way, without consulting Jimi. Jimi discovers the plot and is too keen not to accept it, a decision that makes Jack angry and annoys Vanessa. Hannah says a "little lie" to Simran (that she is Jimi's daughter) and the marriage is canceled. When Jimi's parents go to Jimi's house, they discover Vanessa, drunk, who pushes her away, but finally decide that, for Jimi's happiness, they accept the fact that Vanessa gave them a "granddaughter" and decides to to use wedding preparations as a wedding. for Jimi and Vanessa. Jimi convinces the very reluctant Vanessa to accept this idea. Soon, Vanessa is dressed in a sari, prepared for a wedding, and Jimi, terrified by what he does to please his parents, includes Jack as the best man. At the wedding, the truth is revealed and to Jimi's surprise, his family adapts to Jimi's true self and the day is saved simply by telling the truth. <br /> <br /> The casting is doing pretty well with this absurd nonsense and there are some good performances: Chris Bisson and Peter Ash are attractive men and play their role well, even if they do not indicate no romantic relationship (the director seems terrified to show any suggestion of intimacy between the two men); Sally Bankes provides most of Vanessa's laughter; the rest of the cast repeats the stereotypical roles they have played countless times in Indian films. It's not a bad movie - it has its moments - but it's too superficial and tired to interest us in one of the characters.
