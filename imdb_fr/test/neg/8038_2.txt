This is one of those "family" films that I can not imagine to interest much more than 9 years. A group of siblings discovers a "sand fairy" (yes, really) ideally located at the end of a not so good neighborhood. Secret passage to the country house of their eccentric uncle, where they were evacuated from the London blitz. ... and that's all in one sentence. The story speaks of the role of magic in childhood and the danger of greeting, but none of these issues are examined in an interesting way for adults or informative for children (or vice versa!). The only reason I can think of looking at this is to see how the exceptional talent of Freddie Highmore differs from the rest of the mediocre performances.
