MTV's "Fluxon Flux" sci-fi animation series comes to life: Charlize Theron stars, a freedom fighter who fights against oppression in the walled city of Bregna 400 hundred years later. For her latest mission, she was sent to kill the city's leader, Trevor Goodchild (Marton Csokas), but she reveals secrets along the way. <br /> <br /> Aeon Flux falls under the category of good premises and poor performance. Interesting story but the movie was a bit boring. Many people say it's one of the worst movies of the year and that's not true at all. It may be a disappointing film, but it's at best an average film. I have never seen the cartoon version of the movie, so I can not compare the two. It's probably better because they have the opportunity to explain the story further. The movie is not so confusing, but it's easy to get lost if you're not familiar with the material. The acting was ok, nothing special. Charlize Theron gives a good performance and seems dedicated to the film. The rest of the cast also offers decent performances, including Jonny Lee Miller, Frances McDormand and Marton Csokas. There are also more than a few interesting characters in the film, including Sithandra, Aeon's friend. <br /> <br /> The problem with Aeon Flux is that it takes itself too seriously. It has the same serious tone throughout the film and it gets a bit tiring. There is no humor and the film sometimes becomes a bit boring. This is the same problem as Elektra. Because the film is so serious, the dialogue seems cheesy and the serious scenes seem forced. The action scenes are pretty good, but that's not the purpose of the movie, so do not expect an action movie. The twist at the end is not breathtaking, but it's still a beautiful ending, better than the other thrillers of last year (Hide and Seek). The costumes are a bit odd but still beautiful and interesting. The visuals were also well done, so the film has at least a nice appearance. Thus, the film can be a case of style on the substance. Interesting to watch but may not hold your attention for very long. In the end, it's not the best movie, but it may be a decent rental. Note 4/10
