Number 1 was really great this summer. It was the modern jaws. <br /> <br /> Number 2 is best summed up by Jeff Goldblum in the movie: it's the stupidest idea in the history of stupid ideas (or something). <br /> <br /> Number 3 is the obituary ... JP got everything. <br /> <br /> Once they realized that they had no new ideas, they should have let the dinos sleep. <br /> <br /> That said. The movie is ok if you do not mind knowing you've seen it before. <br /> <br />
