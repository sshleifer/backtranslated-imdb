This film is one of the worst movies of all time. I'm a little sorry that this film is not in the background; he deserves a place at least at number 60 or 70 on this list. It's not just a movie that I find bad in a camp-entertaining style of MST3K; it's just bad. It's one of the few movies I really hate, really. Freddy Got Fingered is in the same category of bad. <br /> <br /> It is said that the girl (Gugino) goes to California to go to school and returns with Crawl (Shore) and tries to learn how to be a farmer. Then, the boyfriend tries to put Shore in place so that the girl leaves Crawl and returns to see it. It ends and what remains of the public can leave. <br /> <br /> The main purpose of this film is that Pauly Shore mugs for the camera and tries to be funny; but I would say that about 100% of the time, it fails that. Their horrible, inaccurate and outdated vision of farms and agriculture is shocking and nothing in this film deserves to be seen. If you are thinking of seeing it, do not do it. The only time I saw the movie, I had the impression to watch it for 5 or 6 hours. If you have already seen it, you have my sympathy.
