Well, it's been about 1,000 years in the future and we finally crossed the great distance between galaxies! But unfortunately, we still use guns that shoot bullets, black men always call themselves brothers, and they break down, break down, fight, and so on. Babies dressed in tight black rubber pants resembling those of Baywatch share intimate relationships with the captian and crew. People with disabilities still need wheelchairs to get around, no fancy treatments, implants, or robotic legs. Dracula always looks and acts cheerful. Should I continue ... In short, this shot was shot on a typical sci-fi scene, with low-budget props, actors and no special effects per se. The beginning, the middle and the end were pathetic. I have to go and shoot myself now, there is nothing left to live on.
