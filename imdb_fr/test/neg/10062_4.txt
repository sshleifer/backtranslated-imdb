When, at the very beginning of the film, paleontologist Donald Sutherland arrives at the Argyle family's home and reveals that he is the undeniable alibi of one of the members executed for the murder of his mother two years ago, you have the feeling that you are about to look high thriller; an innocent man has been convicted and a murderer is still there. But as the movie progresses, your disappointment inevitably increases. <br /> <br /> "Ordeal by Innocence" is a dull and sometimes boring film that never comes up. Nothing interesting has happened since the beginning and even the final revelation of the facts lacks surprise and intensity (whether you have guessed it or not). <br /> <br /> Donald Sutherland, Cristopher Plummer, Faye Dunaway and Sarah Miles in "Ryan's Daughter"), simply go through their roles and not very enthusiastic either. <br /> <br /> You will not miss much if you skip this one.
