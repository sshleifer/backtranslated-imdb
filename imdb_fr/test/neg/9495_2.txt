I really do not know much about the Marquis de Sade, having read none of his books, but I never imagined him as a fiery queen. Carson Kressley of Queer Eye For The Straight Guy, or Jack of Will and Grace would have perfectly integrated the role that Nick Mancuso entrusted to us. <br /> <br /> The film itself was rather skinny and seemed rather parodic - or an excuse to show several brothels in Paris with men and women having fun on the sofas in the living room. What? They can not afford a room? I thought it was nice that Madam (Irina Malysheva) felt that she was fulfilling her patriotic task in dealing with the needs of the soldier. <br /> <br /> The movie was just an excuse to show a lot of breasts - and I mean a lot! Fans of Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) might be interested in seeing him play a different role as a Marsh Inspector.
