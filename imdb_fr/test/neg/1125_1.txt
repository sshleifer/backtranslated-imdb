I can not believe that the actors agreed to make this "film". I could not even stand to look at him for a long time for fear of losing his IQ. points for every second that passes. I guess no one on the network who broadcast this dribble has looked at it before releasing it. IMDB ratings are only 1 for awful, it's time to insert negative numbers for cases like this.
