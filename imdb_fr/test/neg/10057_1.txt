Nightkill plays Robert Mitchum as a tired individual from around the world investigating the case of a missing industrialist (Mike Connors). He is hired by Jaclyn Smith, the anxious wife of the missing man. What Jaclyn fails to inform Mitchum is that she knows very well where her husband is. After all, she helped her lover, James Franciscus, get rid of her wealthy husband. <br /> <br /> What more would you expect from a rotten slasher movie with Robert Mitchum? Mannix goes to the West, the monkeys are mistreated, the models lean against classic cars, and Smith is constantly outclassed by Sybil Danning until the conclusion of a giallo style puts an end to the disorder. It's bad cinema. And this movie is so poor. This gives the impression that Halloween is mixed with Trick Or Treats. Avoid that. <br /> <br /> R rated for graphic violence, nudity and sexual situations.
