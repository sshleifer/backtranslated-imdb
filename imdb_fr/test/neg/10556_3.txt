As a fan of C.J.'s latest film, Latter Days, I really wanted to love this movie. <br /> <br /> The nicest thing I can say, though, is that it's NOT a horrible movie. There are good performances and some fun scenes. Tori Spelling has some great scenes where she addresses the ex-boyfriend of his fiance. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's a nice week. The script uses strange coincidences and movie shots all too often. (The main character went to Stanford with a golf purse and his high school friend does not even know he's playing the game?) <br /> <br /> Most of the time, this movie had no idea where he was. to go or what he was trying to say. There are many scenes that are slightly cute, but eventually become a waste of time. And you could easily cut half of the characters in the movie without losing anything. <br /> <br /> Yet, despite all its faults, I must say that this is one of the best gay movies of recent years. Which says a lot about the seriousness of most gay movies. <br /> <br /> I hope the next C.J. movie will be better.
