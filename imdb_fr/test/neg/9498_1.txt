Except for the shiny look, this show had little to recommend. The writing was condescending and condescending. Without exception, the characters were shallow and unsympathetic. The female characters came out of the worst ... reduced to spoiled and selfish heads whose ambition was to run in stiletto dresses and try to sack a man. This aspect of the show is all the more curious as the series was produced by two women! The acting was mostly dull and humorless, with actors playing one-dimensional characters attacking each scene on the same note. This is not entirely the fault of the actors. If they had spent more time developing characters and plot, adding a little style and humor, MVP would have been a success. What remains to us is something flat and vaguely unpleasant.
