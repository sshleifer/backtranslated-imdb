EVALUATIONS: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br /> <br /> Former Police Officer of the New Orleans Homicide, Jack Robideaux (Jean Claude Van Damme) is reassigned to Columbus, a small but violent city in Mexico, to help the police in their efforts to end a major heroin smuggling operation in his city. The culprits turn out to be ex-soldiers, led by former commander Benjamin Meyers (Stephen Lord, aka Jase of East Enders) who uses a special method he learned in Afghanistan to fight his opponents. But Jack has a more personal reason for taking him to the ground, resulting in both men in an explosive final showdown where only one of them goes alive. <br /> <br /> After death, Van Damme seemed to be on a high road. , showing that he could make the most of the video films on the stock market. Although it's a much more drama-oriented film, with The Shepherd, he's back to the pest, no clever action has made him famous and has unfortunately produced his worst film ever since Derailed. It's not nearly as bad as this movie, but what I said is still valid. <br /> <br /> A dull and predictable film, with very little exciting action. The little thing here is mainly scenes of lifeless battles, which try to look cool and trendy with inexpensive, step-by-step or low-speed effects that unfortunately make them more desperate. As a Mexican screenwriter, director Isaac Florentine has tried to give the film an impression of Robert Rodriguez / Desperado, but that only adds to despair. <br /> <br /> VD gives a particularly uninspired performance and been an actor of Robert De Niro, it can not be good. As a bad guy, Lord should not expect to leave the beeb anytime soon. He begins to have little dialogue at the beginning as he struggles to get an American accent, but mysteriously improves towards the end. All supporting actors are equally bland and do nothing to raise the morale of the films. <br /> <br /> This is a shepherd who has gone astray from the flock. *
