I must say that this movie was really pretty awful. the acting was average, the pace of the film was horrible, as well as the soundtrack and cinematography.I found that I was bored in most parts of the film and the lines of shots did not bring me nothing. the two boys who played the main roles sometimes looked terrible and did not draw the emotion necessary for the film. the little girl was sometimes goosebumps and looked like a scary doll. the end was not satisfactory although the film on the end does not make me feel for the characters. this movie was boring and did not do anything for me, I do not recommend it to anyone.
