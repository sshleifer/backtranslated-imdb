San Franpyscho: 1 of 10: So, you want to make a serial killer movie. But your budget is nonexistent, your photographic equipment is old and your stars are Joe Estevez (the younger brother of Martin Sheen and a base actor in very bad movies) and Todd Bridges of Different Strokes. There are probably ways to shoot at least one viewable movie. The Quiroz brothers have no idea. <br /> <br /> First, much of the cast seems to have been chosen to desperately attempt to make Bridges and Estevez look like Oscar-winning thespians. How difficult is it to play a priest or a domineering mother? Certainly, a city the size of San Francisco has some professional actors willing to work for a few dollars and a screen credit. It is clear that Chris Angelo and Bonnie Steiger who play these roles have other talents such as landscaper or waitress that they should fine tune. <br /> <br /> Joe Rosete as a killer (yes, the serial killer is simply called "The Killer") is also pretty horrible in terms of the method of the mentally ill, but I am almost willing to give him the benefit of the doubt, because his character is written with a null style or personality.An annoying serial killer almost laughable is a problem for a serial killer movie. <br /> <br /> In addition, the Quiroz brothers seem to have originally planned it to be the ABC family's week-long film, there is no nudity or violence, and the R rating is clearly for adult-style stimulation This movement meanders like an 85-year-old woman driving with wraparound sunglasses and flashing lights.The only occasional horror has just lighted Estevez's face with a look that gives the impression that his lower jaw has been removed <br /> <br /> I did not expect to a good movie when I rented San Franpyscho, but I did not expect the mind numbing boredom either.
