"Music and lyrics written and performed by Charlie Daniels" ... says Nuff. Do not expect something like "Devil Went Down To Georgia", old Charles is talking in a song at the beginning of a song on Whiskey Mountain (duh) and that's it for the lyrics. Fans of arty rap scenes will love the Polaroid montage (my second-hand copy is in the FAMILY movie category) and who does not like the endless scenes of rednecks amazed by Purty Wimmen? The art of the box made the film a lot stranger than it was, with the promise that "you can lose your life-- or your mind!", But it's mostly about two couples who are walking through the sticks and playing "naturally". I love this hermit.
