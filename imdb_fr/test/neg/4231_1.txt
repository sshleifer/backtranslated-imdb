The main character, Pharaoh, suffered the loss of his wife and child in the past preceding the film. He deals with just by closing emotionally. A film too long, too much time devoted to the expressionless face of Pharaoh, too much "time of road" (one of the problems of the television: to fill his time of cars in movement, of trains, etc.) absurdly trivial - actions without reason neither emotion. His best friends, Joseph and Domino, are not much more, their relationship is based on sex (this movie may give a new meaning to the term "free sex"); Domino and Pharaoh's mother are the two characters who display an emotion, but not much. It is difficult to say with all the characters in this film: is it an indifferent game, indifferent writing or simply indifferent characters portrayed by good writing and good acting? The characters in this film speak very little to anyone; no wonder they are emotionally isolated, which is all the more strange since it is clear that they live in a neighborhood where people are friendly and know each other.
