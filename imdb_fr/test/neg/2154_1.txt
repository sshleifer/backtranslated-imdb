I'm not sure who's having fun anymore, the people who wrote the reviews or the director of the film. I could not read these comments or watch this movie, I had to say something. <br /> <br /> I can see a small budget Western film made with passion and interest for detail, but using garage with art deco lettering, pastel colors, actors who seem to be falling off sleep because the script is so boring and the boom is taking place on the way to the camera every two scenes, this is certainly not my definition of "one of the best Western movies" produced in the new millennium ". <br /> <br /> > Please, if any of you had friends in the movie, say it!
