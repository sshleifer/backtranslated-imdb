After the death of their star runner after a race, members of a track team are tracked down and killed by a mysterious masked murderer seeking revenge for the girl's death. <br /> <br /> From the beginning of this film, it was pretty obvious that it was not going to be very good (at least as far as the true quality was concerned). The "dramatic" track race at the end of the opening scene was one of the least credible sports events I have ever seen in a movie. It seems that the winner of the race has never run in his life. Not just run track. . . but, run at all. Already. From there, we find a woman Marine, horribly unrealistic, who violated many rules of appearance with her jewelry and makeup, not to mention the fact that her hair was hanging from his collar while she was in uniform . Ridiculously awkward camera angles, pathetically gore effects, and scary-boring roles (only one actor, notice it) help make this movie one of the hilarious horror movies by nature . On the other hand, the writing was not so bad and the story was going well. But the staging was horrible, aggravated by bad cinematography. The game of actors went from acceptable to simply catastrophic. Regardless of all the bad, embarrassing elements, however, there is something here, be it cheese or anything else that I can not understand, that makes the movie extremely enjoyable and very worthy of a watch. Maybe it was just Vanna White. <br /> <br /> Mandatory slasher elements: <br /> <br /> - Violence / Gore: The death scenes were quite funny, but the gore was horrible: the blood gushes out from impossible angles, no cuts or wounds caused by knives, etc. But this movie has the first scene of "death by football" that I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> - Sex / Nudity: There was some nudity (I mean, Linnea Quigley is, after all) and some high school students too excited, but nothing of excess. <br /> <br /> - Cool Killer (s): If you think that leather gloves, chronometers, costume tracks, and fencing masks are cool, this one is for you. <br /> <br /> - Scares / Suspense: Not really at all. There is a moment in the girls' locker room for which I was preparing to be afraid. . . but, this led to a typical stupidity and was ruined for me. <br /> <br /> - Mystery: a little, but if you can not understand the identity of the killer about 20 minutes after the beginning of the movie, then I'm not too sure of your powers of deduction. <br /> <br /> - Clumsy Dance Scene: There is a beautiful impromptu jam session ("Graduation Day Blues") with a guitar and harmonica leading to some great 80's bows. time afterwards by some sort of strange mix of 70s disco and 80s break dance that was probably the scariest part of the movie. <br /> <br /> Final verdict: 4/10. Do not take it too seriously and you could enjoy it (like almost everything else Troma touches). <br /> <br /> -AP3-
