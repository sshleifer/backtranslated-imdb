Long ago, in the early '80s, a night TV show, "Fridays," arrived on ABC, to steal the show on NBC's "Saturday Night Live" channel. This was not the case, but it allowed the world to make disgusting skits and semi-talented "comics". Like Mark Blankenfield, for example. <br /> <br /> Which, in a roundabout way, brings us to "Jekyll and Hyde ... again together". Which is disgusting on its own. <br /> <br /> Blankenfield is about as subtle as a couch filled with cushions that goes out after communion. And about as good taste. It is simply his character drugged addict he played in the unhappy spectacle of "Fridays" stretching as far as the eye can see. And if you did not like it there, why do you read this review? <br /> <br /> Every time it takes more than one or two writers to write a movie, it's a bad sign. Then, when it comes to insignificant jokes that could make you lose all the improvisational scenes of the Western Hemisphere and replace the gags by profanity, the situation can only get worse. <br /> <br /> A comic book about Robert Louis Stevenson's story? An idea as good as making a sitcom from "The Fall of Usher's House" by Poe. <br /> <br /> Aside from a few gags that give a slight smile, this whole film is an exercise in wasted actors, wasted film, wasted opportunities. <br /> <br /> No wonder they showed the original author Stevenson turning in his grave. What more careful criticism could they give themselves? <br /> <br /> No stars. No, not even for Armstrong, who should have known better. <br /> <br /> "Hyde" of it.
