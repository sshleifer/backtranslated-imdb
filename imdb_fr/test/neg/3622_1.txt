Zoey 101 is such a stupid show. I do not know if it's because the pretentious Jamie Lynn Spears is the star or whatever, but I just know the show is bad. This is a girl and her brother going to a boarding school. The jokes of this show are extremely boring and insignificant, and I hate all the characters except Chase and Lola. Heck, the jokes on this show are so funny that they make Jack Black look like Monty Python. if this show were a person worthy of honor, he would hang himself in shame. <br /> <br /> 1/10
