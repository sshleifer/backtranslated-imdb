This is a film of Toilet Pictures. If the name of the production company indicates how bad a movie is, then that would be good. I think I'm not really a fan of horror movies, not that I'm a chicken, but rather this year alone, I have not really been frightened by what's been offered so far, whether it's from West or Asia. 9:56 is no different, good principle, but poor performance, relying on clich√©d techniques (I think these are the only tools available trade?) To try to get moments of heartbeat. <br /> <br /> Se -jin (Ko So-young) is a lonely woman who one day finds that some apartments in the building opposite hers are simultaneously experiencing power cuts at 9:56 pm accurate. No, she is not a voyeur, but a series of unexplained deaths in the neighborhood, one of which she meets herself in a subway, lead him deeper into the mystery that surrounds them. <br /> <br /> With horror movies, there's always a pseudo-logical explanation in the movie about how ghosts happen. That's about all that's happening in the film, the outcome of the "truth", even if seasoned moviegoers will not need to guess the plot midway. Which of course makes the experience of watching this movie very unsatisfactory. <br /> <br /> There are a myriad of characters like the girl in a wheelchair, and the neighbors who take care of her in turn, as well as a schoolgirl, detective, a boy with mental disorders and a spooky suburban train. But according to the gender formula, these people are usually there to feed the dead, or in this case, useless characters to the red herring whose only purpose is to deceive the public, regardless of whether they convolent or add little to advance the plot. <br /> And do not get me started on the techniques used here. Quick cuts, sudden appearances, long-haired ghouls (ahhhhhhh, so pass!) Who can not move properly, abundant amount of blood as if it was flowing freely on a mountain, and the list goes on. But the credit goes to the sound engineers for creating crackling sounds that are used every time the ghosts move, even though it looks like a one-off pony. <br /> <br /> Do not waste time on this, even if you're a horror fan. It's a total mess of a promising place, and in the end, it feels like being driven. A very long and painful to bear. It is high time to innovate in this genre, otherwise one film will easily look like another, with ugly, long-haired monsters moving in a funny way, but able to make sudden appearances accompanied by loud sounds. Oh, and can anyone oil those doors while they are there too?
