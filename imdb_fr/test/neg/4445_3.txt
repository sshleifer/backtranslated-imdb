In a top-down career with all kinds of movies, Altman is a science fiction essay, and this clearly shows that it's not his forte. <br /> <br /> The film is almost incomprehensible. It seems like a disastrous combination of experimental theater pretense and a big studio trying to follow the post-Star Wars movement (it's not that this movie is inspired by this one, but you can imagine that the studio has signed for sci-fi movie Paul Newman). The story is non-existent, the characters are unknown to us all along. <br /> <br /> Altman has packs of dogs feeding on corpses throughout the film, obviously trying to make some sort of POINT. But as the film is so badly thought, starting with the lack of intrigue, it is really nothing. <br /> <br /> The conceived production is confused, the photography is defeated by the blur. on the edges, and the score is terrible. However, "Quintet" has a usage feature. Not only is the film clearly filmed in the snow and ice, but the interiors are also kept cold. You see the breath of the actors in each scene. You really feel cold.
