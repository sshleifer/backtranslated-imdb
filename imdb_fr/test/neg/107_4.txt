Horror movie at low budget. If you do not increase your expectations, you will probably enjoy this little movie. The beginning and the end are pretty good, the middle sometimes drags and seems to go nowhere for long periods of time as we watch the insane events that add an atmosphere but do not advance the plot. A little gore. I appreciated Bill McGhee's performance, which he made credible enough for a low-budget photo, he managed to make the film at times when nothing seemed to happen. Nurse Charlotte Beale, played by Jesse Lee, interpreted her character well, so be prepared to slap her towards the end! She makes some really stupid mistakes, but that's what makes these low-budget movies so good! I would have been outside this place and five states long before she even thought it would be a good idea to leave! If you like this movie, try Committed from 1988, which is actually a scam of this movie.
