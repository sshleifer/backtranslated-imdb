This film is a very bad example of an uninvited storytelling, which tries to hide behind an "artfilm" facade, trying to shock the audience with unmotivated violence (against women) to cover its lack of psychological depth of characters and his internal conflicts. Everything in this film is pretentious, thanks to Bela Tarr at first, through photography, acting, music, history and editing. When suddenly, for no reason, you are forced to watch close-up shots of "charismatic" Hungarian peasants in their boats, while the soundtrack tries to persuade you that it is supposed to be a dramatic moment, even though that on the way to the burial of the local alcoholic, that's one thing. Transforming completely unmotivated rape scenes into shock is a different thing for which I have absolutely no understanding. This film tries very hard to enter into a certain genre of artistic films (dramatic genre of Eastern Europe), but lacks the subtlety, observation and "soul" capabilities that other directors possess.
