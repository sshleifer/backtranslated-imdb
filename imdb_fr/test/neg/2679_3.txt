Man, the 90's have been a horrible decade for movies. The films are lacking in a good style and the story is often lacking. <br /> <br /> This 6th entry of the long Halloween series is definitely a bad one. We never really go down in history because it is not a film that is very well built and constructed. <br /> <br /> It's just a badly made film, which also suffers from his writing without imaginative characters that are there. Dr. Loomis seems to be there just for the sake of it. It's a shame that this is the last film role of Donald Pleasence. It's nice and also to say that his last role is in a Halloween movie, but he certainly deserved to be in a better. <br /> <br /> There is never a real danger in the film and the character of Michael Myers is never threatening or scary. Maybe it's due to the fact that he was too much in the movie from the beginning. He does his usual work but without much class or originality. Also, attempts to discover Myer's past do not really work, for the main reason why this is simply not explained very well. It is obvious that the script has already been rewritten several times - and most likely also during filming. Several scenes were even re-turned or added after the first cut proved far from pleasant. <br /> <br /> The film most often resembles a movie made for television. This is also due to the lack of real blood. As a horror film, it is fundamentally all that this film is a good, if not an original, to watch. <br /> <br /> So far, the worst film of the series! <br /> 3 / ten
