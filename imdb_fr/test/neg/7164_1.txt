Movies like this make me furious just because they do not deserve the funding to get into my DVD player. This film is ambiguous in its cover and even more impenetrable in its casting choices (why does Mrs. Song have a romantic interest) Did they just want an Asian woman, or does her unconvincing character really give her message "the story of the film" a new perspective)? We have very little to do in approaching this film and even less as the story unfolds. But a good hour after the start of the procedure, I realized that the casting was boring and that all that the casting agent could pick up, the unconvincing studies on the character are the result of the writer's reflection capitalism, materialism and progress in the postmodern world. Towards the end of this film, just before going down in the head and missing the last two minutes, I felt that "Everything's Gone Green" is a product of "connections" in the film world - someone with very little talent knew someone with very little management skills, knew someone with absolutely no marketing sense (but a lot of disposable ego) and passed that dull and ineffective attempt at fantasy and a non sense of humor-with-a-consciousness. And that's the most exasperating - how much better scripts have been passed in favor of this almost unassailable filler? Pass this movie and feel good about yourself.
