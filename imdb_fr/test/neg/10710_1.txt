Warning: This could ruin your movie. Look at it and see if you agree. <br /> <br /> To think that we humans can not learn from the past. The futuristic society portrays in glamor what Hitler believed: to erase a race of people (here men) for the benefit of society. It hurts my stomach. Moreover, the plausibility of a Y bomb is insane. Even in times of war, our instinct of preservation will prevent the extinction of humanity. We had made mistakes in the past, namely: Japan, Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945, but because of that, we avoided a bigger mistake in 1963 during the missile crisis in Cuba.
