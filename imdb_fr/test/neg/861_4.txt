Sylvester the stowaway cat on a ship on which is the bird Tweety with its owner Granny. Oh, I do not even have enough words to express how much I disdain the characters of Tweety and Granny. They are just not funny to me and have made this short film a chore to accomplish. Sylvester is a great character all by himself, but he can not do anything more against the terrible horror of this cursed offer and the old senile witch of a grandma. This animated short is on Looney Tunes Gold Collection, Volume 4, Disc 4, and features an optional commentary by Micheal Barrier. <br /> <br /> My note: D +
