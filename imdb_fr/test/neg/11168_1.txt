Stay away from this movie. The fact that you read reviews tells me that you may have already been tainted by the atrocity he is carrying. It's a really horrible movie ... so let's get into trouble. Writing and Staging: I would not be surprised if these questions were handled by a group of hyperactive school-aged students who watched "screaming" and "I know what you did last summer" several times. Giant plot holes abound; Although I can not congratulate them for this film, it's good to know that they are finally trained in cleanliness. Actors (or their absence): Only the best movies of this movie ... the most beautiful extras ever seen for a screen, now featuring their debut as a speaker! As a disclaimer, I must note that I am able to watch and enjoy just about anything. I recognize a good movie when I see it, but I can still laugh and smile during Bubble Boy (yes, that's right); so when I say avoid something, you know I'm not joking.
