These are some vampires (who can run in the sun), which cause problems in South America. Casper Van Dien is sent with his commando team to investigate. The film begins with Van Dien & Co. walking in the jungle, and there is this huge black who can not act at all. He speaks all his lines as if he was reading them for the first time on the memory cards. His voice is so low that in reality, it's really hilarious. Great way to start the movie! Anyway, they meet some of our vampires and shoot them (it makes them look dead about 20 seconds), then they come back to life. Van Dien notices that one of them has been impaled on a tree branch and shouts to his friends to kill them with wood. It must be believed that stunts are effective - vampires are on cables that pull them up trees, which is supposed to give them the impression of being able to climb very easily, but it makes them look like elastic balls. or something. <br /> <br /> Yeah ... anyway, later, the huge black is in South America with some guys (Van Dien not included), and they are attacked by more vampires. It's such a shame that these guys have never heard of a crossbow, because it looks like it's the perfect weapon to kill little leeches, but they're using big old wooden piles that they're trying to to impale the vampires by hand. The big black guy ends up being captured and he eventually becomes a powerful powerful vampire leader. Van Dien ends up fighting him later. It does not help that throughout the movie, everyone forgets that if you shoot a vampire, it is stunned for about 20 seconds, which would allow a person to hang on quite easily. They are just trying to stick to them in the middle of a hand-to-hand fight. Yes, it's not really a brilliant tactic. <br /> <br /> There's a hot girl (remember Veronica from the TV show The Lost World? Yes, that's her!) who's also walking right in the middle of Vampire County sort of mission of research, and she happens to be Van Dien's ex-wife. Hey, what are the chances? It's a shame that she is not much more in the movie than she is. Will she and Casper get back together at the end? Van Dien will he defeat the huge black guy who can not act? Will circus vampires make you laugh through all the many action scenes? Will we hear the music of the three stooges when someone will do something funny? Even Lynda Carter forgot how to play her little cameo (she is more convincing in her ads Sleep Number Bed)? If you come to the end of the film, you will get answers to these questions and many more. <br /> <br /> I do not know, he could score points if the quality is bad, but that's about it. Uh, it's a bunch of gaffes running in the jungle, I guess it's pretty entertaining.
