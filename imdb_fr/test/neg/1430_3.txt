Dee Snider is the villain of this film and his bad way of acting and acting excessively has ruined everything for me. The whole movie just seemed to take itself too seriously. He tries to realize the dark atmosphere of "Seven" without acting. The film highlights the industrial urban "subculture" of rock / tattoo / body art and expects us to be impressed (scared?) By the size of a guy's nose ring. I am not a movie expert, but the script and role in this film are terrible. Dee Snider is watching the villain but his action is downright horrible. I recommend not to waste time on this one unless nothing else is available.
