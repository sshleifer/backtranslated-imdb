About the spoiler warning? It's not "can contain", it contains spoilers. Beware of readers. <br /> <br /> Okay, first we need to know that I do not denigrate the actors. They work just with what they receive. The problem was the script. It was horrible. There was nothing credible about it. Of course, when you have a film based on a deadly hitchhiker, there will be a bad mistake here and there that puts you in a terribly horrible and movie-worthy situation. But these girls come to make a stupid decision after a stupid decision. The only smart enough girl to call the police was added at the end because he had already killed one and hit another with a car. Speaking of hitting her with a car ... why the heck did she try to overtake a truck rather than run sideways like a normal person? Moreover, whoever wrote the scenario was honest, do you think that the police will not investigate a door covered in blood? Frankly, it was not disturbing either. The only suspense I felt was the frustration of how delayed the girls were. Well, that rage has lasted longer than I thought for such a bad movie, so I'm not going to deal with the end, except that it's unrealistic and lame.
