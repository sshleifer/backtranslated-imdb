To this day, it's still the worst waste I've ever seen. So annoyed that I even complained to Blockbuster to have it stored. Friends and I rented it after taking a look at the back cover thinking we were going to have a good horror movie. The plot seems to change during the movie and there was a lot of irrelevant padding. The movie ended rather abruptly, I guess they ran out of film. The quality of the sound was terrible and the first female character had a very strong Spanish accent, even if she still told nonsense. The guy provided a bit of tidbit until his bizarre murder attempts. After spending a lot of time discussing the workshop and his many power tools, he chose to put a plastic bag on his head. All in all, I think you have to watch this movie to really believe it.
