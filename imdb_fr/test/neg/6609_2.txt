the movie is just horrible (2/10). Although the actors do their best (well sometimes it's not much), the special effects are ... let me say so, it would be better if there were none. <br /> <br /> The script is based on Sapkowski's prose, so it should be the biggest advantage of this movie. Unfortunately, it's the opposite. There is nothing left of the original atmosphere. And it's very chaotic. Maybe they had too much material to broadcast within 2 hours. <br /> <br /> Anyway, if you want to see this movie, I would recommend you to search the TV series (same title, same actors, even the plot). remains the same) that was done at the same time as the movie. It's so much better (9/10) and the story makes sense :)
