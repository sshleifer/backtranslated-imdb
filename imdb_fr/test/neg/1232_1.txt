Please do not waste six hours of your life watching this as I did. The fact that I did it is not a very good reflection on me. The only work of comedian in this clunker was that of Wes Studi. How a 'prequel' with similar roots can not even be in the same universe as Lonesome Dove exceeds me !! It was a disjointed story, disjointed, incoherent. The plot lines were not developed, the action scenes were almost laughable and the big end (disappointment) was perfect for this mini-series. Val Kilmer, whom I thought of as a famous actor, played one of the strangest roles I have ever seen. His last scene of the series had to have been a charge for the director. I read these reviews for years and this show encouraged me to register!
