"Love Life" explores a reason marriage scenario between a lesbian and a culturally relevant homosexual. I found the subject fascinating, even though the conflict was a little bit forced and too easy to solve. For example, Thomas falls for Joe a little too quickly and easily for the plot. There are a lot of continuity errors: another user commented on different cars in the garage, Joe's glasses ... what struck me the most was that Joe's facial hair configuration seemed change from one scene to another. Finally, I found myself more excited by this film than moved. Stephan D. Gill has a nice body and shows it all over and over with skill and exuberance pornstar, as well as chops very often agile. Many times, the movie seems to go to porn. Stephanie Kirchen did a good job, but her moment of enlightenment at the end was somewhat tarnished for me, because I wanted to have fun in the shower at the end of the film.
