If you've seen the grudge, another mediocre ghost movie, you should know what to expect, much worse, much worse. This time, instead of being in Japan with all the anglophones, we are in Spain with all the anglophones. It is interesting to note that not a single shot of this film actually looks like Spain and could not have been entirely shot in the studio. Oh, and a place with swings, because there are 5 good minutes of swing sequences without anyone, oooohhh how sinister. <br /> <br /> This one is terrible in every way. The behavior of lame parents does not help at all. Anna Paquin is the only person to offer a decent performance in the film, but I hate Anna Paquin. So you can imagine my private hell watching this movie. <br /> <br /> There is however a good moment in the film. when a villain tries to explain the intricate plot to the character of Anna Paquin and she understands nothing about it and asks a lot of stupid questions and he lets out "You're stupid, you did not understand anything " lol. Well, I understand that this movie is a trash. 0 stars.
