Harry Knowles has a quote right on the cover of the DVD saying "The Next Horror Icon" Really?!?!?!? I heard a lot of hype around this one but I was not totally convinced. However, I am a fan of horror and I will give a chance to any horror movie. No matter what the budget or valuation, you never know where you will find the next jewel. Not here. No Hatchet. Hatchet is badly designed, badly played and funny. It's not because you have actors who have played Freddy Jason and Candyman and a topless Buffy chic with tons of gore that you do not become an expert on horror. I do not even want to describe the plot because she's so stupid. Honestly, my money is on Rob Zombie. There is a man who knows the horror of the old school. Forget that trash.
