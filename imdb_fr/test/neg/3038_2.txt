The original WASC is by no means a must-see film of its kind. In fact, without the first 25 minutes of cooling, there would be no logical reason to look at it. The remake takes those 25 minutes and turns them into a poor horror movie of 85 minutes for teenagers. <br /> <br /> Now I have nothing against the PG-13 horror movies but the trend around them is getting weaker and weaker. When you see the PG-13 rating, you expect a movie filled with fake alerts, teen t.v. or music stars, and a plot that has been used many times. Do not even ask for coolness or violence. <br /> <br /> I know it's not right to compare both the original WASC and the remake, but I think it's necessary to do it because the whole idea of ​​the new tool relies on the beginning of the original. The tension felt through the first film is not present in the remake. Not even with the incredible settings or the brilliant use of lightning. No tension, suspense, thrills ... nothing. The film goes too slowly before becoming a bit "interesting", and that's when the stranger appears. The chase sequence is probably the best part of the movie because there is at least the feeling of "what will happen next?" But that's all. The situations set up for the climax are predictable, boring and unresolved. The original has the merit of having suspense in the most important scenes, and also, to culminate under the cold of the most important scene of the film. <br /> <br /> I understand now that it's a horror movie in PG-13, but, if you respect the original. Why change is the most important situation? Children are not supposed to survive! After the end, I felt as if this movie was useless. So the babysitter was playing cat and mouse with a wacko ... that's all. Then the sequence at the hospital was completely stupid. And worst of all, it means that a sequel can be on the way. <br /> <br /> Camila Belle is the best thing about the movie. It offers a cute and credible performance. She has to choose better projects although this role wins for her thousands of teenage fans. <br /> <br /> Please, do not watch this movie. Some people say that to support the genre Horror, we are supposed to support any movie that comes out. I do not necessarily agree. If we ignore films like WASC, horror film producers will understand that we will not accept the CRAP format. We want good horror movies, not lame movies filled with false fears. <br /> <br /> Look at the original "When A Stranger Calls" instead, because its first 25 minutes are much better than the whole remake (useless).
