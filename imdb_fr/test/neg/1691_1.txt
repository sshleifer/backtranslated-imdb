The classic author C.S. Lewis wrote an essay stating that no children's story is worth reading, watching, etc. if it can only be appreciated by the children. I would say that this film is easy to defend to defend its argument. <br /> <br /> At the age of five or six, I loved it, I did not find it until three or four years later and I found it wet, badly animated, written with tenacity and confusion, and with terribly repetitive and awful songs (I'm looking at you, hi-cockalorum), showing a production aimed at foolish foolishness and fantasy, but ending up in a nasty, twee, frustrating mess. <br /> <br /> Show it to your baby, but I strongly recommend you do not buy a copy or try not to watch. If you want something that happens at the same time but with a sincere charm and intelligence, choose "Oliver Twist" or the brilliant adaptation of "The Box of Delights" by the BBC.
