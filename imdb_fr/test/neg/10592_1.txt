The Mod Squad is not a film, it's a void. This is the most fascinating thing about it and the thing that made me look ?? I had never seen a movie that offered absolutely nothing before. It's a movie without any reason to exist, apparently consciously designed to appeal to no one, as if it were a simple contractual obligation to someone that the studio does not really like. There is no plot, there is no characterization, there are no action scenes in the room, there are not even scenes as such, just a progression more and more empty shots shot at 24 frames per second. I'm not talking about emptiness like in a silly, but empty summer blockbuster like in "We do not have pages yet, so just point the camera at something and stop when you have 90 minutes." This makes you appreciate the "artistic achievements" of Charlie's Angels and S.W.A.T. much more. What he offers is far too much of Giovanni Ribisi on his account the most fastidiously execrable of his bastard son of a thousand morons imitating the routine of action of the method Marlon Brando, Michael Lerner dancing with Omar Epps and ?? no, that's it. Oh, Clare Danes has a beautiful smile all at once. And Dennis Farina makes sense to get killed early. Truly the most useless film in the world, it's like Humanity without jokes but, you know, for kids.
