[WARNING: Some spoilers are included, though this is a documentary.] <br /> <br /> I bought this documentary because I like the work of directors DA Pennebaker and Chris Hegedus, which includes MOON OVER Broadway , STARTUP.COM and THE WAR ROOM., Are excellent documentaries that I would highly recommend. Looking at this ultimately boring and uninteresting account of Depeche Mode's 1988 tour, I realized that they had nothing to work with when they decided to put the film together. The band members were certainly far from showing; therefore, the contest to add fans on a week-long bus trip was added to enliven things a bit. Really, now, I mean, come on. Who thought that a concert movie of a synth-pop band with three keyboardists and a singer would be a good idea? Certainly, I like the music of Depeche Mode, and Martin Gore writes good melodies, but to see them in concert never seemed to be interesting, and this film is the proof. Unless you're a huge fan of Depeche Mode, stay away from this documentary ... it's a total waste of time.
