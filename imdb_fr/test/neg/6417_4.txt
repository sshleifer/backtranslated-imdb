This is the worst work of Daniel Day Lewis ..... I can not believe that the same year he made this horrible movie and My left foot ..... Please stay away from this movie. ... it's a film intended only for Argentines, out of curiosity ... The plot is impossible to understand ...... The writer thinks that in Argentina everybody speaks in English ... Of course , Patagonia brings a very good frame to the film's photo shoot, but that's not enough reason to see this movie .... I repeat, only if you're a big fan of Daniel Day Lewis, or if you want to see southern Argentina, part of Patagonia, and you do not have enough money to travel yourself .......
