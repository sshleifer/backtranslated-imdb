this movie is so bad. but it's so bad that I laughed at myself. for people who like movies, do not look at this one. for people who like good and bad movies, I recommend this one. the scenario is fragile, the scenario is horrible, the acting is horrible to mediocre. The soundtrack throughout the movie was cheesy but I loved it. Cool slogans were an asset. ha ha "if it can bleed, it can die". the fight scenes made me crack. it seemed to me that they spent more time on these parts than any other, because the fight scenes were mostly clean. I almost feel that this film could have been good if it had not been f / x ... no, it would still have been a breeze. the thing for the eyes was corny. and as the girl was eating her boyfriend's belly in the kitchen, they could have done something that would actually be eating something or at least putting more fake blood on her face. and the explosion of the lighthouse disappointed me. I thought they might have had real fire instead of synthetic synthetic stuff. and the end was so predictable, which surprised me when they did what they thought they could do. so overall. I would say it's a classic with regard to crappy movies. its in my bottom 5.
