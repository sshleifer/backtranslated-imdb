Overall, it's a movie for kids. We saw it tonight and my child loved it. At one point, my child's excitement was so great that it was impossible to sit down. However, I am a big fan of A.A. Milne's books are very subtle and hide a sly intelligence behind the childlike quality of her main characters. This film was not subtle. It seems a shame that Disney does not see the point of making movies with more stories in these pages, although it may not be allowed to use them. I found myself wishing the theater to play "Winnie-the-Pooh and Tigger" instead. The voices of the characters were very good. I was really disturbed only by Kanga. The music, however, was sometimes twice as loud as the dialogue and incongruous for the film. <br /> <br /> As for the story, she was a bit suspicious and militant. Overall, I was disappointed, but would go back to see the same excitement on my child's face. <br /> <br /> I loved Lumpy's laugh ....
