I have not watched this show for months, but for a while, I had to watch it every day because I had a roommate who liked it. So, maybe it has undergone big improvements over all this time, although the ads and the rating of 4.2 on IMDb are not a good sign. <br /> <br /> It was clearly a simple quick replacement for Chappelle's Show. Even Mencia says it. And even though I was not even a big fan of Chappelle's Show, his jokes were at least original and smart (and much more pointed than Mencia has ever been). Mencia's jokes are completely original and out of date. If you can not see that, I guess there is no hope for you. But to be honest, here are some examples: <br /> <br /> --Mencia blatantly tears the skit Lil Jon de Chapelle. Just take it. <br /> <br /> - "South Park" makes an episode about Scientology. A week later, Mencia tells a joke about his attack on Scientologists. Keep in mind that the joke is NOT about Scientologists, but how much he offended them on his show. So far, he has never made a single Scientology joke. <br /> <br /> - After Hurricane Katrina, two photos of the PA circulate on the Internet showing a black man "looting" the grocery store and a white woman. "find them". WEEKS later, after millions of people have already seen this, Mencia presents it as if he had discovered it and is shown for the first time (the Daily Show would have been on something like this in one day ). Pathetic. <br /> <br /> Even more boring than the theft of jokes is the way Carlos has promoted himself and his show, claiming that it breaks a kind of computer barrier (whatever) and that if you do not laugh, you must be a weak prude who can not handle any kidding on the breed. Yes, Carlos, it's not because you're not funny, it's because we're all too offended to laugh (if it was really true, so why was Chappelle's show so popular? ). He constantly criticizes his audience for "not understanding" if he does not laugh enough, and repeats and often explains his jokes, a technique that most comedians stop using at the age of 14. <br /> <br /> The worst thing is that Mencia does not seem to be very intelligent. It's a bit tragic that there are dozens of more funny and insightful comedians trying to do that while that guy makes money. His show is supposed to be the third highest on Comedy Central, which is confusing (again, it has a rating of 4.2 on this site). Where the hell are they getting these numbers? Comedy Central tries to present itself as an "upset" station, but as long as it tries to seduce the most stupid public possible, this will never be the case.
