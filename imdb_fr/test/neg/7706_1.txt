So many of these types of movies are coming out these days. This zombie film falls into the category of "cheeses", unlike the much more polished dawn of the dead and the day of the dead. In all honesty, these two films were major studio releases with big budgets. But they were also good movies. A low budget movie can always be good if only they stop accepting and using the worst scripts of the moment. Whoever wrote this film must have been drunk all the time. <br /> <br /> This film had special effects and a very uneven plot. The only major difference compared to other movies of this type is the time it takes for people to turn into zombies. In this one, it seems to take them only a few seconds to die and turn into a zombie. Yet, with the ease with which this "infection" spreads, you can have zombie blood on you and not even seem to be at risk of infection, and believe me, people of this one are covered in blood . <br /> <br /> The main problem I had was that our 2 main stars sometimes walked in dozens of zombies and did not get bitten. When everyone turns into zombies, these two were invaded by zombies when they were not even armed and they could get out without problems. Our hot star even survived a missile strike on the building she was in. I laugh at full load at that time. Without weapons, having like 10 zombies on her and a missile strikes the building but manages to leave without a scratch? OK, of course .... <br /> <br /> Moreover, anyone who has informed these people of the behavior of special forces has clearly never spent time in the army. They should have watched a movie like Blackhawk to have at least some idea of ​​their behavior in combat. <br /> <br /> A soldier was an overweight soldier of the SPECIAL FORCES. LOL it was a good one. Another continued to climb the zombies thinking they were survivors, even laying down his gun at some point. These guys are here to fight the zombies and they behave like the soldiers in the movie Stripes. Special Forces, lol ... <br /> <br /> Then they get to the point where they try to explain the zombie girl in the rubber room and everything becomes very confusing. The explanation is confusing and does not even follow the first film. It made no sense. <br /> <br /> The only thing I liked was the jokes about Anti Bush. The military lady at the beginning told them that the order had been passed from the vice president to the president and that in the end, it was the vice president of an "undisclosed place" who was giving the orders. It was the best part of the movie for me.
