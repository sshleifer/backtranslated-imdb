A good idea can be completely ignored by a weak scenario that throws all credibility out of the window, leaving very little to the actors. Roth hides him as best he can by being all mouths; Hurt is about as threatening as a fluffy bunny and Stamp can not decide if he's playing an ex-London crook or a toff straight out of the playground in Eton. As for poor Laura del Sol, she does what she can, but her character is no more than the idea of ​​every North European of the stereotypical Latin American woman, who has all the evils and burning temperament . If you're a fan of one of the main actors, do not be deceived and deceive (as I suppose many other critics have already done). Look at it well, but stay critical; you know that these guys can do better.
