I know we should not expect much from a low-budget independent film. But the underlying idea is valid: an attempt to open America's eyes to the close relations between the government and the journalists who are supposed to keep an eye on it. But somehow the documentary aspect of it, away from his drama. The protests at the 2004 Republican convention in New York were not so convincing to make a documentary about it. This kind of convincing demonstration belongs to the era of the 60's. <br /> <br /> It would have been better to stick to a theatrical format. Maybe a slow rise to power where the eyes of the young journalist gradually open to the plot.
