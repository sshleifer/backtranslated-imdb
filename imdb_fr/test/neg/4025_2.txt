I rented this DVD because I'm a big fan of science fiction, but this thing (I will not call it a movie because it was obviously shot very fast on video) seemed to have been invented as and when measured. I still do not know what it was. There are these guys dressed in strange S & M outfits, and I guess they come from another planet, anyway, nothing makes sense in this film low, low, low, low budget. If it was their first film, I would leave them a little slack, but I think it's like their 5th movie and it's REALLY bad. <br /> <br /> This movie is really bad. This director must have been crazy to work even on a horrible film like this. Do not waste your time or money on this DVD, please do not do it. It's not even worth the penny I paid to rent the DVD. In fact, I'll tell them that the DVD was messed up to get my money back. I do not believe in giving a bad review to anything, but I have to do it here. My advice to anyone involved in this sinking ship - please find another job. How could you make a rotten film like this? I would give this negative stars if possible, it's terrible.
