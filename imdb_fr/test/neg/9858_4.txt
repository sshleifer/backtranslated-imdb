This documentary was neither professionally nor objectively produced. All this played as a theory of IBM's plot to win the match in question just to make money. Garry Kasparov has an ego problem. He was swollen before the match and when he lost, he did not like. I remember playing chess against computers in the 80s and it was not too hard to win. Over time, I started to lose and I did not like it. Today, I no longer play against computers, they are too good. In addition, the games are uninteresting and do not have the appeal of human games, where both sides are more likely to be wrong and open the game to exciting opportunities. This documentary continues to show us images of The Turk, a former chess automaton that was actually controlled by a human being. From the beginning to the end, we are led to believe that IBM literally hid a human GM at the back of its cabinet-sized computer. I am a computer scientist and am shocked by the idea that because Garry has lost, IBM must have cheated. I know how computers play chess. It's not magic and it's not a mystery. They can be trained, have a lot of chess knowledge, and they certainly see the positions and possibilities with unprecedented details in relation to humans. It's really no surprise that Deep Blue has won. Maybe at the time it was. If this happened today, given the ever-increasing processing power of the machines; people would hardly blink. If a machine could not at least draw with a GM today, people would think the program is weak.
