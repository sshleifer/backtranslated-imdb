From the fertile imagination that brought you the irresistible HERCULES (1983), follows from its still more absurd sequel (read gogo): from the start, we get another heavy prologue "early times" that even manages to contradict completely these same events set up in the first movie! a condensed montage of similar highlights is soon followed by a sequence of SUPERMAN scroll credits. On the narrative level, we have here four rebellious gods who steal the seven very important (but badly animated) thunders from Zeus ?? a crime that, for one thing, places the moon on a trajectory of collision with the planet Earth! Faster than you can say "nepotism", Zeus (once again played as a white-haired bearded man by the relatively young Claudio Cassinelli) sends his champion ?? who has now legitimately taken his place in the elite thanks, presumably, to the all-powerful task accomplished in the first film ?? to find his love at first sight and avoid the calamities that await him. <br /> <br /> Hardly Hercules (Lou Ferrigno, as if you did not know) had touched the earth's surface that he was in contact with two pretty young ladies (Milly Carlucci and Sonia Viviani) needing him for take them out of trouble! the first (who would later become a personality of Italian television) apparently has the ability to speak with the common people (!) ?? who are strangely like the little sisters of GODZILLA VS. MOTHRA (1964) !! In order for them to escort as many unused pictures of the first film as possible, the divine quartet of villains resurrects the good old king Minos (William Berger) with his skeletal sleep and confronts him once more with his eternal enemy. As a rule, Hercules is faced with a number of potentially deadly enemies, including a Gorgon ?? a terribly underproduced sequence that should have led to a plagiarism lawsuit if the filmmakers behind the higher good CLASH OF THE TITANS (1981) bothered to watch this film (with the same "reflection in a shield" preceded by the muscleman leaving the audience on his tactics before running them as if to show us how smart he is) !! And just to make it obvious that he is carrying his influences on his sleeve, Cozzi makes Hercules and Minos become a cosmic version of "King Kong vs. Godzilla" for one of their battles and later, King Kong attacks a great snake, a meeting straight out of the classic 1933 original. I swear it: it's the whole truth and nothing but the truth! <br /> <br /> As was the case with the first film, the cast is filled with old elements such as the previous Berger, Cassinelli and Venantino Venantini (as a wizard with a very bad hair day) and and-starlets? not only Carlucci, but also Maria Rosaria Omaggio (as a young Hera!), Serena Grandi, Pamela Prati and, again, Eva Robbins (whose costume easily replaces her appearance in the first film); for what it's worth, Pino Donaggio's score for this one is recycled from the music selected in the soundtrack of the previous movie. If you stick to this criticism so far, you must have understood now that it is one of those films so incredibly bad that a critic is forced to choose the way forward: either reject it in an unflattering phrase, indescribable time to dissect its defects. I'm sure I left out some of his ineptitudes, but I would not forgive myself if I did not mention the biggest case of loud laughter in the whole film that almost made me fall from my chair (yes, even surpassed the animated titanic duel mentioned above for me), namely the decor of the den of rebellious gods that has the shape of a giant marble ?? kettle ??! <br /> <br /> At this point, one might wonder why I attributed to this film (and its predecessor) a note instead of a BOMB (not entirely unjustified); In the past, I have had many lengthy online discussions about whether the rating of a particular movie should reflect overall artistic quality or its entertainment value. but these are two cases where I felt it necessary to be consciously influenced by him to decide my final grade. I do not know: maybe it's because I'm in a "sword-and-sandal" state of mind for the moment (with a dozen more respectable examples planned for the next few days!) But, after All, unusually for me, I decided to add these two films to my DVD collection simply based on the pleasure I had with them during this recent visit ?? and that alone must count for something, right?
