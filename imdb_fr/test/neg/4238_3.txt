Maybe this movie was special in its time. But five decades later, it seems odd, this is just another cinematographic vestige of the terrible 1950s. Stereotypes abound in this fluffy story about three gold diggers who settled in a penthouse in Manhattan, in order to attract rich husbands. <br /> <br /> The superficial theme does not bother me. But the premise of the film is lame. And the execution is worse. It's a romantic comedy, but I have little to laugh about. The plot on an extremely myopic bimbo is pretty much the only smart thing in the story. The general dialogue is flat, as is the delivery. And the structure of the script is disconcerting. The plot continues to go back and forth between the three ladies. It's as if the author could not mix the roles of the whole. The result is a plot that seems unstable. <br /> <br /> Marilyn Monroe was a good choice for her role. But Lauren Bacall was too old for the role she played. And Betty Grable, with her creaky voice and hideous hairstyle, was just boring. <br /> <br /> Color cinematography is conventional. But there were many plans using rear-screen projection, contributing to a dated look. The costumes are even worse with costumes imbued with "glamor" from the 1950s; they are just awful. Viewers must endure a fashion show, a plot that amplifies the way the director was hit by these happy trash rags. <br /> <br /> And then there is this orchestra. In what is arguably the worst film to open in the history of cinema, the first part of the film includes an orchestra playing a melancholy melody. At first, I thought I was watching the introduction of upcoming attractions. But no, it's part of the movie. And the orchestra plays again and again. It has nothing, absolutely nothing to do with history. What were they thinking? <br /> <br /> I enjoyed Marilyn Monroe, with her panting voice, as she made her way through the plot. But the film would have been much better if it had emptied the two other roles of the ensemble, abandoned this orchestra, improved the dialogue of the comedy and played down silly and ridiculous costumes.
