NBC should be ashamed. I will not let my children see that. I would certainly tell my church to stay away. This film is proof that NBC has always been a third class network. Producers, actors and screenwriters should kneel and ask God's forgiveness to make this fictional work. There were no pirates. Noah's wife did not march on the bridge of the ark. The ark had NO bridges. Lot was not even born when this event took place. Has anyone attached to this project tried to read the Bible? There were more than two animals of each type taken. Read the story in Genesis. How can we bring this on any screen, big or small!
