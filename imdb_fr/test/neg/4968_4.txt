How could this get a rating of 6.0? Are we, as horror fans, so used to the horror movies that are so terribly bad nowadays, that when we come, there are, and I repeat "only a few," who buy quality, we are too excited and give a note that is just a bit too high? The director has a certain visual flair. No doubt about it. But between a few decent shots, he forgot a good story, a mood or fears. There was a very slow first act, a lazy killing scene, boring and flat characters and a very stupid and very incredible twist. And what about the portrait of American teenagers in so many films of this type? Should they always be so stupid, irritating and so superficial. I do not remember being that way when I grew up here in Holland. All things considered, in can not give this film anything more than a score of 4 out of 10.
