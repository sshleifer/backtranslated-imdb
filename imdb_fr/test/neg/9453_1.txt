One of my friends loves horror movies, so I often see low-budget movies like this one. This is the first time I've had to write a review of any of them ... <br /> <br /> In other words, it's probably the worst movie that I've never seen! Worse than Boggy Creek II! <br /> <br /> The entire budget allocated to the film seems to have been spent on a brief scene in the middle when Dr. Klaus comes to the House and turns any vampire. <br /> The only good thing to say about it is that it was hilarious after a few beers (but for all the wrong reasons).
