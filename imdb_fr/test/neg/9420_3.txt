Solo begins as a team of American soldiers travel to South America to blow up a rebel airstrip. A robot named Solo (Mario Van Peebles) can use any weapon, is fifteen times more powerful and ten times faster than any human being. being. Something is not right & Solo refuses to kill innocent civilians whose colonel Frank Madden (William Sadler) is not happy, back to the base & General Haynes (Barry Corbin) orders the closure and reprogramming of Solo . One of Solo's main guidelines is self-preservation, so decides to flee into the South American jungle where Colonel Madden and his men are sent to take over ... <br /> <br /> This Mexican-American co-production was made by Norberto Barba & we must say that the solo is awful. David Corley's screenplay is based on Robert Mason's novel "Weapon". Robots were popular at the time Solo was made in Hollywood and at the box office. Solo thus scams the genre of Robocop (1987), Universal Soldier (1992) and the two films Terminator as well as the same scenario and the same story as Predator (1987). This is the usual hogwash of a robot without emotion that develops the sense of humanity while being surrounded by people. At first, he does not know what a joke is or why someone would want another, but in the end, he develops emotions and starts to become friends. people, it looks like Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991) for me. The characters are poor and Colonel Madden in particular is absolutely motivated to hate Solo and why he would kill other American soldiers and disobey orders to destroy him. You know I saw it for free last night on cable TV (thank god I did not spend any money on it) and I watched it in the TV guide and do you know what it was said? My TV guide described Solo as a "sci-fi action starring Mario Van Peebels" which, when I think about it, is a perfect description of Solo. In less than ten words, my TV guide hit the nail, I mean it's a sci-fi action movie, it certainly features Mario Van Peebles and it's really terrible. It is enough said. <br /> <br /> The director Barba does not do anything particularly special here and the action scenes are really lacking in enthusiasm and the elements of science fiction hardly exist, apart from the fact that Solo is a robot. So the military loses Solo and Colonel Madden is sent to retrieve it, right? I'm not funny, but would not the army have set up a self-destruct mechanism in Solo in case something like this happens? Solo would have at least had a tracking device inside so that the army knew at least where he was at a given time? I'm not funny, but these people can come up with a talking robotic soldier but are not smart enough to realize that a tracking or self-destruct device might be useful in case of a problem. The violence is sweet, there are some scenes of acceptable fighting but this is a pretty weak thing. <br /> <br /> Technically, the film looks good and is done with skill, it was shot in Mexico. Agent Red (2000), the director of Dolph Lundgren's action film, mounted Solo images in this film. The acting is mediocre, Van Peebles was the perfect choice to play a robot without emotion ... William Sadler deserves better than that, a few years ago still, he was in the fantastic film Die Hard 2: Die Harder (1990 ). Solo is a very bad sci-fi action movie, which is actually a huge scam of big-budget Hollywood action movies like Robocop, Universal Soldier & Terminator. I do not recommend it and I will start and pay more attention to my TV guide when it comes to choosing movies to watch ...
