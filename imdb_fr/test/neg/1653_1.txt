That says a lot about the UK when TV shows like this one are not only made but also broadcast in three series. Not funny, politically correct to the point of becoming disgusting and misinterpreted. Meera Syal was neither funny nor accomplished in anything she was, keep telling me I'm wrong, and Jasper Carrott, a man as funny as he is, has far exceeded his peak of eighties. It's such a bad comedy that it could have been done by ITV, but even pubs like The Upper Hand and James Bolam as a parking attendant look like Fawlty Towers over garbage. I would love to meet the writer / director of this show so he can highlight the humor in this program. Admittedly, the majority of the UK population are uneducated characters, but that would not tickle their funny bones. That's if they could part with Big Brother or their cell phones, but that's another story. Complete and total dirt!
