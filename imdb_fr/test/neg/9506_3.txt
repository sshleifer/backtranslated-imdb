I am partly a fan of Miyazaki's work. I say "in part" because most of his films belong to two categories: brilliant and boring. Unfortunately, this film falls into the last category. <br /> <br /> This film suffers from the same fundamental problems as Miyazaki's recent film, Howl's Moving Castle. An intriguing premise is put in place, then immediately reduced to a backdrop of unfathomable events that serve only to confuse the plot instead of explaining it. <br /> <br /> The first third of the film reveals the publication - the apocalyptic world in which the story is inserted and actually looks like a very interesting story that is about to unfold. From there, things go downhill. The central part of the film is mainly composed of thinly veiled eco-propaganda, and the end is heavily ruined by the use of this kind of impenetrable spiritualism that ruins a large number of Japanese animated films. <br /> <br /> Overall, the film gives the impression that someone tore each page of the script before transmitting it to the animators. What's left is something that is visually stunning (although, unfortunately, the version I saw was a copy of the Nth generation, with a mediocre color - giving rise to the common myth that Nausicaa shows her naked bottom in flight), but that makes little sense and finally left me confused.
