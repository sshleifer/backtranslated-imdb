Fulci begins by playing a version of himself, writing some ideas on how people might die. Followed by a fake cat who eats what is likely a brain. The copy I watched was dubbed in English, which I still hate, but I was particularly disappointed not to hear Fulci in his own voice. <br /> <br /> Fulci is in a kind of feverish state and is working on his latest horror film. His stomach turns when he sees things that look like the effects of his film, and he begins to hallucinate as he witnessed horror. He visits a psychiatrist who hypnotizes him and unfortunately he does not think about improving his mental health. I was thinking of the psychiatrist played by David Cronenberg in Clive Barker's Nightbreed (1990). The shrink in this one is played by David L. Thompson, who is very bad. Probably a true friend of Fulci, he has a big smile when he kills people, although it may be Fulci's dark humor at work that I thought was quite poor too. <br /> <br /> The film is made up of a lot of clips from Fulci's films, as if Fulci were on the set to direct them, watch TV recordings or witness the acts. I've never been a big fan of TV clips in TV shows, and I also think that Charles Band's Full Full Entertainment has cut their old movies and put together three of those cuts because the new anthologies are rather lame. I imagine they need to make money? <br /> <br /> The pseudonym Cat in the Brain refers to the theory that violence in movies breeds violence in real life. One of Fulci's colleagues talks about asking a documentary team to follow Fulci to find out about his life. Many self-referential things like this one. <br /> <br /> At the end, some characters leave on a boat called "Perversion".
