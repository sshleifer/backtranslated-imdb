I have only seen most shows since I left the TV on as background noise in my dorm. <br /> <br /> I'm a fan of Mencia, but this show does not do much for me. From time to time, he says or does something to dispel a little laugh, but he has that aura of self-sufficiency that ruins him completely. <br /> <br /> I always thought he was funny because of his raging man's raging routine. it's not very common in this TV series. Instead, it is just enough. I guess that just reflects how funny his comedy is: bland and uninteresting when he's not in the right mode of broadcast. I've seen him sometimes go on his show, but most of the time he's still sitting, smiling and smug, and that does not suit him. <br /> <br /> That's just my opinion.
