Carlos Mencia is just not funny! His show is painful to watch for this reason. His skits / parodies are all very horrible, and that really sounds like a charge for the Chapel show, which, although I'm not a big fan of it, is a lot funnier than this junk. Carlos Mencia gives stupid speeches and he too often depends on ending his monologue with a delayed voice and going "der der der". It's not funny. He often speaks to others with word games. They are horrible and painful. When people do not laugh, he blames them ... Why would anyone laugh, he's not funny. He has an immature sense of humor in everything he does on this show. It's amazing that everyone under 3 looks at it. One of my least favorite things he does is water each subject and make it look like a joke! I hope this racist idiot will be removed from the airwaves as soon as possible, as he knocks out a station that no longer needs to be knocked out.
