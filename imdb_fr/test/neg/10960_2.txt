I am neither director, nor writer, nor anything related to a film. But watching more than one movie a day gave me the idea of ​​what is a good movie or not. So here it is: the alive and the undead is a scam of life and death. I thought it might be a bit of a parody of a cool movie with a lot of debut. But oh no, I really had a big disappointment. <br /> <br /> To put it simply, the film is nil. I am a big fan of gore movies, but this one just gives you gore here and there, but they are not so consistent. <br /> <br /> But I have to honor them by creating macabre characters who gave me a little discomfort. <br /> <br /> If you are a big fan of zombies, look at this. If you are not, look for other Rob Zombie movies.
