Some may be in a film like this, but I certainly have not done it. University professor David Norwell suddenly gets a yen for adoption. It takes pretty much the first child offered, a bad choice named Adam. It turns out that Adam does not have both oars in the water, which causes almost immediately stress and indescribable troubles for Mr. Norwell. This story of sobs was done in turn, all around the disabilities and crises of Adam. Why Norwell wanted to complicate his life with an unknown factor, as an adopted child has never been explained. Along the way, the good doctor managed to attract a woman to share everything the kid was doing. Personally, I think both had a beer of less than six. Circumvent this yawn.
