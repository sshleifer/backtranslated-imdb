It's not "confusing" in the sense that, "Gee, this movie is really complex, and therefore hard to follow!" But confusing in the sense that, "Gee, this movie really has no idea what it's doing!" <br /> <br /> DREAM OF A WARRIOR is a collaboration between Hong Kong and South Korea, but it is completely absurd. A film about parallel universes mixed with journeys in time and a love story mixed with stupidity. <br /> <br /> The film presents the type of concept that bluffs the mind. Again, do not confuse the mind with it's so big and complex, but boggles in the sense that it's so ridiculous and you can not imagine anyone who ever had such an awful idea to start . <br /> <br /> Nothing in DREAM OF A WARRIOR makes sense because the whole movie should never have been shot. It's pretty awful. The only thing that saves is the actress who plays the warrior (not the main one). <br /> <br /> 3 of 10.
