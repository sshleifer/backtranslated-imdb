I was very willing to give Rendition the benefit of the doubt with regard to all the negative press that I had read about it. Even about three-quarters of the way, I always thought it was confusing and a bit incoherent, but otherwise a solid story ends. And then the bottom fell. Not necessarily wanting to spoil the film for anyone, but the conclusion overturns everything you thought was a fact about what was happening and when things were going on over his head - for no particular reason, except perhaps to say in the world, yeah I'm cool, and I know it. I like a good turn, I love a good time ah-ha, but only when it is relevant to the story at hand. The mistakes of the filmmakers are useless, the chronologies do not need to be parallel and they do not need to be separated by a week. The whole revelation was to destroy any merit that I was going to give to director Gavin Hood and screenwriter Kelley Sane, which may be a good thing, because in retrospect, it was not really a film as solid as I had initially blindly planned credit for. <br /> <br /> It's an admirable thing to try to integrate the term restitution into the public consciousness that happens in cinema, but it needed a story that deepened the connotations and the politics involved, rather than to shine on these questions for the story of a woman in distress over the disappearance of her husband and the rebellion full of anguish of a girl against her father "interrogator". I understand that the essential movie viewer needs a human quality to grasp and that is why I have nothing to reproach him for having chosen this path. My only disadvantage is that we do not get enough of what the title says we should get. Instead, many intrigues are shown to us, all put in the foreground before being returned to the lower regions of our consciousness, where they will never be returned. There is so much going on that you forget what you are supposed to take care of, your wife? the interrogator? the agent of the CIA? the victim? the senator? the Middle East girl and her zealous boyfriend? In the end, I really gave up and let the film take me to where he was, which ended up being a totally different person from what he had presented at the beginning. <br /> <br /> Everything happens as a result of an explosion bomb. This bomb is at the center of every thread of history and ends up being so innocuous that you can not believe how much the waves have spread. The old butterfly wing flapping quote is fully effective because a boy's revenge mission ends up destroying the lives of many people. Whether by death, destruction, physical and psychological violence or professional suicide; nobody escapes really unscathed. However, at the end of the day, only the story of the man who was excised in Egypt for torture is really interesting. We are led to believe that he is undoubtedly innocent from the beginning, but he is arrested, electrocuted, etc. to extract any information he may have. When those in power understand a man without compassion or reason to stop until something is spilled (whether true or not) and an observer without the courage to take it or stop it, the situation lends itself to a plot about how she could possibly end. The three actors involved are all the best elements of the film and prove once again that the film should have been sticking to them for the whole. <br /> <br /> I do not want to downplay people like Reese Witherspoon, (the victim's wife), or her former Senate employee, played by Peter Sarsgaard, because they do a really good job with what they receive. Even Meryl Streep, his eccentric accent, and Alan Arkin do not hurt too much. However, it is the trio of Jake Gyllenhaal's CIA agent, Yigal Naor's interrogator and Omar Metwally's victim who really shine. Naor is brilliant as an Egyptian who tries to stay sharp as a razor during working hours, but compassionate and worried as a father trying to find his daughter. This man is brutal, but that's because that's what his occupation calls for and why he's asked to find answers. Metwally never gives a false second to the pain and suffering inflicted upon it. Whether he lies or does not really know anything about the terrorist who called his mobile phone, we admit it completely and we are desperate to see how the situation evolves. As for Gyllenhaal, someone who seems to have a recycled performance throughout his career with more or less success, he finds a part that suits him. The demons entering his soul throughout the ordeal, he is forced to be part of the clothing on his body and mind, causing both an ambivalence and a need to intervene. The two feelings struggle against each other until he makes a final decision. His stoic and childish behavior is perfectly suited to this battle. <br /> <br /> It's a shame that the plot that works never comes to the fore. focal point, despite being the film's namesake. With all the clutter around the edges, we, the public, are too much tossed about, lost in an impression of time and sequence, and then slapped in the face while all this amuses us more laughing than to "bet did not see that come in. "I felt cheated and unfortunately, that's the lasting effect I shot from the movie. If it had been easier, I would have had better fun but, as things stand, we can still draw some positives from the badly imperfect set.
