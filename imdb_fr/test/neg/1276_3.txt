If you like fairytale adventures in "real life", see it. If you are a kid who loves children's movies, why not see him? :) If you are a parent who is going to see a movie with his children, it's better to go for the squirrel! <br /> <br /> The beginning of this film was a little funny and turned local for the events to take place. But after the kind of fun introduction of characters, sets and potential conflicts, the story was rather boring. When more or less the same things happen for the third and fourth time, the word "predictable" often comes to mind, just like parts of an altered vinyl record or commercials that you really hate. And the end of the plot ... * oh sigh * ... poor, poor, poor!
