I did not know that when I signed the "All Pay TV" package with Direct TV, I would face a movie like this. He came right after another movie we were watching ... and I was a teenager, so I do not really know where I was at the time ... but I missed that movie. <br /> <br /> Me too I can not believe we left him. It's a bit funny, because it takes you back to the time machine until the early 80's ... but I think even then it would have been a painful film. It was just ... well ... "too cute"! AND was "cute" in a way ... but not incredibly cute ... and stupid. <br /> <br /> When I see a movie like this ... I go to IMDb to see what others are saying. I'm amazed that this thing was nominated! Wow ... the movie industry has come a long way since the 80s! Oh well ... it showed some old actors ... actually, that's the other thing that surprised me ... the programming ... not a bunch of pseudonyms ... but real actors / actresses. Must have been in their drug days! Anyway ... strange, interesting, weird, and makes happy, they grew up!
