Despite many positive reviews, this is a very slow film with three essentially good actors improvising the most banal dialogue you have ever heard. It's another road movie that really does not go anywhere. The camera is often out of focus and it is uncomfortable to pan constantly in some of the long scenes. <br /> <br /> The three characters are attractive, but they are nice. The cast also establishes what must be an intergalactic record for using the word tired "dude". (Even Howard Stern abandoned this pesudo pronoun tired). <br /> <br /> The three main actors and a supporting actor are very promising. They are clearly at ease and bravely allow themselves to be described as superficial and even clumsy. The actors of the characters all seem to be brave amateurs who have generously volunteered to speak a few words. Indeed, they all perfectly match their roles. <br /> <br /> In total, a dull half-hour that looks more like an eternity. It's among my ten worst movies of all time.
