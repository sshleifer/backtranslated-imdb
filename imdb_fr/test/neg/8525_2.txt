I laughed almost laughing when, in the commentary, the director said that this film was original and had a strong plot. There is not one ... repeat ONE same line of tracing or an original special effect in this blah movie. <br /> <br /> The Crows .... Hitchcock did it superbly in front of CGI and even with CGI, this film is far from being a well done attack scene. The little boy crawling ... The Grudge did it and did it better. The psychosis was recently made at Cold Creek Manor, but it was made to death. No pun. Disconnected / rebellious teenager who no one is listening to ... about a dozen movies have used this one up to Beetlejuice. The muddy material in the basement ... can you tell Amnityville Horror? Doors open uninvited ... What Lies Beneath did with much more talent. Scary farm ... too many to mention. <br /> <br /> The background of metaphysics - which should have been our focus - is lost once you understand what is happening, which is quite early. <br /> <br /> One What they never try to explain in the film is how they explain to the police that their abuser was sucked in by the oozing of the basement, so that they do not really have a body. <br /> <br /> Overall ... DO NOT NEED
