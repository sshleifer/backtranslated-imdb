A family (a teenager, his mother and a father-in-law), sick of city life, decides to go live in the mountains to escape and make a new start. However, their idyll is broken by three brothers and their domineering father, who do not show themselves nice to newcomers. While the objects thrown by the window and the threats in the street are only the beginning, the young man decides to aggravate things by having a relationship with the sister of the terrible trio. The law refuses to do anything and the violence intensifies quickly, the boy decides to take things in hand. <br /> <br /> Going wildly between hilarity and nastiness, this is one of the strangest movies ever made. At first, you can have fun discussing the ridiculous and ridiculous dialogues given to the characters, especially the overworked villains. But then, you get completely useless scenes, like a mother raped while her son is forced to watch, or the thug's sister being beaten by his brothers and sisters for daring to sleep with our young hero. In fact, the women's point of view in the film, which seems to be that pathetic creatures who scream a lot and can not defend themselves, is pretty despicable. But of course, there is the scene of compulsory nudity, which this time involves a young woman who plunges into a basin without a bra under a very fine t-shirt. Who cares about the consistency of the plot when you have some young starlets willing to get rid of his daughters? <br /> <br /> The climax is centered on the teenager, who until now had not been able to sneeze without jumping, suddenly turning into a Rambo clone and expelling his attackers to the left, right and left. center to rescue his father-in-law who is being held hostage by the gang. It's completely implausible, but hey, everything else in this film too ... so at least you can not accuse him of not being consistent. So, rather than trying to find logic in a place where the word does not exist, check out the IMDb pages for Janet Laine Green, Dehl Berti, Stephen Hunter, Jonathan Crombie, etc. You notice a pattern that is taking shape here? Their careers have all ended up dead. Why? Sit down through this, and everything will become clear. Do not forget the children, if you want to move forward in this case, hire a decent agent and ALWAYS read the scripts they offer you. Please .. 3/10
