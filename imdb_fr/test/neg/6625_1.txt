This is what they proposed for the feature debut of star comedian Carrot Top. <br /> <br /> A stupid surfer (carrot guy) inherits an R & D business from an old kahuna (Jack Warden). Things are going well, but are getting worse every day when the company is threatened by a hostile takeover attempt by corrupt pirates. The most unlikely thing about this movie is that smart girl Courtney Thorne-Smith would find this fascinating red-haired son-in-law (but he just inherited millions of them). Classic moments include the cartoon Larry Miller drinking sweat in a plastic cup. <br /> <br /> Funny comedy? Try the funny humor of the UN toilets, and that's exactly what it's all about - in the toilet ... flush the toilet twice.
