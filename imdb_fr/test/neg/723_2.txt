At first, I thought that "nasaan ka man" could be one of those new progressive Filipino films. as someone noted earlier, the movie does not look badly done. it is clear that filmmakers used more expensive cameras to take pictures, better angles, better audio equipment, beautiful actors and more enjoyable places. <br /> <br /> However, the improvements are all purely superficial. If it were not all the expensive and expensive filters, "nasaan ka man" would feel like a second-rate local movie - a hyperactive drama, predictable twists, "yeah right!" moments, tears, cries and characters to which you wholly cared, everything is screwed up in your throat. <br /> <br /> Several things bothered me in this movie. first of all, since when is it acceptable to have sex with an adopted family? this argument without a blood relationship does not make a difference. Second, will not a woman really tell anyone in 40 years that she was raped just because her father told her to keep the secret? and, where the hell were the lights in this movie? I know that the director tried to make things super dramatic, but I just had to turn on the brightness function of my TV.
