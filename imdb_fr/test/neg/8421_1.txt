One of the worst gay movies I have ever seen. Since they are not characters in this story, it is difficult to comment on the film itself. Therefore, since Colton Ford (aka Glen) opened his life to everyone, I guess he deserves his criticism. And it's not difficult to do. Here you are. 50 something Glen is a big porn star who wants fame and fortune as a singer. (I guess 11 movies make him a "star") Being gay and I'm forty, I saw porn and I did not recognize him, any more than his lover. Personally, they are all alike with different hair styles. Guys, it's not Jeff Stryker, Jim Bently or Casey Donovon. It's good, though. The purpose of these films is about 6.5 minutes, so they have pretty much all the same requirements, if you know what I mean. <br /> <br /> Glen wants to become a serious singer after him. throws the porn industry but it can not get anyone to take it seriously. I wonder why? Was he so stupid to think he could whiten his clothes and make love to a movie? And according to the movie, it's not just porn movies he's doing, he lives in a house with other "stars" where people can hang in their bedroom, bathroom and elsewhere via webcams. It's $ 500 an hour for a private party. Stop the concerts in the optional "hotels". Do something called methamphetamine, I guess it's a drug And then you have the balls to get angry when a member of a club tries to touch you - because he's "legitimate" now. Oy! <br /> <br /> The only interesting character, without cardboard, is the award-winning gay screenwriter who would not have given his name. And since it's a documentary, porn is like porn. You can say he is the most amused by the silly-rabbit porn star. <br /> <br /> Glen has a hyper-nellie manager (Kyle) who wants to "sell" him as a porn participant in hopes of getting him gay. He tries to do Svengalli's routine. "Wear this" "Do not smile" "say this" in what amounts to controlling the problems. But our anti-hero will not be controlled or told what to do. I'm not saying that Kyle was right, but if a budding singer starts questioning the manager, he will not go far. A bit like: his lawyer is a fool for a client. /> <br /> All this would not have been worse without a little information: drum roll, please, he is mean, he fears. Her singing talent is Ashlee Simpson. hard to find for someone who - while trying to realize their dream - at age 50! - does not work like normal people. No job. Can you say lazy? And the whining, and the "Why do not they accept me." Singing and dancing. And after a few months tracking the surface of the music industry, he launches, "Why do not I have a recording contract now?" The actors are servers. Writers work in newspapers or magazines of low level - no matter. This guy is on top of that. It is true. He wants his success now simply because he has decided that he wants it. Groan. Whine Whine. His lover leaves him to return to the care but I tell you that I would not want this fool to provide me medical care. Both were useless. Airheads. The film is useless. Unless you really love Whine and Cheeesy, people stay away. Do not waste your money on the shit life of useless people, there are even more interesting things stuck to the bottom of your shoes.
