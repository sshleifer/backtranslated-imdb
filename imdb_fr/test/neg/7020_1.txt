This film was so horrible, so boring, so badly failed - it took a lot of work to turn what should have been a sure thing into such a travesty. I love Lucille Ball, but she is absolutely stinky in this movie. Too old, I could not sing, it looked like a truck that throws gravel even when it's NOT singing - and the biggest sin of all - IT WAS NOT FUN. EVEN A SMALL. The studio shot in the foot with this one, and to have spoiled what should have been a fabulous screen version of a fabulous musical on stage, other parts of the body also deserve to be hurt - or maybe they were missing already. That could explain it. But for Lucy to think she was right for a role that needed to SING - well, that's the saddest thing of all. It's a good thing to know your limits. Even a legend can not come out of a stink like this and still smell like a rose.
