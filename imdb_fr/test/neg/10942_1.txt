Shakalaka Boom Boom is a scam of the movie Amadeus. Personally, I consider Amadeus as one of my favorites, not only because it is about music, which is my favorite subject, but also because it tells us the true story of a musical genius of which we do not only remember for the voluminous works of the beautiful music that he produced. during his life, but for his self-destructive nature and his tragic death at the age of 35, having hardly celebrated during his life because of the politics practiced by some people, especially the Italian composer Sali√®re jealous de him. <br /> <br /> Personally, I was shocked to see Shakalaka .., because the director has invariably cut most scenes from the film Amadeus. I see the worst type of plagiarism in this film and I am skeptical about the kind of movies that Bollywood continues to shoot every day. The film is a disaster, the two musicians of the film do not give you the feeling of being realistic, the film is tasteless, meaningless and a total failure on all levels. Bobby Deol is the only one to have an impact. He knows at least how to act. Otherwise, the entire cast looks like a band of amateurs. <br /> <br /> The irony is that, while watching the film, the first screen of the film indicates that all the characters in this film are fictitious and that any resemblance to anyone is a pure lie, because all the similarities are very clear and very intentional. I wish I could sue Darshan & Co. Not only for violation of copyright, but also for mutilation of a beautiful work of art.
