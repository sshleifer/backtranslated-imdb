Some spoilers **** A Soap has wonderful moments to recommend it. When Charlotte and Veronica get closer to intimacy, a beautiful, discreet and truly erotic scene. I also liked the score and the soft and muffled cinematography. I do not know if the curious stop-start structure of the movie comes from the fact that it was originally digested in serialized form (the advertiser describing the action by sections is quite annoying). My biggest problem with this movie is its rather absurd description of a transsexual and her life. Of course, she has to be portrayed as a sex worker (what else), a sparse, impractical, ridiculously frivolous / girly brain, completely desperate when it comes to dressing and unable to create interpersonal attachments in the world. In addition, she has always shown a two-day beard growth (for a strange reason), as if to underline how confused her life was. And she is waiting for a sexual reassignment operation when she apparently did nothing else to move her transition forward. In truth, the character looks like a drag queen, not someone making the transition. <br /> <br /> These are typical fantasies of outsiders who are not really connected to a transsexual. The fetishization of GRS surgery by film is a way to objectify people in transition. Not impressed by this aspect of the film in the least. At the very least, why not make the character play by a person who is really transgender ... I thought the male actor representing Veronica was fine, but no better than that. The woman portraying Charlotte, much better, was a very complex character, full of energy, disgust of self, desire and contradictions. If she was so fascinated by a woman with feminine energy, a Charlotte could go to a woman's bar in two seconds and find her. Yes, she was attracted to Veronica, but more like an abstract idea of ​​someone with masculine / feminine characteristics (a soft touch but with a good punch), not like a single person. Yes, what A'Aap says about love is often beautiful and moving, but that does not mean that an already stereotypical minority needs to be stereotyped a little more in the process. <br /> <br /> This film also proves that the Danes are null. dancers. For such a promising venue (best performed in a film like "Different For Girls"), the final film is disappointing.
