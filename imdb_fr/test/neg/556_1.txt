Hillary Swank is an unappealing work in this unattractive film. Pat Morita, desperate to work, any type of work, agreed to resume her role as "karate teacher" and to present her brand of karate again on the big screen, except that this time Hillary "skank" Swank is the student. I can just see that Hollywood writers are upset at the idea of ​​having a woman "tormented and spoiled kid" take on the role of Ralph. The movie does not work at any level and it's boring at all levels. There is nothing interesting here and not even a lesson to remember. The film was made without any idea of ​​making money because it is so serious. <br /> <br /> I would be happy to spit on all the actors in this film for their involvement and to ensure that the writers are blacklisted by their authors. miserable and insulting efforts.
