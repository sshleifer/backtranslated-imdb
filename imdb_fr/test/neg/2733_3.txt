Terry Cunningham directs this original Sci-Fi network. Things are not going well in Washington State and Oregon; Volcanic eruptions and earthquakes threaten to throw most of the Pacific coast into the ocean. Trying to keep the world from plunging into the environment, a team of scientists led by Dr. Jake Rollins (Luke Perry) uses a huge drill vehicle called "The Mole" to make its way to the heart of the Earth to avoid fate. The technical dialogue does not really help and does not speed up this film. The acting is nil, but Perry has always been laid back. You can only blame him for participating. The other actors: Michael Dorn, Adam Frost and Michael Teigen
