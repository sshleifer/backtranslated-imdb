In a word, skip this movie, it's so bad. In short, this film is about a weapons factory where secret weapons are developed. Because they do bad things, they are not popular so to speak. A new woman CEO intervenes to clarify things and ensure that the reputation of the company will be improved. It does this by disclosing confidential company information to the press ... Do you believe that? In addition, she starts firing people she has never seen. Incredible uh? A pacifist group is trying to destroy the central system of society, because there is the detailed plan of these secret weapons. This central computer is located at the bottom of the building, hidden in a kind of vault. Of course, the movie would not be complete without the mad scientist and a robot that is the deadliest machine, which looks like an "Alien" Alien movie. The mad scientist loves female CEOs. <br /> <br /> The mad scientist asks the robot to kill everyone and thus protects his work, goes up the chain of command and makes the film interesting. Pacifists team up with the CEO and another board member to escape the robot. Further down the line, they agree to blow up this evil central computer, while avoiding the robot. They also discover that the factory was developing a man-man, a man-machine. They can erase a person's memory and replace it with that of a veteran soldier. One of the pacifists is turned into such a soldier and will hunt the killer robot. I guess the mad scientist also wrote the screenplay for this movie. This super soldier looks a lot like Robocop, but is not that funny. <br /> <br /> It boils down to this. People run, are pursued by a killer robot, are injured, but they do not seem bothered by this. In addition to limping a bit, and of course, the female CEO is the main character of this film and can not be killed. that is to say, he survives every attack, explosion, name it. I will not disturb you by hunting, let's move to the end. They have a lot of weapons, yes the pacifist too, and they know how to use them. When they are on the roof of the building, they empty all their weapons on the killer robot. They enter an elevator that serves to clean the exterior windows. And then, the CEO also knows something magical, on the roof, she complained about the lack of bullets and, as if by magic, the gun is reloaded. Thus, she can pull the cables and let the elevator collapse on about 70 floors, and let it stop just above the ground surface by pulling the brakes. And to top it off, the police are waiting for them there. The robot jumps on them and kills the cops. Hilarious no? The robot chases them down the vault where the mainframe is and when the robot is so close to it that it can touch / kill it, it stops. Because the mad scientist did not want her to be killed. A better name for this guy would be the silly scientist. Although it was he who made this film visible. Right now, I was already shooting for the killer robot to finish them all, so the movie would end. <br /> <br /> I can not believe this movie deserves that much, and that's why I wrote this comment. Avoid this movie like the plague. It's a monster, and I'm not talking about the death machine.
