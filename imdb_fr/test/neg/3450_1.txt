It was one of the worst films I have ever seen. The cinematography was dull, with long tiresome plans (like a camera on a tripod filming a play) interspersed with "dramatic" angles that made no sense for the content on the screen. The editing was terrible, scenes associated with the delicacy of a butcher. The plot was based on the idea that the viewer was aware of the historic night in which Mary Shelley had written Frankenstien. The acting game has been forced, with the type of character development that has left you with a keen interest in seeing them die horribly (the sooner the better).
