Asia Argento is a sexy and beautiful woman who likes to run naked, which is not a bad thing in itself, but when her character talks about all the guys she has been talking about, and seeing her with Michael Madsen and a guy Asiatic in the film's Au Present, it gave me the impression that I needed a condom on my eyes to watch this movie, as if an illness was going to fade from me or something. <br /> <br /> The film felt like it was before. go for a love triangle / drama / action / ??? plot, he just seemed to go everywhere and nowhere at the same time. The acting was awesome, the plot, not so great. The director must at least choose a genre and practice, practice, before trying to do something as complicated yet, because they are obviously not very good at doing it.
