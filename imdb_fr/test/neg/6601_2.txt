The word that comes to mind when we consider this film is "ladle". This is a poor quality film biography of one of the most iconic performers of all time. The glove deserved better. <br /> <br /> Before going into this biopic in detail, I must say that there are two things that I found effective. First of all, it was to use fan sequences and interviews at certain times of the film, especially in scenes depicting the first group of allegations of pedophilia. I think it contributed to a certain authenticity that was seriously missing in the rest of the film. Second, the sequence describing the courtship of Michael Jackson and Lisa Marie Presley. I will not comment on whether, in my opinion, marriage was a hoax, but in many ways it was a relationship where attention and affection existed between the two parties. . This really appeared in this movie; Flex Anderson and Krista Rae had enough chemistry to succeed. These successes are enough to prevent Man in the Mirror from becoming a star. <br /> <br /> That said ... there was very little else that worked here. Very few actors looked like the ones they were supposed to represent, especially those playing Elizabeth Taylor, Janet Jackson and Diana Ross. In addition, the absence of Jackson's music was a huge loss. How can you effectively tell a story about him without his music? I understand that they have not been able to obtain the corresponding rights, it is an unauthorized production at low budget; however, it seems that if you can not have this man's music in a movie about him, you might as well pack him up and go home, because you miss out on an extremely important part of his story. /> <br /> The characterization of Jackson in this film also embarrassed me a bit. I will not discuss the fact that he was confused and that he might have missed a few fries of a quality meal, but here he was introduced as a person close to the mentally handicapped. I do not think Jackson, known for being a shrewd businessman, would have been as naive about how the adult world works, as it was designed to be in this film. <br /> <br /> Finally, the The way this film was written is not shameful. Many lines or dialogue exchanges were either extremely tacky, like Michael and Janet's "Tinkerbell" exchange, or foolish, like Michael's "Blanket of Love" comments. In addition, writers do not have a taste for subtlety. There were many telegraphs of upcoming events (sort of lines "What could go wrong?") And an extremely obvious pounding of themes and motifs in the film (if I had heard the word "believe" one more time ...) This is what ultimately prevented the film from being considered something that could be considered terribly bad. <br /> <br /> Maybe in a few years, or even a decade or three, away from Jackson's death, someone will be able to tell his story to life in a more deserving film, at which time we may have a better perspective of his life and someone will be able to present a truly thoughtful review of who Michael Jackson is and what he represents for the entertainment world.This very risky biopic was not this movie.
