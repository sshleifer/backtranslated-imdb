*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** What's going on here? <br /> <br /> Barbara Hershey, looking resolutely skeptical - as if she had stolen her grandmother's spare wig - performs an unconvincing performance as a woman who kills the wife of a man with which she had an affair with "in self-defense" after having struck her forty times with an ax. <br /> <br /> Like Lizzy Borden, she is acquitted but after an unconvincing argument ever presented before a jury by the representative of an accused alleged "innocent" that I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> Lizzy Borden took an ax and gave her father forty beats when she saw what she had done - she pleaded self-defense <br /> <br /> I do not do not think <br /> <br /> I find the accused guilty of projecting an unconvincing portrait and I have no choice but to give this film a sentence of 4 out of 10 (which would have been lower without the good behavior of some participants) <br /> <br />
