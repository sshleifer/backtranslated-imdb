I did not like this movie. For me, it did not make much sense. It was hard to understand what was really happening. I did not think it was scary either. But I thought it was ridiculous, even Radha Mitchell is the main character of the movie, released in 2003. She was also, coincidentally, in "Silent Hill" of 2006, which I hated too. I found it confusing and useless. "It's not so bad, but I think it's definitely below average. There is nothing special about it. The script is too confusing and there are things in the movie that do not need to be there, in my opinion. I think Radha Mitchell is probably a good actress, if she has more work. My vote for "Visitors" is 4/10
