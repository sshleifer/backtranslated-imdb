It's about as stupid as possible. <br /> <br /> A classic case of two-dimensional characters that always act exactly the opposite of what a sensible person would do in the same situation. It reminds me of a scene from "Scary Movie" where Carmen Electra runs away from the killer. There are two signs, one marked "to safe", the other "to sure death" (I recite from memory). <br /> <br /> And, as in Scary Movie, the characters always run in the direction marked "Sure Death". <br /> <br /> Why oh why did the girl light the fire in the cashier's cabin AND KEEP THE DOOR CLOSED ??? Did she prefer to die in the fire instead of being killed by the guy? Why oh why, after cutting and controlling the driver, did they sit in the seat and watch him by the injured instead of shooting at him or at least spilling him? He had crushed their friend and killed him a minute before, but they had scruples ?? Why oh why a hundred more things ... <br /> <br /> If this movie was a road, you could not drive a single yard because of the holes. Everything is so far-fetched, it sometimes starts to hurt physically. <br /> <br /> Add ruthless "actors" and a small budget to this, and here's what you get. Looking at the note and the comments, I feel like these people are watching a completely different movie. <br /> <br /> The only thing that's really missing is the infamous red toolbox of "While She Was Out" - a film that is pretty much similar in unrealistic plot and stupid behavior characters.
