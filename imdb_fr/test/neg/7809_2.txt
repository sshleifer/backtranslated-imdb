The young dreamer Ashton Kutcher (under the name of Tom Stansfield) wants an appointment with sexy blonde Tara Reid (under the name of Lisa Taylor). Ms. Reid thinks Mr. Kutcher is gay. Kutcher works for Reid's father, Terence Stamp, an anal retender (Jack Taylor). Kutcher agrees to "clean up" the boss, believing it will bring him closer to Reid. Mr. Stamp has a pet owl named "O.J.", which becomes a coke head. <br /> <br /> This is a movie designed to prepare your "G-rated" pre-teen audience for a more attractive "R-rated" rate. This will help them if they have not seen the plot before, and especially if they like ridiculous humor. Remember, people are paid to do this. <br /> <br /> ** My boss's daughter (2003): David Zucker ~ Ashton Kutcher, Tara Reid and Terence Stamp
