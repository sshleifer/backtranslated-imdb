This film has an incredible distribution. MGM chose some of his best actors and starred in a film with the adorable Margaret O'Brien. Lionel Barrymore, Edward Arnold and Lewis Stone play the role of three hungry old singles living in the same house. Although they have amassed a fortune over the years, they have also been selfish fools. One of them has the idea to donate a property to buy a good name (a bit like Carnegie), but it turns out that the property they want to sell belongs to O ' Brien. And since she is an orphan, they volunteer to be his guardians so that they can surrender his property and look like great philanthropists. <br /> <br /> There is also an awkward sub-parcel involving fairies - led by the wonderful actor. Henry Davenport. And, as O'Brien is Irish (as evidenced by her outrageous accent), she and the little people make up the bulk of the plot. Frankly, I absolutely hated this part of the film and wanted them to drop it completely. Instead, the story would have ALWAYS been about sweet Margaret melting the heart of a bad old man - it would have worked. But ... the "little people"?!? Sheesh! All in all, the actors are trying very hard, but the stupidity of the plot and the deadly way they tried to make me back down. I noticed that a lot of people liked this movie - I guess I'm just an old grin! I found the horrible film hard to watch.
