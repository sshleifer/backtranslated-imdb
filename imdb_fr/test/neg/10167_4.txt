It's been a long time since my wife and I have seen such a boring thriller. This is definitely NOT a captivating story and the pace is so slow that we almost fell asleep. It could be a police series with a very small budget. There are ridiculous scenes like the one where the mafia boss Pirano wants to see the lady of the jury dressed in red, or another Mafioso who can not stop to think of her, etc. Ok, maybe it should have been a romantic thriller, but believe me, you do not miss anything. We gave 4/10.
