Like many first-time films, Cimarron must be considered more for its historical interest than for a compelling entertainment. The talented lead actor Richard Dix, named best actor, can apologize as a relic of the silent film school. However, even with the benefit of the doubt, Cimarron is a poorly formed drama - an inflated film that moves from an unrelated sequence to an unrelated sequence with little dramatic impact. Officially, the film lasts two hours and four minutes; it feels like watching four hours. There is no reason to waste your time on it unless you want to see all the winners of Best Picture or take a keen interest in the early days of sound. In my opinion, Cimarron is the worst choice of the best image in the history of the Academy and the award should have been awarded to City Lights or Little Ceasar. We hardly remember Cimarron today, and we would remember well if it was not for his Oscar win.
