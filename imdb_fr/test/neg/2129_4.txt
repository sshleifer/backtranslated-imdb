I really wanted to love this movie because I have an admiration for Italian scam movies (especially Jaws scams!), But the simple fact is that Monster Shark is not very good. All the signs of this being a big trash are there; We have one of the kings of the trash cult cinema, Lamberto Bava, in the director's chair - one of the best ridiculous cult actors, Michael Sopkiw, taking the leading role, and a central creature stupid enough to give the best a sort of film has to offer a run for its money, but the film still manages to be rather bland. The fact that the "monster-shark" is not often included in the list is probably a good thing given the creature's design, but there's never enough else to get the movie through without it. The plot focuses on a resort located off the south coast of Florida (or rather somewhere in Italy), where many residents found themselves in the water without arms or legs. The local authorities quickly decided that this creature had never been seen before, and it is up to a motley crew of various sea experts to catch it alive! <br /> <br /> The main problem of this movie is that it always seems very useless and, as there is hardly any character development or intrigue, even the least demanding viewers may start to bored soon. . This kind of film is not known to be brilliant, although the fun element of films such as "The Last Shark" and "Killer Fish" is unfortunately absent for most of the time. What I like about lead actor Michael Sopkiw is that he always seems to take himself seriously no matter what film he's shot in (though he's never shot four). This is certainly the case here, although Bava never allows him to dive completely and he often feels as much as a spare wheel as the rest of the film. Much of the time is spent watching the different characters, but it's not very fascinating; Although Bava manages to be effective at the end with a host of fun activities while the central monster ends up wreaking havoc on his alleged kidnappers. Overall, there is really not much to recommend for this movie. As mentioned, I really like this stuff and even I have been bored on many occasions. For fans of Italian horror only!
