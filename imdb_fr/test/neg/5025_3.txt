Rossini has already described the work of the rival composer Wagner as having "wonderful moments ... and terrible quarters". Inuyasha, it seems, can also be described this way. There are many good episodes, but between them there are innumerable filling episodes. The entire series includes about 175 episodes, including at least 125 fills or some kind of subplot (I have not bothered to count and I would not be surprised if that number is higher, though). . <br /> <br /> Some of these filling episodes are actually quite nice, although many are pretty stupid or boring. Nevertheless, the constant digressions begin to run out after the first seasons as the plot progresses laboriously during most of the series. Character development also slows down considerably and at the end of the seasons, the cast became virtually immutable, resulting in more and more out-of-date jokes (especially those about the monk, whose ironic traits begin with moderate humor but become boring when appearing several times). <br /> <br /> However, all this does not mean that Inuyasha is a bad series. This is just not a good series of the way Neon Genesis Evangelion is generally considered, for example. It's a good thing to watch at the end of a hard day, but it could never be confused with great art.
