What crack do you smoke? This film, while gloriously entertaining, is awful! <br /> <br /> The action scenes are so obviously wrong that it's a bit sad. The Colonel's daughter is painfully irritating. The ninja training camp is so hilarious that it's hardly worth mentioning. And when Joe puts the bucket over his head and hits the other soldier, I get pissed on. I could go on ... <br /> <br /> Fun, no doubt. Good no. Well done, certainly not. <br /> <br /> As a commentary on America as an empire, it is actually pretty good. Joe, as a typical white conqueror, is not surprising, especially in the context of 80s American cinema.
