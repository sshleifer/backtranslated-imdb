Andr√© Roussin was a specialist in what the French call "Boulevard Theater": pieces in which we find the eternal triangle: lovers man / woman / (man or woman). Several of her pieces have given Elvire Popesco some of her best roles on stage. ... and the great actress was the main reason to watch them, because Roussin is not Sacha Guitry, but the French public remembers "Au Theater Ce Soir". <br /> <br /> Always with me? Roussin's pieces were not made to be filmed, and this is a rather mediocre material, even if the writers call Lewis Carroll to their rescue.I love Stewart Granger and David Niven, and Ava Gardner is a treat for But perhaps this is their worst film, being brutal, predictable - even the intervention of the native (Bola-Bola) is ridiculous - a stunning farce around a Threesome on a deserted island where Granger would be a sort of Robinson, Niven, his Friday and Gardner, his daughter, Friday.
