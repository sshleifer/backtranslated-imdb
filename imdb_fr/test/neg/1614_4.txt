One of my friends, who is even more interested in the cult movies of the 70s than me, recommended me this one and even gave me the copy I watched. However, I was not as enthusiastic about the result as him ?? or, by the way, Michael Elliott ?? was. The film is a hybrid of HOUSE OF WAX (1953) and THE Texas CHAIN ​​SAW MASSACRE (1974): indeed, I dare say that it served as a basis for the 2005 redesign of the old, much more than the "original"! So, we have a remote and abandoned wax museum of incredibly realistic models (with the riddle why?) With its seemingly harmless curator (a Chuck Connors martyr) "overgrown" by the forced group of failed teens (including Tanya Roberts). He also has a crazy brother ?? The shades of PSYCHO (1960) incorporated for good measure, until the same rebound ?? which is supposed to be a mechanical engineering (presented in a "poltergeist" that inexplicably accompanies the first murder). The film has a score of Pino Donaggio but, being so derived and not very well done to start, it is actually a redundant genre effort (and quite confusing).
