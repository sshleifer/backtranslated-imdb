I absolutely could not believe the levels of inefficiency displayed in this production. Honestly, I thought that homosexual men tasted better than that. I know I know it. <br /> <br /> Most of the blame is not cast, but leave it first ... the only one who has a real talent was Joe Souza (plus had the best body in the cast). He had a beautiful and clear voice of theater. Ok, and Jaymes Hodges's voice was average, but he had an empty expression in all the numbers. The others could not keep a note in a bucket, even though the music was obviously doubled afterwards. It must have been really horrible to hear them live. They were all girls, except maybe three. If I wanted to see naked women on stage, I could go to the titty bar. I do not know why someone would choose to turn L.A. production instead of New York. I imagine NY has more singing talents readily available, although one might think in L.A., they would be able to find more LOOKING guys. Apparently not. <br /> <br /> But I'm moving away from the subject ... the real blame rests here on the creators and the producers. This score was the most mundane, tasteless tripe I have ever heard of. It seemed like theater queens were all taking their music cd, throwing it into a blender and pouring the sticky substance on a page. Unfortunately, there are many who can not tell the difference between good theatrical writing and anything. I mean seriously, I was laughing at everything but not lame jokes. I think the morbid song "Kris, look what you missed" was "the most hysterical thing in the whole series". Genius who writes ... Kris / Forgotten ... wow ... they almost rhyme ... it must be a good lyric. And Jesus ... the end of this song ... "Oh Kris, Ohhh Kris, OHHHH Kris ..." MORE AND MORE !!! My other favorite was "You must be a Pumpy Junkie Boy to be a Humpy Hunkie Boy" ... WTF ??? The whole series was full of the most arbitrary words JUST BY WHAT they rhymed. Where did these people learn to write songs? Apparently, they listened to Sondheim and said "He's not that good, I can do it" ... as evidenced by the delayed reference "Bobby, Bobby, Bobby" from COMPANY in a song. Another problem: why do twenty years sing Robert Mitchum and Tab Hunter? Coming obviously from the mouth of the lyricists and not actors ... again, bad writing. <br /> <br /> If you love torture and pain and you know many of you, strange fetishists, go ahead, look at it. But you have been warned.
