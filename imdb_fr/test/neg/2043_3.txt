Among the few alternative titles in English, "The Sexorcist" is undoubtedly the most appropriate, since it is only a cheeky scam of William Friedkin's classic horror film, in which they have replaced Stella Carnacina, only one year old, only to be able to show off her beautiful naked body for free. I'm not sure exactly what Satan is trying to accomplish here, but he seems to have the girl exclusively to play sex tricks for him! Poor Danila masturbates 24 hours a day and tries to seduce priests and even her own father to have sex with her. The girl is portrayed as an intelligent and ambitious theology student with a weird boyfriend (driving a stupid yellow car) and loving parents, albeit adulterated. When she renovates a particular house with her crucifix, the old relic comes alive and Satan himself (played by Ivan Rassimov of "Jungle Holocaust" and "The Planet of the Vampires") begins to torment her. The very long sessions of masturbation and some weird sequences of nightmares cover about three quarters of the film, then the director Mario Garriazzo begins with the exorcism. This last segment is even more embarrassing and amateurish! The priests do not really do anything but say vague prayers, but in one way or another Danila seems suddenly cured. There is not a lot of gore, the dialogues are horrible and the producers seem to make up for every little flaw by adding more sleaze! This is one of the strangest Italian exploitation efforts of the seventies (why on earth do they refer to "The Rocky Horror Picture Show"?), But it's certainly not one of the best . If you want clones of "The Exorcist", I recommend "Demon Witch Child", "Beyond the Door" and "The Antichrist".
