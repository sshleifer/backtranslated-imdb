The science fiction channel thinks it's a science fiction; too bad. Bugs, snakes, mythical creatures, they always persist. <br /> <br /> Someone from Universal had the courage to include BattleStar Galactica (the new, the good) and Firefly for a brief moment in their lineage up. I know they know that they make the difference between the total amount of waste and the extremely high quality of science fiction. <br /> <br /> A few years ago, they wondered how they would become powerful and powerful and achieve productions that were not just for us simple, lame Trekkies. Thank you very much, Sci-Fi! You know, you make movies so bad that even Trekkies do not look at them, so you've reached your goal! Fire snake, ice spiders, manticore, larvae, etc., and a huge crap relentlessly later, and they're even faster than the latest flu virus! How they do it is beyond my Ken. Why do they do it, I do not know. How can they ignore these reviews, comments, blogs and emails, I do not know either, but it is clear that they do not think much about their audience or care about our opinions! They seem to think that's what sci-fi fans want! One might think that one or two good, sensible productions would be insinuated when anyone who lights the green light goes on vacation. At least they use the Misfit toy collection; most of the science fiction movie actors of the week were once in sci-fi shows and now need the money. I love you and I hope you will get a better job!
