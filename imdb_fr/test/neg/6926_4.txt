I was looking forward to it, being a big fan of the book. However, when he came out, I remember thinking it was one of the biggest waste of money and time I spent at the movies. <br /> <br /> In principle, the acting, the sets and the music were excellent. And that's the main reason I gave a rating of 4. <br /> <br /> In this version, Sara is a bit too optimistic for my taste. She would not have deliberately lied to Miss Minchin just to prevent her from punishing the other girls; In the book, she wants to describe the lies as "not only mean, but vulgar". <br /> <br /> There is also too much of a Disneyfied end for me; Sara's father returning from the dead and all trotting along in the Indian sunset. Although the book has a happy ending (and the critics may say it's improbable), it does not leave you thinking, "Oh puh-leeze". <br /> <br /> The only things that are true in the book are: <br /> <br /> 1. Sara's father being a soldier 2. The dividing line between Sara and her father ("Tu teach me by heart? "/" No. I know you by heart, you are in my heart. ") 3. Sara's friendship with Becky, and her 'adopter' Lottie (although he did not been developed as much as it could have been) 4. Changing his room by adding various luxury items. This part has been brilliantly done. 5. The core - a rich girl who suddenly falls into poverty - is there, but that's about it. <br /> <br /> People might say that this adaptation is more for young audiences. Perhaps. All I can say is that I have two cousins ​​- aged 7 and 12 respectively - who have been big fans of this movie until they read the book. <br /> <br /> If all you want is a "well-being". family movie, so this book. If you're looking for a movie that actually tells the story of A Little Princess (actually, if you've read the book), do not waste time with it. It is shameful; With a cast like this, if they had stuck to at least the basic story, it could have been fantastic. <br /> <br /> Am I talking about "reading the book" and "reading the book" like a little too much? Very probably. But if someone tries to adapt a book - especially such a classic - to a movie, he should at least have done the same thing. Preferably more than once.
