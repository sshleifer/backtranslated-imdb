I will be generous here and give a 3 only because I live in Huntsville and it was great to see how much the city was filmed. That said, this movie was pretty bad. It's as if they started with almost no script and the director simply asked the actors to look at each other significantly with a lot of music. And Billy D. Williams seemed to prefer to be somewhere else than in this film. It's just a mess. I think I could write a script better than dislodge it for this movie, and I'm not a writer. <br /> <br /> There is one thing I've seen mentioned in the reviews and message boards - everyone is under the impression that the film starts around World War II and that in reality , it seemed more like it was supposed to start in the late '50s and early' 60s. Although the army is not separated at that time, I'm pretty sure the troops waiting to ride on a train would still be in a place like Huntsville, Al. If the beginning of the movie was supposed to be that of the 1940s, Billy D., Lesley Ann and Rae Dawn should have been in the 70s and 80s at place of half or early 60s. <br /> Don 'Do not waste your time unless you really like the actors, because the story is not very interesting.
