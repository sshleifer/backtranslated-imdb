I just finished watching Disappearances at AFI FEST 2006 with about 30 other people in an essentially vacant 1,000-seat auditorium. After noticing the lack of audience, the festival programmer began his opening remarks with: "At least some of the spectators of the festival have good taste in the cinema". Well, sir programmer, after watching this movie, I have to answer "No, we do not, and you too!" This "backwood" period piece follows the young Wild Bill (not so) as he and his mystical family dangerously steer Canadian illegal whiskey across the border during US prohibition. The former outlaws (Kris Kristofferson and his company) not only need money to save their dilapidated farm in Vermont, but they also want to teach little Wild Bill the virtues of manhood. <br /> <br /> Although very photographed, this adventure story is missing what makes this kind of film a "tension" and a credibility. Kristofferson's poor performance and epic monologue remind me of a dream I once had, where Al Gore played the role of Willy Wonka. I did not care a bit and when the mystical grandmother of Wild Bills appeared to give her advice, she did not fit. Yes, I almost fell asleep more than once. <br /> <br /> Gary Farmer does a good job as Cameron Frye's character in Ferris Bueller; Big Bill's brother-in-law while teen Chris McDermott uses those piercing blue eyes for his acting benefit. <br /> <br /> But all in all, expect to see Jay Cravens Disappearances play in a $ 2 Block Buster locker near you.
