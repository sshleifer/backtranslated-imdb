License fee to look at this trash, and pay for it with hard earned money? Without humor, not the least laugh, God knows how he won a BAFTA! <br /> <br /> We are now subject to "Eastenders" for twenty years. When, oh, when is the British public going to see this terrible soap for what it is? Crass Pap! This program does not describe the reality in East London more than the daily life in Beirut, and has never been. <br /> <br /> The Eastenders I know (the real ones) are kind, brave, hardworking and loyal. And one of their biggest attributes is humor. It was the Eastenders who went through the worst blitz in London and who always stuck two fingers at Hitler. And what do we see on our screens five days a week (including an omnibus)? Just a bunch of wailing, weeping, weeping wimps that seem to be doing nothing but sitting in a pub all day shooting at each other. What a great advertisement for Britain! Do writers really believe in the garbage they pump? Obviously, members of the public with crazy ideas do it, but then I heard that, apparently, anyone can be brainwashed and believe in anything.
