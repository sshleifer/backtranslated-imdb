I went to the movies to watch a preview of this movie without knowing anything about it. Recognizing the name Jennifer Lynch and seeing the certificate 18, I realized that it could be disturbing. In reality, I found the film a joke. I found myself laughing with disbelief through some of its parts. The acting is atrocious - Bill Pullman and his ridiculous shaking face. I almost pity the actors, because the scenario does not offer them any chance of a credible interaction with a character. After a shocking incident (there are many things to "try" and shock the viewer in this film), we see two characters share a beer and talk about the weather. Everything was overrated or thought it was smart when it was obvious! The performance of the little girl character named Stephanie was the best thing about the movie. Quiet and intense. I really could not recommend this movie to anyone. It's violent without a point, ridiculous characters, a bad acting, a bad script and an idiot.
