top of the carrot in a full movie, enough said. the only reason this does not give one is through my personal voting system of only a 1 and a 10, and this is not an extreme solution. horrible ugly god. There are movies that are so bad that they are unintentionally funny, then there are movies that make you physically sick, and there are those that lead to a serious contemplation of suicide. burn all the copies of the film, shoot all the non-creative players, torture anyone with creative ideas and, as for the star, there are so many things that can be said online, but he should implore the final ten seconds of existence with a head cut off when the work is done.
