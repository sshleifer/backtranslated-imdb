Ouch!! What a mess we have here. Not so much a mess as a painfully dull and half-seated excuse for exploitation. Presented by the one and only, J. G. "Pat" Patterson, yes, the same from Moonshine Mountain. Dr. Gore, formerly known as The Body Shop, is, I suppose, somewhat inspired by Frankenstein, and God knows what else. The death of Mr. Patterson is also included in this joke, as a broken-hearted scientist / plastic surgeon who just lost his wife in a car accident and has gone mad, to the point that it becomes clear that the Next step is to: Shoot countless women, then maybe steal some graves to retrieve parts of the body, in order to "gather" the ideal partner. It will not be easy, but thank goodness, his friend Gregg, the hunchback is available to lend a hand and offer moral support. <br /> <br /> If the proof was necessary that the goals of some people are not supposed to be accomplished, here it is, gang. Patterson's hay has obviously never had the slightest task of directing, still less, in the footsteps of the good old H. G. as master of the gore. I have never seen a gore film that simply refuses to give the viewer a single reason to keep watching. Even the gore is boring. Almost slightly humorous sometimes, but impossible to say if it's intentional or not. I choose "no" <br /> <br /> Filmed in Charolotte, North Carolina (country of the California ax massacre), on a three-digit budget, by a man as inexperienced as possible summer, who probably had an appreciation of road litter , so, maybe we should give JG a good break, I mean, he tried (I guess) what is more than one can say for most, and this movie is better than theaters come out these days big-budget superheroes, though, I realize that does not say much. In addition, Dr. Gore is a significant advance over Patterson's previous failure, The Electic Chair. It is a little possible that he improved his art over time, if he was not dead. the DVD, How to make a doll, so what, take a look. 4/10
