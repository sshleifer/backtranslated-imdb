No one expects Star Trek movies to be high-quality works of art, but fans expect a film as successful as some of the best episodes. Unfortunately, this movie had a confusing and implausible plot that left me in a rage - it's by far the worst of the nine (so far) movies. Even the chance to see the well-known characters interact in another movie can not save this movie - including the wacky scenes of Kirk, Spock and McCoy in Yosemite. <br /> <br /> I would say that this movie is not worth renting, and hardly watched, but for the real fan who needs to see all the movies, renting this movie is pretty much the only one way you'll see it - even cable channels avoid this movie.
