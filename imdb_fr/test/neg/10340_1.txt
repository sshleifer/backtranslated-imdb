I am currently 22 years old and I remember seeing this movie in movie theaters when it was released. You heard me well, I was 5 years old and yet I can still remember what I saw that afternoon so many years ago. Was it a mystical journey through the fantastic world of Mark Twain's creativity? ... No, on the other hand, it was a pretty scary movie about Mark Twain's dark, depressed, and actually suicidal side. A scene that always bothers me is a particularly strange scene in which Mark Twain plays the organ at his own funeral. <br /> <br /> Would an adult enjoy this movie? Well, it is quite possible that this film presents interesting points of view that a person with a working knowledge of Mark Twain's writing could appreciate; but believe me, "Adventures" is NOT the movie you want to use to introduce your young kids to Mark Twain.
