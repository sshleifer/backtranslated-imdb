Roger Corman took advantage of his infamous cinematography during his illustrious low-budget career, covering more than 300 films. While few (if any) would call it big, the obscure links of his films with underground culture (via reference, homage or influence) ensured him a distorted legacy. Throughout his career, he has also taken the bad habit of redoing his own movies ("Piranha", "The deep humanoids", "The black Scorpion", etc.), without improving them in the least. "Raptor", "written" and "directed" by "Jay Andrews" (Jim Wynorski, the man behind one of my favorite movie pleasures, "Chopping Mall") propels this practice to an alarming new level about the mid-90s of Corman. Trilogy "Carnosaurus". <br /> <br /> The credits of Wynorski are in quotation marks because "Raptor" is not a tribute to "Carnosaurus" movies, nor even a remake. "Raptor" IS the "Carnosaur" movies, or at least the dinosaur-induced death scenes, randomly married with trace elements from the original plot and newly-shot scenes (many of which consist of "dino views" "in a lame attempt to make the inserted scenes less obvious). The "new" material was written around the footage, not the other way around, and is totally innocuous, with huge gaps in terms of logic (for example, two separate teams are sent by the military, so the sequences 2 and 3, where the soldiers had different uniforms could be included), which is surprising given the lack of logic that we already have in the films "Carnosaur". The lack of feeling among the actors in their characters (although in all fairness, each dimension of character is presented in the script only once, perhaps twice) recalls the terribly woody game of the fiction films of 1950, and that certainly does not matter. between scenes of torn attacks that are worth watching. What is even more embarrassing for actors in new scenes is when there is an obvious difference in the physical construction between the new actor and the actor in the original scene. When the only scene evoking a reaction in a movie is the oldest thing in the horror book, "the spring animal," something is really wrong. <br /> <br /> At the moment, this is an awful practice in two category b characters (who do not have to worry about ruining their reputation because they do not have one ) ripping off their own gear, for the cheapest and fastest ride, simply because they can (why would not they feel ripped off a series supposed to be a scam of the series "Jurassic Park "?). I can not say much else that this film contains my highest recommendations against visualization; the only good thing about it (in addition to watching Melissa Braselle's belly button) is that now I do not have to see any of the "Carnosaur" movies anymore.
