Good now, this movie is a job. It is full of stupid references and dialogues from Jesus that would make most humans wonder whether or not they should watch movies. Big names like Roddy Piper and David Carradine attract you but, believe me, this film is bad. The story is incomprehensible and lacks intelligence. The sets, vehicles and costumes come as a cross between five points and a bondage movie. I'm sure there is porn with better dialoge.
