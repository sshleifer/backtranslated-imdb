Why, oh why, this trash is considered a classic? I saw higher body counts on the episodes of The Simpsons. Virtually nothing happens in this film and most of its time is adorned with an almost unbearable melodrama, straight out of a soap opera for moderate rent. <br /> <br /> The Trenton family is going through a difficult time and when her father is away, mom and little boy is going to get the car repaired. But when they arrive at the ranch, they discover that the watchdog has gone crazy. The rest of the film only concerns people sitting in the car while the slobbering St. Bernard bypasses them again and again. <br /> <br /> Regarding the child, I have never seen a child so annoying in a movie my life. And obviously, he is completely Aryan since children with blond hair and blue eyes, such as the one that appears prominently on Kinder chocolate packages, are apparently more sympathetic than people with brown eyes and black hair , like me. He's just crying and complaining. Same thing for mom. She gets out of the car, gets into the car, gets out of the car, gets into the car. <br /> <br /> I know it was done in 1983, but I got sick to death from horror movies where the characters make stupid and illogical decisions. If Mom used a little common sense, she would be able to get away from the disgusting dog. <br /> <br /> It's very badly written and the tension is zero. If you want to see a good "Bad Dog" movie, check out John Lafia's Man's Best Friend. It's funny, inventive, he has a better dog, a higher body and a more engaging story. Let this garbage be.
