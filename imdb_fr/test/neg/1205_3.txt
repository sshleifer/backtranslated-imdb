I liked this move when I was a child, but now that I'm older, I can see how absurd the plot is. In case you have not read the previous reviews, this is a teenager and an Air Force colonel who steals two fully loaded F-16s to save the teenager's father. <br /> <br /> It has some beautiful aerial waterfalls, although the dialogue that accompanies it is basically teakno babel. <br /> <br /> A bit of unwanted humor in the mounted version for television. When the father of the hero is detained by Iran, well, I mean an unknown country, and his captors ask him for a confession (explaining why he is detained, do not worry about exactly why, or what they want him to confuse.) He says, "Tell him he can take my confession and put it in his throat." However, his lips and, more importantly, his gesture clearly show what movement and what part of the anatomy he really thought.
