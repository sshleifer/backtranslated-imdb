The atmosphere in this show is great. There are many excellent accumulations, but this is where this show fails. There is a way to accumulate a lot for nothing. You will constantly see a scary installation that gives the impression that something really weird is coming out of the corner and that ... nothing. Again and again nothing. You hear a lot of stories from people talking about weird events but you do not see any. They come to the doors of these peoples, talk about their deep and emotional past, install a lame equipment and find nothing! there is nothing in this show that leads me to believe in anything paranormal. I laugh whenever they need to exert a "horrible spirit" that we have never seen as an audience. They get rid of the spirit that never existed and everything is put in a nice little package. A show that looked so weird and had so much potential leads to one thing ... Nothing!
