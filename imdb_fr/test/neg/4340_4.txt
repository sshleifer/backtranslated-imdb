The only thing in "Sudden Death" that surpasses the amount of non-stop action is the incredible number of holes in the plot. With all this, and the impressive number of instruments, we could hardly call what remains a scenario. To say that the scenario borrowed from the premise "Die Hard" would be equivalent to making the most blatant underestimation in the world! <br /> <br /> Here we have a troubled hero who works in the huge Pittsburgh Ice Rink Indoor Rink. The night of the seventh game of the final series, he gets tickets to be able to offer his separated children the decisive match and, of course, spend some time with them. Vice President of the United States (Raymond J. Barry) also attends the match, but for political reasons. When a group of incredibly well-organized mercenaries seize the Vice President's box and claim hundreds of millions of dollars in public funds, our hero, Darren McCord, has his plans more than lightly revealed. <br /> <br /> Every time, a new these formulas are made, it seems that all we hear about innovation is the most mean, and the means more and more spectacular and horrible to eliminate them by the good ones. The director Hyams and his scriptwriter have exaggerated (it's not an original sin) trying to make us hate evil terrorists. The horrible villains will knock out the secret services, security and civilians (young and old) with an indifferent look at the relative threat of each victim. <br /> <br /> Van Damme engages in an abundance of punches and shots, exploits and deadly stunts. The script asks little to the muscular European. Almost everyone has a say except Powers Boothe, who seriously exaggerates his underwriting and superficial role as the cruelest and meanest ringmaster ever. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of intelligent and quite explosive f / x film to keep someone awake. But really, it's all this action movie has, action. Although there are some clever sequences, nothing could be described as awesome. <br /> <br /> Saturday, February 10, 1996 - Greater Union Melbourne
