It's absolutely the worst comedy I've ever seen. It is difficult to explain, however, because (unless you have seen this), I bet you have never seen a comedy that was neither good nor bad; it's just there (it's the original part - neither good nor bad, just there)! <br /> <br /> Let me say that I have seen all actors play a leading role and love them all. That's what makes it such a mystery. The support wires actually act (though the dialogue is bad). The only pretty good character is the one played by John Goodman. He does a very good job with the little dialogue he has and actually has a fun line (I will not ruin the only fun line of the movie, in case you decide to look anyway. 'a pancake.) The big mysteries are the main leads. I will not call them characters because no character has been developed. This script is so juvenile that they do not even bother to give fictional names to the main characters. They all use their own means. They do not even seem to be trying to act. It's as if they all read aloud from scripts that the local college had sent them. In fact, I wrote an article like this for my English class, when I was thirteen - it was not funny either. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, do not bother to rent it. It's not funny He does not even have the kind of bad dialogue you can moan. I sat down and looked through it all. It was so boring that I could not even get upset. I can not imagine how this is even got a score of 4 here.
