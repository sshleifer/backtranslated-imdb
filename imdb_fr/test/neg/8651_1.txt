This film is worthless. I mean, if you want to watch this stuff, go to Hollywood movies! It's totally a shame for the Bollywood name. Neal N Nikki seriously sucked! Never look at this movie. As for the actors, it seems that the genes involved have jumped a generation. Tanisha could not have worn less and Uday Chopra was obviously chosen because he was the spoiled son of the director. (All that, Halla Re was incredibly stupid) The songs are eh, and I hope the director did not spend a lot of money on ...... In the end, I hated the movie. Do not let your kids watch it, and if you have it at home, it's a stupid movie, so throw it away! Buy the CD, if you must. (As I said, the songs are eh.) At least, it's better than the movie.
