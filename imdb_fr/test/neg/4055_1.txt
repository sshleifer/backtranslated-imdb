Whenever I see a video like this, I have to wonder how it was funded. HBO or Showtime or anything that has to pay for the production company to take action - hire someone who speaks English or not to speak up and arrange something that is close to a conspiracy, pay for it strippers with scary jobs to bounce and torsos of coarsely waxed dudes, find people to design and illuminate sets, to buy the rights on the techno cheesy music, etc. But I must imagine that it must be a vanity project for anyone who serves as executive producer ... He must have nailed all these girls, right? And my brother is not wrong about the "Spanish looking girl", but calling "narcotics" cops is terribly generous. In fact, I would go so far as to call them something much closer to "hideous" or "fugly". Watching these women writhing - sometimes very clearly on painkillers - was so far from eroticism that my testicles went up inside my body. Gross. <br /> <br /> Why waste time with that while there is so much hardcore porn available for free on the internet? I wonder if the popularization of video on the Internet will slowly kill the softcore video industry ... One can only hope, is not it?
