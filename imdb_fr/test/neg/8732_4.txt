Rock Hudson's second adventure in the science fiction genre after Seconds is Embryo, a film that combines elements of the Bride of Frankenstein and Pygmalion in a rather strange film about the lack of words to describe a test-tube baby becoming Barbara. Carrera. Hudson is a scientist experimenting with organic development and having the chance to make his first experiences on his own Doberman pincher when he is accidentally hit by his car. <br /> <br /> Some of the pituitary secretions of the dog are administered to a puppy born prematurely and it develops remarkably in adults. Exalted by his success, Hudson takes the fetus of a victim of a fatal accident and gives him a little of the same substance. <br /> <br /> What he gets is Barbara Carrera. And it develops physically and intellectually at a prodigious pace. What she does not do is develop emotionally. Still Hudson calls her new research assistant to her family and friends, such as her sister-in-law Diane Ladd, her son John Elerick and stepdaughter Anne Schedeen. <br /> <br /> Embryos do not explore some of the real problems of this type of science, but exploit them. The special effects as they are, are rather second-rate. Hudson seems to have lost interest in the project around halfway through the film. <br /> <br /> Now, what would have been really interesting was that he had a little boy and become a hero of the Harlequin novel. That's what Rock Hudson could have cracked.
