Warning May Contain Spoilers <br /> <br /> Unfortunately I have just spent $ 5 on this movie on Amazon and I wish I had never spent it. I never saw sucking horrible special effects nor playing. I mean Jack-0 is just a laughable monster and his costume looks like something you could buy at a Halloween store or create yourself. The acting game is just awful, especially Sean Kelly, I mean, come on, he's so pathetic with his little aftershocks "Come get me PUmpkinman". I mean, the movie is so horrible that they had to put in a few minutes of nudity, just so people would not move it away. I think the most laughable scene is when the woman sticks a butter knife in the toaster and gets electrocuted. I mean, come on, it looks so fake and the model, I could buy it at any Halloween store or make it myself. Well, I recommend not to watch this cheesy movie because it will be time you never come back.
