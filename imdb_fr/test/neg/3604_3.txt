I really liked the movie 'The Emporer New Groove', but to look at it was like going home and seeing his wife having "relations" with a lama. Seriously, this movie was bad. It's like the Dread Club After Super Troopers. I'm supposed to write 10 lines, but I do not even know what to say. I laughed a few times, but only because I was drinking. A movie like this should be funny at least when you're drunk. It was not. Maybe llamas are just funny and cartoon people are not. Anyway, just use New Groove from The Emporer if you want a fun, cartoon-themed movie about the lama. Line 10 is this line here.
