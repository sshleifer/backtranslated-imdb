It's not a movie. It is a set of random shots taken in a fascinating part of the world, coupled with a random text. The footage is not very good and the text is not very good either. The final product is extremely dull. <br /> <br /> On the DVD, activating the commentary can offer entertainment value, as the director puts forward a rather deranged argument that this is a sci-fi movie. It is also fascinating to read about the extraordinary risks and difficulties the team has faced in collecting these images. Too bad it's garbage. But I think "The Making of Fata Morgana" would be a fascinating film, much like "Ed Wood".
