Seriously disappointing performance by Brad Pitt and QT, the plot is very superficial and lame, and, unless indirectly intended, this film glorifies the Nazis and portrays them as men of honor, and shows that the Jewish people are cheating, can not stand his promises and vicious. Hitler and the most notorious Nazis attend a stupid movie about the plot about the murder of 300 Italian soldiers in a small cinema in Paris, it's incredibly ridiculous. the Nazis laughing and yelling every murder in the movie as if they were watching a STUPID basketball game, the case at the end is lame. What is really appalling is that the film got great reviews and is ranked here in the 40's among the top 250 films. will not be surprised if he has won many awards, including Oscars. the film is simply a kiss for the Jewish people, but hey, think about it, it's not even a great job to do it. it really defeated the Nazi-Jewish conflict as a whole and was a real insult to all those who fought and suffered the tyranny of the Nazis.
