One of the commentators is wrong. This is not Pat Patterson's only film and he did not die two years after it was made. He shot a movie called "Electric Chair" in Pineville, North Carolina. He pulled that a few years after Dr. Gore. Patterson died in the late 70's. I know because he used my house and he left a cat !! It was bad too. It was a big problem when the movie came out. No independent horror movies have been made in North Carolina. This film did not help things. Patterson used to make gores for H. G. Lewis. He was also good at magic. His gore scenes in Body Shop were actually well done. The film was shot in a building also housing a 7/11. You can actually see the vertices of the walls in certain scenes. The budget was less than $ 20,000 and the scenario looked like a child. Only Patterson could understand it. Yet ... it's entertainment and it's a classic.
