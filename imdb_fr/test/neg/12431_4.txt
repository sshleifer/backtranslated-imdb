Choose a stereotype, any stereotype (be it racial, sexual, cultural, etc.), and I bet you'll find it in Wassup Rockers. Do you think all Hispanic teenagers are stupid, hairy, inarticulate and dirty troublemakers? Are Hispanic girls crazy about sex, easy, sluts? Do all blacks want to start fighting and carry guns? Do all homosexuals organize themed parties with pink drinks and ask the boys to serve as role models? Are all white teenagers rich, rebellious princesses bored of white teenagers and looking for something a little more dangerous? If you answered "yes" to any of the previous questions, you are, my friend, a bigot and you will LOVE Wassup Rockers. <br /> <br /> Director Larry Clark likes to shock his old listeners the first time I saw Kids and I think that's why I'm still a virgin), but Wassup Rockers is not shocking ?? it's just bad. He tries to stay nervous and realistic with his minimal dialogue and his hairy close-ups, but these characters and story are completely unrealistic. <br /> <br /> In summary, Wassup Rockers is a teenager fantasy. What 14-year-old boy does not want to be a skater who has problems, holiday symposium, drinks forty years, and that the rich and hot white girl says to her uncircumcised penis "is dangerous?" Outside of this population, I really do not know who will like this film.
