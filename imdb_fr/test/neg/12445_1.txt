This film was terrible not only was the plot weak, but the acting was incredibly bad and sometimes pathetic. The unrealistic dialogues, the people in real life do not speak as well and there is no emotion or feeling in anything very monotonous, except for the almost indistinguishable murmur that occurs constantly. Even the editing is bad, the cuts are terrible. The work of the camera was sloppy and fragile on close-ups, even swaying during conversations. There is nothing positive about this film and George Katts has to work on heavy machines or anything that does not require talking to other humans, because he obviously does not know how to do it. How was this movie nominated for the awards oh my god !!
