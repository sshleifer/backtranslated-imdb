Making a film based on a true story, especially a story as incredible and horrifying as the plane crash of the Andes in 1972, is difficult even for the best filmmakers. But the Mexicans behind this forgettable and inexpensive exploitation movie do not even try! The names of the survivors and the victims of the plane crash of the Uruguayan army have all been modified, the crash itself is obviously staged very stealthily and the cannibalism aspect was unnecessarily and generously played. Surprisingly, he made a lot of money on both sides of the border. Fortunately, thought, he was fortunately forgotten. But the same people behind that would give us the GUYANA just as outrageous: CULTE DES DOMMÃ‰S! <br /> <br /> This horrendous and inexpensive exploitation film required the creation of VIVANT about fifteen years later. This film was a masterpiece. SURVIVE !, to put it mildly, is not.
