Nothing to ruin here, but it could be a SPOILER, so beware. <br /> <br /> The special effects were at the video game level - about five years ago, or maybe the original Star Trek. The acting was just pathetic - a nerdy-looking blonde roaming the desert as a voice in the background rang out. And on. And on. It's half of the trek and the drone that I managed to cross. Progress is interrupted by some fighting. Ships blow up for no apparent episodic reason. Again, it's not that there's a real fight you'd expect from a movie, but rather a cheap video game. Boi-ing! Boi-ing! The ship explodes. Next ship. Apparently, some ships are looking for the blonde. Here, in the distant future, the ships must be myopic and astigmatic, as many of them pass directly over the futuristic baby elegantly dressed in black but never see it. <br /> <br /> Then there are some choreographed fights that look like something staged by high school students. Once again, the gross mentality of the video game is predominant. The fighters go into "combat mode" by putting something on their wrists. A loud and computerized voice resonates and flashes in "combat mode". It must be a dandy design if you are trying to sneak someone. Then you go to a large power station that looks like an electric tower of the day and you plug to recharge. LOL, I'm not kidding, you can not invent this stuff, it's like watching a terrifying video game of about 2000 people, only the acting is better in the game. <br /> <br /> > More trekking. Then she shows up at "The City". (Blade sound trek gets even tougher here.) She is fighting with an evil robot of the future who can not hit her with her big gun, even if she runs in front of him, about five feet in front of him. Obviously, robots of the distant future are about as useful as bread ovens in a fight. She throws sand in her eyes and beats him to death by throwing stones at her. At that time, I was about 95% of the tolerance, my nausea circuits blinking red. <br /> <br /> In the next scene, she ends up being tied to a rocket with a rope. I'm not kidding, tied to the outside of a rocket. This is supposed to be an advanced means of transportation. At this point I bailed out. <br /> <br /> This film is a total shame for a film made at the moment. Just a terrifying shame. There was a story that was raining but the movie was distracted - someone kept talking about "mother" constantly. <br /> <br /> I gave him a two because there were some scenes that showed pretty illustrations representing a sci-fi background. Unfortunately, intrigue, acting, action, cinematography and narrative have diverted attention from this work and have degraded it. No kidding.
