TDY is probably the worst waste of all time to go directly to video selection. They take a scene from The Order starring Jean Claude Van Damme and it makes me angry because Van Damme is personally a favorite of the movie comedy B. Segal did a good job in the past, but he's very low in my books and he will probably never underestimate another sous-chef or be sentenced to death if he does not sit down and does not have a very good brainstorming session. <br /> <br /> It also annoys me not to have realized many of his stunts as in previous films. In conclusion of all this, if you are ready to see a movie worthy of a garbage can or a lumberjack, praise it today, you will die.
