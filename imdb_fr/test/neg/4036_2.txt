I had the terrible misfortune of having to see this "movie-b" in its entirety. <br /> <br /> All I have to say is --- save your time and money !!! This must be the worst B movie of all time, it should not even be called a B movie, but rather a F movie! Because it fails in all aspects that make a good movie: the story is not interesting at all, all the actors are skinny and not believable, it has a wrong direction and the action sequences are so wrong that is almost funny. ..... almost. <br /> <br /> The film is packed with crazy characters that a respectable person could not find amusing in the least. <br /> <br /> This film is supposed to be geared towards men, but all the women who are there are so unattractive, especially this wrinkled old thing that comes near the end. They try to look sexy in these strange and horrible costumes and they fail miserably !!! <br /> <br /> Even some of the most ridiculous movies in the series will still make you laugh, but it's too painful to watch !!
