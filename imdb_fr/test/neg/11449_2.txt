The subject was good, the direction was OK. Mohanlal was effective in his role as major. The game of supporting actors was at best amateur. The casting director and the director must be held responsible for this debacle. Hawaldar Jai was terrible, he stood out like a sore thumb with his poor histrionics. He did not look like the room and did not move like a soldier. There was a scene where a satellite signal of the skirmish was needed with the militants and they showed it from the camera angle. The satellite is located hundreds of kilometers in the sky, so the only angle is above. It was a rather embarrassing moment. The public these days is ripe and they recognize that they are trying to give them wool on their eyes. The director is a major, so the story could come out of his personal experiences. This is not a problem, but the film is as good as its actors and its director. So, if Major Ravi engages in other projects, he should pay more attention to casting.
