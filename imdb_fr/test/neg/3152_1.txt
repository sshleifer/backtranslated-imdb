The fact that someone could conceive this nonsense and make it happen is incredible. The fact that it is broadcast on television and advertisers have paid to associate it with that is staggering. This heartbreaking excuse for children's programming is almost too vile to comment on. I burned - yes burned - all the Barney tapes that people gave to my son. Finding this horrible programming in my library was a bad surprise. And where, tell me, where do they have these kids actors? Do their parents make no sense? These kids are going to take drugs before being teenagers. Geez. The last insult is that I have to add this extra line to the review to get it on IMDb.
