There is no better way to describe the HORRENDOUS experience watching Mamma Mia: Hitler must look up, tell the pseudo-director Phyllida Lloyd 'Monster, what did you do?' <br /> <br /> All about the movie is wrong. Just?? False! Even his success, which is inexplicable. I can understand when these parody movies, like Epic Movie, earn a minimal share of money and generate profits simply because they are cheap (of course, they are!). But when something like Mamma Mia earns $ 450 million in the world, you think "what's wrong with the world?" <br /> <br /> And think we have Meryl Streep, one of the greatest live actresses in the world, in it? What was she thinking? "I need money," she could say. Well, sell one of your grandchildren, even if it would be less embarrassing. It's not that Meryl is good in a disastrous movie, uh, 'movie'. She is also disastrous! When she sings, even if she has the voice, it's ridiculous. Worse than his only Pierce Brosnan. He was James Bond. Now, he sings Abba in a purple spandex during the credits of the worst film of all time. Really? And when I talk about Abba, I have nothing against the band and its music. Although it does not help when the actors have started singing (bad), dancing (worse) and the extras join then (they come out of nowhere! Frequently!) To present a terrible musical sequence after another. You want to cry when the music starts. And I love musicals! But this is the first of the kind where you PRAY for silence. <br /> <br /> I could go on. The list extends infinitely. You can write a Stephen King novel with the complete list of errors of this movie. <br /> <br /> In summary, go watch it! Really! We must testify to understand !! And since it's already a huge success, who cares if it brings you a few extra dollars? And it's not like you sell your soul to the devil. Meryl had already done it. For all humanity. And now the world must end, because we have committed the ultimate evil and we must be destroyed.
