Basically, it's a typical revenge of the western West, heavy spaghetti, and if you follow it as such, the protagonist succeeds in defeating the main villain. However, so many things do not affect the story that you have to wonder what the filmmakers were thinking about. I'm referring to things like how Miss Rosie's singing number popped out of nowhere and the boxing match in the middle of the city. OK, they have a loose connection with the influence of the evil Mash Flanagan, but why suddenly comes up with an alias - Mr. Donovan. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, I thought it was quite innovative to see how the camera showing Wallach's sight of the wounded person could have been filmed by someone with a real bullet at shoulder. And was not it great to see how Donovan's daughter uses the old headache routine when he gets a little dashy? Do not let me forget the great waterfall work done by the villains of the gravel pit while Wallach shot them in the final. <br /> <br /> There was one thing missing, however, a complete film for that. What happened to that trio of hoods that Flanagan / Donovan hired at the beginning of the photo? You know, the Martel guy a funeral director wanted to hire for his gun prowess, the devil's servant Mitchell with the rifle and knife thrower Lincoln Tate. Each had a bonus of five thousand dollars on their heads, and they were supposed to protect Donovan from the guy who had survived the massacre of the opening scene. They have never been heard again! I like to think that Donovan may have just killed them and kept the 15K alone.
