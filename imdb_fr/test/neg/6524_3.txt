Loving the fairy tale Andersen as a child, and having recently seen intriguing documentaries about this strange but brilliant author, I can not wait to see this movie designed for television. Unfortunately, the experience was only a disappointment and left me angry and confused. First, the story / story is full of inaccuracies and fantasies, creating an almost totally new story while shamefully abusing Andersen's fairy tales, no doubt to sell bullshit like me. . Secondly, the pretty boy actor (really ... never seen a picture of the true Andersen?) Kieran Brew manages to portray Hans Christian as a mental retardation, rather than his brilliant but very disturbed character. Although boring and irritating like Andersen, Brew lacks the charisma needed to create a feeling of compassion, whatever it may be. Thirdly. The love story between Andersen and the fictional Jetta (who should be Henriette, Edvard Collin's wife) ... Why? This man has lived such an interesting life, it should be enough to found a good movie! <br /> <br /> I could go on this very long list, but I think it's safer to recommend you all devote your time and money to something else.
