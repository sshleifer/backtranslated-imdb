Wow! This film is almost a pity for words. Obviously, the scriptwriters wanted to make the link with the Ghoulies franchise. So they asked Pete Liapis, the first, to resume his role of Jonathan ... only now, he is a cop and does not have traits similar to those of the first. . The ghouls of it are not the last ghouls. The cheap puppets have been replaced by even cheaper little costumed people. Instead of being a main antagonist or a demon, they are more like comic relief characters who have come out of nowhere for no reason. <br /> <br /> When I watched this movie for the first time, I felt like I saw it before. Why was it? Because all this was stolen in another movie. All the lines and action scenes of the cops were from Lethal Weapon. The kids looked a lot like Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck, but they were not fun at all. Even scenes from the original Ghoulies movie have been scattered throughout this movie. <br /> <br /> I think the target audience was supposed to be adults, but the mix of dark magic, cartoon, comedy and bad acting do not work at all. I hope they will not do Ghoulies V because I do not want a movie studio to lose their money. <br /> <br /> My note: BOMB / ****. 78 minutes R for violence.
