I remember going through the channels on HBO and seeing that. This, my friends, is one of the worst TV movies I have ever seen. There is no excitement in this movie. <br /> <br /> The story begins with Drew Summers (Candice Cameron Bure) driving in a trance in a small town. She stays with a couple who, by chance, have a girl named Laura Fairgate who looks like her and is played by the same actress. Even city-dwellers agree that they are alike. The thing is, Laura was killed over a year ago. Her boyfriend disappeared about the same time she was murdered, which gave the impression that he had killed her. <br /> <br /> As he settles in this city for a while, Drew begins to have visions and nightmares. These visions and nightmares could prove that Laura's boyfriend is not the murderer after all. Throughout the movie, you discover that Ray Ordwell Sr. (Denis Arndt) is the one who raped her frequently for a while and killed her. <br /> <br /> The film is too long and very boring. The film hangs around again and again, again and again. Surprisingly, I saw another TV movie after this one called (Cloned) 1997 which was good, but I'll see it again later. <br /> <br /> I give this film 1 out of 10 stars. Avoid this TV movie. It's not worth your time. This is the worst TV movie of 1997!
