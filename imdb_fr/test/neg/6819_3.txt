Of course, this film may have had its funny moments with the questions asked and I know that the film is not supposed to be totally credible, the film has made it too scandalous, for example a girl like that does not would never come out in a million years with a guy that people in the movie had poor performances there while playing was so bad. Also, the plot, they could have done a better job at least on the script and focus more on comedy, the comedy was also a bit dry and was getting really boring after the first jokes, it was like 10 minutes were laughter then The end if you want a little terrifying to act with a stupid plot and a love story go ahead and watch this movie.
