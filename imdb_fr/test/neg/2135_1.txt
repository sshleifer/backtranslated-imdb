Never before had such a vast group of ugly people come together to make such an ugly movie. <br /> <br /> Something huge and horrible is being lost in the waters off the coast of Florida, something that leaves half-chewed bodies behind its wake. Depending on the unshaven beer, Bob thinks he has captured the "evil voice" of the Thing on a tape. Bob's assistant, Stella, surprisingly unattractive and painfully skinny, decides to seek the help of Peter, a hairless electrician, whose equipment could perhaps help locate the mysterious creature. But anyone who plunges too far into the mystery ends up being killed, killed by a baboon facing a malefactor with a bad permanent. What is the terrible secret behind the Sea Killer? <br /> <br /> Silly scientists have hot affairs, cops and doctors are taken aback by the growing body of corpses, Stella and Peter go to the beach and characters that matter to us are killed or missed. The Sea Killer, a strange combination of an octopus, a shark and a pair of great dentures, never seems as threatening as it should be. The plot behind the creation of the monster makes no sense. None of the characters are particularly friendly and those who might be are immediately killed. This is a bad shot, badly doubled, intrigue less mess. Everything is so blurry and so bad that it made me want to take a hot bath. I had sushi plates more frightening than this movie. Avoid it, except for the MST3K version.
