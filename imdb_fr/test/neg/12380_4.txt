Personally, I have no problem with the acting or the scenario. I have a problem with the giant bird. It was just AWFUL. Clear and simple. <br /> <br /> One of the first moves is the rolling of laughter when you see it. What were they thinking !? The budget is damned. The monster was a monstrous farce. <br /> <br /> Of course, if producers could get actors like Ankrum, Corday and Morrow, then they would have a special effect on the beast. Never mind. What is done is done. This will be the case of the eternal joke about them that was involuntary.
