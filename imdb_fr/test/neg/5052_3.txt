You know, I'm getting really tired of all the generic music used in this type of movie (see Jawbreaker, Disturbing Behavior, etc.). Every real tension scene here (and there is) is immediately alleviated by a pop cheese melody, completely diluting the suspense. Why are they doing this? To sell soundtracks, of course, but in this case, the mission is incomplete - did anyone buy the CD? <br /> <br /> And yes, Mrs. Mirren attacks her role with enthusiasm and flavor (with an enthusiasm add a kick). But what do Molly, Leslie and Vivica do here? Their roles (they are so underused that I can not use "characters" here) have no reason to be in the script. I can not understand why three known actresses were chosen. <br /> <br /> Oh, and the end is so incredible and irresponsible. The children are doing well and acting as if nothing has happened - everyone is smiling at graduation. They are criminals, people! No consequences for their actions (kidnapping, aggression, change of rank) - nothing. <br /> <br /> Little things too - Tingle's story about her husband was true? What is the crossbow? Would the virginal Katie lose her cherry on a whim like that? (Great message, guys.) Why did McKean go to her house? How did Kate's academic enemy walk through the door at this moment? How do students even get the personal address of teachers? WHAT WITH JEFFREY TAMBOR ?? On what basis did McKean send Tingle? She is bloodied, beaten and held hostage by students, it's the love of Cripe! <br /> <br /> Well, I'm thinking a lot more about the scenario that Mr. Williamson apparently did, so I'm going to stop here. <br /> 3/10
