How did LIVING THE DREAM get into Laemmle 5 in West Hollywood, because it's the worst film I've ever seen in my life. I should have known when the first scene opened in desperation, in Eugene, Oregon, that this episode of a movie with characters you want to love and desolate from their days of high school exclusion, but can not, because they are so losers, so wooden and so atrocious with a dialogue that goes beyond evil. <br /> <br /> Then, clich√©, the three losers of high school meet in Los Angeles, and it is here that the film could have been realistic showed them trying to find a career in the theater. But no, one is a used car salesman, the other is a real loser in a garage call center selling magazines. Even the bastard who runs this place has more appeal to the public than this horrible actor with the horrible foreign accent. And, they fraudulently earn money from an insurance scam to create an inexperienced executive recruiting company, simply showing "the so-called good life" in Los Angeles nightlife with a cast of actors so threatening and so mean that it's better not to have SAG cards ... <br /> <br /> I could go on and on about this bad movie, but I ended up leaving the theater, which had six people at first, and when I left, four men were the only ones in the audience. I wanted to love this film, but I found no merit in the story, the characters, the writing, the dialogue, or the actors. Whoever shot this film should retire. Amen ... enough ...
