This movie was corny and it was more than that. It was about this guy who curses himself and turns into a gorilla. I had to see how much it was because of the title. Before this guy turns into a gorilla, he gets married. I was a little upset because she was not the wife of a gorilla: she is now the wife of the gorilla. She should have married him when he was a gorilla, so the title would have made more sense. There are also all these people in the middle of the jungle and they all want to leave. It's not just a B movie, it's more like a Z movie. I did not even see bananas as a wedding present. Oh, all right, he was not cursed yet.
