Very dark, very dull, no real drama. Why not just do a documentary? This is not exactly Joan of Arc's passion. The only reason to see Chronicles is to hear the performances. I love Bach's music and I even had a hard time sitting in this movie misery. The great Gustav Leonhardt plays (in two senses of the word) Bach. We do not really understand him as an actor because he has given so little to do dramatically. Most of the time, he can leave various rooms with determination or anger. Bach's life, of course, was not a film by Errol Flynn. It was indeed quite dull and more than a little hard. It probably means that life is not an excellent candidate for a movie. Music, of course, is another story. I recommend Bach stations. Much more information, among others, and a glimpse of music, which is, after all, the reason why Bach interests us in the first place.
