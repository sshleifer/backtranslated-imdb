I was subjected to this battery on a Wednesday afternoon while my mother-in-law was watching her. I can not convince anyone to remake a big-budget Hollywood flop ("The CORE" with rundown actors like Luke Perry). If the budget HIGH is flopped, what makes think that to do the same film 2 years later without budget would go nowhere? I laughed almost all the way through the movie because of its incredible resemblance (in fact, I'm shocked that it was not caught in Legal, but rather on TV), and that was actually the CORE scenario that comes to be badly redone. you saw "The Core", you know why it's fun to do worse, because the Core was already so bad that it was funny. <br /> <br /> If you like to laugh at REALLY bad movies, this one will be right in your driveway. The only thing I can say is that I wish Luke Perry could have a career, because he is not a horrible actor ... he just picks up horrible roles. A film made for TV movies that will be broadcast only in the daytime television is a step closer to the end for him, without 90210, he would make a career.
