I saw garbage based on the Bible. This one in mind. To make matters worse, it takes about three hours. A horrible waste of time, unless you want to match your child's biblical knowledge with innumerable aberrations. Do yourself a favor - walk around the Sahara instead. Since I have to explain in ten lines why not watch this movie, let me just tell you that there is absolutely no redeemable quality. God's conversations with Noah are ridiculous. The whole thing has a stench of "make the Bible story look delayed." The basic logic is: if they spend money on a Bible movie, why not make it profitable? Since the basic logic is not respected, something is wrong. The film begins with a disclaimer on Poetic licenses taken ... that's the least we can say about the century. Poetic rape. But then, poetic would be an undeserved favor.
