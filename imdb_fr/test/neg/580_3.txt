Dorothy Provine does the opposite here: she keeps growing. I did not detect any subtext, however. "The Incredible Shrinking Man" and other films of its kind during this period were parables about radiation, nuclear war and other horrors. The growth of Provine is the result of an inept computer / robot. <br /> <br /> And who operates this computer but Lou Costello! I like some of his films with Bud Abbott. But, although it's a very bad movie, he's doing it without him. And Gale Green is an excellent leaf. <br /> <br /> Green plays the big pompous blow of the city. He is the father of Provine. He intends to be elected mayor. So when her beloved daughter starts having problems, he drops her. He does not really reject it but abandons his fight against his longtime admirer Costello. <br /> <br /> It's quite unlikely: Costello is the local garbage collector. <br /> <br /> minimal. And the sub-plot involving the army is lame to the extreme.
