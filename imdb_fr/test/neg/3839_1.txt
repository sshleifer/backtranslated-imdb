A blind man could have shot this film better ... seriously! The director is clearly a novice. He must be Dennis Hopper's coke dealer or something to convince him to be part of this movie. I felt so embarrassed for Dennis. <br /> <br /> For John, the director ... PLEASE pull yourself out of the direction. Your contribution is not necessary or desired. The medium of the film is stronger without you. You are terrible to lead. Stick to the grocery bag or something. <br /> <br /> This film should have been ignored "directly to the video" and "trashed". I am a stupider person for watching this movie. DO NOT SEE THIS FILM IF YOU RESPECT AND RESPECT THE ARTFORM OF THE FILM!
