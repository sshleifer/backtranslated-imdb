Terror in the jungle is a real discovery. If you have seen it, you are one of the lucky few. It's hilarious! <br /> <br /> The story is about a plane crashing in the middle of the South American jungle. The scene of the accident must be seen to be believed. Everyone dies in the accident or is then devoured by crocodiles. Only a young blond boy survives. Nearby tribes bring the child to their village and all (men) worship him because of his golden hair! I am not joking! In the end, there is a lot of struggle between the natives and the man looking for survivors of the plane shot down. All the while, the kid sits on a throne and his blond hair is surrounded by a golden halo and he cries all the time !! It's funny !!! <br /> <br /> Very obscure and contains very questionable sub-texts. A must if you like the dark, it's so-bad-it's-good-movies.
