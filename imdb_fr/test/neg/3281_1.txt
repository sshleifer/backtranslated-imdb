This is a piece of celluloid CRAP. You can know when you watch a movie "I want to be" on the Mafia ... and that's it. That makes NO SENSE at all, did not start at the beginning of his life, the characters were everywhere ... and the TERM "GODFATHER" did not even exist until PUZO wrote the book! ..... THEN, the real mafia, borrowed the PHRASE and made it its own AFTER the movie ..... this piece of puzzle would have an idea that the sentence (representing mafia donation) had been used in the 1920s ... while these people were called "DON" .... apart from the original Godfather movie, if you want to see another decent Mafia movie, take a look at Puzo Part 2, The Last Don (part 1).
