I was discussing between this movie and 2012, but I chose Inglourious Basterds because of its surprisingly high IMDb rating. I must say now, what a disappointment. I was expecting a certain amount of gratuitous violence, but I was also expecting a lot of spiritual dialogue. I had a huge dosage of the first, but not enough of the last. I felt exchanged. The relationship between violence and intrigue is very important and I think this film is completely wrong. And the plot? It's also credible or really so entertaining. Save your time and money. I can not believe what this note says for the bloody and violent tastes of the modern masses.
