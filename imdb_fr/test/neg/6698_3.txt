If anyone thinks it's a big sports film, it's probably the only sports film they've ever seen. A sports film can take different aspects. Whether professional, college or secondary. Jim Thorpe: All Americans, All good things, Any Sunday, Eight men out and Rocky, among others. All these movies had more than just sports. Whether it's an ascent then a descent of man's greatness, or a man who loses a dream under the action of a vindictive coach, or the effect of money on professional sports. In Hoosiers, there is not much content. It did not even seem like the movie had a beginning or an end. There was no character development, they were all imposed on us. I could summarize this film by quoting a very bad coach: "Get out and try to score more points than the other."
