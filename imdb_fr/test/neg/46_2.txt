Acolytes presents an interesting mix of original concepts in a cliché horror "screaming teenager" with more thriller stimulation. In some ways, Acolytes is very successful, but in many other respects the film fails miserably. <br /> <br /> Overall, Acolytes has avoided the typical archetypes of innocence and innocence of youth from endless horror movies like Cabin Fever, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and countless others films in which unsuspecting, relatively naive and innocent teenagers have sex, run screaming and one by one are shot by some sort of monster. Instead, this innocence is replaced by pride, retaliation, and arrogance. The characters had several opportunities to save themselves from immanent death and despair, but they did not do so because of their own demons. In the end, you still had the feeling that there were not (and maybe not even) innocent victims. <br /> <br /> As the name suggests, the film also very much refers to following a leader or authority. This was used directly in the sense that the main character would become like the serial killer and was also used less directly in the film. Following the central character is a recurring theme in the film. <br /> <br /> Through all this, the filmmakers also incorporated a lot of clichés, which I suppose was intentional and gave the film a unique blend of depth. as superficial as I find intriguing. This, perhaps inadvertently, plays well with characters who, at first glance, are superficial, but as the story unfolds, it becomes clear that they are, at least the two main male characters, quite complex. <br /> Technically, however, the film has a lot of problems. Cinematography, which is generally considered highly appreciated, seems to me rather sophisticated and too stylized, using stereotypical approaches to 2/3 far too rigid. I felt that many transitions were too stylized. The use of symbolism was not only vague, but also too much used. <br /> <br /> The plot was poorly planned and relied exclusively on erroneous information in order to reach a pretty hokey end, badly resolved and leaving the viewers confused. The methods used to solve the climax are inexpensive and unprepared, the motivations are generally unclear and the plot's essential points ultimately remain untapped. <br /> <br /> On the whole, the relative originality, the themes and the thesis of the film are lost in a labyrinth of mediocre technical execution, images too stylized, unclear reasons, obtuse symbolism and useless and inexpensive twists maintained solely by a lack of information or totally incorrect information. <br /> <br /> If the film was better executed, it would have been excellent. However, Acolytes receives only two stars in my opinion.
