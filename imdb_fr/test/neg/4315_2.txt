It's total swill. If you take The Devil's Rejects and you suck all the good, and you add many kinky servitude elements, rape scenes, and some rape scenes, like one or two truly horrible scenes, you'll get that movie. People call it a Hitcher scam of 86, but I do not see it at all. Even the worst Hitcher scams are even better than that. The main problem presented here is that there is really nothing here apart from some of the director's fetishes presented as circus shows. Does all you need in a film is to film abused and tied up girls, shaking with fear? So rent this movie! <br /> <br /> However, I would rather just watch a good movie, which is clearly not the case. What is sad is that there are still very good thrills to discover here, but only a few. For example, the suspense at the beginning before the nonsense of the bondage started ... damn good if you ask me. And the scene where the hitchhiker kills the nympho girl (I can not remember the names) is scary, very brutal, challenging even The Devil's Rejects for unbridled fury. How is it that the rest of the film can not be so good? Huh? I really need to stop renting bullshit like that. Closing message: let this trash die and forget it forever. Not recommended.
