It's complete nonsense. I studied Nazism and read many manuscripts of the day. The "parallels" take up most of the degraded apocryphal myths of Nazism and then compare it to complicated generalizations about what constitutes 1/3 of the planet. It has been designed for a complacent Polly-Anna audience that eats a lot of spooky mumbo jumbo, terribly thought out arguments, irrational conclusions, fallacious ideas and absurd logic. Who contributed to peace? Easy. <br /> <br /> When everything is said and done; What is Bono? That is to say, who benefits in the long run? <br /> <br /> You do not have one. You sacrifice money and rights. Muslims do not have any, they have our bombs. Retry. Answer this and you have unlocked a main door.
