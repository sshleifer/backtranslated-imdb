While she was looking for water, a young psychic woman named Jessica Burns (Carolyn Kearney) stumbles over something else. She discovers a chest that has been buried for centuries in her aunt's ranch. Instead of the treasure his aunt hopes for, the chest contains the head of Gideon Drew, a devil worshiper beheaded by Sir Francis Drake. Controlling telepathically the hand that opened the chest, Drew embarks on a murderous madness in search of the rest of his body. also buried in Jessica's aunt's farm. Although Jessica is certain to feel the presence of evil, can she put an end to Drew's plans and will she be in time to prevent her from becoming whole? <br /> <br /> I thought I knew enough about most of Universal's horror productions before 1960, but it's a 50s Universal movie that is certainly not mentioned. Although the thing that would not die is not what I would call a "good" movie, there are a few things to do. First, the film has interesting ideas and is rather ambitious. The director Will Cowan, whether by chance or intentionally, is able to give the film a pleasant atmosphere from time to time. And, the special effects involving the head are certainly scary. But the whole project is defeated by the actors. I am shocked to learn that one of the supposed "actors" of this thing has appeared in something else. One might think that it was a film "one by one" and made for most people involved. Kearney is the worst offender. She is horrible. In addition, the thing that could not die was perhaps a bit too ambitious for his own good. Given the budget and other constraints, the film could not aspire to any more noble ideas. Finally, the film ends rather abruptly. Just as things start to get interesting, The End. What are you talking about?
