I love movies like this. Beautiful girls, toilet humor, free nudity. So why did not I like this movie? No film like this should add any confusion to the plot. Who's who, where's the money, it's not SE7EN, make me laugh. Maybe it's me, but I've never felt so frustrated watching American Pie movies or any other more modern National Lampoon film. This film has no flow that makes me smile, waiting for more. Instead, I found myself thinking, "Why did they keep this scene?" I do not recommend this movie. If you wait for Van Wilder, think again. The only pleasure I had watching this movie was to guess which movies were the actors when they were kids. 2/10 generously.
