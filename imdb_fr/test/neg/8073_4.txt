I remember a Florida vacation when this movie was broadcast I had my VCR installed to record it. Anticipation kills me. I knew the movie since it was announced about six months ago. We returned from Florida 4 days after the movie and I immediately watched it. I tried as hard as I could to love him, but I did not do it. <br /> <br /> I am a huge fan of 3 stooges. And as such, I know a little bit about it. So, it was not like I was expecting to learn something from the movie, and I did not do it. I was more interested in the representations and accuracy of their information. There were a lot of problems with this movie. The actors, the scenario, the reconstructions, ALL could have been much better. <br /> <br /> Paul Ben-Victor is an extremely talented actor. But let's be honest, Moe Howard was REALLY out of reach. He does not look like him, he does not look like him and therefore he can not act like him. Michael Chiklis is also very talented, but his interpretation of Curly did not really mark me, although, when Curly became ill, he was very successful in this area. Shemp's performance by John Kassir could have been better repeated. It was more of a bad impression than a portrait. Joe Besser was the worst of all. They made him skinny and more annoying than he really was. It was just laziness. I do not like short films Joe, because, as the film illustrates, he was never touched. But it was not so boring and not so thin DEFINING. The best performance belongs to Evan Handler. He had the most accurate representation of stooge. The problem with Larry's character, his hair is much too frizzy and much too red. I know it's too technical, so I will not count it in my list of reasons why I did not like this movie. <br /> <br /> Back to Shemp, who happens to be my favorite puppet. It is written like a groaning chicken that trembles. True, he had a lot of phobias, but he was not so bad. He did not leave the band early because he was afraid of Ted Healy, although he did not like it, but Shemp left because he had received an offer from another studio that he just could not refuse. Instead of the truth, this film chooses to make it wet the bed. On Larry no less, he rushes into a closet and disgracefully drops out of the group. Another problem is that Shemp has made almost as many Columbia short films as Curly, but only one, Fright Night, is his first short film. His career was almost completely ignored. Plus, the ugly editing caused a terrible and unforgivable mistake. Shemp was born in early 1895 and died at the end of 1955. That would give him what age to death? Well, here's a hint: it's not 59, as the movie says. <br /> <br /> Now let's move on to writing, which I think was imperfect only because the film was hastily released. Some of the lines are silent and could be developed and / or introduced much better than they were. The line that really touched me is at the very end of the film, when Moe shows the developer how the eyepoke is. <br /> <br /> "That's how we do it, make contact with the eyebrow, not the eyes, looks real on the film though." This line was poorly written and misplaced in the film. It's supposed to be one of those lines that lead the public to say OH! I'm amazed and I'm sure this has been the case with some people, but the end of the movie was not the perfect place for this line. A better place you ask? And if they first came to Columbia and were introduced to the sound effects machine. I know at the beginning there was no sound for the eyepoke, but Moe, for example, could have said, "And that?" and Curly or Larry eyepokes. Jules White says, "Are you okay?" or "How did you do that?" There were a lot of misplaced lines in this movie, which clearly indicates that the script was released in a hurry. Another concerns the origin of the name Shemp, although this one is not so serious. That's why I'll let him slip. <br /> <br /> What is this film doing well? This illustrates how the stooges were screwed by Columbia, what they were. I do not know if Moe was a fan of the race, but it was the kind of dramatization meant to get the viewer to sympathize with them. I know this film was a dramatization. I know that everything is not going to be clean, neat and absolutely perfect. However, some of the things they invented and the real things they ignored were in serious conflict. For example, Curly's attack is not as close to reality. I know, I know dramatization, but the purpose of dramatization is to make real events more dramatic. The Curly shot in real life is more dramatic than what they showed in the movie. This is what really happened. Curly was sitting on a chair off the screen while shooting a scene. They had called him for the final scene of the cake fight, but there was no answer. Moe went to get him and found the head of his little brother, half-paralyzed, unable to speak, and tears running down his face. Moe then said "Baby?" and tried to help him out of his chair. Poor Curly kneels down. Then the ambulance was called. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie was not terrible, but it was certainly not good, nor even correct. This film portrays the stooges in an impotent and inaccurate way and sometimes goes too far with dramatizations. There is a very, very long list of inaccuracies in this movie. If you do not believe me, check out Stooge's list on the threestooges.com news forum. It's about a page and a half. I can let some things slide in the movie. But others were unforgivable. The Three Stooges were geniuses and a lot of today's comedy is based on what they did. Do not believe me? Discover the Simpsons, and even more Ren and Stimpy. But this film fails to capture their genius. This makes their difficulties much more inaccurate, which is important, but if the title of the film is to be The Three Stooges, it must portray their ingenuity and originality more than anything.
