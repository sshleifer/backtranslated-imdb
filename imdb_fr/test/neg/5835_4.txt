I challenge you to watch this movie and deny the statement above. That is, IF you can stop looking at his face virtually flawlessly. She also fights and fires, but not as much as I hoped. The film is extremely slow and low budget, even if at least they tried to find an excuse for the spaceship that was so sparsely populated; almost all the crew is in "suspended animation", and the ship goes into autopilot! And the heroine saves none, and brings nothing useful "at home"; it seems that trapping this devilish lady by making her travel in space was the only part of her mission that could not be accomplished more easily by the missiles that blew up the ship at the end. There are also long-lasting, but tame, soft-core scenes, and some "Alien" monsters that kill about 2 people. * 1/2 of 4.
