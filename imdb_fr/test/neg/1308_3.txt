Normally, I do not write reviews, but for this film, I had to. I am shocked by the talent of actor in this movement that will be lost ... the script was terrible ... editing is horrible ... and the plot very thin. You spend the first half of the movie wondering who is talking to whom and how. The second half of the movie slows slightly, but has no depth or feeling. The only thing that saves is the nice, but still limited CGI, and its location being London. I gave 3 stars for this, and the fact that the actors always tried to do a good job with the drivel that was given to them. If you want to lose a few hours of your life with a movie disaster poor entertainment popcorn, this is the movie you need. But I would rather do something else with your time, like looking at real archival footage online! :) http://www.weatherpaparazzi.com/flooding.asp
