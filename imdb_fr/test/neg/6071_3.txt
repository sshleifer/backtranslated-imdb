Terrible! <br /> <br /> Despite the good results of Ed Harris, Diane Kruger and the high budget (reason for the 3 stars), the film is by far the worst I've seen on a composer, and the worst edition a masterpiece of music. I agree with some elements of fiction to improve a biography, which otherwise could not be so "charming". This has been done in AMADEUS with the best results, but this B copy here is a flaw. Beethoven had a strong personality, but was a sensible artist. Here in this movie though, it looks a lot more like Mike Tyson! I also wonder if, despite his deafness, he heard all the whispers of the last scenes (maybe a cochlear implant?). I prefer to listen to the ninth on a CD with a good maestro. Today, most of them conduct modern Wagnerian orchestras. By the way: I gave Amadeus 10/10!
