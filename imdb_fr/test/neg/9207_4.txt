The first half of the movie is not so bad actually. Although the characters are not too detailed, the story is funny and generally acceptable, with potential for improvement, which is not the case. <br /> <br /> In the second half, things start to get worse. not only for the characters in the film, but also for the viewer, who will basically wait for the story to come to an end. <br /> <br /> The comment of the previous user mentioned: "It's a love story, a road movie, a thriller, a comedy of errors, a film of the 80s and most importantly, a film by Jonathan Demme. "<br /> <br /> Well, let me rephrase that:" It's a boy story girl, they're driving around, the thrill is gone because it's too clear how the things will evolve, there is no scene in this film that can make laugh out loud, she has some light years 80 feel and yes, Jonathan Demme was really the director.
