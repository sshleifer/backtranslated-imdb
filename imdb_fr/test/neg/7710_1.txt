oh dude, where to start ..... <br /> <br /> drop his weapon into a hand-to-hand combat with a zombie, while holding a bitten soldier arguing to shoot him b4 he turns, then he turns around and bites the person holding him, his back to a "fallen" zombie, continuously pulling him on the chest and seeing that it did not work, then they pulled themselves again on the chest , thinking that a child was slouching at the office w / blood coming out of his mouth is still good, walking along a football field as if nothing was wrong then suddenly noticing the zombie football team doing n ' whatever in the middle of the field as they could not have seen up to this point .... <br /> <br /> I could go a few more hours, but you understand the meaning ... writing and childish dialogue, wrong direction, horrible special effects, really sad and undeveloped scenario (campus infested with zombies, you have to get the viral host, then lose it ... twice), the only additional benefit I can find is that it does not include extracts from the sounding "action scenes ".... <br /> <br /> id say do not waste your money, but be more upset by the waste of time, I saw it on a cable and I wanted the 2 o'clock life back
