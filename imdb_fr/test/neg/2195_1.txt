When, oh, when, will Hollyweird write a good movie around computers? I can not believe that people really consider this film a credible story. <br /> <br /> No computer operating system could ever survive with this sort of annoying scrolling interface. It may look good on a movie screen, but if you have really tried to use it for a while, you would go crazy. <br /> <br /> When it comes to "tracing" people like she did, it just can not be done this way. Network security alone would prevent that. The recording of the keystroke was, to say the least, laughable. <br /> <br /> Regarding the software supposed to be installed, no system administrator would allow the installation of such critical software on a production system tested, retested and tested again on a system of bags sand. <br /> <br /> But probably the worst part of the movie was the "virus". It is impossible for a virus running on one operating system to work on another system. And when it comes to a virus that could destroy a central computer, it only takes a few seconds, which just begs for conviction. There is no way for an open remote connection to have the required root access that would allow the deletion of system files. <br /> <br /> I could go on but I can not be bothered. <br /> <br /> A porn has a better plot than this pile of garbage.
