Someone remembers the docudrama FILS? It's a dramatic documentary that shocked Britain in September 1984. Although Mick Jackson's nuclear horror film about holocaust did not really amuse me, I could respect it. Unfortunately, I can not respect this documentary broadcast 20 years later on terrorists who drop a radioactive dirty bomb in central London <br /> <br /> The problem I have is that the director Daniel Percival has a distant value. too good when in fact it would have benefited from rather cheap production values. Cinematography is superb but in this type of speculative drama do we need a superb and well-lit Oscar film? What we certainly do not need is a musical score, as the survivors of the explosion slowly emerge from the smoke. Nor do we need any vaguely well-known cast members. Did anyone else sit down and ask themselves, "Hey, where was he, I know that face" many times? I know I did it and it's very entertaining. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the biggest production flaw with DIRTY WAR is that someone decided to make it a docudrama with too much stylistic emphasis on the drama. In THREADS, the action dissociates once more from Sheffield's and becomes an HORIZON edition on the effects of nuclear war before returning back to the protagonists of fiction and THREADS is very effective. Here, the information presented stifles drama drowning in revealing dialogue and totally unconvincing. The characters in the retransmission are not really characters, but cyphers to inform the public of what happens when radioactive material is exploded. It would have been better if the action cut in the subtitles transmits this type of information in the manner of Threads. The worst thing is that the director Daniel Percival used the same technique as that described in THREADS a few years ago with his docudrama on smallpox. He should have used the same style with DIRTY WAR <br /> <br /> I should also put my cards on the table and say that even if I do not consider that Muslims are terrorists, I start to have a little tired of TV productions like THE CELL OF HAMBURG, THE GRID AND DIRTY WAR must signal me by dropping me on the head, which is rather typical of the condescending attitudes of computers in today's TV channels <br /> <br /> I managed to miss Bob's studio debate mentioned here was also discussed elsewhere and I can not help but think that DIRTY WAR himself offers better viewing, with his passionate debates between different factions of the political spectrum. If we remember DIRTY WAR in twenty years (it is very unlikely that I know it), we will perhaps remember the discussion that provoked more than anything.
