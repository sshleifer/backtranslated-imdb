With "Thank you, God, you're here" from NBC, the network may be trying to replicate the success of ABC's improvised sitcom, "Who's Line Is It Anyway?" in which the host, Drew Carey, would judge the performances of a handful of cast members who improvised scenes. In the NBC show, Dave Foley and his co-host, Dave Alan Grier, supervise a handful of notable comedians who have to improvise their way through various scenes that all begin with "Thank God you are here." This is taken far too seriously (why do the viewers have to be reminded repeatedly that the actors have never seen the plateaus before), the two co-hosts seem less enthusiastic. After watching the insane and continual attempts of actors to solicit some laughter, I wonder if the live audience really laughs at what is happening or improvised too. Expect the slot filler to be very temporary.
