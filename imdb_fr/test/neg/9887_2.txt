I read the book after watching the movie and I did not care, finding it a bit trashy. but trashy books often make good movies, and this one could certainly have. The story of a teenager's exploration of her attractive power over boys, which she finds as irresistibly stimulating as it is questionable, and which carries her even more than a normal girl would do because she touches her through his werewolf- -This story would have an obvious appeal to the young audience for whom the films are made: a call of a genre to girls and of another genre to boys: and I do not understand how filmmakers could be blind to that and turn history into one with little interest in anyone. <br /> <br /> For starters, let's take the title (which is the best thing about the book): it is taken from a quote from Hesse, also used as an epigraph, about a person running in the scared and tastes both blood and chocolate in the mouth, one as bad as the other. It's a wonderful metaphor for the heroine's state: torn between her human side and her wolf side, savoring each of them, but also afraid of both. The film goes without the epigraph and presents the character working in the chocolate factory of his aunt! I can understand how the title of the book might have suggested to filmmakers the chocolates erotically loaded with "Like water for chocolate" and get them to want to link the same symbol to werewolves. But they did not do it. so why is it in the movie? In the book, the characters are in high school - or go out, as in The Five, a teenage gang who favors jeans and black t-shirts, and who stands somewhere between the character of the heroine and her pet peeve. In the film, they became decadent in their twenties. In the book, the heroine is 16, just the age to discover how her sexuality operates on the boy she wants, as well as herself; it is she who initiates contact, then withdraws, re-initiates, etc. In the film, she is no longer a girl, but a woman, and the guy is no longer a high school poet on the fringes of university life, but a fugitive of the law (and a cartoonist, in addition ), it is he who comes for her, in a way as unattractive as that of his worm-eaten cousin. At first she pushes him away, then gives in, because he's convinced she'll do it: hey, you know you want him. I would have thought that a director would have taken advantage of the opportunity offered by the book to show a female protagonist in an uncompromising and proactive role; but no. <br /> <br /> In the book, the clan of the heroine is driven from her home because of the delinquent behavior of the Five; in the film it's because she ran (!). She is an excellent runner, inclined to leave the walls of the building, and her teammates and she climbs the buildings all at once; very similar to martial arts movie heroes and very different from wolves, or something that looks like them. In the book, they do not become real wolves, but things bigger than wolves; in the film, they are just ordinary wolves. In the book, they metamorphose into a "screaming" style, with the screeching of thorns; This is one of the things that make the heroine aware of her body's pain and pleasure. In the film, werewolves became magical acrobats, performing swan dives and transforming themselves into the air, a shimmering yellow like Tinker-Bell; it looks cool, it does not mean anything. <br /> <br /> In the book, the clan is a slightly trashy white family who has moved from West Virginia to Maryland. In the film, they live in Bucharest but all speak in different accents, no Romanian. In the book, almost the entire group wants to lead a normal life and agrees that to ensure its survival, it is essential to keep its true nature from humans. And so the characters continue to say in the movie; yet, the clan leader is a kind of clandestine leader - but apparently not a crime leader, because he despises criminals - and has a permanent contract with the police, which provides him with "meat" for the pack. This seems to be a great exception to the rule of preventing humans from knowing; but perhaps the police are considered safe because of his known tolerance for eccentricity and cult killing. <br /> <br /> At the end of the book, the heroine learns that she can not be something she is not when, in her effort to live. a divided life, it gets stuck between the human state and the animal, unable to be everything or anything else. Her boyfriend is not sure or strong enough to accept her for what she is, the pack can not risk having her with her and the two are forced to separate. In the film, she saves him like Lassie and they go to Paris (why Paris?), With a smiling end but not really happy, because the conflicts between their natures - between their natures - remain unresolved. <The most intriguing difference in the film is that, while the characters in the book behave conventionally, in the field of young adult novels, those in the film have been made as boring as possible . Any other line is a threat or some other kind of lack of mind: you will be sorry; you do not belong here; you will not get rid of me; I gave you your chance. etc. I prefer to avoid people who treat this way. <br /> <br /> There have been a lot of good movies about vampires, never a good movie about werewolves. If he had stuck to the book, it was perhaps the first. <br /> <br /> But no.
