Deepa Mehta, Arundhati Roy and a host of other so-called intellectuals get the title of intellectuals because they love to portray India and Hinduism in a bad light ... and Deepa Mehta reports to him anyway. Be that as it may, Hindus are too kind or scared to protest in the same way as Muslims so that anyone can take full liberty with Hinduism. And it is a fact that during the 1930s, Western women were also abused when they became widowed ... Just that no one likes to report anything about the West or anything else that India and Hindus. She paints an inaccurate picture of India and the situation of widows in this city. Nowhere is it mentioned that child marriage is illegal. She finished the film by saying that there were 34 million widows in India. Of course, among a billion people, there will be as many widows. But how many people live the life she described in the movie? Deepa Mehta finally sells India and poverty to earn money. Pathetic....
