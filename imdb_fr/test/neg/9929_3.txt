I found myself halfway through this movie and I was very disappointed. It was downright boring and completely unrealistic. I can afford to be unrealistic in many movies, but not when it's supposed to be a crime drama. The collection of evidence and the interview process was just fantastic. I started moving quickly to see how it ended. And then I got bored with that and just turned off and returned. The main character, played by Ellen Barkin, was simply not credible. Peta Wilson played very well in this film, but his character was out of the ordinary and there was nobody for his acting skills to play for it to work.
