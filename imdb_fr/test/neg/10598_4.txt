I was looking forward to this film. The ads made him look really cool and action packed. And I heard that Claire Daines's character was arrested for assault, so I thought maybe she could kick him and that would be cool. BUT NOOOOOOOO !!. Their action was almost nil and the characters were all a little bland. Omar Epps was the only person who saved his life and he did not even help that much.
