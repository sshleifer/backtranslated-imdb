Another horrible movie from Hollywood. This time, a woman helps revolution in a Central American country. Yeah yeah yeah. Hey lets make a movie without any realism. I'm so sick of movies like this. The actors and actresses are void, the effects are tacky and the dialogue horrible. And all of a sudden, I see John Rhys-Davies as the evil president. From Gimli to Hugo Louis Ramos. I bet he is very proud of it. Well, I should not have expected a lot of this movie and I did not do it. And I'm happy because it sucks bigtime. I wonder what kind of people like this movie. I think young people from 12 to 16 years old. And I guess some people like it because of Kristin Dattilo. Well, I'm not in any of these bands and I hate it. Rating: 2
