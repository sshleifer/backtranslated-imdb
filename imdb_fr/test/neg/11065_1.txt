There seems to have been some money behind this film, but it would be impossible to imagine a film so badly planned and executed if I had not started to watch it. <br /> <br /> For starters, once we are in the cave with the characters (the usual stereotypes of young adults we've encountered in horror movies since the early 80's), the movie is shot almost entirely in close-up. Since actors wear helmet lights, it means we only see dazzling lights alternating with total darkness - we can never see what the characters are seeing; so when they shout "Look there!" we still have to beg "What ?! Where ?!" In the end, the film has a nauseating and confusing effect of strobe light, which makes no sense until the end. <br /> <br /> And I will not tell you what "end" means - but you recognize it if you've ever seen Arch Hall's old laughter festival in the early '60s, "Eegah!" with Richard Kiel. <br /> <br /> But what madman will he ever want to make a variation on a theme like "Eegah!", long considered one of the worst movies of all time ?! But that's what we have here, guys. Except that, unlike "Eegah!", "The Cavern" is not an idea of ​​what is fun. It's unassailable. (I ran it at normal speed x2, just to finish, hoping I could see something at the end of the movie, but when I did, it was just stupid.) provided a satisfying moment, however; Since it only cost a few dollars, after taking it out of the DVD player, I was able to break it with my own hands - what a relief!
