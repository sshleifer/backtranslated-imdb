A woman in love with her husband (he is suicidal) decides to have a baby to save his life. She went to a fertility clinic - just like the lover she takes - so that both of them know how artificial insemination works; but, instead of using the method that thousands of people use every year in the world (the $ 5 turkey pears), they indulge in coitus. We must also believe that even if the immigrant is in love with his fiancee, he does not suggest the obvious alternative to sex. Moreover, even if it is a commercial agreement, the first time she spends with her sperm donor, she removes all her clothes, as if it were a seduction. In addition, her husband does not realize that $ 30,000 disappeared from their bank account. Does all this seem to require a more deliberate suspension of disbelief than even most Hollywood fares? Far from looking on all the plans.
