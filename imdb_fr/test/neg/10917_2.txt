It takes forever for this film based on Stephen King, typically too simplistic and silly, to end up leaving the block. About half an hour is devoted to the useless presentation of various boring characters and their irrelevant personal problems that could excite bored housewives and apathetic retirees in soapy dramas, but this is supposed to be of the horror genre (or at least I thought it naively). The dog can not seem to look at all that is fearsome, with which Leonard Maltin, the notoriously distraught / desperate and always smiling film critic, would disagree: he considers Cujo as "really scary". (I often wonder if Maltin is really thick - or just like to make favors to his Hollywood friends ...). It's both illogical and incoherent in the way Wallace survives an attack by injuring his leg. And, of course, her car breaks down when she needs it to save her life: it's one of the oldest clich√©s of horror movies; trust King to use it to a minimum. The principle is foolish, too commonplace, even for a horror movie: a rabid kitten attacks a family. Is that right? This kind of thing is just a sub-sub-parcel of 3 minutes in your average zombie movie. I think even Cujo must have felt like he was playing a turkey. The mutts have terrible agents ... But what I really do not understand is how people can jump on the book "Cujo" and read it from one end to the other? These SK fans must be immortal: this is the only explanation, that is why they treat time as a meaningless product. <br /> <br /> Number of bodies: 3.
