This film is so awful that it's funny, not quite to Troll 2 levels of hilarity, but still funny. The acting is awful, the music is awful and the story does not make sense. The story revolves around a man dressed in a hideous grandma costume who kills a group of people at a party. The scenes of death are so bad that they are hilarious. A girl is stabbed several times in the chest, but does not scream, defend herself, defend herself or run away. She also manages to stay upright despite the stabbing. Another death scene involving a rope is also extremely hilarious. No thought seems to have been put in the plot. The grandmother seems to move magically from one place to another (for example, hiding under leaves in a wood just next to the victim, appears in front of a person while she was behind her ten seconds earlier ), people kiss extremely hard. inappropriate moments (would you stop and kiss someone if you were pursued by a murderous maniac) and the twofold turn at the end is quite ridiculous, it seems that they have just thrown it to confuse people. I would advise people to watch this movie if they like horror horror movies like Troll 2, The Dreaded or Blood Gnome, but do not watch it if you're waiting for a scary horror movie, you'll be disappointed.
