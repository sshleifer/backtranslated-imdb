A sadly predictable and clich√©d story about a woman who was no better than she should have been. Unfortunately, the script was also written by the great experimental novelist John Dos Passos, after an original French exotic brewer Pierre Louys. This time, Marlene Dietrich is Concha, a manipulative Spanish beauty with a cold heart. Don Pasqual (Lionel Atwill) lifts her from the cigarette factory, but she abandons him. He warns his big and young friend Antonio (Cesar Romero) against her, but to no avail. A duel ensues, Concha reproaches Pasqualito for trying to kill the only man she ever loved, so he does not: he points his gun to the sky, but Antonio shoots him. But instead of going to Paris with the young conqueror, she goes back to the man who died for her. With an unexpected twist of Edward Everett Horton as Spanish governor. Dietrich plays the role of a Spanish woman by constantly moving, wriggling at the waist and positioning herself, turning, turning, turning, turning her head, and so on. And she grimaces and has a loop in the middle of her forehead. The photograph is strangely cluttered: no outdoor scene can be shot except through a tangle of bare trees, no inner scene can be shot without such loaded details that it's almost impossible to follow the people who are moving in one room, no consecutive scene of Dietrich can be shot without major change of wardrobe. The carnival scenes are so full of confetti and streamers that it almost looks like an underwater scene in the Sargasso Sea.
