Entering the film with the right expectations, I liked this movie a bit. Like most of the critics who saw this movie, I totally agree that the plot was extremely thin, like a clich√© and that I could predict every turn of the plot right from the beginning of the movie. But the dance sequences were VERY well done and I really enjoyed the fusion of classical dance and hip-hop dance (both I like to watch). The music / soundtrack of the film was also very good, which made the "dramatic" scenes more bearable. The lead roles (Jenna Dewan and Channing Tatum) were acceptable as actors, but their dance throughout the film was impressive and hypnotizing. <br /> <br /> In the end, a film that is worth seeing if you like to watch good dance sequences, and this film is MUCH MUCH better than "You Got Served" in terms of plot and of drama. Again, that does not say much, does it? = P
