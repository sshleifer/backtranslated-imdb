Although Stephen Gyllenhaal is a good television director with a few full titles to his credit, "Homegrown" is a mess in his screenplay and in his realization. Despite the performances of Billy Bob Thorton, John Lithgow, Kelly Lynch, Jon Bon Jovi, Jamie Lee Curtis and Ted Danson, a cast of this genre could not save the film. <br /> <br /> Gyllenhaalics will know that Jake and Maggie are in the movie but you do not see very well Jake and Maggie is only there for 30 seconds as a babysitter informing the Lithgow character of a chest. It's not even a pot-low low comedy that the movie was destined to be. It was just not funny.
