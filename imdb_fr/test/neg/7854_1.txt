I am a fan of good historical fiction and I am delighted that someone takes a well-written series of books and films them. Writing scripts is not like writing fiction novels, but if you adapt a book, it would be nice to follow the plot. <br /> <br /> The representation of the Vespasians (the present emperor and his 2 sons Titus and Domitian) was horrible. They acted like a cookie cutter Caligula and were the "bad guys" in this adaptation. There was a scene with Titus rendering justice as if it were Caligula (from the film of the same name.) The way the Vespasianii are portrayed in the books follows mainly the stories of historians writing at that time - they were just and healthy, not stained by imperial Claudian madness. <br /> <br /> Helena (the love of Marcus Didius Falco) gives as reason to divorce Pertinax (one of the traitors referenced in the title) was he was a traitor, yet, in the books, c because he did not know her and she thought she had better marry someone who valued her as a person. <br /> <br /> Marcus in the movie gets a slave named Justus, though in the books he could hardly afford, let alone a slave. There was certainly no romantic interlude between the non-existent slave Justus and a woman gladiator ... <br /> <br /> Overall, if you want good stereotypes Roman cookie cutter , get Caligula, if you want a good classic story romance point of view, get me, Claudius.
