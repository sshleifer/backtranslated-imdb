What did I think when I rented this one? What did the distributor think when he copied the cassette and shipped it to Holland? Someone really wanted to see this ***?!? <br /> <br /> These are some astronauts who have problems in space (Apollo 13 flashback, but never in the shadow of this beautiful movie) and they want to go home. If you act in such a movie, you should be happy to get as far away from Earth as possible! <br /> <br /> This one wants to surf on the small wave of space films in 1998 (Deep Impact and Armageddon), and this one fails everywhere. Deep Impact and Armageddon were not perfect either (far from it), but they were at least worth watching once (and maybe once again when we're all old). They had fun. Max Q does not do it. This gives an irritation. OK OK. It's a TV movie, but does that mean you're allowed to create such a mess? <br /> <br /> If you did not choke on your own vomit in the end (by all the cheap and worthless drama dialogue) you must be bored to death with this waste of time. <br /> <br /> The situation worsens in the end when the space shuttle lands at ... No, I can not mess it up (the IMDb guidelines forbid it). So, you have to see for yourself. NO! DO NOT SEE (sorry), but rent a movie that is worth renting (like Battlefield Earth ... I'm kidding!) <br /> <br /> Probably the worst I've ever seen.
