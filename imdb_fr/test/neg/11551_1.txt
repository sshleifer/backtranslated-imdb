One of the worst movies I have ever seen. Atrociously slow, boring and stupid. A lot of juvenile humor in the bathroom, pulled into a painful boredom. I love Jeff Daniels, but he should stick to the action and forget to write. I am surprised that this is considered as high as that. I call it a turkey.
