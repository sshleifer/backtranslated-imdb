This is the worst show in Nickelodeon's history. First, no boarding school has a sushi bar, flat screen TVs and gives each student a laptop. This makes the show so unrealistic and boring. The plots are useless and incredibly boring. The actors are so bad that it makes me want to commit suicide. I really hate the fact that in the series, Zoey is the most popular girl at school, the prettiest and the smartest, and gets the best grades without doing any work. She never really has any problems and all the guys want to go out with her. She is so perfect. There is nobody like that. Plus, I hate everyone doing anything for her and everyone chooses her for each team or club. It's so annoying. Quinn is so obnoxious. His experiences are pathetic, useless and false. Chase is such a wimp. He says he loves Zoey, but if he told him, it would ruin their friendship. Pathetic. Michael tries to be funny, but he never accomplishes anything. Nichole is so perky and shouts a lot. We never see her doing work or studying, but she is straight. Lola thinks she's an actress, but she's afraid (Excuse my language). Do I need to say more? I think not. For your good, stay away from this show at all costs.
