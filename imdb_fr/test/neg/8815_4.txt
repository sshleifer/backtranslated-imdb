I really tried to like "Saw". The story was good and I admire the frantic pace in which the film was shot. However, there were too many clich√©s and elements that, even if they looked "cool", made no sense. <br /> <br /> First, what I liked in the movie is the general tone of the story, and I thought the place was fantastic. The character of The Jigsaw Killer was intriguing and reminded me of the vintage Dario Argento. Danny Glover was excellent in her role as an obsessed detective, and Monica Potter was good in a thankless role as a woman kidnapped by a doctor. Shawnee Smith's stage was incredible and Wan and Whannell are to be commended for using this scene as a demo to gain support for the film. The idea that the Jigsaw killer finds the way for his victims to commit suicide is a great idea, but once the movie started, the logic started to escape. <br /> <br /> Once they showed that Zap was the one By holding Dr. Gordon's wife and daughter hostage, it was obvious that he was not the Jigsaw killer, and was part. The scene where he puts a stethoscope on the heart of the terrorized Diana while Allison yells through her gag is one of the most free scenes I've ever seen. It was supposed to be cold in the back but not to establish anything. Moreover, since the Jigsaw killer found the way to commit suicide, he has no problem slicing a policeman's throat. I guess it's a way of showing that he does not want to get caught and that he will do everything possible to prevent that from happening, but for me it just did not make sense, especially when he shows no remorse at the death of another detective (which I liked, it would have been better if it was given to someone who really deserved it). <br /> <br /> I felt that Leigh Whannell was fine Adam. It was not really a spectacular role and he has a lot of potential as a character actor. However, I did not really like James Wan's management. The story may have been original, but the management certainly was not. I guess I'm tired of MTV-style quick cuts in favor of the old approach to staging, but many scenes involving the Jigsaw killer reminded me of "Se7en" too much. As the movie progressed, it began for me to become a series of demos like "Hey, look what I can do." Instead of being intriguing, it has become very distracting. But hey, it worked. He now leads "Final Destination 3", so he's on the road to a successful career. I think he will become a leading horror director in the years to come. <br /> <br /> the end. As I said, I knew that Jigsaw was not Zap and I loved how Adam discovered the mini tape recorder after killing him. The end would have been great, except for one fatal flaw: I thought they should have left it where you did not know who the killer was. The way this has been done has only been done for one reason: Boy, are we smart? Uh no. For me, that made no sense. <br /> <br /> Some of the best horror movies are made for a reason, when there is a reason for the violence we see in the story. While "Saw" started very well, it began to be canceled by the insatiable need of filmmakers to be "cool" and to hurt their winning story. Maybe if they did not insist too much on making the movies themselves and relied on a more experienced horror director to direct him, I think that would have been the horror classic he was given unnecessarily in the last four months. If this and "Cabin Fever" are the future of horror, I am very scared.
