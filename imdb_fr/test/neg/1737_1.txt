Worst.film.ever Nothing needs to be said. Aaron Carter is totally repulsive and the rest of the cast should immediately fire their agents. It's really a terrible movie from start to finish. I wish I could be more eloquent in describing movies with many (but so many) flaws, but I can not be bothered / be too angry to form correct sentences. <br /> <br /> In short, I absolutely hated everything about this film and not "so bad that it's good" a bit like that ... <br /> <br /> C was a pure drek Gavin
