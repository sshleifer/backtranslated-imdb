There is simply no quality that redeems this film. Okay, some costumes are acceptable, but these are not things you can not see, say, in Conan's movies. And what's new with Ator's hair? I can not believe it's part of a series! I'll say one thing about this movie: it was deemed bad enough for a virtuous fanfaron by the first cast of MST3K and I suggest to anyone who is curious enough to see how bad this movie is to watch this version of the film for moral support if nothing else.
