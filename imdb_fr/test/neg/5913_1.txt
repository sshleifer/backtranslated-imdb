It's really one of the worst movies of all time - and I do not mean so bad, so beautiful. Eddie Murphy is an excellent comic and shows how this film almost killed his career. The writing and staging are incompetent, the sets and staging are as imaginative as an episode of Brady Bunch, and the acting shows just how painful a distribution can be when it absolutely nothing to work with. If there were not the costumes - which, aside from Eddie Murphy's ego, seem to make up the bulk of the budget - you'd swear this thing was slapped by a bunch of high school kids devastated by Schnapp's peppermint. It is amazing that anyone can find this parody in any way funny or entertaining. It's probably not a coincidence that the misguided souls who boast of this whore are barely literate. But if your idea of ​​hilarity is that Della Reese gets her "little finger", then put your cup aside and go rent this movie.
