Everyone likes to see a very bad movie from time to time. You look at it, you joke well and you forget it in the half hour that follows. But he's not one of those. This is the worst thing that will happen under your eyes for a moment. <br /> <br /> I would like to see someone take responsibility for Dante - he's really the most stupid villain you can think of: a guy from A leather pants who speaks with a voice-over and who has a Victory laugh like a 50's Dracula. How can anyone come with this guy? And the hero ... "The Dragon" or whatever ... my cereal box has better acting skills than him (maybe all), it's amazing. But the worst is the scenes of fighting where you might think there might be something. They are so lame, it goes beyond description. There is no shame, I simply can not believe how this movie was licensed by any studio. But I'm just glad it was. Watching this is a self-mutilating pleasure. See it only if you are on a quest for pain in the movies, and in this case, this one is a sure winner.
