This film is perfect for the biggest cheese zombie lovers. it's a movie you can laugh at from acting to the terrible zombie. That being said, I gave a 4 out of 10 to the effort, because horror is a difficult genre to do. Going down the list, the negative points of this film were as follows. <br /> <br /> #Bad make up # serious sound and sound effects # true continuity #the #cheesy # dialogue a song played throughout the movie #stein Couldn't act and, in my opinion, the one of the worst I've ever seen #terrible ends with a #racist moment and the robbery of the name of Simpson named <br /> <br /> the good points # a good suit # the police officers seemed to have the best #the actors with fewer lines or smaller roles seemed to be better #good attempt with gore <br /> <br /> I do not want to badmouth the film, it's funny to watch cos from these negative points and I think that's what makes this movie OK. If it were better, I do not think it would make a difference, but it would not be interesting to see a remake with all the same actors, because I think they have probably improved in the last 7 years.
