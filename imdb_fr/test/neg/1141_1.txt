I'm a big fan of the Vacation franchise and I love Randy Quaid as cousin Eddie. At least two of the hidden names were involved in this project (including Matty Simmons, who produced or directed the production of the four theatrical releases, as well as "Animal House"). For these reasons, I thought that this television spin-off could be worth checking out even without Chevy Chase. <br /> <br /> For the record, I did not expect it to be very good; I just thought it might be a fun diversion. Therefore, my high level of disappointment will prove how terrible this movie was. It was stunned, breathtaking, appalling, the head exploded terribly. Still, I could not help but look at him. It's a disease that I have; I can not get out a movie or give up a TV show before the end. Nothing has ever made me want to recover two hours of my life more than this movie.
