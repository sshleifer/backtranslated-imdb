Annoying yawn of a film that does not retain the zing and sharpness of its predecessor, "Gold Diggers of 1933". The production code was firmly in place at the time of the release of this film. The humor is a pure variety of hokey, wocka-wocka and missing, dry one-liners that sounded so cosmopolitan escaping the lips of the beautiful ladies of the first film. A troop of second-tier stars and character actors interpret the movement, and the motive "put on a show" seems terribly forced; Instead of making or unmaking the world of Broadway, the show here is a charity event hosted by a fancy hotel. Who really cares whether the show continues or not? The score here is bland too. Of course, the big number of the film is "Lullaby of Broadway", which accompanies a long fantastic dance number about the eventual disappearance of a New York social party after a big party - does not have exactly the same effect as the "Forgotten" digit used as the final in '33. Busby Berkeley directs and choreographs this film, and all the promises that are built into the fluid opening scenes of the film deteriorate rapidly. Unfortunately, no one learned from it, and there was another Gold Digger movie two years later. <br /> <br /> Grade: C-
