Sorry for the spoilers that this contains. But if you want to keep reading, I really wonder why so many people value Kevin Williamson so much. Let's take a look at his work as a screenwriter, okay? There is Scream 1 and 2 (plus the story of the next), which I find quite amusing but very overestimated. Moreover, by making Scream a franchise, it has ceased to be a parody of horror movies and has simply become another. Then I know what you did last summer, which is essentially the same movie. He co-wrote Halloween: H20, but even he felt he did not brag about what he did with this monstrosity. Then comes the faculty, which, I say, was awful. (A lot of fun to make fun of, though). Do not even throw me on Dawson's Creek, ridiculous and soap opera, I could tell how hard it is for hours. So we come to teach Mrs. Tingle. First of all, there are tons of little improbabilities in this one. For example: in most high schools I know, the predictor is NOT the only one who can go to college! The idea that Katie Holmes's character would never go anywhere if she was not a follower of the medal was absurd. Have you ever heard of financial help? Also, I do not think you're fired from high school or you're not going to college because you cheated on a test. There are many more, but now I'm going to big. The end really bothered me: they committed a crime, but it was ok because the teacher was a bitch. Awesome. Do you know how many of my teachers I could kidnap on the basis of this logic? I'm sure the police never made statements to find out the whole story, either. It certainly would not be necessary. Helen Mirren was good, she added some talent to a character who (as one previous speaker noted) had NO reason to do anything. And did anyone else notice that Katie Holmes could not act at all? His self-righteousness has become incredibly annoying. "You wanted me to fail ... Blah blah blah." Her last two scenes with Mrs. Tingle were the worst. The only reason I do not regret losing $ 8.25 following this disaster is because she was beaten up a bit. No, wait, I regret losing the money: it was not real and she survived. Mr. Williamson, if you're reading this, you did the same movie (scenes of violence and / or dread erased by wise children making sarcastic jokes and references to other movies) there is barely a few times (I count 6 so, not counting Scream 3 and what follows), and I would really appreciate it if you could stop. Otherwise, maybe I should just kidnap you and threaten you with a crossbow. Okay? :-)
