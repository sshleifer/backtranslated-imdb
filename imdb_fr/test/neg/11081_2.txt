After watching the review of this movie after watching it, I was surprised that there were people who gave him good grades. <br /> <br /> It's a bad camera work movie. Anything that "scares" goes off the screen, usually accompanied by a close-up of someone shouting "Did you see / hear that?" Well no, we did not see that! We can not! And when there were no close-ups, the camera was doing something weird, like turning upside down or shaking very fast, very quickly, either to take action or to make us physically sick. <br /> <br /> The characters were incomparable, because every two minutes, they began to shout the same thing over and over again. I do not care if it's really what I would be, I did not rent a scary movie to see reasonable things! I expect unreasonable things, like extraterrestrials, demons or good actors! They were so stupid. Let's have intimate relationships in a cave! With all our clothes! Speaking of which, the end contradicts somewhat what Domingo said just before his death. It bothered me a bit, but not as much as the fact that the end resulted in a ... serious violation of a girl's privacy. <br /> <br /> No conspiracy, no climax, no good acting, terrible camera-work. What's left? Oh that's right. The end may have had a "twist", but generally with horror movies, the twist in the end is actually understandably relevant to what happened during the film. Sixth Sense, that explains a lot of things. Hide and Seek too. But the Cavern had a lame bullshit that served as an explanation, if you could call it that. Explain. Whatever. <br /> <br /> Do not see it. Please.
