Peter Watkins prepares to face the American justice system in 1971 with this invaluable piece of paranoia zeitgeist that leans so far to the left that it falls constantly. Watkins is a pure tourist as he assembles this tragedy within our gang with clich√© monsters, hippies and black revolutionaries who oppose happy and military cops and a kangaroo court of adults calcified disapproving ones making derogatory statements. Talk about a revolution. <br /> <br /> In Punishment Park, we have a radical system against corruption, because dissidents convicted of crimes are sentenced to three years of imprisonment or a three-day trek through Punishment Park (Valley of the Death) and freedom. Of course, law enforcement officials who monitor their course are not about to play fair and, combined with the stifling heat, the fate of our protagonists seems sealed. <br /> <br /> Punishment Park contains elements of Kafka in the frame and the theme. The trials unfold in a large canvas tent where the chained prisoners cry out for the challenge of worshiping or leaving, a group of inquisitors (like members of Silent Majority for a peaceful America) coming back. None of the groups spend a lot of time listening to each other and the procedure sometimes takes the form of a teenage parent battle over the keys to the appearance of the car. Generally, there is only one side that says what is wrong with America, the other that says what is right if no one offers solutions of change. Meanwhile, Punishment Park's martyrs stumble over dessert while armed cops behave like teenagers. It sounds a bit like some of my 1970s college film class when we were younger and knew more than we do now. <br /> <br /> Peter Watkins has always been on the side of outsiders and the common man against what he perceives as a powerful and corrupt minority. Culledon was a powerful indictment of military atrocity in 18th century Scotland that still resonates. War Game is a sober look at the consequences of nuclear power that should be watched by everyone. Punishment Park also has its value, but for a reason other than the one planned. Watkins' vision today is a classic example of the left-wing paranoia of the 1970s and, given the times (Vietnam, Kent State, The Chicago 7), such hysteria did not seem so far removed from the truth. But 35 years later, the fever has subsided and Punishment Park, with its narrow and unrestrained point of view, is a silly ride.
