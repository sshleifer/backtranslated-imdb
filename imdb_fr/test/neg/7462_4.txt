Slow and strange film that drags and walks (I mean really PLODS) until its disappointing climax. You can expect some sort of punchline at the end, but there is none. Milland and Snodgress give clumsy performances. In fact, the strangeness of the film is perhaps the only thing he can expect. The generally atmospheric score has absurd parts (like the music played during the first appearance of a monkey), and there is a really horrible fantasy scene involving .... a gorilla. (**)
