After spending all her money to care for her terminally ill wife, Karen Tunny (Lori Heuring), a widow, moves with her two daughters Sarah (Scout Taylor-Compton) and Emma (Chloe Moretz) into the dilapidated family home of her husband, in rural areas. Pennsylvania, where local legends talk about zombies wandering in the woods at night. <br /> <br /> Just see the names of the author and director of this film in the opening credits to send chills in the back: Boaz Davidson is the 'genius' responsible for writing scripts titles such as STV Octopus 1 & 2, Spiders and Crocodile, while JS Cardone gave us the heartbreaking "nasty video" of The Slayer and the dull vampire movie The Forsaken. With such dubious talent, I did not expect much from Wicked Little. <br /> <br /> And as I just finished the film, I'm happy to have kept my expectations low. <br /> <br /> Although the film looks good sometimes, with a pleasant use of the wooded and mysterious region, and that the actors give reasonable performances, considering the clich√©s with which they work, the plot is so much laborious, poorly written and derived that it is impossible to be enthusiastic. sure. More importantly, perhaps the film's murderers, the undead children who get up every night from the mine in which they died, are not at all scary, a touch of makeup, black contacts and some scars. store jokes that hurt very much to add to the meaning of the threat. The scout Taylor-Compton and his company do their best to look scared by the tiny terrors, convincingly screaming at every confrontation, but their admirable attempts to sow fear in the audience are of little use: the little ones Detractors just do not have what it takes. we must cool the blood. <br /> <br /> There are some dull chow zow scenes in vain to defeat the gores, and the last murder, which sees the blood of the victim soaking Compton and Heuring, Wicked Little Things (AKA Zombies in the Kingdom) -Uni) is a forgotten trash - another fuss in Cardone and Davidson's filmography.
