First there are some holes in the plot in this movie. We see at the very beginning that a child dies after playing the game. But who was tied in the mail truck to deliver the package containing the game? How did the driver place the package in the mailbox while attached to the steering wheel? It's not like he's Mr. Fantasy. Wow only in the first 15 minutes ... The actors are second-rate, take the "Bad Guy" interpreted by Patrick Kilpatrick (who?). like this one). So, most of the actors are like TV shows, I can live with that, but the graphics or the special effects are horrible. The disembodied "Game" voice sounds like a poor Hal clone from "Space Oddessy 2000". What they called zombies looked more like shadows jumping like monkeys of "Planet of the Apes". The extraterrestrials had transparent bodies like the zombies of the shadow. In most cases, the movie was simply predictable because it contained no agenda or hidden program. The story was a good idea but, like most good ideas discussed at lunch, it was never developed beyond this stage.
