Wait ... wait ... wait ... wait ... wait ... WHAT !? This film is terrible, absolutely terrible. 1. The only reason Kiefer Sutherland is on the cover is to sell it to Kiefer fans, only to be heartbroken. He kills a guy, gets shot and dies before half of the film is over, not to mention that he was only in the first 10 minutes and then disappeared until he died. WHY put it on the cover if its character Blows. 2. Where are the EPIC battle scenes promised in the preview on the back of the cover? 3. It was too confusing, I mean what's new with the girl? She had to tell the movie to try to catch our attention, she failed! 4. If Kiefer dies in a movie, he fails. Now I'm going to watch 24 ..... THIS FILM DOES NOT WORK!
