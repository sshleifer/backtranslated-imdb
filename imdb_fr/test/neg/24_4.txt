"Bloody Birthday" is a strange and sometimes humorous little budget horror film inspired by "Mikey" or a less intelligent version of "The Good Son". <br /> <br /> In a small Californian city, three babies are born at the height of an eclipse, where the planetary alignment means that they are born in one way or another without emotions. Ten years later, our three little psychopaths start a killing, eliminating parents, brothers and sisters, teachers and anyone else who irritates them. Only one teenager knows the truth in order to prevent them. Nothing explains why babies born at the same time around the world are not so twisted, but that's it! <br /> <br /> For a slasher movie, it's very docile in terms of violence and gore, which I guess highlights the problem of incorporating child characters as killers because you can not expose very young actors. Instead, it is amusing and a bit disturbing to see three ten-year-olds preparing murders and executing their plans using guns, knives and crossbows. The main reason why this is not totally ridiculous is that the children actors are very convincing in their role: they sneaky play the innocent children in front of adults indiscriminately while showing their dark side to the girl who knows the truth. . <br /> <br /> "Bloody Birthday" is rather mediocre than a horror movie, with few scares and a little blood, but because it has the shock factor of having children as killers it's a bit unique in that sense. One to look at if there is nothing else.
