Oh damn, I'll reveal the secret: this movie stinks! <br /> <br /> Yeah, there are some cool dinosaur effects that in their day were probably really exciting to watch. Now they do not cut it, but they are not terrible. They are just good enough to tolerate without being able to laugh at it. So they sit there and I sit and watch it, not laugh, not excited, but well, bored. It stinks! <br /> <br /> If I can exercise my Jay Sherman for a moment, the movie really does. The box promises cowboys to dinosaurs, and in a very generic sense, it offers. The guys dressed like cowboys fight two or three big dinosaurs. But in reality, these guys are a bunch of wet chicks, and the hero is a loser (more on that later) and the dinosaurs are barely intimidating. The plot is a yawn, and there is not a lot of trouble technically with what is there to laugh. Everything is gray and bland. <br /> <br /> After a horrific cinematic night (filmed in a color and a half, I call it), we get the plot that involves some people doing things. That's what I caught. Oh, and they are at the turn of the century in Mexico, so they disguise themselves at least cowboy, even if they do not behave this way. <br /> <br /> A group of these people, who I think was human, they go to the desert and fall on these dinosaurs (after finding a miniature horse ... I do not know, let's go ). Then, the film turns into a real scam of King Kong in the final act. At that time, I had lost the will to keep my eyes in the television, and I let myself be carried away by the conscience. <br /> <br /> The "hero" is played by the guy from Under the Planet of the Apes who essentially played the role of Charlton Heston when Heston decided he did not want to be in the sequel. He was chosen because of shock, he looks exactly like Heston. That's about all he has for him. I was really upset when he was the hero of the movie because he was just watching, bringing the girl back in the movie (called TJ ... unfortunately she is not a prostitute or finally the origin the name would have been revealed). Meanwhile, his friend kills all the dinosaurs, saves the day several times, and what does he get out of it? No recognition, no nothing! And he dies while sacrificing himself for his friends! They do not even expect it as they escape! <br /> <br /> boring, long, slowly, with little to appreciate until the movie decides to copy the King Kong script on its own, it's best to avoid this movie, unless you do not feel pain because of the fall of an anvil to the eye.
