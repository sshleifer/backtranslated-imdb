wow, this movie was bad. <br /> <br /> This film was an embarrassment for the original sand field. <br /> <br /> Everything in this movie was horrible. <br /> <br /> The acting game was horrible. All parties except the "Mexican" official were terrible. <br /> <br /> Luke Perry, even if only a small part was horrible. It was his worst role ever. Even the little actor who played him as a child was someone you'd like to hit, even in the end, lol. <br /> <br /> This movie reminded me of those children's movies that do everything in their power to make the game awkward. far beyond the fun scene. The humor was reserved for children 6 years old. <br /> <br /> If you are over 12 and want to watch an interesting movie, skip this movie and watch a sitcom instead.
