To be honest, it's hard to get through this movie without choking on your own vomit. Poor quality animation does not help, as it gives the impression that this decades-old video is in Morrisons 99p. Anyway, it's better than the lamentable scenario, which spends about a third of its length on superfluous extras such as Belle's current problems, information about Scrooge's father, and many insane follies - of suffocation - TWO SIX ANTHROPOMORPHIC SICE. These bizarre additions consume time on the screen to the detriment of elements that you think would be very important, such as Dickens' dialogue and the key elements of his plot - the film fills the game with twenty questions, for example, and sometimes fails to put scenes in the right order. Absolutely hopeless.
