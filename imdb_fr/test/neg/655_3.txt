I was excited to see this movie when it came out. The commercials for that seemed odd and I usually like Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock, and the combination of both seemed like an interesting idea. Unfortunately, nurse Betty was terribly disappointed. <br /> <br /> Personally, I have generally found that graphic violence and comedy do not go very well together and that the only director to have combined these two, in my opinion, are Tarantino and the Coens. There is not a lot of violence in nurse Betty, but the violence that prevails makes me feel a little weird when I had to laugh. Of course, for me, part of the problem was also that there did not seem to be many places where I had been asked to do so. <br /> <br /> The film does not work much like a play either. Betty de Renee Zellweger, the protagonist of the story, is clinically crazy and impossible to understand in real life. I will say that Zellweger is playing pretty well and that Freeman, Rock and Greg Kinnear are doing a good job as well. The problem is in writing; Freeman is the only one who can play an interesting character. It's a shame. 3/10
