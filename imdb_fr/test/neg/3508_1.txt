The film's slogan is "You think you know who you are, you have no idea." I reject both the suggested idea that I have no idea who I am and the inferred suggestion that this movie tells me who the really people are. If people in real life are really like that, then, man, we're screwed. <br /> <br /> A bilious film in which I entered late and I left prematurely. A film that is so rooted in its goal of becoming the film of the race of all time that it loses sight of the very tools that a film must use. <br /> <br /> Hollywood rules are such: if you show something in the first half, it must be used in the second half. Thus, the weapon that the girl worries about what her father buys will end up in the story of the second half. The rules of Hollywood are to make dialogue "real" - a concept that changes every decade. Is this "real dialogue" less ridiculous than the "real dialogue" of Kevin Smith ten years ago? The Hollywood rules state that we are preparing the scene and that as the action gets up, the camera gets closer to the faces - in this film primarily, we can see the so-called shame, humiliation and transcendental realism of the characters. Ropes increase, the rate of shooting slows down and our heart is supposed to break. <br /> <br /> This film is as rude as it is manipulative. I have my own prejudices against L.A., which I freely recognize. I will not say, to combat this prejudice, that this is a natural situation arising from the place, but rather probably from the author and the director. The writer, Paul Haggis, had already shown his taste for the controversy over humanity in his book Million Dollar Baby, which had at least one director who understood how to ensure that the vision of the film brings out the best of ideas. 'a scenario. Now that Paul Haggis has his own hands on the camera, it becomes clear that not only does he not know how to write a true and natural human drama, he does not know how to photograph or direct it. Paul Haggis comes from the country of television, let's not forget: the country of lower expectations. <br /> <br /> Everything is as obvious as a TV movie, presented simply for simple minds - Haggis hits us, more And again, while, on the surface, people can look terrible, they hide secret pains. It's a good idea, but presented so forcefully that the whole juxtaposition of bad / good has an amateurish meaning. The structure of the film is fragmented, in the tradition of Magnolia and other earlier films. The editing is as typical and conventionally "cinematic" as possible - if there is a dramatic movement, such as a door or a car that passes between the subject and the camera, editors-in-chief use this extreme move to to give the cut that occurs there a more kinetic quality. The problem is that, aside from the desire to keep things moving, there is very little intelligence and thought behind the cuts - everything is in the rules. Not only are the puppets of this horrible racial punch and Judy handled needlessly, but even the curtains are lowered and trained with incompetence. <br /> <br /> The film tries desperately to present the reality, but there is simply no talent. Some actors are good, others bad, and all the performance is confused, blurred by the low and low aesthetics of the film. We have a technically clear cinematography: we can see the scene, we understand what is happening. However, not only is the cinematography remarkable, but it is an unthinking camera work and framing that suggests that it is truly inspired. The result is small stylistic flourishes that are recognizable but add nothing to drama or pathos. For example - and this is a spoiler - while a father is holding his dying child (the father could also be hurt, I did not stop to find out), the camera sees his face and we transmits the famous Vertigo plot / zoom. The dizziness !!! It was then that the film became hysterical and I had to leave. I had to leave because it was so bad. I left because I was in the middle of a crowded theater and I wanted to tell the audience that I was fed up with the Hollywood "straight" art, full of noise and fury, but that meant nothing ( in Bard's own words). I hate to waste such good Shakespearian references on something so remarkable.
