This movie was the worst movie I have ever seen. No story, no point, it was not even funny at all, I do not know why people say that this movie is hilarious because it was so bad! Felix Bean, the main character was bad. Susanna sucked. This film was shot in 1996 and was really in the 80s. What else, I never let my friend choose movies. Hmm, the cover of the film says that it comes from the producers of super troopers, who kidnapped them and stole their identities. Wow, what a waste of time. The only thing that was funny was Freaky Ricky, he was funny, especially when he and Emily were together. It was fun. All in all, it was bad, waste of time and sleep. Wow, never thought of a movie like this one could be done, so stupid to watch to watch it until the end.
