This film is released in all major Australian cinemas. I watched the movie on the weekend of August 7th and thought it was absolute nonsense (and I use this extremely low word). We do not know how it was distributed in all major cinemas. The plot seemed simple enough for the world to be divided into subclasses and people need ID cards and actor Tim Robbins plays the role of an investigator who travels to Shanghai to investigate an issue. employee flying ID cards, which turns out to be actress Samantha Morton. <Br /> <br /> You think from this summary that the rest of the story should interact, but it does not confuse the audience even more with another scenario that does not relate. <br /> <br /> If you think about seeing this film, let me save you the trouble.
