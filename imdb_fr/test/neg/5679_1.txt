You can not touch NRFPTP! The new crop is horrible. The jokes are not funny. Some members of the troupe make me want to stop watching TV together. Lorne - you let your creation go to the bathroom. The guests are sometimes good, the groups are mostly garbage. Update of the weekend, Seth has to tell the audience when to laugh ..... Seth would get a proper reception in a Baghdad cafe well ... Make sure Andy accompanies her ... The show contains about 10 jokes in all and they keep repeating them over and over again. Even segments that are obviously not funny. Offending people has become the name of the game, but they can not even do it properly. Just offensively. I am so disappointed with what happened to the series, but now I also know that it is safe to go out on Saturday night!
