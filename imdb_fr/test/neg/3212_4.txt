There are certain scenes in this film (like the first meeting of the hero with the super-villain Shirley Eaton) where he seems to be about to break the sexual taboos and to make his principle (women want to rule the world by making the slave men), justice, but he never dares. The result is a film without sexuality and a tame violence. Despite the hectic plot, the film is not too bad until its peak, where his amateurism rages (terrible editing, overuse of archive footage). To see only as a curiosity. (* 1/2)
