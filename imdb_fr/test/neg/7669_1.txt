WARNING ** SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> Lord knows I've seen bad movies in my day and this one makes me angry too. It's an insult to people looking for a bad movie. "The story" involves a stewardess who discovers that her boyfriend (badly acted by the great Robert Wagner, by the way) is a murder, a thief and just a face of vomit. After taking off from Concorde, he sends guided missiles to destroy the Concorde. So, as the Concorde travels at the speed of light, our "hero" (played with utter stupidity, George Kennedy) opens the cockpit window, then reaches out through the glass to fire the missile! I am not a rocket scientist, but it seems that his hand would at least suffer from the wind. Then towards the final "culminating point" when the Concorde heads for a certain disaster and everyone dies, a passenger turns to his fiance and offers him the wedding. It turns out that a priest is sitting in the next row and getting married with them as the planes crush! (I do not invent anything) Wow, the guy who wrote the script must have sniffed glue for a week.
