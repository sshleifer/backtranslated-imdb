As a deceased writer and Jewish Orthodox woman, this film has left me terribly dead. The dialogue is used and useless, the characters, too engaged in replicas going from the most prosaic to the most melodramatic, are not allowed to extend to truly textured individuals. The one-part musical score tries to fill the lack of sensuality by plunging into silence to separate the viewer and the scenario of a long catatonia. <br /> <br /> As a teenage revolutionary on a perverse tirade, this film is blown away by the wisdom of its revelation - patriarchy is wrong - and completely squanders its energies by hammering on this point. The resulting artistic crime is a complete lack of imaginative development; the moral crime is the reduction of human beings to caricatures: martyrs and grotesques.
