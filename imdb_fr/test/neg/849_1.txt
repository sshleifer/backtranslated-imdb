The Italian scam of Mandingo and The Drum is an Italian life badly nicknamed on the thread of the plantation. Many people who do not seem to belong to the southern United States wear poorly designed costumes and wander around places that look nothing like the southern United States. The plot has something about the romance between a rich man and a certain young woman, the jealousy that ensues and the tragedy that ensues. The film promises hot and wet sex and a lot of twisted violence, but nothing really comes from anything, it's all teasing. All this is probably insensitive to race, I could not notice since his artistic bankruptcy. The last turn is at best laughable. A major turkey.
