The quality you will probably remember after watching The Big Knife is how claustrophobic it is. His rhythm is sacrificed to a texture of uniform dialogue. It's talkative to the extreme. Modern viewers will feel that everything is said (and then some), but the film does not move or does a favor to the viewer and changes the scenery. It's very inert. After 45 minutes, I was sure I watched two very slow hours. My besieged answer was, "God, where are you going?" It looks like Odets was getting paid by the word ... <br /> <br /> It's a good place to note the decline of the drama from its heyday in the 1940s to the creation of Film Merit projects was rediscovered in the 70s to disappear again. Here, Steiger, Lupino et al. and the movements of the camera are pre-arranged to cope with a jam too much practiced. This is due to the rise of the method; the unfortunate tendency to sacrifice all the other merits of the film, to grant the actors their most selfish wishes. "Very good acting", ho-hum, killed the thought in the movies. <br /> <br /> Jack Palance's forehead and pompadours retract and advance each time he reacts to something. It's annoying. <br /> <br /> It's a terribly boring thing.
