I made the mistake of buying this because I collect comic strip movies. Even at $ 6 it was too expensive. I thought there might be campy fun in it, a "so bad" it becomes a good mood maybe, I was wrong. I had watched it a long time ago and I could not remember it anymore. Now I know why. I was bored and looking for distractions to do something else. I'm for power, punk attitude and absurd humor, but Tank Girl does not work at all. The scenario is bad, you do not care about the characters and the humor is rather weak, with the exception of some funny characters. Special effects or locations are mediocre or often replaced by comic panels or animations too jarring with respect to the actual action. It's as if they do not have the money to shoot cool stuff and have used drawings, as cool as they are (an uncensored animated feature film would be a lot better for Tank Girl now than I think about it). Action scenes were lame but not fun. The tank itself was far from impressive or dynamic although it was decorated in an interesting way. In fact, the best action scenes involving the tank were in animation. <br /> <br /> It contains interesting songs from well-known artists such as Bjork, Hole and Portishead, but instead of improving the mood, they simply do not fit in most of the time. Once, they even got into a ridiculous song and a dance number that was just crazy and horrible. I think that's when I totally lost touch. I guess Tank Girl, played by Lori Petty, seems to play the role of punkette but beyond her "attitude" and replicas sometimes just fun, she is more two-dimensional and superficial than the worst characters of bands comic. Jet, played by Naomi Watts, is probably the only saving grace of the film and it is amazing to see how such a good actress has been involved in this mess. Malcolm McDowell was not so bad at playing his role as usual villain. This film may be a cult film for some, but consider that it is really different from the original independent comics and that the creators were disappointed by the film (see the entry of Tank Girl on Wikipedia). <br /> <br /> Rating: 3 out of 10
