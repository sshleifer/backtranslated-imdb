The One is a very aptly named name, mainly because it looks like at least the only network show in prime time watched just by more than one person. <br /> <br /> I told myself "Weee !! Another show of sung songs! We do not have enough!" and then began to tie my helmet and run home by beating my head against blunt objects and sharp angles. Because, in all honesty, the constant pain and suffering throughout the year caused by the presence of one or two reality shows based on "talent" is simply not enough. We needed another one. And not just any - "THE" One. The one with slightly less attractive competitors with a little less talent. The one with a few less points, although it is difficult to imagine a scenario in which this is possible. The one with useless images of competitors when they do not play included. Because I care about what Johnny Sings-a lot does during his off-hours! I really do! Now, you may think, "Hey, all over the North American continent, less than 4 million people watched the first episode, does not that mean it's nil?" Well, I would say that fewer than 4 million people in North America have syphilis, so sometimes a small number of people bring good news, do not they? Think about it. <br /> <br /> In the end, The One is perhaps terribly unoriginal, a show that even the broadcast network could not bother to promote because it also realizes how useless it is, not syphilis! Yay!
