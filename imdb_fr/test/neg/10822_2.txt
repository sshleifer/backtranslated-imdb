A mixed group of experts (explorers, divers and scientists) enters a basement and then another submarine to an even more remote location, where they find salamanders, giant albino moles (?? ) and some big razor fangs, Computer-generated winged creatures are hiding around us. The cave is sealed by a landslide, then the monsters attack and start killing everyone as they search for an exit. And that's all she wrote with this unambitious effort that fails even to combine action, science fiction and horror at the most basic level. Imagine if someone gave $ 30 million to Sci-Fi Channel filmmakers to make a big movie. This is exactly what the cave looks like. almost surprising in his sometimes incompetence, full of clichés and almost entirely dependent on special effects to entertain. The only difference is that they had more money to build sets, more money to polish the monsters and more money to hire supposedly professional actors who give dreadful executions anyway. Otherwise, things go as usual. Some of these movies are always fun to watch. This one is not and there are many reasons why: <br /> <br /> 1.) He takes himself far too seriously and has no sense of humor. So you get a completely original and predictable movie that does not even recognize how original and predictable it is. <br /> <br /> 2.) The opening sequence is useless except to kill a few minutes and add to the redundancy. <br /> <br /> 3.) Non-original looking CGI creatures do not impress anyone in this day and age. <br /> <br /> 4.) The use of shakycam and quick editing for your horror scenes is simply a lazy and unimaginative film making. And why further obscure the action by making things too dark AND by adding distracting distractions, such as fire and bubble explosion? This makes these scenes not only difficult to see, but also impossible to appreciate even at an unthinking level of action. <br /> <br /> 5.) Even if he wants you to take it seriously, the script is full of clichés, the dialogue is awful and there is no attempt at characterization. Embodying brilliant scientists and seasoned explorers of 25-year-old dummy-looking dudes is perhaps a feast for the eyes, but it completely kills the credibility of a film that otherwise plays out completely. Sorry, you can not have both. <br /> <br /> 6.) There are two exceptions to the sample rule, as they decided to choose an old man and a medium sized Joe. These are the first two characters killed. <br /> <br /> 7.) For a bit of diversity, they also locked up a black and a Chinese. Strangely, neither of them really has a voice in this film and remains in the background as Whitey discusses what their next move will be. Insulting. <br /> <br /> 8.) In addition, how many films should be shot in which a black character sacrifices his life at the very end so that the Warm White Lead and the Warm White Lead are brought together at the end? Ugh. Give me a break already. <br /> <br /> 9.) A big part of the acting game was HORRIBLE. Cole Hauser's performance was completely laughable. The other male character seemed to have left the stage of a Soap Opera and used the patented alveolar smile technique that makes all the ladies, which is the kind PG-13 switch equivalent to my- big-tits-all-purpose technique. -the-guy-swoon often used by ladies in R-rated movies. In any case, his performance was completely recalled. Daniel Dae Kim (from the television series "Lost") and Piper Perabo also trapped the room with their stitched and monotonous distribution line. <br /> <br /> 10.) Was the end of a joke? Absolutely terrible. Please, my God, we do not need a sequel to this trash. <br /> <br /> So, basically, I would not bother with this one unless you've never seen a monster movie before or if you're really desperate. and the only other thing is "The Simple Life". The sets were good, the blue picture is correct and some actors (Lena Headey, Marcel Iures ...) did their best. So I decided to raise the score one notch to a "2".
