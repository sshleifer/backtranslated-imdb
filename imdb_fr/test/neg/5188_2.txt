on this quagmire of mediocrity? You are so much better than that. <br /> <br /> In simple terms, frostbite is worthless. Bad action game (and I use this term vaguely), minimalist "plot", sophomoric humor, and dull snowboarding. There are not even enough demonstrations of female pulchritude to elicit the persistent interest of socially incompetent men, but men with red blood. <br /> <br /> Top Gun had spectacular flight sequences to watch. Days of Thunder had a thrilling race. Even Point Break had parachuting scenes under his belt. Frostbite has none. It's not worth wasting your time, my time, that of Traci Lords, Carmen Nicole's, nor the time of anyone involved in this destruction of celluloid that would have been perfectly usable for something that was worth it. he had not been wasted on the recycling center. <br /> <br /> The world will be better if we forget that frostbite has always existed.
