The war in the East, as the Germans called it in the Soviet Nazi conflict of the Second World War, was a war of annihilation on the part of Germany. 90% of the German army fought in the Soviet Union. Their ultimate goal was to eliminate the so-called "subhuman" (Untermensch) population and colonize the mostly empty country with German settlers after their victory. <br /> <br /> Read "Hitler's Willful Executioners". <Br/> <br /> The German army is presented here as an innocent victim and not as a Nazi mass murderer. When will modern German filmmakers be honest and face the past? <br /> <br /> See the Russian movie "Come and See" instead!
