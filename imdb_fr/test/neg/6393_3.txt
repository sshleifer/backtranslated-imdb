Yes, I know the girls are hot and the scenery is charming, but for someone who knows the place, it's hilarious. <br /> <br /> If you want a little precision, it's not a film to rely on. It starts with the flight from SÃ£o Paulo to Rio aboard a 747. This will never happen with the 400 km flight. Smaller planes, such as the 737 or the A-320, shuttle between the two cities every half hour. The drive from the airport to the house, if marked on a map, would reveal a complex zigzag back and forth. Perhaps the producers have tried to emulate one of the most popular routes of taxi drivers in front of tourists. This is not a local habit, as I myself have been scammed in very serious places like Switzerland. Girls, yes. All Topless. It's something a stranger will never understand. Brazilian girls will be happy to exhibit 100% of their amazing bodies at samba school parades and wear almost no bikinis at the beach, without ever going topless. A handful of beaches throughout the country will allow it. All carefully isolated and out of town. Oh, the interior design! the incredible wallpaper ... maybe in Disneyworld ... Apart from that, it's very entertaining and, yes, Demi Moore is absolutely gorgeous.
