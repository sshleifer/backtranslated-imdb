When I sat down to watch this movie, I thought it might be slightly good. but no. It was a movie OK, not good, but not bad for most, but you get to the end and it loses all credibility. they should have just left, then dead. they did not leave the last piece, it made no sense. If they had something to say at the beginning of a plane crash, yes, but we did not do it to make it work. the first bit is OK and I give them the credit, but the rest is a useless and useless plane if you're thinking of going to watch this movie DON "T, it's awful, rent something that is really worth I'm giving it 2/10
