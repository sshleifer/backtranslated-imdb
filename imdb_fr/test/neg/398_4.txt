The opening of MORTE A VENEZIA looks like a musical video of Duran Duran with classical music and is the highlight of the film. <br /> <br /> "In terms of what is Theo?" <br /> <br /> In terms of everything, but especially the excitement. I doubt there was ever a slower but slower movie than this one. Yeah, all right, it's a European art film, so I did not expect Charles Bronson to kill hordes of villains, but I was expecting something, if not a real conspiracy <br /> <br /> The film revolves around Professor Gustav Von Aschenbach visiting Venice. Gustav goes to Venice and makes a gondola, Gustav eats in an expensive restaurant, Gustav looks out the window of his hotel and if it's exciting, you want Gustav to have a flashback <br /> <br /> Pretty badly if it was the whole movie but it gets worse because Gustav notices a teenager teenager. So you have an older academic who is looking for a teenager he has seen, an old queen is obsessed with a stranger. Great idea for a movie? I do not think so either and I thank him with all my heart. It is always a gagged party instead of a sleazy precursor of gay porn. <br /> <br /> I notice that many people who rent this movie have tried to intellectualize it. I can only be monosyllabic and unpretentious in my opinion and say that the only underlying I could understand was Gustav's physical and emotional disintegration, but that was not caused by the erased beauty of the teenager - this was caused by watching such a boring and ostentatious film
