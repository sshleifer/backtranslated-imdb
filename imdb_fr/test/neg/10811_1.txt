I was like that when I came out of this "movie". I could not leave because it was in a film festival and the cinema was full of people. I was stuck in the middle. Trapped. <br /> <br /> The tiny fragment of the original sequence that tried to link this movie features some of the worst actors who have ever played on the big screen. The girl was a remarkable performance - stand out in the wrong way. <br /> <br /> Cinematography was hideous, consisting of a disjointed framing and a light among the strangest I've witnessed. </ <> Regarding archive footage ... well at first ... <br /> <br /> Wait. <br /> <br /> Why do I watch this movie? Why do I recognize its existence? Please, do not look at it. Do something useful with two hours of your life and go watch the paint dry.
