Our story: Two US Navy divers searching for silver coins hidden under the ocean off the Philippine coast. Our proof: an extremely dull entertainment at its best, without intrigue. Jim Brown is completely lost, as long as he helps to produce this war turkey of the 70s. Richard Jaeckel is in its usual form. Don Cornelius and Richard Pryor are among those who have especially thanked their contributions! BOMBS FAR !!!
