I give "Flashdance" the lowest score of 1 in 10 because it's nothing more than a series of music videos with a short film surrounding music videos, to make a feature film. Since when does it count as a film? Jennifer Beals plays Alex Owens, an 18-year-old budding dancer, who, incomprehensibly, is a welder at a Pittsburgh steel plant. It is not a profession that most older women find, let alone 18-year-olds coming out of high school. Meanwhile, at night, she works like an exotic dancer, who never takes off her clothes, in a greasy bar called Mawby's. Yet, looking at the well-choreographed and well-finished routines that girls do every night at Mawby's, one would think they were working at the best casino on the Las Vegas Strip. <br /> <br /> Alex ends up having a predictable romance with his boss, Nick Hurley (Michael Nouri), who is about twice his age. After having resisted Nick's advances, because going out with the boss is not a good idea, she does not waste time going all the way with him after their first date. Alex and Nick make no effort to hide their working relationship, which makes no sense considering what Alex's colleagues might have in mind. <br /> <br /> When Beals is not doubled for many dances In the film, his character spends most of his time throwing tantrums. Alex's dream is to audition at the prestigious Pittsburgh Conservatory of Dance. Unexplainably, when her boss / boyfriend helps her to pass the audition she dreams of, she starts a temper tantrum. She angrily tells Nick that she is not doing the audition because of her intervention, and then leaves her car in the middle of a crowded tunnel. This is just a scene that lets you ask what the hell the manufacturers were thinking when they did that. <br /> <br /> Of course, Alex ends up spending his audition at the Conservatoire. She presents to the Conservatory Council a dance routine so ridiculous that one might think it was in a film sold to the MTV generation. Oh yes, it's a dance routine in a movie sold to the MTV generation. <br /> <br /> I do not think I can judge whether or not Beals can act on the basis of what I saw "Flash Dance". That's because the character she's forced to play is so badly written that I do not think it's a litmus test of her ability to play. <br /> <br /> You have to hand it to the makers of "Flashdance" though. This film is proof that the poorest films can be hidden by a delicate marketing campaign. In this case, a soundtrack and music videos best-sellers and award-winning for said soundtrack in strong rotation on MTV. If they had spent more energy writing the script, they might have created a plot and a story with characters that were close to my heart. Instead, we get original characters put into ridiculous scenes that any viewer with a functioning brain can not take seriously. A "movie" really forgettable.
