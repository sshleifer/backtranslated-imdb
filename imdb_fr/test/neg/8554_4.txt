Not the best of WIPs, but not the worst either. Honestly, I feel guilty of laughing at this movie, knowing that everyone involved had to know a minimum in their career. However, the acting, the dialogues, the absurd scenarios and the microphone always present to me every time and certainly add to its bad charm. If I'm a fan of Linda Blair, the honors (or topless) go to Sybil Danning. In addition, congratulations to Henry Silva, the only one in the cast to not play his role too seriously. While watching, the film now makes me look more closely at the character of Stella Stevens. She embodies the chief officer and I wonder if that's where Hilary Clinton decided to adopt her current look and behavior. After all, I'm sure she did not have to look any further than her husband's video collection to find this movie. Not that I judge. I have seen it myself many times and I really wonder what would have happened if Mr. Clinton had been allowed to install a spa in the Oval Office. Hmmm.
