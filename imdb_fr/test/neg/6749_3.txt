This film was shot and shot in 1987, but it was not shown in theaters until 1990. Watching this movie, I could see the good intentions it had, but I'm afraid there are not many talent or experience behind the camera. to make it work. The story takes place in California in the 1890s and some Italian winery owners are told they have to leave their land to let a railroad pass. Dennis Hopper plays William Berrigan who offered money for the land but was refused. Giancarlo Giannini, Sebastian Collogero, is proud to leave and asks other farmers to stand up and fight to conserve their land. Berrigan gets impatient and hires a gang of thugs to force everyone to leave. These criminals are led by a man named Andrews (Burt Young) who does not hesitate to kill those who pose problems. Andrews and his men kill Collogero one night and his son Marco (Eric Roberts) promises to take revenge and recover the land for everyone. Marco blew up the bridge that the railway would need and also destroyed a tunnel, delaying the project by several months and Berrigan is now starting to be heated by other investors. This film was directed by Peter Masterson and, besides "The Trip To Bountiful", he has at best an uneven career in directing. He's a good actor, but here he seems to be above his head. It was a film that desperately needed more attention for the details and it's easy to see that it did not happen. The Roberts hairstyle is perfect for the 1980s but is supposed to be 1890! The director of photography is Toyomichi Kurita who ended up being a good cameraman, but it was only his fourth film and he certainly had not learned everything at that time. It's not at all a clean film and I noticed in several shots during the day that the sun was wide and the scenes just did not have the sharpness that could have contributed to the general appearance. The scenario is just a story of revenge and no surprise takes place during the course of the film. We know that Giannini will get it and it just seemed a matter of time. The cast is first rate and they do their best but the whole movie seems to be uninspired. This was announced as Julia Roberts' first film, but I'm not sure that's the case. She could have appeared in a movie called "Firehouse" before that.
