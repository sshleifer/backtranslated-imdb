Some friends of folklore have recommended it, but as a film, it really lacks originality. I found that the characters were unflattering stereotypes, and the plot is predictable almost from the beginning. However, if you like traditional English / Appalachian ballads, your interest will be maintained long enough to hear the next. I also read that the soundtrack does not resemble the music of the film, with professional musicians replacing actors.
