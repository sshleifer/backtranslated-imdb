A bit like Paul Newman and Steve McQueen with their race car films, it looks like a "jollies" project for Robert Redford, who climbs up and down the mountain under the sun of the Alps. <br /> <br /> The story is as light as powdery snow with David Chappellet, a boy from the small town of Redford (what kind of main name is it?) Who, looking at the price of Olympic glory, puts his nose, in no particular order, in his coach, father and teammates. Women are only a secondary sight in her island world, as evidenced by a rather disturbing scene with an old girlfriend in her hometown, then her selfish-petulant pursuit of, above, a free and independent woman, played by Camilla Sparv. The ski sequences are perfect, with good stunts involving many bumps and scrapes on the slopes, but their effectiveness is diminished by our subsequent knowledge of the state-of-the-art television coverage of ski events to the present day. In addition, I am not convinced that the Winter Olympics have the same mass identity with the general public as the summer games. So when Redford finally wins his gold medal in the last reel, I really could not be so enthusiastic for him. another. <br /> <br /> Of the actors, Redford, best profile forward, does not need to do much and does not have much to do, while Gene Hackman does better with a content also low. Mrs. Sparv is doing well as the main female interest that treats Redford well in the same chauvinistic way as any other woman. <br /> <br /> In truth, the dramatic tension is missing throughout the sequence. do not compensate completely and you do not care about the main characters. One of those movies where the actors probably liked to do more than the viewers.
