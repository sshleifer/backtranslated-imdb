It is a series often used, but it really summarizes this film ... "If it is the current state of gay cinema, we are really in trouble". I saw this movie at the SIFF because of the high IMDb rating (7.6) and if there was a case of stacking votes on IMDb, then that's it. Just watch the number fall during the weeks of release of the film. <br /> <br /> An easy scenario ... A boy discovers that his ex-high school student (his boyfriend) marries one of their friends and returns to his old hometown (always with an old flashlight). 10 years) to see what happened. <br /> <br /> First of all, I liked "Latter Days", the director's last feature film, despite his cook cutters and plot plots, but you're supposed to become a better director every time new release. I do not know how you get horrible support performances from so many TV veterans (Robert Foxworth, Joanna Cassidy, Tori Spelling), but he did. The writing was Lifetime Network quality (a long time ago, they were REALLY bad) and the situations were incredible AND incredibly hard to watch. I kept looking for a nonexistent remote control to move quickly, but I finally got guarded to the end, hoping for a decent end. Ugh ... no. Even the free male nudity that appeared during the movie was so blatant that it seemed to be there to keep people in their shoes. <br /> <br /> To be honest ... the 2 main roles, especially in the free nude scenes, were gorgeous. There was also a sweetness between them when their friendship was reborn as they discovered how they were separating. And the movie looked great ... good quality and saturation of the colors of an independent film. <br /> <br /> How is it that networked TV can broadcast week-by-week superb weekly entertaining episodes (such as "Ugly Betty", "Desp. Housewives", etc.), but so many feature films in similar genres can be as bad as that?
