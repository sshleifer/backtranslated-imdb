I'm a fan of the old SCTV program of the late '70s and early' 80s, and John Candy was one of the main reasons. He had received very funny characters and was just hilarious. Unfortunately, he could not get those roles in the movies. On many occasions, I was disappointed by the mediocre films in which he almost played the role of "straight" instead of the funny character. "Armed and Dangerous" rarely tries to use John's comic abilities, or that of Harold Ramis, for that matter. It's just a very predictable type of movie for cops and thieves. If you're a fan of John Candy or Harold Ramis, the movie is viewable, do not expect to laugh a lot.
