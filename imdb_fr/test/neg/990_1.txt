It may be the worst movie I have ever seen, it was horribly done, it did not flow, it was very jerky, because many people did not understand the movie at all. I had to watch this movie several times before I got an idea of ​​what was going on. Okay, it's as if a kid stole someone's car and, while he was fleeing the police, he'd total it. his parents who sent him to live with his uncle in the desert, meet a girl who loves climbing and he goes into the sport and must beg his uncle to let him participate in a climbing contest, and yeah it is about it's like I'm saying horrible movie.
