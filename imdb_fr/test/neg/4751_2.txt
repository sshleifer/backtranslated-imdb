There was a time when the Alien series was a hit with even the third album, Alien 3, promising under the guild of a young and new David Fincher. The first Predator was a box-office success mainly because of its history, the star "at the top" Arnold Schwarzenegger and the director John McTiernan (Die Hard). The Alien, Aliens, Alien 3 and Predator films have all been very popular and have been very popular with moviegoers and sci-fi fans alike. Predator 2 and Alien Resurrection should have been rumored to be the death knell for both franchises, but the studios spared no efforts and saw the opportunity to bend to rumors among fans and combine the two. Step in Paul W. Anderson, Alien Vs Predator, and now the Strauss brothers (graduates in visual effects, not even directors or writers). The problem was that allowing such profound and revolutionary creations of the science-fiction genre to fall into the hands of a mediocre director and then a novice director resulted in nothing more than a profanation, characterized by incompetence. After seeing Alien Vs Predator Requiem (AVPR), the most dedicated fans will feel disgusted by the fact that this series could have been even worse. <br /> <br /> An example of the cinematic deterioration of this franchise is in the opening scene and is likely to cause nausea among fans. The film begins with an alien who makes his way on the Predator ship, springing from the predator chest, developing to become an adult Predalian and lowering the Predator ship (which now seems to have far fewer Predators on it than at the end) . Alien Vs Predator) and all this happens when the ship is still in the Earth's atmosphere. Once the ship crashed, AVPR quickly resorted to cheap conspiracy methods and basic narrative conventions. It does not attempt in any case to use the twists or subversions proposed in the two original films. The boring plot progresses at a tedious pace, punctuated only by the almost exhilarating conflicts of Alien and Predator and when that might bother us, we are treated either by a seductive blonde in bikini or by quick shots. AVPR suffers from countless errors of continuity and intrigue with little or no narrative elucidation, that is, members of the public thwart an elite military unit or the Predator who does not do not adhere to the laws established in previous editions. It is a film that completely despises its predecessors, it breaks some of the most fundamental rules of a sequel and gives the impression that it is trying to establish itself autonomously. Independently, the film has no heart, no conviction and no soul and, even with regard to other films, it lacks the most basic continuity. This is illustrated by the overall narrative of the film that undermines the basic premise of the first Alien. Because if the species had already been met before, those of the first Alien movie would have been more effective and less prepared for the meeting. <br /> <br /> On a cinematic note, the film is almost terrible. felt pushed to some places to light a torch on the screen, the light was so bad. By using such dark, dark effects, the audience may feel deceived in the action. which is ironically his goal and also indicates the lack of budget of the films. As in any science fiction, a scene normally appears as the most memorable. In this case, it is probably the scene of impregnation in the hospital, because it draws too tenuously on the themes of the original Alien by literalizing it. The staging is bad, the performance is low and the scenario is rotten. AVPR is the product of a conveyor belt system in which ideas and techniques are assembled by ineffective people, and the finished product is distributed in cinemas. This is personified by the absence of bloody death scenes and bloody battles because certification does not allow it? lower certification reaching a broader target audience. AVPR was purely a business and nothing more.
