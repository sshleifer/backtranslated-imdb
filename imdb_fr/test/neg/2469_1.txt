Two girls who can not die stay in their uncle Benny's beach house. Uncle Beeny does not like the party. But guess what? the impossible girls of death have one, yes you guessed it, a party at the immaculate beach of death. If you do not understand the not-so-subliminal message I'm trying to convey. First of all, you are a moron. I would rather watch a naked team of jello tag watching a match between Bea Aurther and Cameryn Manhiem VS. Rosie O'Donnell and Jessica Tandy. This film, and the word I loosely lose, is only THIS Damage. <br /> <br /> My note: F brioche
