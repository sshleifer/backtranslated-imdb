The film is an adaptation of a Japanese story by respected author Yukio Mishima. It just does not make the transition to a credible story about the British and the Americans. <br /> <br /> The story goes slowly, especially the part where Miles and Kristofferson are separated and the director takes pictures of the bow of the ship cutting across the waves and the small line of road shown on the maps while their letters are heard in an excessive manner. The film moves so languidly that I even make a quick advance in scenes of sex and masturbation that, although long, are really neither passionate nor erotic. The film reached a certain degree of notoriety when his then wife, Kristofferson, divorced for extra-curricular activities with Miss Miles during the filming. I guess they enjoyed the sex scenes, but it's not quite the same for a spectator. <br /> <br /> There is no character to hang on to. The sexually frustrated widow is incomparable, the little child is hateful. Kristofferson is kind enough, but he just does not have the acting skills to do much for the role, although we may not want to get too involved with him, given his ultimate fate. <br /> <br /> for the little child, well, he falls a little in the crowd after the death of his father, and they help him to trace evil against the man who enters the life of his mother. Now it's a really bad crowd. They do not just steal and smoke drugs, nosireebib. They slip a mickey to a cat and live it. This is shown in the bloody details. But of course, it's just a practice that allows them to do the same thing to Kristofferson! <br /> <br /> The film moves slowly, without any character, and when something happens, it is pitilessly morbid. <br /> <br /> The end is about as unsatisfactory as any movie you'll ever see. <br /> <br /> All this could have made sense if the locale and Japanese cultural context had been preserved. In the current state, it is appalling. <br /> <br />
