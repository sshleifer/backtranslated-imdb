I was extremely excited for this movie! my expectations were under control because I was reading the book first, so I was expecting differences. What I did not expect was how big the differences were. Starting with the physical appearances of the characters ... like the lack of tattoos at Channing Tantums n Amanda Seyfried not being a brunette lol but I let go ... the developments of the characters were not there at all ... you did not have time I love the character of Amanda Seyfried and you could not feel anything for her or for John when they broke up for the first time ... I thought the two weeks had rushed and hated that she was the first to leave, and then ... it took away the emotional separation ... and why did they change Tim from the book ... why did they make him a father instead of a brother and why did they make him so old and the film was missing from this intense moment where they discovered what was happening in the end (do not want to spoil it lol but for those who watched it you know what I mean) and whohyyyy ooooo wyyyyy have they changed the end ... in the liv It was heartbreaking and emotional and he emphasized the decision of the character of Channing Tatums who twisted it ... it just felt like it was a hasty end ... it was terrible ... C was the most disappointed ... the end of the book should have been exactly the same :(
