Aubrey Davis (Amber Tamblyn) goes to Tokyo to investigate the mysterious disappearance of her sister Karen (Sarah Michelle Gellar) and finds herself caught in the same mysterious fate that has killed so many people. With a group of others, she tries to resolve and end the curse for good. <br /> <br /> The Grudge 2 recaps everything from the first and only produces a few fears. The first grudge was at best an average film. The premise was correct but the acting was wood and some scenes were really ridiculous. The Grudge 2 is even more stupid and less scary than the original. In addition, Scary Movie 4 made it almost impossible to take these films seriously and I struggled to keep an impassive face during "scary scenes", which should encourage laughter more than fear. How Takashi Shimizu ruined his own franchise is inexplicable, but he managed to create a decent atmosphere. Unfortunately, he kept the movie at a slow pace with a boring group of characters and a frightening terror tactic. Obviously he made this film for money and I'm glad it failed. <br /> <br /> The scenario was pretty bad, mainly because it made no sense and they did not develop the characters at all. In the film, there were three different stories going on and each of them was somehow related to "the grudge". The connections were weak and a group of people were killed for no real reason. They do not explain the rules of the curse very well and it ended up being a bloodbath because of the death of everyone, although the PG-13 rating prevented things from becoming interesting, so even some scenes of death were rather nil. The dialogue was weak and none of the characters were friendly or developed enough for us to really care. <br /> <br /> The action was at the height of everything else and it was much worse compared to the first. Amber Tamblyn was annoying in wood. She moved very slowly to the screen and all her emotions seemed to be fake. Sarah Michelle Gellar was fine, even though she had just had a cameo. Jennifer Beals gave the best performance, she had some good scenes and was quite effective. Arielle Kebbel was fine, a little bland. The others were either horrible or just too forgettable to mention. Overall, The Grudge 2 was a disappointing sequel. It was missing many things and it was not worth watching. Note 4/10
