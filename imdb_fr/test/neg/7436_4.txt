The main problem with this movie is that he can not use Bill Murray to the best of his ability, simply because of the co-star. <br /> <br /> If it was a road movie with another comic actor, it could work. Even if they both tried to get the elephant across the country, it would at least allow them to share a fun dialogue. As it stands, Murray is talking to an elephant who can not answer with witty jokes. It basically means that Murray is talking to himself, which makes the movie more boring than it could have been if he had another character to bounce back. <br /> <br /> Children would love this movie, just because of the elephant, but anyone who wants to watch Bill Murray's scathing delivery and enjoy an excellent script has to look elsewhere.
