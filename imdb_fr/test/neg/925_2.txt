This film is an undisguised attempt to appeal to an older population aged 14 to 24 and an insult to all. I refuse to believe that this age group is as insipid as to be distracted by this useless "remake". At the beginning of the film, one of the characters proclaims: "I am surrounded by idiots". This is the decisive moment in the film, which stems from it regularly. full of clich√©s, "fears" of red herring and unexplained events, the film is also full of characters that are not quite cervical, a formula too familiar in silent horror films. and that shit "it's so dark that I do not see" stolen scenes in Chainsaw Massacre, but just boring, building no tension, no horror. It is difficult to film in the dark, and sometimes darkness is an excellent vehicle in a movie that is supposed to be live. but, in my opinion, the less we see, the better. maybe he did not want to wait until morning because he did not care, otherwise it might cost him more money to do the night scenes well, or he did not know how. who knows? Unless you've ever seen a horror movie of your life, or you're two or three years old, every aspect of this movie is predictable and realized before. warning: Paris Hilton is in this movie. enough said. All in all, it's a jaded slash movie that asks the question: where is the wax? He was treated like a lost leader. if you are bored as much as possible and all the other rentals are over or if you are simply in the mood to turn to a bad horror movie, which is not really scary, or if you would like Paris to be broken head to Paris, go ahead and take a chance. This is not the worst film I have ever seen, but if that's what the film's producers think of a younger audience, I pray they will be deceived. a for-profit film that does not seek any art or respect for the genre. you know, smart characters make a scary movie. I think it's the beginning of Collet-Serra as a director, in addition to commercials and video clips. he has another one that will be released in 2006 called Goal 2, his goal is to make a better movie.
