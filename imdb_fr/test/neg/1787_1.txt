This film is so irreparably bad that nothing makes it interesting to see. NO effect, no suspense and mediocre dialogue poorly delivered. Oh, and neither a camp nor any fear contains it. Indulge yourself and see the original Friday 13 or Sleepaway camp (preferably), but whatever you do, do not watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Even the appearance of Michele Bauer at the very beginning can not record it. Usually, in this kind of movies, you expect violence, suspense, a little gore and T & A. The violence was poorly executed, the "suspense" was laughable, there was NO gore and T & A is abundant IN THE FIRST 5 MINUTES, then NOTHING. At least one of these things, properly done, would at least have allowed to look at it. <br /> <br /> To say at least one nice thing about it, Buck Flower is great, he seems to be the only one to understand that he makes schlock and justifies it well. If everyone had that tone, it would have been fun, no pun intended.
