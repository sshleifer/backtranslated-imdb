In the 1940s, Veronica Lake experienced a meteoric rise to cinematic fame thanks to its sensual beauty and its highly exploited "peekaboo" hairstyle. She has played alongside big names like Alan Ladd and Fredric March, recording hits on screen in such films as "This Gun For Hire" and "I Married A Witch". She has also stood firm with female stars and she even surprised her detractors with her portrayal of naval nurse in "So Proudly We Hail". But times are changing and her own failures are catching up with her, and by the end of the decade her hour of glory is over. With two unsuccessful marriages behind her (and two others in her future), Veronica headed to New York, where she occasionally made appearances on television and in the summer film before disappearing completely. This was briefly great news when she was found working as a waitress at a second-rate hotel in the early sixties. But now, his longstanding alcoholism and years of hard life had robbed him of his appearance. Without them, public interest in her soon faded. She returned to the scene in various vehicles, but her success was minimal. Finally, she moved to Miami, Florida, where she lived in relative darkness. In 1966, she went to Canada for a role in an obscure film entitled "Footsteps In The Snow", which was not published in the United States. The following year, she was discovered by industrial filmmakers who had long wanted to produce a commercial feature film. They approached her to play in the movie "Time Is Terror" and convinced her to invest in the project. As one author wrote: "If ever a movie queen had a terminal comedown, that was it." Surrounded by amateur performers and pathetic production values, she did not even manage to reach a minimum level in this fast-paced film from Miami, Florida. Appearing quite ordinary on long shots and aged in close-up, poor Veronica did not act as if she were walking in her skin. As a deranged doctor, who has come up with a successful youth restoration formula, using flesh-eating flies !, she looks both bored and confused, her most unintentionally hilarious moment to come when she is forced to step aside while struggling with rubber gloves. The supporting actors are of no help, they simply advance the plot by talking to death. The director Brad Grinter apparently only asked the actors to move while the camera was directed at them, no need to look like entertainment (There is certainly a hilarious scene involuntarily involving a private detective / nurse and a corpse in a chair Previously, the film was put on hold for three years, because no main shot was filmed, according to Veronica herself. But in 1970, the production company brought them together, changed the title to "Flesh Feast", and published it to take advantage of Lake's recently published biography. And because former personalities such as Bette Davis, Joan Crawford and Olivia De Havilland had unexpectedly relaunched their careers in horror movies, this parody was portrayed as Veronica's "return film". This seems strange to filmmakers, however, as it is unlikely that the (young) audience of a horror movie of this quality knows or cares about who Veronica Lake was. As expected, Veronica had no impact on her career and she died in poverty three years later. A previous reviewer cites a scene in which a detective working as a secret nurse in the doctor's laboratory (watching for body theft in a nearby morgue) uses a multi-talented driver to cut off the body parts. "Poor Mrs. Lustig," she sighed. "I hope she will not care to leave her body to science." "Try not to think about it," advises the driver. "I guess you're right, Hans." concludes the detective / nurse, "What is done is done." What a sad end of career for a star that we still remember very well.
