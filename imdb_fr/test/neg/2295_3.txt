This splashy Swedish film tries to parody / imitate American horror movies such as "The Evil Dead", "Gremlins" and others. Screenwriter / director / actor / director Anders Jacobsson and screenwriter / producer / actor / makeup effects supervisor Göran Lundström (did I miss something?) Were visibly inspired by Sam Raimi. But the work of the camera is a bad copy of what can be seen in "The Evil Dead" and elsewhere. Other users have written that they appreciate the humor of this movie, but not me. <br /> <br /> The film disturbed me rather than entertained me. He's trying to combine suspense and comedy, and the end product just leaves me feeling oppressed though it's neither scary nor shocking. The combination of different genre elements made this film very strange. I never knew if it was supposed to be scary or amusing. <br /> <br /> The story is quite inventive, apart from the confrontation at the hospital, but I did not like the way it was staged for the reasons mentioned above. . The effects of gore and makeup are considerably good and at least the sequences of "Loose Limbs" were quite funny because in these scenes, the filmmakers did not try to mix scenes of fear and jokes. <br /> <br /> All in all, a strange movie that you will hate or love. Stay in pieces, Evil Ed. <br /> <br /> My rating: 3/10 (made me stick to American productions)
