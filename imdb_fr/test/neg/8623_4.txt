The remake by George Sluizer of his own movie - superior - is a total waste of time. Why was he even tempted? Kiefer Sutherland plays Jeff Harriman, whose girlfriend (Sandra Bullock, who spends a very short time on screen) is kidnapped at a gas station by Barney Cousins ​​(Jeff Bridges). Now, Barney is described as the kind of guy no one would trust a month on Sunday - he hangs out like Frankenstein's monster but without sympathy, and the Bridges game is totally horrible. Sutherland seems a little better when his character becomes a detective with the help of the new love interest Rita Baker (Nancy Travis). <br /> <br /> A major problem with this version of "The Vanishing" is its obvious need to respond to the Hollywood audience by avoiding the dark end of the original movie. Here the end is happy, which seems forced and unbelievable, and completely destroys the story. However, at this point, the damage is done and Jeff Bridges turns the villain into a huge laugh.
