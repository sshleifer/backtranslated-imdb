The tug-3 is absolutely right. Although I'm sure Mr. Osmond wanted to make a heartfelt and comforting Christmas film, this one is as cynical and scary as they come. The religious significance of Christmas is forgotten and replaced by cute kids, clueless adults and nasty villains. The values ​​of the production show that it was shot adrift or by really inexperienced filmmakers - I suspect the latter, unfortunately. The worst, oddly enough, is really the music. One would think that someone with a long-time musical career could do better than the title track, but you would be wrong. Even my mom did not like this movie and she likes Osmonds AND Sappy stuff.
