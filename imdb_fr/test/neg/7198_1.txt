This is one of the movies that killed the western "spaghetti". Not only does he lose something in the translation, but so does a total mess of editing. Pieces of it have been edited and / or reissued for an English language version. In any case, it makes little sense, point to the line. This makes the films "Trinity" and Eastwood "The Unnamed Man" look like John Ford / John Wayne. Nothing in this film is original. Somewhere, there is a beginning, a middle and (finally) an end. Except for the end, everything is not exactly in that order. Robert Wood seems pretty nice. The rest of the cast, especially the women, should have made better career choices.
