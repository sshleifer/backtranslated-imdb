'' Queen of the Damned '' is one of the worst adaptations of a book to a movie I have seen before. The only thing I like in this movie is the soundtrack, nothing but that. (Since I'm a fan of Korn, Marilyn Manson, Linkin Park's Chester Bennington and Static-X's Wayne Static) <br /> <br /> There are so many mistakes and bad choices that I do not even know how to start. So many stories have been told, such as the legend of the twin (one of my favorites), the relationship between Armand and Daniel and even that Louis is not present, to name a few examples (the plot was dead). Vampire Lestat '', because it's the second book after '' Interview with the vampire '', not '' Queen of Damned ''. They tried to put together so much information in one movie that you ended up getting nothing unless you read the vampire chronicles. <br /> <br /> So many significant characters do not seem to have a real importance in this film. . This is the case of Pandora, for example. <br /> <br /> The actors they choose to play all the characters do not correspond to many of Anne Rice's descriptions, especially Marius, supposed to be a beautiful, tall, imposing blonde-eyed blond guy, like Lestat. (Stuart Towsend is also far from being like Lestat) I did not understand why they had changed the maker of Lestat by becoming Marius instead of Magnus as well. <br /> <br /> "The Vampire Interview" was a great movie, I loved the actors and Tom Cruise, because Lestat was PERFECT and much better than Stuart Townsend (I'm sorry Tom Cruise refused opportunity to play again Lestat). Far superior to this shitty film entitled '' The Queen of Damned ''. <br /> <br /> Anne Rice was so picky about Interview that I did not understand how she had just sold the rights of this terrible production.
