What's really terrifying about this is that filmmakers thought they were creating something clever and sexy. Instead, they probably made the most stupid horror photo of the year! <br /> <br /> This film begins with a group of artistic friends in a gallery. This strange European nut comes up and starts talking with the main character of a pretentious fruity, giving the impression that he just got out of an episode of Dark Shadows. He then offers him a stick to smoke (yes, a great stick), with which she accepts with enthusiasm! He picks up some red shit and puts it in a spoon so she can free herself! If this happens to you in real life, do not do it! <br /> <br /> She is transported in a strange nothingness Jean Rollin who is supposed to be sexy but who is not, where is this thing which looks like a rotten creature of the black lagoon! <br /> <br /> Soon, she turns all her amateur sleazeball friends on her new form of supernatural crack. It does not matter how much these idiots panic and turn blue, they can not escape in hell. At one point, she even comes out with the rotten creature! <br /> <br /> After the final battle and the stupid vaporized woman, the so-called hero remains alone to put away his copy of Michael Moore's Dude Where. My country and can not resist smoking this stick once again to try to save her weak friend. What dope. <br /> <br /> Gives four stars to unintentional humor.
