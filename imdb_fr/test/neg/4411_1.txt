I know it's not original, but what is it? What else can we say about this? I feel incredibly stupid in not paying any attention to "From Hell It Came". The film shows that the important political and social issue of the fallout from atmospheric atomic testing may seem like a joke and dismissal topic, not the alarm and alarm raised by scientists around the world at the time.
