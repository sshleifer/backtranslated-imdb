(This review is based on the English version) <br /> <br /> The unfinished legendary epic of Orson Welles was simply that - unfinished. It should have been left as is, and not in this clumsy and boring compilation of all available material. <br /> <br /> Even though I'm sure it was done with the best intentions in the world, the filmmakers not only did not do justice to Welles' vision, they also managed to discredit by inflicting this version on the public. <br /> <br /> The first thing that strikes the viewer is the amateur quality of the sound. Not only are the newly dubbed voices rather mediocre, but also inconsistent: Welles' original recordings (using his own voice, as he often did) were kept in a handful of scenes and they do not match at all. There was not the slightest attempt at coherence. Add to that an extremely empty sound mix that has only a minimum of sound effects and atmosphere. A long sequence during a big festival (including the bull race) gives the impression of being recorded in a deserted suburban street with about three people making the noise of a crowd that must have been thousands. <br /> <br /> However, the real problem is the inevitable fact that "Don Quixote" was incomplete and it was obvious to observe it. The film consists of a handful of scenes chained and dragged to ridiculous lengths just to make up for the time that passes. Example - the sequence in which Sancho looks for Don Quixote in the city drags on. It's just Sancho approaching people in the crowd, asking the same questions over and over again - it's impossible that Welles ever intended to use every shot in its entirety, but that's what it's all about. which appears here. This lasts more than twelve minutes, when in fact, it would most likely have lasted about two minutes maximum in a final version of the film. <br /> <br /> While the beginning of the film is relatively complete and rather well done, the rest presents huge holes that simply can not be filled by an endless layering of the Spanish campaign and others pictures of Don Quichotte & Sancho back and forth. There is no end either. No resolution, no conclusion, no punch, no comment. <br /> <br /> Although some documents in private collections are inaccessible to filmmakers, it is impossible to account for what would be necessary to make them a complete and coherent work. Welles just did not finish shooting, largely because of the death of his main actor before he could even finish. <br /> <br /> However, aside from the fact that it was not complete, and could never be, one would think that just seeing a collection of footage of this masterpiece that could have to be enough. Unfortunately, by assembling all this in such a rudimentary way, we end up with a very negative impression of the whole film. In particular, what was clearly a superb performance of Akim Tamiroff as Sancho is completely ruined by the new voice and long stretched scenes that ultimately make it just irritating. <br /> <br /> Orson Welles' vision for this film was something much more ambitious and complex than a simple story in Don Quixote's story, but that's what was attempted here, and as such, the point is lost. The only person who could have gathered all the material into something interesting would have been Welles himself, and he did not do it. <br /> <br /> The images could have been much better used in a documentary chronicling the entire saga of Welles trying to make the film. Welles himself even proposed the ideal title for such a doco: "When will you finish Don Quixote?"
