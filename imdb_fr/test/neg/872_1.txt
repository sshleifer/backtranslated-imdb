We thought it was one of the worst movies of all time. I had to volunteer to watch the end. The romance was not credible. the characters were not developed; The love story made little sense. it was a bad idea; and the scenery was absolutely stupid because it was either (in my opinion) like the Adam family going on vacation ... just scary, gnarled and nerdy; and the OUTERBANKS do not generally look like these houses on the waves; and who would spend the night in one during a hurricane if it was not theirs. Also ... it was not realistic. The hurricanes warn you to close the hatches. <br /> <br /> The friend was also superfluous; and does not fit the story What did the Civil War have to do with the Peripheral Banks anyway? I must also mention the wardrobe ... D. Lane had to have a scarf / pashmina / shawl in every scene? It was exaggerated. She looked good enough not to have to hide things; without making them obvious as with light pants. <br /> <br /> Finally, I'm concerned about the impact on our landfills when everyone has to get rid of this stupid movie, and I mean the movie STUPID !!!! Do not fall for the hype on this one !!!!!! We were doing. Not even watchable.
