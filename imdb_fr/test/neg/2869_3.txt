I like CKY and Viva La Bam, so I could not resist that when I saw him for £ 1.99 in Gamestation. This is the first scripted film by Bam Magera, written by himself and Brandon Dicimaillo, and featuring the CKY team (Ryan Dunn, Raab himself, Rake Yohn, Jenn Rivell, Don Vito, etc.). ). Brandon is also responsible for the art direction - which is one of the film's biggest merits - his pretty CKYish color style - but which is also showing progress. <br /> <br /> Basically, he follows (very vaguely) Ryan Dunn's break with his girlfriend Glauren (played by Jenn). Vilo (played by Bam, named after Vilo Valo by chance?) And Falcone (Bran) play his best friends who wreak havoc by performing various stunts. <br /> <br /> It's a bit like CKY movies but with a linear scenario (which is very basic) and bad game It's strange, usually super charsmatic gangs seem to have lost their lives when they know what they mean afterwards. <br /> <br /> The acting and the screenplay are pretty awful for most, but Half of the movie is way better than the first movie (90 minutes is pretty long for the movie), and There are a number of redemptive factors, such as Tony Hawk's cameo, Dicimaillo's secondary intrigues such as 'The Futuristic Invention Awards' and 'The Diamond Bike', the soundtrack is also very strong (this is not ALL cKy and HIM - in fact, Bomfunk MC steals the movie in terms of using music). In the second part of the film, the fun is much more real - especially since Don Vito plays a fairly important role in this last part - and he seems to steal all the scenes in which he finds himself. <br /> <br /> The film will appeal to those who love CKY antics, but only because of the basic material and not bullshit. Oh, and will anyone tell Bam that skating montages, especially in movies, is so 1998. <br /> <br /> However, the best part of the package on the DVD is not the film - but the 40-minute shoot 'doc. <br /> <br /> The final 20 minutes of the documentary deal with Raab Himself's alcholism and the real feelings of team members towards each other. problem and Ryan Dunn appears as a very good down-to-earth guy). The last ten minutes of the documentary are devoted to a friend (an uncommon CKY member) who tries to kick the heroine while staying in the Magera household with the crew - and a caring unitary group ( including Ape and Ryan) - a surprising gem in an otherwise dull DVD. <br /> <br /> For £ 1.99, I am very satisfied - although I hope Bam will stay in the short improvised sketches from now on.
