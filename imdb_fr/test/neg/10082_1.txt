How could those who liked the previous JP movies even sit for an hour of drivel? There are so many stupid things in this movie that it's amazing !! I remember that when I went to see JP child, it was my film and my favorite franchise: the acting, the SFX, the music, the staging! JP2 in my opinion was quite the same, apart from some really stupid moments (like the gymnast who kicks a raptor..please!), But overall a viewable cinematic experience and reasonable. <br /> <br /> But the third has no sense !! Carry is supposed to be a sequel to JP2 and yet, it magically adds new elements to the franchise that would have been impossible to miss on the 2 previous films! for example: 1) The "new" Mega Spinosaurus - Seriously, what's the hell !! This thing follows them wherever they go, they can not escape its presence and yet in The Lost World (the same island), do you see it once? do you mean? does anyone even mention it? NO! It's ridiculous!. The star character in the 2 previous films was, and will always be, the T-Rex, so what will the director of (urr) "Joe Johnston" do? Kill him! as soon as you see the huge T-Rex in all its splendor, it is killed and you will never see it again - a new Dino in town is the excuse .. where does it come from !! !! not a single explanation! and do not get me started on this satellite-phone-in-the-belly-dino thing! 2) Just when you start to realize how stupid Spinosaurus is, you see the Raptors. Aside from their new haircuts "punk", they seem pretty believable! * Phew * they will make this film watchable non ?? FALSE! now they talk to each other !! and the excuse for them to speak in this film and not in the first and the second are ... wait ... evolution! - Yes, the process of millions of years in a few months from the end of the second film, amazing! snarling, they should have developed opposable thumbs and created tools now !! OK, I'm not going to say more about the plot because it's coming up to me, so I'm going to finish on this: Jurassic Park is a classic, JP3 is a punch for the biting back for one original fans of the series, my favorite franchise was dead after watching this monstrosity (no pun intended) Avoid this movie as a scourge
