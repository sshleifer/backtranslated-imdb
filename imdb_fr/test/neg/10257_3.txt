The delivery of many lines seems to be an unnatural distraction for some actors. The lighting also seems to be a problem, although the faulty view could explain my frequent folding. And if you watch this film, be open-minded enough to accept elements that no zoo or circus would want to reject: it is the terrestrial and underground creature that feasted on dozens of campers near an empty manor house. Louisiana. It's the discovery of a trio that is sent through their print media to investigate deaths. Then two of them disappear and the survivor is part of another trio who goes hunting. Eureka! I just realized what one of these "special circumstances" would be - unconsciousness.
