With No Dead Heroes, you get stupid replicas like this one, because you have to watch this catastrophic action movie to be believed. William Sanders is saved by his friend Harry Cotter during an extraction in Vietnam but is captured by the enemy. Ten years later, Harry is now a Russian brainwashing agent with a mental control chip implanted in his brain. His new Russian boss, Ivan, played until Nick Nicholson's obscene guard. I would add that not only did he not try to speak with a Russian accent, but he looked more like a Kentucky pump attendant with stained teeth. What is even more absurd is the fact that he was also the coach of the dialogue for this film. Soon William is re-recruited by the CIA to hunt down Harry. He teams up with Barbara, a freedom fighter who has infiltrated Ivan's camp in El Salvador and who is soon blowing up half of South America. Some scenes are so horrible that it's a wonder why this movie does not have more worship. One of these scenes is the sudden love of William and Barbara in the jungle, accompanied by the most inappropriate background music I've ever heard. Who would undress naked in the middle of a South American jungle? There is a rape scene that uses the final theme of Blood on Satan's Claw. No Dead Heroes is the champion of the magic bullet movie of all time, a shot making several casualties. In one scene, Harry puts his rifle behind a rock and kills seven guys. I had to rewind and count. Hard to find a film that has recently benefited from the MGM Full HD processing. Follow this film and watch it for the stupidity that results.
