I was impressed by the movie watching the specials and I went to watch it. FDFS The film was horrible to say the least. <br /> <br /> The first scene is good and until they go to London, things are funny but slowly the pace slows and nothing funny about it <br /> <br /> The subplot of Manoj Joshi is funny in places, but it is undesirable and adds to the boredom <br /> <br /> The part on the drugs is funny especially the monologue of Govinda <br /> <br /> The film continues aimlessly, as a young child has written <br /> <br /> The interval brings a twist to the story but I lost hope <br /> <br /> The second half-time starts well, but the way things are handled is a mockery The entire angle between Arbaaz and Jackie is half-cooked. How is it that people do not identify them? <br /> <br /> The climax is rather funny but stupid <br /> <br /> Priyadarshan is not his element at all. From this film, he began to make craps and his films went bad The music is good, SIGNAL, TERE BIN stand out and AFREEN too I'm good <br /> <br /> Akshay Kumar has white stubble and looks old, but he plays well this role that he has played many times but thanks to his natural comedy, things seem bearable. Govinda looks bad, badly His act, except that the monologue is boring, is too surprising from Govinda. It seems too urgent to come back and Priyan can not use it. Paresh is ok in places, but overall, the repeated act, Manoj Joshi, is funny, but Sharat Saxena is acceptable. Shakti Kapoor is awesome Jackie Shroff looks overweight and acts in his sleep Arbaaz Khan is bad Lara Dutta screams of glory but fails to act
