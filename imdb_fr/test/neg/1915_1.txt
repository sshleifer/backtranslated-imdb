I do not know why I do not like this movie so much. Maybe I'm too old or too masculine or too much. Just who was the target audience here? If you like it and have enjoyed it, I'm happy for you. Personally, I found it a bit like a pill. The characters were uninteresting and inimitable, the screenplay was simply embarrassing and some of the actors, without being totally inspired, were not inspired. Mawkish, tedious and sometimes nauseating - there is surely something better. <br /> <br /> On a related topic: why is it that every time I see Chris Klein in a movie, I want to slap him? Does anyone else have that?
