This movie is a laugh and a half. From the first scene, where we have the appearance of Mel Torme as a big and bad muffin gang leader driving jaguar herring (and it's a real laugh), to the latest image of Mamie Van Doren, now an angelic teenager rehabilitated on leaving the prison (a loving girls' house run by iron fists), you can not stop shaking your head. The distribution of this film is a derisory list of Mel and Mamie to the talented Paul Anka (all I wanted for almost all this movie was that he stops singing!) And to the king of teenagers of forty years, Dick Contino. Gloria Talbot, playing a teenager without humor with more than a few blows (judo, not playing), I saw her for the last time in the terrible puff Leog Woman of the 50s misogynist, with a hairstyle so bad she looked like a dead marmot crushed by a Mac truck. <br /> <br /> Granny is a bad girl. She smokes, swears, struggles, strikes teachers and walks with gang leaders. She drops her boyfriend driving Jaguar, Chip (whom we see in the first scene trying to rape a blonde, before he falls from an adorable guy), and begins to sit down with Dick Contino. The question is whether it is a step forward for her. Mel shows up at a party she is attending with her newborn and accuses her of pushing the nasty Chip from the cliff. Although I'm sure she would have liked it, she was not there. It follows a stupid fight scene between Contino and his band and Mel and his crazy jazz, with hilarious and unpleasant movements on both sides. <br /> <br /> Granny ends up being sent to a girls' town, a reform school..errr. ..loving home for erring girlss..run of Sister Iron Pants and his sisters correction. It annoys the nuns (and ourselves) arguing, throwing accursed curses and just showing how bad it is. She quickly runs into Gloria Talbot, who plays one of the girls who misbehaves, who gives him a quick tug to show him his place. She meets a soft noodle of a girl obsessed with the character of Paul Anka (why?). This little drip becomes his "henchman". <br /> <br /> There is a long stretch of film where not much happens, except that St. Paul of Anka continues to show himself and prove how holy he is. He sings too much in this interval, until you want to hit him in his huge snozz to silence him! And Grandma's little sister, interpreted by the glory of the best-fathers princess, calls her to tell her that she has problems. It turns out that it's a sister who went out with the Chipster, and now Mel's singing her because she found out. The girls are all rushing to save her, with a hysterical battle scene between the girls and Mel and her boys. it's after a race between Mel and Dick that is so stupid that it's staggering. Teens overflowing with this nerdy movie have a fabulous, fabulous time romping through a fundamentally silly, misguided and morally moralizing movie, which has no purpose if its goals are not fulfilled, unless its goal is to make you laughing out loud.
