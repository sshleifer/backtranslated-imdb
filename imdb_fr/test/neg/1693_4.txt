A very resistant but ultimately harmless film version of the children's literary classic that incorporates an animated part of the style of MARY POPPINS (1964) and BEDKNOBS AND BROOMSTICKS (1971). The human cast is very distinguished - James Mason, Billie Whitelaw, Tomlinson's David, Joan Greenwood, Bernard Cribbins - but their roles range from miscast (a 69-year-old mason incarnated as a chimney sweeper thief!) To the unknown (Greenwood as a confused aristocrat) to the strange (Whitelaw plays several "exotic" characters - including a circus performer, an old witch, a maid and a fairy - for no apparent reason). <br /> <br /> The animated segment of the film, run by a group of animators from Eastern Europe, is not inspired, it is rather pleasant in itself and, as usual with these kinds of things, there is an assortment of songs to bear, one of which is often too often taken up for one's own good. The film was directed by the famous actor Jeffries, who had already directed (with much more success) other children's films, including THE RAILWAY CHILDREN (1970) and THE AMAZING MR. BLUNDEN (1972, which I have not watched myself but was published some time ago on R2 DVD by Anchor Bay UK).
