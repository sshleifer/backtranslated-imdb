This film has no respect for the viewer's time. It takes 15 minutes and lasts 95 minutes. To achieve this, they must use a very slow narration and let everyone run with frenzied and implausible anxiety. At the time this film showed something interesting in the plot, I did not care. The problem is not in the acting, but rather in the stimulation. The story is just weak. Jim Carrey is a capable actor, but his attempts to inject light humor into a serious role are simply misplaced. His style of humor is not generic, so it appears as a diluted version of himself. The number 23 causes a lot of grief and frustration in the characters of the story, but its justification is never logical. At most, it's slightly interesting. Jim Carrey has many more abilities in a serious role than what the film reveals. Do not waste your money seeing this in the theater. Rent this movie if you have trouble sleeping. If you are still awake after 10 minutes, you liked it better than me. I did not like the lighting and the artistic aspects of the film. Many passive visual effects were thrown at the viewer with lights or effects, which did little to improve the already weak story.
