Regardless of whether the predominant social message of this film - that self-defense justice is acceptable - is justifiable, I am more insulted by McConaughey's closing statement. In a drama in the courtroom, the final statement of the defense attorney is at the heart of the film. When the problem is as difficult to solve as this one, the statement is really passed on to the public as well as to the jury. This basically implies that the public considers the rape of a white girl as a crime more horrible than that of a black woman. For my part, I find that very insulting. For the rest, I found the game of actors reasonable, except Sandra Bullock, who seems to play his usual sparkling self (it does not really work in a court drama), but what is the purpose of the film's message? who is poor? like this one. It tells you that justice is acceptable, and accuses you of racism if you disagree.
