=========== BIG SPOILER ================================ This is a movie terrible without sympathetic characters. So many clichés and crazy scenes. He needs a good publisher, but there may not be any more films left. Please save your two hours. The only decent and unpredictable scene of the film took place when the younger brother refused to prevent his brother from killing himself. The description said "moments of black comedy". Maybe I missed those when I blinked. The horrible characters just start with the funeral. The people attending the funeral laugh and complain about the food during the burial of a very young man who committed suicide? Then, the father does searches on the only son who remains? Just at the funeral? How is it that the next door neighbor whose husband cheated on her with the character of Sigourney Weaver is the bad guy for telling the husband? The father does not even know that his son can play the piano, although everyone around him seems to know he is a great pianist. The film tries to transform all possible dramatic clichés into one film: a father who drives his athletic son to success, a dysfunctional family who loses a son chosen to suicide, the son who feels lonely and lost, drugs, business marital, a child conceived by an affair but raised as a son of the husband, incest, homosexual tendencies, intimidations, possibility of terminal illness, etc., etc., etc. Do not waste your two hours.
