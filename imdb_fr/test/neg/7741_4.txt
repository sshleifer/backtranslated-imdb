I watched the MST3K version of the movie, and this review includes minor spoilers. <br /> <br /> When I started watching this movie, it seemed like it could have been promising as a sci-fi movie, but the more I watched, the more disappointing it was. The first reason is pretty idiosyncratic - I liked the shy girl with glasses much more than the model that Wanda became at the end of the film. More deeply, it is the fact that the loss of glasses and the change of clothes replaced the real growth of the characters. Instead of becoming a self-care person, Wanda depended as much on men as she did on everything she did at the beginning of the film. The game could have been better (although I was tired of cracking for the voice of Ireland - they were even in the movie itself! It's not that bad.) The background was ok, but it was a little hokey (aliens = humans with makeup), and could have used more explanations. <br /> <br /> Maybe it was just that I was interested in the movie itself, but Joel and the bots did little for me. The film might have been better without them. <br /> <br /> Overall (for the film itself, not the MST3K), a 3 out of 10. It was a good movie, for what it was.
