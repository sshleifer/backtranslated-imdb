As you can read, the only positive comment about this movie is made by someone who actually looks at it IN HIS CHURCH! <br /> <br /> Anyway, the movie had a good start in science fiction, everything was there to make a good movie entertaining and easy to watch, then everything felt in this mode of washing Jesus' religious brain will save everyone. <br /> <br /> The story begins with 2 main characters, 2 reporters, but it quickly gives the star to this monster of Jesus who is there to save the soul of everyone with this disordered attitude. <br /> <br /> In a few words: this film goes from entertainment to brainwashing in about 30 minutes <br /> <br /> Loss of time, waste of money ... AVOID
