What did Rajiv Rai do? One day, a successful director of movies like Tridev and Vishwatama is doing one bad movie after another. At first, I was excited that Rajiv Rai would be back in the action genre, but it quickly failed. As a fan of Rajiv Rai, I thought I should at least try but I left after an hour. One of the reasons I left the film so early, so the amount of Pakitchhingh in the movie was not part of Rai's previous venture. Rajiv Rai Another disappointment was the music. Rajiv Rai has always had good music until now. There is only one good song and it is Tere dekh dekh Ladgayan. The performances are not up to par, not even Rai Loyalist Naseer-Uddin-Shah. Preventable rate of once my favorite director.
