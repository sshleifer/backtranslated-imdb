Any horror film that projects Robert Englund (Freddie Kruger!) Then kills him 5 minutes before the start of the credits, must be immediately viewed with suspicion. <br /> <br /> Tony Todd (Candyman!) as a tour guide in the marsh (his vocal imprint of James Earl Jones is hysterical by the way, I do not know or I do not care if he tries to to be funny but I laughed). Unfortunately, his role was 5 minutes. More reasons to suspect and rightly so. <br /> <br /> Mercedes McNab (aka Buffy & Angel Harmony, I had to watch her to see what I remembered but she's half naked!), Marcus the symbolic black guy (not another movie for teens) plays a comic role that is not really required in a horror movie unless it is meant to be a travesty. <br /> <br /> Joel Murray (the brother of Bill Murray & Pete of Dharma & Greg) plays Shapiro, the guy who turns the video on the gonzo with the 2 pretty girls. While doing a "Spooky Swap Ghost Tour", the two main male characters meet other people, run aground on rocks and have to leave the boat. So, they are now all isolated in the marsh at night, in the rain. <br /> <br /> Once the true story of Victor Crowley was told (his makeup looked like Sloth from The Goonies), we determined he was dead (Well, you will not come back from having hit the skull with an ax!) Once the old man is attacked, despite shooting his gun and having a very clear shot, it takes more than 30 seconds for Marybeth to start shooting at a guy who pirate an old man with a hatchet. Is she stupid? It's 29 seconds too much! In terms of intrigue, it does not really exist (sorry, I do not consider the psycho-dead as a conspiracy, and the stimulation is also very bad.You have a slaughter, runaways, a slight relief, then a slow dialogue before starting the cycle again. <br /> <br /> After an extremely long scene investigating a rickety bush with a raccoon, Victor reappears (with a sort of power tool) and kills the black-haired pornstar, reaches he also slice the tour guide in half with a shovel? Once Misty was left alone to watch Ben, I felt it was obvious that she was going to die (I was right, but you did not no chance to see it) <br /> <br /> Filmmakers? The rain will NOT extinguish the burning of gasoline, OK? Idiots! Of course, after the 2 near-accidents in the cemetery, Marcus was on the not to die and Ben had been wounded at the foot with the spades, but they had ussi to find a boat after impaling Victor on the spades. <br /> <br /> She had stuck in the water by something invisible, he tries to save her then she is suddenly pulled into the boat by Victor and screams and the film ends abruptly. <br /> <br /> Yeah, just like that. No idea if Ben was dead (he seemed to miss an arm) and no idea if Marybeth was going to survive and what happened with Victor. <br /> <br /> It's a terrible ending and without a doubt my verbal attack to the filmmakers have removed the latest criticism. So much for freedom of expression, huh?
