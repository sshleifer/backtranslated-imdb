I found "Shuttle" an incredibly frustrating movie to watch. He starts well enough and quickly advances to the first "injury" (which is a doozy). After that, he becomes very lazy and writes as a story. This was the case of the plot leading the characters and not characters leading the plot. If you hate movies for which you can not understand why the characters do what they do, you'll hate "Shuttle". In particular, the last act is strange and seems to occur in a world without common sense. Also at the end, one of the characters confessed to a crime passed on to her friend, rather than generating sympathy from the audience, most people started laughing. It was probably because the "heroines" of the story were complete idiots. Finally, there is an end that seems "shocking" and comes from the horror school "people are bad, the public, so accept it without any explanation". <br /> <br /> "Shuttle" is neither good nor bad, but mediocre and boring.
