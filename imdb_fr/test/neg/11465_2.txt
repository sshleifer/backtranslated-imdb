I just saw that at the cinema. I did not read the books. There is nothing new about this movie. <br /> <br /> the bad guys seem to die with some lashes, no matter how many times our hero has been stabbed with a big sword, he continues to look the same (ish)! There are several action scenes but they are very wrong. the filmmakers seem to have the impression that whenever they can not bother to choreograph a fight scene, they move the camera closely, move quickly and put on the music ......... This leaves me again jostled. <br /> <br /> I admire them for trying to tackle a dark story without the usual Hollywood cheese, but I'm sorry to say that the filmmakers have failed miserably. The characters are in 2 dimensions. We have barely learned to know them or appreciate them. The chef has a charming peasant accent oo arrr ..... although it seems he does not have much to say ... <br /> <br /> Do not worry about watching this unless that you do not get bored and that you did not understand it at half price of blockbusters ....
