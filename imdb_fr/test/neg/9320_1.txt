I do not know about you, but I'm going into horror movies to be scared and it was anything but scary, the movie has had several opportunities to be really scary and has failed miserably EVERY TIME! Some of these supposedly suspenseful moments have been haunted by some of the worst CGs you'll see this year, maybe a decade! I mean when I say that the CG looks like daytime television, I give a bad name to the daytime television, I've seen better things on the science fiction channel. What I really regret is the actors (who have their names associated with this movie). They did a good job. I was interested in most characters and felt that their performances were pretty good, but that was not enough. take this film out of the gutter. What's really fun is the reuse of certain decorations. If you have seen "exorcist: the begin", it will be easy to spot the reuse of some buildings. However, what I thought was the worst thing about this movie, even above the problems of cg was the main demon, it was just not scary anyway, its shape, its way of talking, it was extremely bland. All in all, this movie was a horrible experience and I would be out of the theater if there had not been my wife who wanted to see the end.
