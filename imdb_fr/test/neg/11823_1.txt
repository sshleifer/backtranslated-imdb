It must be one of the worst absolute movies I have ever seen in my life. Writing and playing are only pathetic. Uncle Sam is one of the best movies of all time. However, when I see stories like this that are able to go to video, it really inspires me in the pursuit of my crazy dreams of making movies because I know I could do a better job than the ones that manufacturers Killers did.
