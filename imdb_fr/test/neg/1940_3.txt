Bam Margera's celebrity Jackass is back with his own reality show. Not only is she not as funny as Jackass, but she's also incredibly stupid! It must be one of the most stupid shows ever conceived. Of course, there are some worst reality shows, but none are so nasty or stupid. <br /> <br /> Bam Margera did it all, and her parents decided to pull her piggy bank out of her glory. Bam and his parents, his uncle and his idiotic friends all live together. Although Bam and his friends manage to break nonsense and argue, his parents are usually stupid at home. When Bam's parents are not lazy at home, they are tortured by Bam, especially his father. To add to the humor, we treat his big uncle, Don Vitto, who is constantly away from it and never pays attention to him. <br /> <br /> This show is really like an attenuated version of Jackass ... tonic In the sense that there are no stunts, Bam and his buddies will just break things, do lame stunts , and meanwhile, loud music plays to make it even more impressive. It's not funny at all. I can not imagine a more silly show than that because there is not an ounce of intelligence found here. <br /> <br /> If you are a big fan of Bam Margera and want to see one of the many follow-ups / sequel to the Jackass series. <br /> <br /> My note: * on ****. 30 min.
