This movie was on pay channels today and I had nothing to do so I had it on. It must be the worst football movie ever made. It must be one of the worst periods of cinema. The premium service on the cable system has a rating system, and they have given 2 out of 4 stars. This movie is not even half a star. Bad game, Scott Bakula sinks as usual, Larry Miller ?? Sinbad, could not act if he tried. The liners of Rob Schneider are completely stinky. Fred Thompson should be embarrassed that he is even in this movie. The only good grace for this movie was the hope that Kathy Ireland was naked in the shower, not even close. A waste of time and complete film. If we could give a negative number, minus 9.
