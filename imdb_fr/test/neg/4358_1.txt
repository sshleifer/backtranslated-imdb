I really hope that the authors of these "movies" read these reviews so that they know that people just do not want their films. These are just rubbish and embarrassment for the horror of murderous clowns. It does not matter whether it is better or not than the first one does not matter, because they are both terrible. I'm surprised they did not learn the lesson from the first movie. Stop now!! Warning to horror movie watchers, DO NOT WATCH, RENT OR WATCH THE "URBAN" HORROR BOXES AND ESPECIALLY, DO NOT BUY !!!!
