I saw that with my kids, they love it but I did not get crazy like crazy in the song. But what's going on in this shitty movie, she was hit by the sled, that's why why, when my kids heard the floor, they thought it was good, but we looked at them, they were like this: "Daddy, why Granny", that's how my kids say grandmother. sled "I told them that the movie was nil" looks like Goths & in the song they found grandmother on the floor I think she died in the song, but in this strange rotten film she left I think they should take this show OK everyone would like this I give it a 1 out of 10
