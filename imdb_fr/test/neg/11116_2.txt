I did not like this film for so many reasons that I can not even say everything. I thought it was badly done, because of the whole story. I mean who will believe that they captured the chupacabra and that he escaped on a cruise liner. LAME!!! It was good for a movie lame right at the video, but it was not worth spending money on it. I can not believe anyone really gave this film to ten. But I guess there are people who like this movie. I gave this movie a 2 instead of a 1 just because it was chupacabra and the guy was out of lord of the rings. If you want to watch this movie, I'll stay at home and wait for him to come on a science fiction channel. Do not waste your money watching this movie. Believe me.
