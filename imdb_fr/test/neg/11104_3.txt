Everything is my fault. They all told me I should avoid seeing this movie because I'm a big fan of the old TV series. They were right. While the production values ​​are good and the actors themselves (including "not looking now") Julie Christie are not so bad, the entire movie displays a shyness and self-awareness that are clearly without justification. A comparison between Karloff "Mummy" and "The Mummy Returns 2000" comes to mind. In fact, Belphegore 2000 owes much more to new Mummy movies than to old series. But then, the script is terrible, the speed is zero and sometimes the film is full of involuntary jokes (the first scene in the tomb looks quite stupid), the cats being clearly projected while they are supposed to jump ). Belphegore moves like a statue on wheels neither impressive nor frightening and the psychological drama that took place in the old television series when the heroine had to learn that she is a villain is completely neglected. This film is so wasted (waste of money, wasted actors, wasted plan) that it hurts. A lower-than-normal scam that will only please to laugh, but has nothing to do with the classic Greco (she also has a small role in this movie - in the graveyard).
