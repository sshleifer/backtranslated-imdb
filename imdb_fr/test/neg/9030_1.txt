Okay, I've seen over 100 Troma movies and some of them are pretty bad. "Sizzle Beach U.S.A." It was horrible, and "I was a teenage TV terrorist" was unassailable, but it's the worst movie in the Troma library! <br /> <br /> A group of women are held in a prison and tortured while trying to escape. <br /> <br /> It's really terrible. Even if the exploitation films go. Doris Wishman and Hershall Gordon Lewis would probably kill the director if they saw this poor excuse for a cult movie. Avoid this movie at all costs. <br /> <br />
