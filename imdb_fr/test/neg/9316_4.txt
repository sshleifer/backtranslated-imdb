As long as you enter this film knowing that it will contain no historical fact, it's not bad. <br /> <br /> It's tied with "Hercules: The Legendary Journeys" by Sam Raimi. as for plot, acting, humor and production. You will see the similarities in several places. However, most fight scenes are not as successful and the film suffers. <br /> <br /> Jack Palance controls the screen as well as ever, and at no time do you feel he gives less than his. level better. Same for Oliver Reed. The problem is that their excellent performances make Don Diamont's less than stellar acting talents even more awkward. The perennial player Cas Anvar was also very good, playing a character a bit like Salmonius in Hercules mentioned above. <br /> <br /> If you liked the low budget movies about sword and witchcraft from the early years will probably enjoy this show too. In fact, it's unfortunate that they associated the name of Marco Polo with this one. This really has nothing to do with Marco's life, contrary to the expectations of most people who will want to watch this movie.
