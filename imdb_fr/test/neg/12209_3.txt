Although I love the story of David Copperfield, I can not claim to have enjoyed this film. It was probably the second worst film I have ever seen. One problem I see is that the scale of the novel requires a miniseries of several hours, rather than a regular movie. It's simply impossible to capture a significant amount of events that unfold in history in two hours. I do not take advantage of the flashback format. It was disjointed and it would be impossible for someone who did not already know the story to understand well. In addition, I do not think the filmmakers have correctly interpreted the personality of Copperfield. The idea that he walks on a beach groaning about his life seems to run counter to the proactive and forward-thinking nature that Dickens has given him in the novel. Agnes also bothered me. She appeared as a sordid house decoration rather than a strong woman. Dora was perfect, though. This film was full of pitfalls and I look forward to someone making a decent version of the screen.
