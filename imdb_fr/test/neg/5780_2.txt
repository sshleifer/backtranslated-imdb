Alexandra Maria Lara: A very beautiful and seductive woman, but not a good actress. In all the films in which I saw her, she seems to me to be exactly the same character. Whether in THE DOWNFALL, NACKT, VOM SUCHEN UND FINDENEN DER LIEBE and now WO IST FRED! She is still (plays?) The young woman with a good heart, a little naive and who does not know how to handle what happens to him. She has a repertoire of probably five different facial expressions with which she works extensively. Personally, I find it hard to believe that she can play a mysterious and slightly odious character, because it's just not there. She is therefore considered the nice girl next door, what she is, but, again, she is not ready to play acting. Til Schweiger: Same thing! The film: downright stupid. Since it was an American film, it would have been a great role for Adam Sandler, whom I do not like either. I was not offended by the fact that it was a film with disabled people, I just thought that the resulting jokes were not funny at all. I laughed two or three times, but halfway through I was bored and angry and wanted this movie to end.
