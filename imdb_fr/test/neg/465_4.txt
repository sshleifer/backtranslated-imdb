I must say that I was not impressed at all, probably because I was expecting a lot more from this movie. Perhaps a focus on religion vs. science or the meaning of life, not just a few lines. So, if you are waiting for something to think after watching this movie, do not do it. It's more psychological than philosophical. I vote 4 because of the end, it clears up a bit and because I have a lot of respect for BBC documentaries. There are some very interesting scenes that made sense. It was a brilliant idea to add it in a film about the theory of evolution, a shame that it is not the main subject. Oh, I just forgot to say that for over an hour, the movie is pretty boring and somehow cruel.
