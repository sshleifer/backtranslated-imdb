I have a friend who works at Blockbuster and he gets 5 free movie rentals a week. So one day, as we were walking down the aisles looking for something interesting, I came across 18 Kung Fu Weapons and, judging by the box, this film sounded rather awesome, but we nevertheless gave way to temptation and praised it - after all, it was free ..... and thank goodness it was .... it's by far the worst movie I've ever seen .... the budget was to be a pickle and a string ... the plot was ridiculous, the only mention of the "18 weapons" is that there is a book that teaches how the 18 weapons are used by a villain - and that's all! there are not even any weapons fighting in this movie ... that and the action sequences are simply BAD ... 9 times out of 10, the punches and the kicks of the other guys arrive at one foot of the landing, and there are many times the movie skips images (result of a ridiculously mediocre editing) ... the dubbing is too laughable, and it is hardly understandable .. and we will not even get into the acting game. ..the end will certainly let you say "wtf ??", however to be fair, I must mention that the fighting techniques used by the actors were a little decent, and that the old man is a crazy idiot .... But that's about all. ... fortunately, I did not have to pay for this movie, but I guess at least now I know exactly how much a movie can actually be ....
