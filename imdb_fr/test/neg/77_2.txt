OK, so my resume line is cheap stuff. But the film is full and it is absurdly praised, so ... <br /> <br /> I saw this one on TV (not cut, because the TV shows all the movies, it's for you Americans who would say I do not like it because I saw a cut-off version for television (thankfully, it's only an American thing) and I had no idea what it was I turned on, I took the last minutes of a show and the film began and after a minute, I implored it was a comedy, given the particularly ridiculous beginning of the shots (yes it's a bad film in the film, I know, but what a way to interest the viewer I do not do it I do not even know why I have not changed channels.) And indeed, the film turned out to be a comedy, even involuntary. <br /> <br /> Marina Zudina is pretty, but that's what a terrible performance! naming a stranger in the role is smart enough (she does not speak beyond the language barrier), however, sorry Marina Baby, playing muted does not mean posing as Harpo Marx. Her game is unintentionally funny in many moments, just watch it when she draws an X in the air while she is hunted down by the killer. He wants to kill you, this is not the time to play Zorro. We have a lot of things that "run upstairs" that pass for tension, like in the worst slashers, and things like pulling a rug and a bad guy pulling each other. Ugh! Will Hollywood ever learn? Still, the best / worst pearl is having a guy electrocuted in a bathtub and ... Well, I've never seen anyone being electrocuted to death in a bathtub, but I'm sure you can not see them cartoon blue rays in real life, do you? And how about immediately trusting a nasty guy because he claims to be a cop and does not ask him to show you his credentials? OK, so he turns out to be a real cop. Nevertheless, not asking for the badge has no meaning (in terms of plot, one could always think that the identity information might be wrong or be a dishonest policeman.Screen Writing 101). And what about the big twist? Do not tell me you did not see it coming 300 km ... <br /> <br /> I'm sorry for poor old Alec Guinness and his useless camcorder. Now, I think about it, why give him a credit "Mystery Guest Star" ... in the titles END? The movie is over, there is no mystery, and everyone and his brother have identified Guinness (even moviegoers will recognize "the old man of 'Star Wars'"). Better yet, we can pretend that this is not the great deceased actor. <br /> <br /> People continue to compare this to, Hitchcock, the most popular people. I suppose it must be John Hitchcock, the milkman, because the late Sir Alfred would feel embarrassed to look at it, let alone do it. And that gets a 6.8 / 10 ???? This is the material of the bottom 100! But then we are talking about a ranking system that allows the "Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King" to appear as the third best movie of all time (see Top 100), so ... <br /> < br /> 2/10.
