************* SPOILERS BELOW ************* "Night, Mother" is the story of Jesse (Sissy Spacek), an epileptic woman Divorced Calm announces to her reckless mother (Anne Bancroft) that she is going to commit suicide. This is a fascinating principle that is emptied of all vitality and excitement. The brilliant hook turns out to be a cheater - the story that follows lacks substance, gravity and revealing value. Where are the shocks and surprises as mother and daughter have what can be the last conversation of their life? Where are the revealed secrets, the confessions, the fantasies and the regrets? They are here, but they were all painted the same dull color that keeps the emotion in the background and celebrates the "genius" of the playwright Marsha Norman at the expense of everything else. The result is not a film, but an exhausting endurance test. <br /> <br /> Let me begin my comments by saying that I find that Sissy Spacek is one of the greatest actresses in the history of cinema, a woman so magnetic, so natural that she continues to surprise me and marvel after twenty years of celebrity. She brings a touch of class and magic to everything she does, and I saw her rescuing more than one movie from the wastebasket with her angelic face and vulnerable eyes, her soft voice and her sweet smile . It's because of the excellent Spacek that I saw this movie in the first place. For one of his films to be terrible, he must fail significantly. This film fails on two. <br /> <br /> First and foremost, the film is so faithfully adapted from Pulitzer's award-winning play that it is claustrophobic and repetitive. The whole film is a dialogue of two women between Jesse and her mother. What worked on stage: a mother and her middle-aged daughter argue for two hours in small movie scenes. A room, regardless of its size, must be * adapted * to the screen ?? it is complacent and arrogant to believe that dialogue is so perfect that it can not be changed at all. The scenario for this film could have been shortened from thirty to forty pages and an experienced screenwriter would have given the brilliant Spacek and the experienced Bancroft * physical * sequences, facial reactions, enough to break the yak festival wall to wall and in prison as one set. It is not surprising that the screenplay was adapted by the original playwright Marsha Norman, who perhaps knows the theater, but turns out to be ignorant in the cinema. <br /> <br /> I can not emphasize enough the effect of the scenario. on the film. Watching Jesse and his mother arguing about Jesse's impending suicide is redundant and boring. The women enter the living room in the kitchen and return to the living room where they start again. A tiny Midwestern house is not the perfect location for a single-shot movie and the director never tries anything clever or original, he never tries to break the monotony with an outdoor shoot or a cutaway or a flashback or whatever. There is no music, no other characters, no other stories ... just two women covering the couch cushions and discussing their opinions. The reverence given to the piece is disgusting ?? even the most solemn classics of Shakespeare are shaken for the screen. The commitment in the original game seems almost naughty ?? it is as if the film was made solely to document the dramatic treasure of the play, after reflection by the public. <br /> <br /> The other reason for the failure of the film is Anne Bancroft. She may be a good actress but in movies where the presence represents 80% of the performance, she rarely seems to go. She's definitely not suitable here, playing a Midwestern grandmother but more like Mrs. Robinson before her morning coffee. She pursues Jesse around the house, looking more upset than stunned, and seems extraordinarily unfriendly, even though her replicas evoke a loving, albeit imperfect, woman. <br /> <br /> Sissy Spacek is always good, honest and honest. open and so good that you understand and accept the choice of his character. Sissy lets us see that Jesse is a flat tire, the wrong turn of a woman who has had all the difficulties and made too many bad choices. She has never had control of her life, and her suicide will be a way for her to finally say, "No more, that's where I get my footing." That's how she says it anyway, and when is Spacek talking ?? you listen. She proves in all her films that a good actress does not have to behave like a man, that she must be bluffing, bravado and borrowed testosterone. In this film and in films like "Coal Miner's Daughter", she quietly demonstrates a gentle force and a tranquil depth as impressive as it is hypnotic. you can not help but fall in love. <br /> <br /> That's why it was so hard for me to watch "Night, Mom". Spacek is wasted in a cascade of movie that is never used to engage or even distract. I would not recommend this movie to anyone except Sissy fans like me, and even then you will be disappointed. I give the movie a full letter bonus for the end, which is brave enough to let the main character do what's right for * her * and not enjoy a happy ending. Rank: C
