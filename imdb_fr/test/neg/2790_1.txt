The first opening stage, lasting about five minutes, showed the potential to become an instant classic, with a moderation of a good action game, a good movie, a story that keeps the volume, and one in the corner a sinister screen "did you see that!" (the scarecrow moves). <br /> <br /> After the quick introduction of the story that was going to enter the present, it was as if someone else had written and directed the rest of the "film". The following scene is a basic overview of how the film unfolds like a truck on the run. Looks like the rest was shot on video, with shitty "porn actors", the scenography was a law office with virtually nothing on the shelves or anything in the office. <br /> <br /> I only remember watching shitty horror movies for a chance to see naked "girls". At the time, there were no Victoria's Secret magazines everywhere, and I did not look at what makes today's big horror movies like acting, terror, suspense, intrigue, etc. etc. <br /> <br /> It took almost fifty minutes for the first person to die. When that happened, me and my friends were so shocked by the worst costume of a "monster" EVER, we went through our popcorn on the TV screen booing.
