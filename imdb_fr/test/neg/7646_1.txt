Apparently, the film has a harsh anti-Bush message ... If that's the case (I did not understand it), that's all. It's boring and useless, not at the line. <br /> <br /> It's sometimes too serious to be a comedy, too slow to be a thriller, not funny, not arresting, not exciting, no movie. It's too much to be the opposite, and vice versa. I was amazed at how bad a movie could be. Do not even think of looking at it. <br /> <br /> I have literally watched hundreds of movies and have never been so compelled to write a warning on IMDb. Avoid at all costs. You have been warned. <br /> <br /> Even "The shooting of ..." is terribly boring. These are just people who talk about gibberish with tons of jokes inside a camera, much like a movie at home. There is even a party where a guy takes you on a tour of the food that was consumed on the set by the film crew. Still, beat the movie, I guess ...
