PEP SQUAD is at a very low point with its puzzling plot and horrible gameplay. <br /> <br /> First, let's talk about the characters. Cherry (Brooke Balderson) continues to display a scandalous and bubbling anger throughout the film, due to her irresistible passion to become queen of the ball. However, the public does not know why Cherry wants to be queen of the ball. Even before the applications are read, she goes around the school with constant disinterest to be there and shows no interest in the place or her students. Why does she care so much about being their queen of the ball? Brooke Balderson apparently has an "acclaimed" performance, but in reality, she spends all her time with an angry face, stomping on and killing people. Maybe it's just me, but I think if you give a young actor / actress a scenario that only asks him to act insensibly angry, you do not ask much. Moreover, you do not allow the character to develop very well. <br /> <br /> Beth's character, played by Jennifer Dreiling, is even worse. Dreiling shows absolutely no emotion and no connection with his character. When harassed by her director, she stuns him (after several seconds) without any feeling of disgust, shock or anything so traumatic. Her lines are read as if she were reading anecdotes on the back of a cereal box. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, the students in charge of his kidnapping sound more like they are planning a barbecue they will do with their principal, sitting in their basement. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Cherry is killing several female candidates, and no one notices or cares about it. (Yeah, I understand, the whole city is worried about the graduation party, very realistic, at least you could tell funny scenes with the cops, but maybe that's too much to ask.) For example, just after Cherry Pass near the school and shoot a handful of students, we discover Beth being interviewed by local media. The journalist mentions "the shooter" in such a way as to give the impression that no one knows who killed those innocent students, but a second later he asks, "What do you think of firearms in the hands of minors?" Or something to that effect. Where did the journalist jump to such conclusions? <br /> <br /> At the end of the movie, after Cherry kills the winning queen of the ball and the ball is over, the media returns to the stage, Beth simply adds that she "understands the need for ( Cherry) to be heard "and goes away with his friends, smoking cigarettes in a calm and unchanged mood. Nobody marvels that they have just witnessed a murder. <br /> <br /> Not to mention the students who are permanently stationed in a yellow zone and nobody seems to worry about the upsurge of violence in the city, Julie lives in a big house without parents, and the weird party at she (maybe I'm a little off the stage, but the last time I knew it, high school nights did not involve nude women dancing artistically in a pool of water while men drink marshmallows and everyone enjoys their "I'm so indie and mod" attitude), the horrible behavior of Beth's parents, with her mother overboard and her father just shaking her head at all that the mother has to say (and not in an entertaining way either), with stupid scenes such as the new black principal chasing Cherry as she tries to shoot him with a gun. Yes. Very realistic. <br /> <br /> The only compliment I can make to this film is that the photography is beautiful. The angles are flattering and the screen is very clear and clean with each shot. <br /> <br /> Too bad that the acting and the scenario are not.
