Frame! Rather annoying, and they could just as well have turned black and white, it was so colorless. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a scrolling text explaining the cryogenics and asking if God or Satan is behind. There are demonstrations outside a cryogenics laboratory. Some people rob a bank and many thieves and guards are shot. The father of one of the thieves (I think) is getting organized to freeze his son. There are a lot of jumps at the beginning of a scene to another, presenting characters without us knowing how they are told. <br /> <br /> There is a power outage and the tanks containing the frozen ones are struck by lightning and they come out. like zombies. They all wear a mylar-like silver jumpsuit, and their skin is dark green and wrinkled (they do not know why they look so bad - being frozen has apparently not preserved their appearance) and they have silver eyes. They will kill people, sometimes flickering like zombies, sometimes like normal people. <br /> <br /> Linda Blair continues to show herself from time to time, for what purpose I am not really sure. I think her character works in the cryogenic lab, but she's not very important to the plot and her role is very small. <br /> <br /> The film ends with some freeze stops with legends telling us what happened to the following characters, who are pretty stupid.
