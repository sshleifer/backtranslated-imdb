Sometimes I look back in high school and am amazed to never go lower than Marvin in this bad movie. <br /> <br /> Poor Marv is the main character whose bad luck only gets worse. Despite his intelligence, he manages to be intimidated, exploited, supports his ugly bad father and many other nonsense, including a daring robbery that, say, does not go as planned. Of course, the viewer feels no empathy towards anyone in this film, so all this disastrous gloom bounces like harmless zeta rays. Recommended for those days when you feel depressed, start this movie and you'll smile saying, "I'm so glad I'm not Marv!"
