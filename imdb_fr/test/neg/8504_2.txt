I give this film 2 stars only because of its slightly liberal plot. Without going into details. <br /> <br /> In this movie, playing in a movie is terrible. Really terrible - wooden, shallow. <br /> <br /> The graffiti presented is weak, so bloody that I can only wonder why they took the trouble to use graffiti artists. In the spray scenes, it was obvious that other people had been tasked with doing the "work". They could as well have let the actors do the picture and save a few cents. <br /> <br /> I would avoid this movie at any cost. <br /> <br /> The loco kid soundtrack was sometime Something I listened to on my iPod, it will take me some time before I can go back, for fear that this movie will come back to me. 'mind. <br /> <br /> Avoid it at all costs. Unless you think about yourself "Wow, it's been a while since I've seen a really great movie ..."
