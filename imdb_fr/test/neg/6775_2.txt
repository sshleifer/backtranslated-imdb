Let me say that this new cartoon He-Man does not destroy the memories of my childhood, because I did not like the old cartoon He-Man. I liked the action figures, but I thought the cartoon was corny and I hated the script (the He-Man I liked was the one from the very beginning, the pre-cartoons mini-comics included in the figurine boxes, where He-Man was a barbarian, the power sword was split in two and there was no Prince Adam, no Shazam-scam premise, no Orko). Anyway, let's leave the old material aside. <br /> <br /> The new He-Man cartoon (or at least this pilot) is a shame in itself, as it represents both the worst cheesiness aspect of the previous series and the worst trends these days. I watched it because I had heard that the morality of the old show had disappeared (thankfully) and that it had more swords and character development. But I met a horrible hodgepodge of the worst cliches of the genre, characters that I could not help but hate and the sadly inevitable visual style of Matrix-esque. <br /> <br /> I think it was a good idea to give a little background to the characters, because it showed a Skeletor that peeled the face, but this is the development of the character, apart from usual youth rubbish that is coming to age, which I see in the following episodes, where teenybopper Adam will learn the responsibility of his newly acquired powers, blah blah. At least in the old show, Adam was not a spoiled kid! I found myself hating his guts. That's what we get when they present an adventure show for pre-teens: pretty faces and trendy young clothes. I should check the new episodes to see if N'Sync makes a special appearance. Dude, does this series remind me of the 1996 Flash Gordon cartoon, which looks like a tiny bug! <br /> <br /> Dialogue? Ha! This stems absolutely from all the clich√©s of the book, the two-man-shoe Randor in the opening scene to the immortal Skeletor "Oh, and he himself ... I lied!" in the end. And Skeletor's voice is still the same as the old series. 20 years old and nothing we learned. <br /> <br /> And of course, nowadays, there can not be anything far away from action that is not Matrix style. Let the Japanese animate, think of new ideas. And seeing the poses of the characters during the fighting did not help either. <br /> <br /> Of course, we have our usual dose of PCness: Evil-Lyn (now I think about it, who the hell is it?) has no yellow skin now, but gray-ish. Oh, so no Asian will be offended. I bet Jitsu will not appear in the series either. Once again the 1996 FG, where Ming the Merciless was a green alien like a toad! <br /> <br /> People complain about Cringer's lack of words. I do not think I would have liked that more or less if Cringer was talking, he's pretty lame like that. And you have your cheese supplement with Orko! The shocking thing is that many of the people who (rightly) hated Jar Jar Binks were maybe huge fans of Orko ... <br /> <br /> I looked at the pilot project, and I'm tired of it. Leave the series alone. 2 out of 10
