As a Bruce Campbell fan for almost two decades, I was delighted to see his latest film on the big screen in the presence of the man himself. Unfortunately, "The man with the screaming brain" was in itself a disappointment. <br /> <br /> Located in Bulgaria - where the Sci-Fi channel produces its original Saturday night movies - "The Man with the Screaming Brain" is a Curious Horror Blend of the B-series fiction films from 1950s, body-changing comedy, violent revenge film and exaggerated slapstick with a touch of romantic reconciliation. If that does not make sense, well, the "brain-screaming" man either. Campbell embodies a CEO of a pharmaceutical company who travels to Bulgaria with his ex-wife in an inexplicable attempt to invest in the half-finished subway of the former communist country. The two end up with a former KGB agent turned taxi driver and are finally murdered by a Gypsy revenge woman. <br /> <br /> A local scientist (Stacy Keach) and his clumsy assistant (Ted) Raimi), who have developed a technique for tissue transplantation without the possibility of rejection, steal the bodies and place part of the taxi driver's brain in Campbell's damaged skull. In addition, they put his wife's brain in a robotic body they had on hand. <br /> <br /> Campbell escapes, and with a hastily handed skull, and the taxi driver's voice - whose transplanted brain tissue controls the left side of his body - echoing in his head, begins en route to search and kill the gypsy. (His robot wife does the same.) <br /> <br /> But first, there is an attempt to imitate Steve Martin / Lily Tomlin's "All of Me" when the two Campbell personalities quarrel. domination over a dinner at the restaurant. Just as he played his own diabolical hand in "Evil Dead II," Campbell is adept at making sure his body seems to be inhabited by more than one mind. <br /> <br /> Sometimes, "Shouting" comes closest to another Steve Martin film, "The Two-Brain Man," which also takes a silly approach to science fiction clich√©s from the 1950s. However, he tries too hard to get too few results, and the result is twofold for the semi-comprehensible Bulgarian film of Ted Raimi, who spends his entire time on screen. (Nothing against Raimi, it's just that he's better at small doses.) <br /> <br /> In the end, it's not quite outrageous (or funny) to satisfy like a parody, nor serious enough to enjoy Pastiche B-movie. I'm glad Campbell already left the screening when she stopped, because I was afraid I had to say, "Gee, Bruce, it's really ... something." <br /> <br /> Maybe the best thing I can do as a movie is that at least the pictures stuck to the emulsion. And it was twice as good as "Alien Apocalypse".
