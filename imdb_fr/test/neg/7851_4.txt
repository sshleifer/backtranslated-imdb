The German actor emigrated and ultra-hamburger actor, Paul Muni, who has never seen a scene he did not want to chew, will play blackface to embody a humble Mexican immigrant living in Los Angeles and making his way in the world. If this squeaky vehicle reminds everyone of Al Pacino's Minstrel performance as a Cuban untaught in the SCARFACE remake, do not be too surprised. The characters are quite similar and both become furious when the script requests it. Hispanics around the world should be deeply shocked by Muni's outrageous performance as this dizzying Mexican lives the American dream, and the consequences are cursed. I suppose Benicio DelToro's grandfather was not available. A blond whitened blonde, Bette Davis, plays one of Muni's amorous interests; she ends up going mad with love for Mr. Meh-hee-can Muni. An absolute hoot, Davis is the only reason to watch this offending racial claprap. There is an absolute delirium towards the end when Muni asks the daughter of her dream to marry her - a white-bred girl with one of those over-30s theater accents that Hollywood loved so much - and she nicknamed him wild and a brute, of "a different tribe." Muni immediately turns into Mr. Hyde and chases him to an untimely death. In the final scene, a repentant Muni tells his sober-faced priest that he is returning to his people, his people. End of the film Finis. That's all she wrote. Muni allegedly hired a Mexican general as a driver to study the speech pattern and physical habits of this exotic creature. Yowza!
