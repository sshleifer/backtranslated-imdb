Although the predominant and excessive use of the game format is fully operational throughout the film, this is not what gives up this image. It is rather unconvincing female performances and the rather tedious scenario on which the film relies so obviously too much. With an idea that had potential, the mere conspiracy is further diminished by Graham's inability to truly express the devastation that his character inevitably claims to suffer. The use of scenes improvised by all the actors would not be such a bad idea if only the two ladies could enjoy this privilege. While Downey Jr proves as always that he is a talented actor, he associates the two actresses in their scenes, which is constantly perceptible. The sex scene, useless but intense, seems to exist simply to prevent the film is too expressive to give the actors a well-deserved break. With an unsatisfactory conclusion, Two Girls and a Guy has little to recommend, aside from the great performance of Downey Jr.
