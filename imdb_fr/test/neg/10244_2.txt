I am not a movie snob. I liked a lot of movies that critics hate, and I hated movies that critics like. However, I agree with critics here: "Galaxina" is only of inferior quality. Clearly meant to be a comedy, he only has a few scattered laughter. "Galaxina" has a bad photograph; it has mediocre special effects; he has a rather bad acting quality; and the production values ​​... well, the sets could have been made of cardboard as well. <br /> <br /> "Galaxina" tells the story of a spaceship whose crew is looking for a magic object called "The Blue Star". After a long journey (and some unconvincing space battles), the crew arrives at their destination, a sort of extraterrestrial world in the wild west. There is a painfully non-funny cantina scene (clearly designed to be a parody of the famous "Star Wars" scene), a chase against space bikers and a final jaunt. <br /> <br /> Distribution tries, but can not breathe life in this turkey. Stephen Macht and Avery Schreiber have worked better in other films. James David Hinton is very good as a member of the crew of the spaceship. The late Dorothy Stratten embodies the title robot. Although she looks great, her role does not leave her much of a chance to play. <br /> <br /> You could see this movie with Dorothy Stratten. However, if you are looking for a good movie, you will probably want to ignore it.
