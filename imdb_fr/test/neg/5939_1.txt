If Andrei Tarkovsky had been a pirate, he would have directed Mother and Son instead of Mirror. It's the most pretentious movie in the world, I'm sure. A son, without name, takes care of his mother, without name. They love each other, I suppose. No, they are not, I'm sure. They are not characters. They are not even actors playing characters. At least it could be pretty, but even nature seems ridiculously retouched and changed whenever needed with a Macintosh computer. And could Sokurov have proposed a technique as banal as a ration of distorted appearance? You should have been born yesterday to buy this waste. 1/10.
