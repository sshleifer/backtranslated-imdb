The best thing about Shrieker is the dialogue. Just like Scream and I know what you did last summer, this movie is aware of the conventions of this type of horror film and manages to come up with some good lines and scenes that respect these conventions. Unfortunately, Shrieker is just boring. The plot is your basic polar of the Ten Little Indians with a monster controlled by one of the suspects / victims. You know from the beginning that each of the characters will be destroyed until only the hero (ine) remains to overcome the evil. And that's exactly what's happening. Absolutely no surprises and no tension. The values ​​of production and play were acceptable, but I had no motivation to look to the end (although I did) because I already knew how the final scene would take place. The end surprised me a bit, because it literally managed to disappear instead of throwing a bucket of special effects. Maybe the special effects budget was spent at the end.
