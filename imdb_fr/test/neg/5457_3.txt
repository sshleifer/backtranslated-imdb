A television director uses astral projection to kill people who take the form of the blue man. <br /> <br /> This dull and unambiguous horror film stays in front of you and makes you wonder why you are watching it. I sat down to the end of the film and I really can not give you more than a brief summary of its content because I kept focusing on other things. <br /> <br /> I can not really recommend that. I think my feelings are summed up by the fact that I paid a dollar for the DVD as a double film and that I feel a little ripped off.
