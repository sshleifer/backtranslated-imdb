This movie is just awful, the movie only lasted an hour and about 25 minutes of the movie was just useless snowboard clips that do not even connect to the movie. The scenario is completely "resumed", my cousin of 5 years could probably write a better scenario. I do not understand how someone could finance the production of a film like this ... horrible. It's definitely the most horrible and horrible movie I've ever seen in my life. I think the casting director just took random kids to the street to play in this movie. Realize, play, produce and write for this movie are really bad. I feel bad for people who have wasted money on funding this waste. You could not pay me to watch that shit again.
