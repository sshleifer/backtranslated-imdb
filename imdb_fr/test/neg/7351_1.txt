I agree with the user "SpecialAgentFoxMulder" to say that this episode is terribly worse than any of the series. Now, I'm not keen on many episodes of the last series but this one takes the biscuit! It was not funny and not offensive. As for the end, I'm sorry, but it disgusted me more than all the other episodes combined. <br /> <br /> I mean, the boys think they meant but the end was so overwhelming that they think the whale belongs on the moon and on the credits we see it's death. What could have saved the episode was if the jokers could confess for what they had done. <br /> <br /> There seems to be no outgoing message. Ok, South Park may be guilty of preaching too much and it's always nice to see a maverick (like Make Love Not Warcraft "), but this episode was just wrong! Avoid it at all costs! Helen xxxxx
