Who fed this stupid idea to play and produce a movie in Himesh's head, still hidden under a cap, covering almost half of his face all the time? Let's just hope it's the first and the last too, for God's sake! From Assalam Valekum to Gayatri Mantra, Himesh has tried everything to create an aura of his so-called singing talent, which is nothing but atrocious pronunciations of words like Tanhaiyya, which completely kills the beauty of the terms, so commonly used for love Songs. Why does not Himesh smile? Simple because it does not use toothpaste close-up! Now here is his friend who follows him everywhere, and this city's leading lawyer, who has to squirm sexually and try to seduce Himesh, of all the beautiful Germans she could have met earlier, maybe the lawyers in this part of the world, they might perhaps curse their fate, as they are destined to deal with rigid and unattractive fate, every day! Action scenes are so fun, like the thief-attacked event planner, cars flying over cars, and so on. The bride's father seems to be in a hurry to get rid of his daughter by marrying him, flying back and forth. Very hypocritical, he praises the human resources for having distributed the love to the people of the whole world, as if it were treats, and on his back, gives a cold talk to his daughter during these spectacles. when Himesh is proven innocent, he bluntly rejects the other guy, as if it were a musical chair game! I did not even see the poor guy's face, did I? Hansika in the role of Ria, it looks like she needs a visual examination, to get tired eyes! The guy in the role of a friend is good, he acted in a very natural way and should be part of better movies, like Sharman Joshi, for example. The child artist in the brief appearance of Trishu is sweet, but wasted. It seems that the young generation of today has gone crazy, preferring this kind of parody of words and scores, and associates gossip. For example, if you sing ek bar aaja, the ghost would come. it's a strange taste in music, and rather funny. I'm surprised how classic authors like Gulzar have opted for Himesh, a popular music. There is a story in Panchtantra, according to which a raven attaches as many peacock feathers as it is beautiful and attractive to the birds; but the feathers eventually fall and the real black raven is revealed! Hope Himesh sticks to a clue and refrains from making such meaningless objects and wasting precious money that he has earned by taxing his short nose! His friend tells him, if your nose is cut, how are you going to sing? Thank you for showing us Germany, Himesh, at a reasonable cost of renting the DVD! and correct these spelling mistakes, do you want? an extra e in the movie, and no love! There is also a famous issue of the old movie Sholey, Mehbooba, on which Mallika Sherawat stirs, again, but this time with Himesh, who winks at her, and conveniently, Ria, her so-called true love and his new wife not in the corner! It was very clever, Himesh! At least one thing in this film that you made intelligently, to justify the presence of Sherawat. But does not she look a little washed?
