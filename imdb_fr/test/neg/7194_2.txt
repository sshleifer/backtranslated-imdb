Have you ever had one of those sneezes that seems to accumulate forever? You gasp and convulse yourself and grab the nearest paper product in anticipation of the world's largest flyblower ... and all ends up stopping. "Frankenhooker" was the cinematic equivalent of this lost sneeze. Now, I'm a big fan of B-movies, and I always look the other way when a microphone appears on the screen or an actor says his words with all the enthusiasm of Gerald Ford, but that one it really let me down. The cover of the video, for example, is the slogan of the entire movie. Using coins from murdered prostitutes in New York, Dr. Franken reconstructs his deceased fianc√©e, but leaves her mad in Manhattan as a kind of superprostitute with a bad attitude. After an hour and a half of accumulation, these ten minutes quite amusing seemed a little anti-climactic.
