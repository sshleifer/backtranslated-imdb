Let me first say that I rarely watch movies; I only comment if I'm blown away or disappointed with something that I think was going to be good. Killshot has been a major disappointment in many ways. The scenario was horrible, the acting was mediocre (especially heavyweights like Rourke and Lane) and the editing and effects were comic (car explosion, etc.) Rosario Dawson had a horrible role, I can not I believe that I would even accept it, it was such an abuse of his talent that I could not even tell you. I should have known, after seeing the trailer of this film 3 years ago, that the problem was serious with this movie .......... B movie all the way ... .. .... do not bother unless you're really bored ........
