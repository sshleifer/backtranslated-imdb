The best scene of "People on the other side of the lake" is the really scary nighttime opening scene featuring a house, a murder and a lake. After that, the horror is down. A family (mom, dad, sister and younger brother) is fed up with the (moderately) dangerous environment of the suburbs and decides to live near the titular lake. From then on, the film has too much doo-doo related to the annoying family near the lake, with sometimes corpses popping up here and there. The few scenes where they discover the bodies are quite convincing (in terms of goosebumps), but they strongly contrast with the rest of the news (staging the daily tricks of the family that settles). The truth about the facts (the mystery of who is committing the murder) is learned too early, leaving only the family and the spectator yawning during the final uninteresting (with a discovery in a basement and a run in the house) As if that makes for television suddenly remembered that it was supposed to be a horror movie. It's not really badly done; the content and the story are just not interesting enough. Barry Corbin is the only asset in the cast, although his performance and character are a bit too crazy to be taken seriously. The cute blonde Tammy Lauren (the girl) could also be a recognizable face for horror junkies, since she also played in "Wishmaster" (1997) and in TV shows such as "I Saw What You Did" (1988) & "The Children of Stepford" (1987). She does not have much to do in this film. Sautable, but observable, if any.
