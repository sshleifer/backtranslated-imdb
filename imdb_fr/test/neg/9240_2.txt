I just watched this yesterday and wanted to read the harsh comments of other people, but I found good grades. <br /> <br /> WHAT ??? It was probably the worst Asian horror movie I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> * spoilers * The story has posed many fundamental problems. Many Asian horrors have the twist of minds trying to help but seeming scary (with notable exceptions: Ringu and Ju-on). This is the case here except that they are not scary. An attractive Asian woman who looks a little pale is not scary at all. The character of "monk" straight explains everything as a perfectly natural life cycle; nothing frightening there either. But the woman simply does not understand, she would rather kill herself and her baby, and then let this poor ghost reincarnate. My girlfriend and I were laughing when she jumped out of the building twice and the ghost waited after the second time to tell her why she was following her everywhere. This information would have been nice to know before it started to jump, but it does not matter. <br /> <br /> * That said, I liked two parts in the middle. First, she gets in a taxi with a ghost (ghost taxis?) That has a lot of hair in addition, which is inexplicably scary. Just after that, at the bus stop, you have to see it because it is rather spoiled. <br /> <br /> In summary, this film is a real bomb, I gave him an extra point for the two scenes above. . It's an Asian horror of poor quality that manages to make ghosts flying in the womb almost gorgeous while trying to scare you with the same images.
