The film and the chocolate has nothing to do with the book. The plot completely changed and the one who chooses the distribution had to read the book. First the girl is not an introvert, Aden is. Vivian was the one who sued Aden. His mother must have survived and be the one after Gabriel. Astrid was the one who committed all the murders with Ralf, a Vivian ex. Gabriel is not old. He is old. And Aden did NOT have Vivian at the end, Gabriel did it. The title comes from Vivian comparing the kisses of Aden (sweet as chocolate) and Gabriel (delicious like blood). She drew blood because it promised more and he understood it more. It reminds me that Gabriel is not against humans as in the movie. He simply avoids intimacy with them because they have already hurt him. Really, the book is so much better than the movie. But if you want to see running, a montage of meetings and a lot of jumps. So this is the movie to see.
