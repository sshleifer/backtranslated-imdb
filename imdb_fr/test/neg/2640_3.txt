In a quiet town, two girls witness the murder of one of their friends to a strange young boy named Milo, who lives on the other side of the city. After the murder, his body is found in a river and his death is pronounced. Sixteen years later, a wedding brings the girls back to their hometown and Claire, a teacher, is obsessed with the fact that Milo is not dead. She has recurring visions. Her friends die one by one and no one believes her when she claims Milo is apart. So now, she's looking for the dreadful truth. <br /> <br /> When I came across this film, I was rather skeptical about it, especially when there was "Anaconda creators" on the cover, but reading the strange little shot of intrigue on the back of the videotape, it sounded good and rather refreshing for a change. Well guess what? I thought it was a good idea at the time, but it was a totally different story when it came to watching the movie. It just seemed to be trying hard to be smart and very psychological, but this last element did not go very well for me and it was basically an extended and mostly unconvincing thriller. Hey, I'll admit that it's had its moments, but barely enough to make it scary or memorable. But, bravo to the filmmakers, at least the story is not a repetition of these slasher imitators who followed "Scream" and the shock of horror, there is no obvious self-referential humor ?? in fact, there is not even a hint of humor. But maybe it was too serious? Especially that the plot is rather absurd, but this is not his main problem. What a ragged plot we get, I did not know much about what was going on, because it seems to skim many things in favor of some so-called shocking and disturbing sequences. No! Rather scenes without interest and yawning inducing clich√©s that we see from time to time. You can also see some "good" horror movies from the 70s, including "Do not Look Now". This is when our main character continues to see the figure of his past in a gooey state. The other should have been one of my favorites, "Alice, Sweet Alice", with the person who had trouble wearing yellow slippers and committing horrific deaths. Interesting idea, but it is rather superficial and too many defects appear. I liked it more when the scenes were about the character's childhood, because the performances and circumstances were terrifying, but when he was getting closer to adulthood, he was tired and without a story for the most part, and the Performance was not terrible, but incredibly mundane and barely involving is a good way to say it. Most of the dialogue made me groan in disbelief at the way it was artificial and awkward. You will shout "no duh!" on the screen, because you can not believe what you hear. The police detective receives the consequences! <br /> <br /> Quality - the film is not bad, it's better than your usual video, I would say. Very slippery things. With some inventive and prominent camera angles and a low score that works pretty well. Another factor that made the difference and played a key role in creating a moody atmosphere was the creeping sound effects and this bike bell left a ringing sensation in the ears. The establishment of a calm primary school was well done and the rest of the action takes place in a house. But do not expect real suspense or surprises, as their execution is non-existent. The deaths are not pleasant and they are slightly bloody and they are rather the consequences of what happens to these bodies, which try to disturb you. The villain in this room, the petty child, Milo Jeeder, was a little annoying. This voice and this yellow slicker make an imprint to start, but they seem to lose their effect when we come to the conclusion of the film. The slogans of cheese on the video compare it to Jason, Freddy and Chucky, but it's not child's play, but you do not care about me! Right? It is labeled "The new face of evil", yes well. All he needs is to learn a few ways and solve problems. Overall, the film left me with a bitter taste, as I could have left without seeing it. I probably would have liked to do it. <br /> <br /> Do not expect too much in this movie blur. Or better, just avoid skipping it, because you will not miss much, really.
