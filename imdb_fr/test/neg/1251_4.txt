Stu Ungar is considered by many to be the greatest poker / gin player of all time - an extraordinary self-destructive natural force - a tiny stature, but a huge heart for the game. <br /> <br /> What we have Here's some kind of Hallmark movie about the dangers of gambling. Of course, he wins, he loses, he blows on sex, drugs and more gambling, but where is the real game - where is what makes him the most great card player of all time. <br /> <br /> Much too flat and frankly boring in places, it gives a four because we learn something about Stu the man, but Stu the card player, nada. <br /> <br /> Beautifully Shot and Presented to One This is the perfect example of what to do to not make a movie on the cards: honestly, the coverage of the World Series by ESPN is more watchable that this one. <br /> <br /> A mess of great luck.
