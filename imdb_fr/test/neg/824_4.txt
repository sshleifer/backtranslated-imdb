If I compare two films with Sacha Cohen, Borat and Ali G, Ali G is infinitely better. It's not a masterpiece, but it's a movie at least. Borat is a complete waste and I do not understand how he behaved better than Ali G. <br /> <br /> I can not pinpoint him, there is a problem with the Ali G script: half jokes are as if they were written by a 15-year-old man and not by an adult scriptwriter. And a number of jokes, including Mr. Cohen's lower body, are pretty bland. <br /> <br /> But the film is a comedy and some good jokes are funny: for example, how Ali G becomes a member of the government for doing something scandalous and stupid in the public (sadly true in society current West: people have careers for doing stupid things in public), as well as Ali's advice on immigration policy and a few others. <br /> <br /> The Ali G ensemble remains a nice character, even if it is a kind of mental underdevelopment for his age. But it's good to watch, it's pretty funny. <br /> <br /> But never look at Borat, it's awful and makes all smart movies sick.
