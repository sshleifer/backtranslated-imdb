I was surprised by Antal's Kontroll in 2003. His first American project, Vacancy, was less impressive but a decent start. Shielded is his second feature film and although the visual signature is recognizable, the film never exceeds the level of a film of series B. <br /> <br /> It's a shame because the main premise contains all the ingredients necessary to turn well and that the distribution with many quality actors should be able to give results. Antal could have made a good burglary film but opted instead for an action movie. Again, he could have shot a nice action movie, but it is not really effective either. <br /> <br /> You only have improbable situations, a group of badly sketched characters who bicker and argue over a sum of money. If you look beyond cinematography, distribution and good score, you find yourself facing what could have been a below-average live-video with Van Damme or Seagal. <br /> <br /> It was probably the most disappointing film for me for quite some time.
