Patsy Kensit and a random Australian star among the duo of two besieged besieged in the middle of an investigation into a series of murders related to an art gallery, but in the meantime, they can still find time to shoot juvenile shoplifters and to suspect the new wife of the male cop to be adulterous. The serial killer suddenly has no importance when the supposed lover of the woman (who is actually only one of her colleagues) is found murdered and the police officer becomes the main suspect. "Tunnel Vision" is a really dull, unrealistic and tension-free Australian thriller that obviously imitates popular sex thrillers such as "Fatal Attraction", "Disclosure" and "Basic Instinct". The characters are extremely one-dimensional and practically every shot of good / bad cop is described in detail in the script. The tough position of women police in a body full of men, the mentality of shooting first, questions, later alcohol problems caused by stress, etc. Even bad eating habits of cops are a gag. Yawning! Kensit does her best to make this film more bearable, but lacks the credibility and talent of a true movie hero. The end of the turn is more or less interesting (not at all original, but you've already stopped looking at the characters for a long time.) The scenes filmed inside the sex clubs look ridiculously wrong and the realization of Clive Fleury is completely devoid of inspiration, what a total waste of time ??
