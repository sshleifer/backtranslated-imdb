OK, so it's horror? I hate - but I do not get horrible. Black and white is artistic, but too much black is excessive ..... enough about lighting. The story - a serial killer ....... a lot of them. This has been done in the past and yes, it will continue to be done ..... but I hope not. My question is: when will the public be tired of reliving this infuriating dilemma? I guess the director thought he would do something different - portraying children killed. This has already been done before. I guess he must be shocked ... have them killed in the darkest of fashions. OK ..... the audience was shocked ...... disgusted ... disgusted ..... numb. And rising from my seat, I felt all these things. Has the director succeeded? Yes! Absolutely! These are the things he wanted me to feel and do. Now what am I doing with feelings? And more importantly, what is the "message" here? With the incredible talent Francis Xavier was "gifted" ..... could he ever consider applying it to the making of films that speak, dare I say, coming out of the darkness? I stayed in the dark after watching this movie, my soul was assaulted ... Is this job? There are a lot of movies of this type out there - they bring me a lot. So what's up with people who want to see all these lamenting visuals? What is going on in this world that people will pay to be horribly shocked? Will I see that again ..... ever
