CUJO is the film adaptation of a novel of the same name written by Stephen King. <br /> <br /> I never read the novel, but the simple fact of scanning the page of the comments allowed me to better understand. I noticed a reference to the change of the end. <br /> <br /> The plot of the film is as follows: a Saint Bernard dog is bitten by a rabid bat and starts a killing. <br /> <br /> The plot seems quite worn, having been made in various films. However, it could have been something new when King wrote the novel. Or maybe King's novel changes the story that has never been shown in the movie. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the first 40 minutes of this movie have nothing to mention but the dog that was bitten. Nothing else happens - nothing scary, nothing fun, nothing adding depth to the characters and nothing interesting in any other respect. I found this section difficult to sift through and I constantly shouted on TV, "Come on, get started!" The events I saw on the screen were reminiscent of a dramatic TV movie or an extended episode of a TV drama. Unfortunately, there was only one family in the movie, so she could not even work on a soap opera. The dog was the best character in the movie, but he did not have enough time on the screen in this section. There was no reason why this dog would start a slaughter later. <br /> <br /> After the 40-minute mark, something finally happened. The dog suddenly transformed from a lovable pet into a vicious killing machine. He started attacking some people. There was also an interesting cat-and-mouse chase when two characters were trapped in a car, unable to leave because the dog would attack them. Even in this second period too long, the suspense would accumulate well before dying again. It was just a stop-go situation that repeats itself again and again until the film reaches its conclusion. <br /> <br /> Without giving an end, I can tell you that it was very formally and unworthy of a Stephen King story. <br /> <br /> Suspenseful scenes when they are on screen are exciting to watch. Some large camera angles add a threat to the vicious nature of the dog when it attacks people. This is especially important because, as others have already mentioned, a St. Bernard dog is not nearly as scary as a Rottweiler, for example. Unfortunately, the film fails to use captivating music to support on-screen images. The music is far too melodramatic rather than suspensive. This may be suitable for a TV movie, but it seems incredibly out of place in what should be a dark-toned movie with a live nightmare to the viewer. <br /> <br /> This brings me to a more general problem with this movie - Photography. The work of the camera and especially the choice of colors make it look like a very cheap TV movie that you would expect to see as the movie of day on Channel 5 here in the UK where I write this comment . <br /> <br /> The two main actors offer good acting performances that help bring to life the dull segments of the film. Dee Wallace and Danny Pintauro should be commended for their excellent work with the poor equipment they are given. I could forgive some brief moments of over-action by paying more attention to the dialogue, which would have allowed no other interpretation from my point of view. I will not judge other actors because they receive practically nothing to do. <br /> <br /> As a fan of SALEM'S LOT and STEPHEN KING'S IT, the two film adaptations of Stephen King's famous novels, I had high expectations for this film. But that turned out to be a huge disappointment. <br /> <br /> Overall, I do not recommend Stephen King fans or horror movies in general to watch CUJO. This is one of those times when I have to recommend the book rather than the movie. Let's hope this brings the story to life in a way that the film failed to do.
