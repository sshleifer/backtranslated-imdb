"The Puffy Chair" is a supreme waste of 84 minutes of my life that can not be recovered and spent more profitably (even "The Blair Witch Project" allowed better use of precious moments of life). It should be called "The Puffy Chair" because only the "inflated" chairs can accommodate the extremely "puffy" and very important brothers who left it for public consumption; and, of course, they are so full of themselves that they have assumed that the public would really want to consume their drool. "The Puffy Chair" makes "The Wooly Boys" a cinematic masterpiece! "Doll Valley", "Beyond the Valley of the Dolls", "Flamingos", "Texas Chainsaw Massacre", "Night of the Living Dead", "Urban Cowboy", "The Blob", everything being a better use of his time, than to watch "The Puffy Chair". The characters described are either too predictable or too devoid of normal emotional reflexes to even approach sympathy or credibility. In addition, at one point in the film, while the characters are supposed to be in the same small town, if you look closely, you can see that part of the city is apparently in the southern United States. United and the other half is in Maine. It's a city, huh?
