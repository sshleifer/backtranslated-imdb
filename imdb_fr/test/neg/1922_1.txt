*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** HERE ON EARTH / (2000) 1/2 * (out of four) <br /> <br /> "Here on Earth" by Mark Piznarski holds the record for the film containing the most recycled material in 96 minutes. Every element of fiction, cliché and familiar intrigue is literally somewhere here; there is simply nothing original, original or fresh. God, what a dying film to go through! I would have liked to see the film when it was released last year so that I could be on my list of the worst years. This is the kind of movie where the story is instantly obvious and decreasing since the opening credits and, worse, takes itself seriously. "Here on Earth" is clearly one of the most horrible and painful films of the time. <br /> <br /> "Here on Earth" is a teen movie, aimed at teens, so it must contain some of Hollywood's most popular young men who are quite attractive and inexperienced enough to accept a role in a movie too bad than this one. Chris Klein and Josh Hartnett correspond to this varied description and take the main roles of assault. Klein plays Kelley, an arrogant and insolent student with a wealthy father (cliche number one). He graduated and went to Ivy University in the footsteps of his father (Stuart Wilson). This creates the cliché "I do not want your life" in which the father tries to control the life of his son, while the son resists in a rebellious way. Throw in the dead mother of Kelley who committed suicide a while ago. When his father brings another woman home, he asks himself brutally about his intentions (the cliche "No one can replace mom" is considered number two). <br /> <br /> Josh Hartnett plays Jasper, a character opposite to Kelley. His family has a local restaurant. Enter into her longtime love, Samantha Cavanaugh (Leelee Sobieski), a dinner waitress who gets covered with her sister (which has no reason to be instead of controlling the next scene) when Jasper and Kelley behave like childish idiots in the race (oh no) crashing in the restaurant, making him blaze. (Conflicts between rich and poor will be number three.) <br /> <br /> The botched car chase sets Kelley and Jasper in an artificial and plausible conflict. They have trouble with the law, but as this film feels the need to exist, the local judge orders them an alternative to the trouble: they must work together to rebuild the restaurant. <br /> <br /> Both boys work hard during the summer to become strong and get a nice tan. Samantha's eyes attract Kelley and romantic sparks fly. Jasper is jealous, but wants the best for his true love (Photo Number Four). Her parents (Annette O'Toole and Bruce Greenwood) disapprove of her little romantic triangle (shot number five), but she continues to time twice for Jasper. His father is also the local sheriff, what a surprise (count this cliché of melodramatic nugget number six). <br /> <br /> Romantic feelings invented between Kelley and Samantha count as cliché number seven. But Samantha's relationship with Jasper is never defined, so how can there be a romantic tension? If the film should prompt Samantha to choose between the two young men, we must see both characters on both sides. The film describes Jasper as a distraction for his "legitimate love," Kelley. It's clear that Jasper really loves it, but it's also clear that she does not like it in return. This absolutely eliminates the romantic tension at the beginning of the story. <br /> <br /> Leelee Sobieski does not hurt here; However, his charm and kindness are not suitable for a two-time character like Samantha. John Hartnett is also right for Jasper's role, but the film gives him nothing to do except bickering with Kelley. Chris Klein can make a name for himself. he spends a large part of the film shirtless, sweaty and overworked. Unfortunately, he does not show his acting abilities, perhaps because he has very little. The cast is a lot more talented. Bruce Greenwood provides the best performance of the film, but does not have enough time on the screen to record anything but a few brief moments. I also enjoyed the performance of Stuart Wilson, who perfectly fits the role of a rich father with a dominant social status. <br /> <br /> We then tackle Samantha's knee problem exactly one hour and ten minutes after the beginning of the movie (another spoiler to come). Anyway, she suffers from a serious incurable disease (yet another invention in the painting, about number eight). His terminal illness brings the two young men in competition, finally, at least I think that's what the film wanted to show, that the loss of a loved one by two nemesis can bring the two (cliché number nine). <Br /> <br /> Klein repeats his farewell speech to show that his character is more than a superficial stereotype, but we have seen him so many times before, I would prefer a rich character rather than a character deeply sentimental that hides real feelings (number of clichés, was it ten)? The conflicts between Kelley and Jasper are desperate and insane; a comment from "your mother" triggers a fight with fists during the reconstruction of the establishment. There is a retreading of Armageddon, while Samantha and Kelley lay in an open field, horny as a devil, as he slowly moves his fingers around his body, naming areas after American cities (why do not call this number eleven). The film uses alcohol as a means to increase love tension: Kelley, in a state of drunkenness, ridicules himself after arguing with Samantha's boy, Jasper, but the next day he recites only his desire to dance (number of shots, oh no, I lose the account).
