Some changes for the better (the special effects are more elaborate), others for the worse (Scott Grimes, a child friendly in the original, has turned into a clumsy teenager), but usually this suite is pretty much equivalent to the original - which does not say much. PG-13 is questionable; Although the movie is not scary at all, there is a bit of short gore but quite explicit, and a bit of nudity misplaced. (* 1/2)
