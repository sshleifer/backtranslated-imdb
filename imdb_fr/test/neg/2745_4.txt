-SPOILERS ------------ I'm a fan of French cinema of the 60s-70s but not necessarily the most modern, so to be honest, I looked at it because of Bellucci. She is very young here, extremely It's beautiful and above what is supposed to be this movie is the one where they met Cassel, which gives it extra importance. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a beautiful style reminiscent of DePalma.So we are precipitated flashback, and the back and forth continues that becomes tiring.I do not mind a flash back, but do it and finish with the man !!! Anyway, the movie is always interesting for me until the first and final hole in the plot, which allows the rest of the story, never let me enjoy the rest.I can allow small holes here and there, but not to found an entire plot on hot air.This is the story of a man who is literally looking for an old flame.This is the main plot. I will continue, when the story will eventually convince me that there are some really mysterious things, but it's a story, there is nothing really mysterious about it. Bellucci-Cassel is a couple, so Bellucci must leave urgently for a job in Italy (not the place farthest from Paris) and she leaves him a message which, for later reasons, explains that he does not do it . These people do not have a phone? She would have spent two months (not exactly a century) and she would not call her boyfriend in Paris to find out how he is doing. Of course not. Instead, even after her return, she forgets everything about him. And that's good, but later in the film, she tells her friend that it was her greatest love and that she was ready to go. For the first time in her life, she failed to call him for two months and never tried to come back with him. And what about the character of Cassel? He was supposed to be unable to locate her in Italy, very difficult to find someone in Italy, it's probably like Siberia, especially an actress who is probably listed even in the arts journals. And after 2 months when she would be back, really hard to find her and ask for an explanation. We think she wanted to avoid it, but no, we discover that they just could not meet. So difficult to meet in Paris. Okay, I do not need to go further because this is the incident on which the whole movie is based. Even worse, Bellucci is not really the star of this movie, but Bohringer, the other girl.
