The first time I saw this movie, it was with this pretty girl who attracted me. we had a lot of fun laughing and generally making fun of it. So my impression was that it was awful but that you could look for good value. Then, as part of our anniversary, we watched it together again on video. In the end, the film is simply dreadful and unassailable. It's amazing how pretty girls can change the world.
