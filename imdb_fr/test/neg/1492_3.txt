I am really disappointed with this work. It is silent and shallow, constantly repeating itself, it is generally inaccurate and sometimes about to be wrong. I think it's done for elementary school, especially because it's repeated over and over again while leaving big gaps. A young child can benefit and learn from it, but a better way to get him to appreciate theoretical physics is a book like "A Brief History of Time" or "The Tao of Physics". If you know the subject at a very basic level, you will not get any new information or point of view from this series. Do not waste your time with that. Candy for the eyes though.
