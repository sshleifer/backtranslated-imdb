I'm a big fan of Emily Watson (Breaking The Waves) and Tom Wilkinson (Normal) and I was amused to see them burst by Rupert Everett (Dellamorte Dellamore) in this rather minor shocking movie that had all the ingredients to be so much more. The too brief scenes in which he depicts a son of a rich lord, worthless, languishing to infinity and without right, are perfect and entertaining. But for a love triangle, there was remarkably little chemistry to talk between anyone. The music was of a disturbing quality as film of the week, and the voiceover was shocking and totally useless. Obviously, the job of a new manager with a small budget, which was missing or lacked enough good advice. Pity. <br /> <br /> I can understand how much the people you hate at the beginning are the ones you love a little bit at the end, and vice versa, so there's a kind of arc of character, unless you terms of perception. For example, Watson's character, while refreshing with her husband about her feelings for another man, started to hurt me in the end, especially when she announced to her husband that she had absolutely no control over her actions, and later simply stated that she would return to their matrimonial apartment without asking permission or apologizing. And I went from not liking Wilkinson's monotonous / moralistic relativity character to understanding him and not really wanting him to change (unlike his wife). <br /> <br /> This film is awkwardly transformed into a "love story" "or" Steel Magnolias ", a drama about the disease without informing me enough about it, so I sat distractedly guessing what would be the next possible turn of the plot long after their revelation (Was it the Lord who drove the car? The Lord's dog?) The scene where the Lord visits Wilkinson and tells how Watson is brave, the best nurse that any dying boyfriend can ask, Florence Nightingale incarnate, etc. was OK until he started sobbing like a baby Good god, if you ask me, she is just another very rich person, with much too much time, and so she drives her hard to work, offering her crazy wife a useless drama, her jostling was just another way to occupy her empty life; dying thing was an added bonus p for her because it made her previous actions totally irreproachable. <br /> <br /> Listen, everyone would have been better if Wilkinson had just left it for his secretary, who seemed to like him for who he was. Instead, he acted like an abused dog, his open desire for his wife's affection increasing with every kick she gives him. I'm not against PC or anything, it did not sound right, even after taking into account all the hard realities of the Middle Ages that we all tend to face. The end for me was depressing (and not the intention of the director, I'm sure). The film took the last 80 minutes to convince me that these two people were just not going to belong, so I did not find any joy in seeing their relationship continue. I'm not above wanting my emotions to be manipulated by a story, it just has to be a bit plausible and not be worn out. Is it too much to ask? <br /> <br /> My score: 4/10
