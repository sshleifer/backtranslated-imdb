How many disaster films can we have before we are fed up? Come on, we can see them all day on the Discovery Channel. <br /> <br /> I agree with the comment that the first part of this film is just a soap opera. The grandson of the Great Predictor makes a prediction and everyone starts to complain about how he ruins the family name. The perverse stepmother convinces the woman to throw him into the arms of his mistress, whom she wants to meet. Can you believe that? The woman wants to approve the new woman! At the same time, the mistress has a lover of her who has no wife, but she sends him packing. <br /> <br /> Now that the soap opera is over, the earthquake appears. <BR/> <br /> The special effects are really good, but the dubbing is bad. That's why I like subtitled movies. The actors are all very experienced and have won many awards. You will be able to discover some of the best of Japan in a story often repeated. <br /> <br /> The soap-opera story comes back with a very fictitious end.
