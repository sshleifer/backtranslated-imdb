For viewers who thought the "Alien" movie of 1979 was the first to portray a Terran man being imbued with a malicious extraterrestrial, "The Night of the Bloody Beast", filmed 21 years earlier, may surprise . In this film, America's first man in space crashed on Earth and, after examination, we think he's dead. He will come back later, when half a dozen extraterrestrial seahorse stuff is growing in his abdomen. The (?) Extraterrestrial Mom also appears to terrorize the small group of scientists who observe our gravid hero, and she (?) Seems to have the body of a bear and the head of Yarnek, the rock creature of a 1969 Trek star Anyway, with his short 62-minute run, his small group of scientists and his cheap monster, this movie offers nothing less than a grade Z warm-up for "The Outer Limits "(the first of which will take place four years later), but without the beautiful writing that this show usually boasted.In spite of its ominous title, this film is resolutely science fiction, not horror, and no fright, no pain, little suspense, and little food for thought afterwards, it seems like it costs about $ 100 (but probably costs twice as much), and its musical score often seems to have nothing to do with it. with events (I will not use s the word "action") on the screen. At the end of the film, many questions remain: how did our hero give birth to these critters? Why does the stranger need to decapitate people to learn our language? (To justify this title, no doubt!) Why can extraterrestrials traveling in space not land on our planet, rather than having to hitchhike on our ships? How was our hero impregnated to begin? These are all things that can not be bothered by this little bit. This is the case in reality for science fiction graduates of the 1950s.
