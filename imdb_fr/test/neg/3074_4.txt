This television channel seems to have polarized the opinions of the commentators on this page, so I can perhaps fix everything by saying that it's a very stupid TV movie, not very well done. Is it bad? It's a televised game that can not even decide on its name, because if everyone in America calls it LINDA, it's known in Britain as LUST FOR MURDER and it's usually a bad sign when a movie needs to change its name. And can I also point out that this is not a fake cheek as someone claimed? <br /> <br /> I'll be honest and say that the plot is pretty healthy. Linda and Paul Cowley meet another couple called Jeffries with whom they get along very well. They get along so well that they go on vacation together (make up your own mind if there is a woman exchanging his wife) and Paul sees his wife killing the Jeffries. After the intrigue takes a critical turn <br /> <br /> In writing the paragraph above, I suddenly realized the enormous potential of the story and I will say nothing to dissuade you from situation. It's just that when the story continues after the events I've described, things get more and more improbable and weird. Not only that, but the production values ​​are quite unimpressive with the actor playing Paul Cowley playing a very wooden voice that irritates, while most of the scenes - both indoor and outdoor - seem to have been filmed on a foggy day
