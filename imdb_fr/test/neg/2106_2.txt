Really, really horrible. I do not even know where to start. This is a perfect example of a movie that does not know what to do with itself. I'm not even sure I can assign a category myself, except that I'm sure it's a slap for everyone, everywhere. Even unborn children. <br /> <br /> Sometimes I thought I was watching a parody or some sort of joke. Sometimes just a bad movie B. But I've been good for porn, which, I'm afraid, is almost (but not quite), nonexistent. <br /> <br /> Someone advised to jump to the end. I would certainly like to help this emotion. The last five minutes are intense and certainly contain some of the best movies / CGIs you'll ever see, ever. <br /> <br /> Ed Wood would be proud.
