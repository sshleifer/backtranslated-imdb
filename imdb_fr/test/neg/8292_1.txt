Although I'm a long time fan of Shatner (since watching Trek perform at dinner time in the early '70s), I do not see why he wanted to make this film, either for his development personal business reasons. Has he lost a bet? <br /> <br /> As a film buff, I like to enjoy bad movies with grown-ups. But "Shoot or be Shot" has no talent or funny sensations, involuntary or not. <br /> <br /> Although unclassified, there have been no dubious scenes (blinking or you will miss nudity, cartoons drawn "violence" with endless bullets shooting), we are led to believe that the producers simply wanted to save the costs necessary for the MPAA to evaluate them. This will make its way to the cable with just 10 seconds of editing completed. <br /> <br /> Of the eight people who were in the theater with us, four of them went halfway, whispering statements like "This is stupid". . <br /> <br /> Shatner embodies a patient with an escaped mental illness who was denied release because he considers himself a screenwriter. The Examination Board marks his request "INSANE". He meets a group of Z class filmmakers who "shoot video because it's 80% cheaper than the movie" and decides to force them to shoot his screenplay under the threat of a gun. There are some minor minor intrigues that develop some of the secondary characters, but most of the time it is the entire movie. <br /> <br /> If you want to spend 90 minutes on a movie "art" Shatner, see "Free Enterprise" instead, it's a much better movie.
