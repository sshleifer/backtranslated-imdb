I know many people like this series and I apologize to those who think this series is great, but it's the worst series ever created. Of course, I'm sure I would be a big fan of this series if Jeremy Clarkson was not showing. I mean, I think testing cars and doing things like seeing if a car can beat a plane is great! But Jeremy Clarkson is just pathetic. Here are the reasons why I hate this man: He thinks it's cool to cheat the speed cameras that measure your average speed by taking your distance and your time while traveling 200 km / h on the road, then resting for two hours. . He clearly thinks he's better than Richard Hammond and James May. . He has my best friend who says pathetic things. . He's screaming at the kids just for taking a picture. I'm sorry for the top gear, but Jeremy Clarkson is a monster.
