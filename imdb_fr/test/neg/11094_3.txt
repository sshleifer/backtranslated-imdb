Even the presence of Sophie Marceau and the few (very rare) good French gags are unable to save this film otherwise slow and boring! Disappointment. The story is weak and the same goes for the actor. This movie has been announced as the French version of The Mummy, but the Mummy has at least some spectacular and enjoyable effects ...
