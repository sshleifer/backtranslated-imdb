I feel stupid after watching the first 20 minutes. Fortunately, I went out and saved the rest of my brain. People should watch better movies and take notes on why they have a high score, and not because of the movie budget or special effects. Just play well and do things well, and it's important - not to be BLADE--, but I guess it was produced for those tasteless Sheeple and not a clue to what is '' a good movie '' do not be afraid to rank movies too low, save your high underestimated scores for "once in a lifetime". Keep in mind that many use IMDb for reliable reviews and opinions, do not spoil the Peace and Love Powdered Sugar Bouillon
