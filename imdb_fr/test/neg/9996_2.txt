It is a monotonous boredom, inert and important. When the only thing that suddenly gives life to a movie is a hanging, you know that the business is sloppy. Philip Seymour Hoffman interprets Truman Capote as a narcissistic, ticking, complacent caricature of cartoons and insects. Why it is like this is never explained and we get little basic information. The script focuses on Capote's writing of "In Cold Blood" and his attachment to the damaged brothers who murdered a family of four. Harper Lee (Catherine Keener), famous writer of 'To Kill A Mockingbird', accompanies Capote in his first investigations of crime and his presence immediately suggests a much more interesting topic for a biopic. Unfortunately, Lee is quickly dismissed in favor of endless scenes of Capote who laments his sorrow. To look at it is like watching Dr. Smith from "Lost in Space" complain about his "delicate back" to anyone who wants to hear it for two hours. The difference, however, is that Smith was fun to watch, unlike Capote. The precious importance of the film kills him, as does the reluctance of director Bennett Miller to add any kind of shading. Like the morose piano score, the film is a marvel a note, without contrast, without emotional coloring and without intimate drama. If Capote was really so irritating, why make a movie about him and expect the audience to watch him? Although the side roles are well interpreted (Chris Cooper is his usual), they have a goal as little dramatic because, in the end, the director of Capote (!), Bennett, and the scriptwriter Dan Futterman fail to engage emotionally their target audience, as they were clearly overwhelmed by the cultural baggage of Capote's "legend". Their product is a stillborn Oscar bait ... and further proves that a great genre picture contains more "truth" than a dozen so sincere piles of shit like this one.
