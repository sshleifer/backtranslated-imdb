A virtual carbon copy of The Cave saves less budget-reduced effects and a slightly different scenario. I knew the film was going downhill when I saw the flashing lights of a campfire reflected clearly in the face of one of the actors. The conflicts between the characters and the secondary intrigues seemed to have no use and added nothing to the film, except for a few moments of silence. The acting was not as bad as the typical B movie, and their fear was credible, but as professional speleologists, they seem to be psychologically too unstable for the craft they chose. Overall, it is not worth wasting $ 4.50 for rent.
