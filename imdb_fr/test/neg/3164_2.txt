This film looks great, and that's where my eulogy ends. "Love is a splendid thing" was released in 1955, a very schizophrenic year, when candy-like nonsense like this coexisted with a dazzling art fair like "Kiss Me Deadly". As the trend shifted to more modest and socially conscious films, such as "On the Waterfront" and "Marty", which was established in the mid-1950s, other filmmakers felt the need to stick to ruthless and provocative melodrama that ranks so many other films from this decade, and "Love" is one of these. <br /> <br /> This is the kind of movie of the 50s in which the Technicolor is used thoroughly, where the light is invariably high; even scenes taking place in a dark room or at night are brighter than average sunny days. I never want to hear the theme song again, because it is played quite often during the film to last a lifetime, and I do not want to hear it sung by the high chorus that pierces the ears and tells it about them. final titles. Jennifer Jones and William Holden are passable, but anyone could have played those roles. Jones's role is horribly written - his character is incredibly incoherent and it seems that every time his character has to make a decision, the writers throw a coin to decide what that decision will be. <br /> <br /> People will probably tell me that I take this film too seriously, that I'm not romantic, etc. But I loved "All That Heaven Permis", released the same year and just like Cornball in his own way, except that Douglas Sirk is able to turn melodrama into an art form, while Henry King ( the director of "Love") does not do it. <br /> <br /> I am generally able to enjoy a bad melodrama, but in this case, I was bored. <br /> <br /> Grade: D +
