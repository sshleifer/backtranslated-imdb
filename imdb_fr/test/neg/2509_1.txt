I can not believe I'm sitting through this total loss of time. I was too fascinated by the indescribable evil of not being able to move. It reminded me of the feeling of not being able to leave the eyes of a horrible car accident or a rotting cow carcass. You can not help but watch, but you feel sick and nauseous afterwards. <br /> <br /> Let me clarify: "Plan 9 Space", for example, is not a bad movie. Not even "Star Wars: Holiday Special" is a bad movie. They are both awful to look at, of course, but they have SOME qualities and at least they leave you the strength to reach the "off" button. <br /> <br /> This "remake" (name only)) of the science fiction classic let me cry on my couch, desperately trying to understand why such scenarios were filmed, why anyone would defile the memory of the original classic and if I could resume my normal life without my knowledge suddenly in search of calm and the peace of death. <br /> <br /> Although death, I realized, would not offer any rest of the horrible memories of this pile of shit, because the poor souls in hell are probably forced to watch this over and over again for the eternity ...
