holy sweet murder it's probably the least funny movie I've ever seen. you can take my word for it as a truth because it is being broadcast on television right now. it's really one of the most pathetic productions I've ever seen. there is not one redeemable aspect of this film. it just lacks humor whatsoever. the only good thing to do is that it's so funny that it's totally immutable. In fact, I sat in front of a ridiculous sub-plot and I can not really tell you what happened. the only reason I can possibly remember seeing this movie is that it's so devoid of humor that it will remain etched in my mind forever based solely on this one. <br /> <br /> it's an event not to be missed. if your friend wants to show it to you, shoot him and save yourself from boredom.
