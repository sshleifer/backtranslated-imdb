I watched the first show in each series just to see and what a waste of time. Emmerdale's daughter was fat, so yes, she should be a big friend, but no one has lost her weight. <br /> <br /> As Itv made a big mistake with that. <br /> <br /> Bad Girls is 100 times better. <br /> <br /> I think the whole show was about tall people trying to lose weight, but they never did it again. This broadcast was not repeated on ITV2 / 3/4. YOU MUST BEWARE
