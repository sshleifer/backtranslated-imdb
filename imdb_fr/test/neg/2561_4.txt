I remember when it came out, it was the first kung fu movie ever, and we were all looking forward to seeing it. Although the action was mediocre at best, it gave us our first taste of kung-fu and our first taste of bad dubbing as well as bad film or more exactly as the Chinese made movies at the time. Granted, they were definitely lower, but there was an entertainment value here and this attracted on for sure. The madness of kung fu had started and Bruce Lee and "The Chinese Connection" would soon be either "The Chinese Boxer" with Jimmy Wang Yu. In any case, this film was chosen to show the way.
