Oh my God, it's awful. Stay away, just stay away. If you think you've seen bad movies, think again. Never before had my brain suffered so much after watching this film. The action, if so called, is enough to cause internal bleeding inside your head. The story is so thin that it's barely there ... no waiting, scratch it. There is no complete story about it, but from time to time, a few thin lines come from horror, and believe me, those few lines should have been turned. The best way to enjoy this movie is to place napalm on it and watch the warm fire from afar. <br /> <br /> Some may call me sarcastic in this criticism, but I'm only trying to spare you a serious headache. However, if you are what I like to call a visual masochist (like me), go ahead, look at this monstrosity.
