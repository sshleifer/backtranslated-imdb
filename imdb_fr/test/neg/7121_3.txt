I loved the first grudge, I watched it in an empty theater and, in all honesty, I was panicked. Never before had I heard the unique sound of chilling sounds, it was really striking. <br /> <br /> However, the Grudge 2 had some good jumps, but the story was messy, and not quite believable, and everywhere, with a few scenes (like a woman who's urging for fear, or another young woman drinking a pitcher of milk then vomiting it again), which made no sense and which help to improve the creep factor of the film. During these and other scenes, sold-out spectators laughed out loud. It was a good indicator to show how much this film lacked chills, chills or goose bumps. The acting was decent, the emotions portrayed were credible, so the actors' hat was low, but the cluttered scenario and lack of direction were something I could not shake throughout the film. I was irritated more than anything, the same old grudges of grudge, some unexpected scenes to blow me up, but overall, I was very disappointed.
