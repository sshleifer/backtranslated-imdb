At the bottom of the Apocalypse movie is this piece of pish called "The Final Executioner" ... at least where I come from. A former police officer leads a guy to take revenge on those who killed his wife and his cool friends ... and that's about it. Many dummy explosions and repetitive fire ensue. Has one of the strangest costumes I've seen in a movie for a while and a huge fortress apparently run by only 7 people. Great job on dubbing also guys (!) Best moment: when our hero loses a swordfight and is about to be passed by the neck, he just takes out his gun and his boom! Why not do it sooner? It's a mystery. Why would anyone want to sit through this in the first place. I'm still puzzled by this one right now. 2/10
