JP3 does not have the Spielberg touch. It's an assault on all the senses featuring dinosaurs "in your face". Watching this movie was a bit like a hellish mountain in hell. <br /> <br /> The script is lame; he asks simultaneously and leaves too many questions unanswered. Plus, we do not really appreciate humans in the movie for all they are worth. For example, William H. Macy is too talented to compete with dinosaurs for our attention. And Laura Dern was particularly nice in JP1; in this film, she barely made a background noise on the radar screen. <br /> <br /> The whole experience JP3 was a little fishy. Too much noise, too many surprises, too many characters disappearing, too predictable, free violence. <br /> <br /> Word to the wise: vote yourself on this island. <br /> <br /> (I noted 3 for special effects, I removed the other 7 points to have no originality.)
