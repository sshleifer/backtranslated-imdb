This movie is really bad. The hero can not play. You see too much that he learned to walk by heart. And believe me, he walks a lot. For 45 minutes, nothing happens. It only goes around and out ..... As if the story was so short that it had to be extended by adding unnecessary scenes and boring "looks-like-a-suspense". <br /> <br /> The dialogues are very poor. I counted a lot of "hello" and some "hung" at the first part. <br /> <br /> The blood is orange like the Mercurochrome you put on the children's bulbs. And the scenes do not follow each other. A bloody neck on a stage, a clean neck on the following. <br /> <br /> The story could have been improved. Yeah, I mean, what's this story? <br /> <br /> Martial arts? Or? Is the martial arts? Watch as the movements are hesitant and slow !!!!! If kicking and receiving a punch is called martial arts, then I'm Bruce Lee !!!! <br /> <br /> The only good thing I found is fighting scenes: they do not play with zoom and fast switching scenes that gives you a headache in most action movies . <br /> <br /> There are many low budget movies that are excellent. That one was just to make money. Nothing else.
