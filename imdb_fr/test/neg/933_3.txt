I was watching the beginning of this show on a Friday, mid-day, while working at the computer at home, relaxing a bit after a hectic week, cleaning up files and answering communications. Has been interrupted several times, so I had trouble developing all the details (although it is not a work of the proportions of Hitchcock, where to miss a detail in all the distant history), and in addition it was not really a "captivating" piece of work. <br /> <br /> Thus, during an advertisement, read the only previous comment (by "mgconlan-1"), and you will agree quite well with its details. <br /> <br /> Not quite in the category of such an awful movie that it's fascinating "good", but I'd like to catch on tape when we shoot again (rather than see it as broadcast) , so that I can move quickly if necessary and see the parts I missed this first time. <br /> <br /> Give it a "3 *" because of the appeal of the four main characters.
