"The Man From Utah" opens on a singing cowboy who scratches a guitar on horseback. John Weston (John Wayne) was introduced as he headed for the city and was looking for work. When he helps Marshal Higgins (George Pre-Gabby Hayes) to thwart a robbery in a bank, the marshal offers him a sting job as a deputy to investigate the Dalton Valley rodeo. Apparently, the annual rodeo winners are a group of bad boys closely linked to the job of Spike Barton (Ed Peil), who also runs the rodeo committee. The serious contenders for the supremacy of Barton's best man Cheyenne Kent (Yakima Canutt) have been gravely ill or dead. <br /> <br /> Even back in the 1930s, Lone Star Westerns, John Wayne, had a charismatic presence evoking the future quality of stars. Seeing Wayne so young in these movies is a real treat. The film itself runs at a rapid pace of fifty-three minutes, largely borrowed from stock rodeo sequences of ropes, bulldogging and parades and Indian dances. At the decisive rodeo, Weston avoids the disaster by discovering a poisoned needle inserted in the saddle of "Dynamite", a hitherto ungraded bronco on which it must survive Cheyenne. <br /> <br /> The end is not a surprise, as Barton's villains give up winning the rodeo events and winning the entire thirty-thousand-dollar prize at the local bank. But Marshal and Weston are here to thwart their plans and save the day for the Dalton Valley Rodeo. And as we've seen in movies such as "Neath the Arizona Skies" and "Randy Rides Alone", Wayne's character ends the movie arguing with a pretty young woman, this time Judge Marjorie Carter's daughter (Polly Ann Young), who looks up to her throughout the movie.
