I registered on IMDb.com to comment on this movie. My god, what a pile of steaming shit it was! It should not even be presented as a real movie, it's very disappointing. it's at best a 15-year film project. The acting is terrible. But even good actors could not save that. The dialogue is probably the worst part of this movie. Who wrote this shit? And this constant joke from the chubby lesbian about Kaye, a "damsel in distress," has aged very quickly. My God, I'd rather have a camel take a wet dump in my ear than look at that shit again. Do not rent this movie. If they gave you the movie for free, do not look at it. crush him with a hammer. Even if breaking this video made you lose your Hollywood video account or blockbuster, it would be worth it. it is an abomination. I guess I said everything about it without being redundant. all questions .... write to me.
