Oh, where do I start? Give a brief summary of the story? No, you've heard it before or you do not want it. Anyway, it sucks. A bit like the movie. I'm a big fan of horror movies, and I must say it's one of the most stupid and clumsily executed movies I've ever had the displeasure to see. <br /> <br /> The script is horribly stupid. The story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or accumulation at all. All these scenes of torture would have been MUCH more effective if we had given the slightest bit of shit to the characters. Since the first scene of the film, teenage girls meet the captain. Howdy, how the hell are we supposed to sympathize with them? First, they seem stupid to go to a party with a guy they do not even know, and second, we do not even know their name! Why the hell should I worry if they live or die? Not to mention the fact that they have the courage to try to make us feel sympathetic to the Capt. Howdy after he was "reformed"? PLEASE! I was excited when he had his just desert! He deserved them! Hell, he deserved worse! Moreover, we are obliged to go unnoticed in a wrong and useless sequence drawn directly from "The silence of the lambs" (and here it is done horribly!) Of course, it will give them a false address! had given the real one, do not you think he would wait and not see Johnson on the floor? DELAYED!) <br /> <br /> Then there is the dialogue. All that Captain Howdy says is either laughable or just stupid. "The dead are terribly dead, when they are dead" ?? What is this kind of bullshit ?! Dee Snider at one point says "knowledge is power". Well, if it's true, this movie has absolutely no power. <br /> <br /> Then there are the holes of the plot. Yes, I know it's a horror movie (well, a Wannabe horror movie), but damn it! You could drive a semi truck into these holes! First of all, these are the DUMBEST cops I've ever seen! ALREADY!! I mean, DEAR GOD, these guys are morons! Call for backup, idiots! Second, how did this huge septum ring fall from Captain Howdy's nose ?! Obviously, this piercing expert says "it's the biggest I've ever seen," but if he's so fat, how could he have done so easily? Did captain Howdy just LEAVE him at the scene of the crime because he WOULD get caught? They certainly did not make him believe. Besides, they would NEVER release Captain Howdy, and I know that. He would be in prison for the rest of his life, and there is no way out. Even less let him go back to his old house where he killed / tortured everyone. IMPOSSIBLE AND IMPLAUSIBLE. <br /> <br /> And now, the acting game. Dear God, have these people been void? Linda Cardellini is the only good thing about this movie. She is ready and amazing. Too bad she barely has a chance to act in this shit. Amy Smart comes for about 10 minutes, then disappears. Even the very entertaining Robert Englund is underutilized and ineffective here. Dee Snider plays the crazy guy without any talent. I never felt threatened, scared or intimidated. I would have preferred to see Dee Snider in the role of Alexis Arquette in "Bride of Chucky". It would have been so much more fun to see this hack without talent being caught by this adorable psychopathic doll. <br /> <br /> Dee Snider is completely nil. He can not play (one of the least scary bad guys I've ever seen), he can not write (did he write this movie in his sleep?), And he's obviously more silly than the crazy Jessica Simpson! This film is just a way for Dee Snider to show all the strange bullshit he knows about self-mutilation, modern primitives and blah-blah-blah. Either it was done before, or it was not necessary. I was bored all the way through this damn thing. <br /> <br /> The game is zero, the music is zero, the scenario is zero, the rhythm is zero, the special effect is zero, the achievement is zero ... basically, this film is zero. This film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thriller / horror film and it fails miserably. He can not frighten, shock or disturb in any way. It's probably one of the least effective and least original films I've ever seen in my life. A piece of cinematographic garbage captured on celluloid. <br /> <br /> "Strangeland" gets a 0 out of 10. Avoid at all costs. Not nice at all.
