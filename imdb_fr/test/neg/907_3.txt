Sigh. I am confused when I see a short film like this one attracting attention, homework and so on. I saw this film at a festival before the filmmaker got attention and forgot about it immediately afterwards. It was slightly annoying to see him sweep Grinch Who Stole's gag of hearts with the narration, the scenography seen many times before, Tim Burton's utterly feeble style and the story that leads nowhere. And we had the "joke" about shooting the crows with the 45 the first time, okay? <br /> <br /> But I guess what's really unacceptable is that he even sweeps his basic concept in a 1999 comic called LENORE, The Dead Girl of Roman Dirge! Like any fast internet search will reveal it. I mean, what is it? That's what they found a contract in Hollywood and opens doors in Canada for a filmmaker? "Shake your head," Don Cherry might say.
