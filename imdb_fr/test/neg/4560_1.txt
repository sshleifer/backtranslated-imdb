The comments of Commune make it a very interesting film, a subject that would interest me deeply. Unfortunately, producers have not seen fit to include subtitles for the deaf and hard of hearing. That leaves me and countless people like me, who depend on closed captions to follow a movie, completely. <br /> <br /> This is inexcusable for all films produced in 2005. In a world where all kinds of disabilities and disabilities are taken care of, it's infuriating and ironic that the entertainment industry, which is still unpleasant, do not ask cinemas to be subtitled.
