I can not believe it's a movie I did not like. . . I generally find that I am open-minded to all sorts of things. . . but this movie is just bad. <br /> <br /> I could deal with the subject if the script and the story were better. I could handle the acting if the camera work was better or the characters were better established. . . I think it comes down to scenario and direction. <br /> <br /> it was just bad. <br /> <br /> I want to give this note the lowest note, but. . . I do not believe that, at least this guy went out of his way to make a movie. . . so he gets four stars (just above the average rating so far)
