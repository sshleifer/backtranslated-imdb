I thought it would be an OK movie after seeing the commercials about it. It was funny in some places and some very nasty. The only person I felt sorry for was Horatio Sans, who had a scorching woman who cheated on him with other women. But he never had the chance to make a trio before and it was good, but they should have done bigger through the movie.
