I think I saw a very edited version because it was not as graphic as I had hoped - according to other reviews I heard. <br /> <br /> Other than 1. being written by the same person "Emmanuelle" (1974) of origin, Emmanuelle Arsan, 2. the main character being a sexually free spirit and 3. being located in the exotic place of Asia, "Laure" does not have the same talent as its predecessor. I just found this film too talkative with philosophical topics that do not really interest me, namely the open voyeuristic relationship between Laure and Nick, "I'm just happy with what gives him pleasure". .. something in this sense. I can not relate to this mentality and the movie / characters do not really light up. <br /> <br /> The second part, devoted to the research of the Mara tribe, seemed to be a completely separate film. One that I did not like. At that time, I was just hoping it would turn into pornography so that at least that would keep me interested. <br /> <br /> Maybe I just did not understand it. <br /> <br /> I will leave it there.
