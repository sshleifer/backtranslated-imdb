This sinister account of popular vengeance is simply not very interesting, even with Ed McMahon in a mature role as a heavy leader. Jim Brown gives a good kick to the ass, Gloria Hendry proves once again that she can give life to the poorest roles, and Brock Peters is decent as a cop who plays by the book. It is still dull and poorly constructed, and even the copy shown on the cable is now emasculated from its original James Brown score.
