This is just one of those movies that keep you moaning and wanting to be finished. The problems are many and the positives are few. I think the main problem with this movie is that it's a ridiculous plot. They are trying to make this movie an epic movie, a movie about the super evil monkeys and the clever ones who sign that it's not epic, it's cheese. When you have cheese, you make the movie more fun. Admittedly, the final scene with the monkeys and this laser was very nice to watch and more things of this nature were needed. Instead, the actors are doing such a serious job that you feel that the movie has a mundane plot in the middle of all the serious tension the movie is trying to put in place. The plot revolves around a woman trying to find out what happened to her ex-husband who disappeared while looking for some kind of legendary diamond. She uses these two types who have trained a monkey to sign language and now wish to bring her back to the wild as a blanket to enter the country and begin the mediocre adventure of a lifetime. The only thing that makes this movie a little tolerable is Ernie Hudson's character and the laser attack at the end.
