This film comes with "Gli fumavano the Colt ... lo chiamavano Camposanto" and both films leave much to be desired with regard to their DVD copies. First, both films are very dark, which sometimes prevents you from seeing exactly what is happening. Second, no movie has subtitles and you have to watch a dubbed movie - although "Il Prezzo del Potere" seems to have a better dubbing. Personally, I always prefer subtitles, but for non-purists, that's not a problem. These DVD problems, however, are not the fault of the original filmmakers - just the indifferent package marketed four decades later. <br /> <br /> As for the film, it's about the assassination of President Garfield. This is a major problem because Van Johnson looks almost as much to Garfield as to Judy Garland. In no way does he look like Garfield. Missing the beard, the wrong hair color and style and just not close (do not be fooled by that, I'm a professor of American history and we get paid to know this stuff !). Garfield's real life was a General of the American Civil War and resembled those of the Smith Brothers. In addition, using another actor to give voice to Johnson during dubbing is simply unreal. Never before or since, Van Johnson did not seem so macho! He was a good actor ... but certainly not a convincing general president or macho. <br /> <br /> In addition to the stupid cast, the death of President Garfield has nothing to envy to this film. It is obvious that the filmmakers are profiting from the wild speculation about the plots concerning the death of JFK, not Garfield. Garfield was shot in Washington DC (not Dallas) by one armed man with serious mental problems - not a group of men armed with rifles. However, according to most experts, what actually killed Garfield (more than two months later) are incompetent doctors - who probed and tried to recover a bullet (to no avail) and never bothered to wash hands or instruments. In other words, like George Washington (who was essentially killed by repeated bleeding in pneumonia), he died as a result of malpractice. In the film, they had absolutely nothing good ... except the president Garfield who was shot. <br /> <br /> Because the film has almost no similarity to the real story, it's like a history lesson taught by someone from the other planet. or someone with a serious brain injury. Why not include ninjas, battle robots and Greek gods while you're there?!?! Aside from some decent actor and production values, because the script is a cow poop, I do not recommend anyone to watch it. It's just a complete and total mess.
