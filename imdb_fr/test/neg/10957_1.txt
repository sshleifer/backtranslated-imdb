Unreal !!!!!!!!. After reading the first critics published by so-called critics, I was shocked to see that almost all of the initial critics, 38, rated the film as 10. In comparison with other major films , these critics felt that the Quick and the Undead was a better movie than, The 6th Sense (8.2), Saving Private Ryan (8.4), The Lord of the Rings (8.7), Godfather (9.5), Gladiator (8.1) and Dawn of the Dead (7.8), to name a few. Hopefully these companies are using their next low-cost lasik procedure, which they hear about, because it is quite obvious that these criticisms have been falsified. <br /> <br /> I was led to believe that this film presented a unique concept in the genre of making zombie movies. Unfortunately, after watching the movie Quick and the Undead, it is obvious that these critics were generated by people who participated in the production or had a direct interest in the marketability / financial success of the films. Nothing says more to me in the head than to learn that part of this film was shot in Texas and coincidentally the beginning of the ad that rented the movie. The Zombie / Horror B movie culture as a whole is an indulgent group, but this film is unfortunately beyond any redemption. The characters are recycled and the plot is mediocre. The quality of the movie was not bad enough to be tagged camcorder, and at least they used a movie quality camera. The game is horrible, the star trying unsuccessfully to pretend to be a Clint Eastwood who wants to be cloned. Christ on a bike !!!!!! Even the name of the main actor is Clint. He was just terrible. The only resemblance to Clint Eastwood is that the main role is to use the "wood" called Eastwood in his acting style. Zombie makeup was above the quality of the Halloween party, but was not fully applied to the members of the undead cast. Many zombies were not made up. The plot was so hokey that I was expecting a power failure, a flaw on the DVD, or that the zombies are turning to the director. The film may have value for some viewers, but not for my hard-earned dollar. Fortunately, I used my free rental coupon to view this DVD. Maybe this movie will be saved by Nott Entertainment (which is aptly named) by launching a special DVD for collectors, which will fix the flaws and deliver the promised products ??? Some how, I think NOTT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!! It only remains to be hoped that their next release, The Flesh Keeper, is truly the "keeper" of a movie ... and not a recycled version of the 5th generation of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. I'm crossing my fingers here, but only if you care.
