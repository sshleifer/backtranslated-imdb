I have heard a lot about the inventive work and direction of the camera in this film. I thought both were a mess <br /> <br /> also a really terrible acting game. The main "heroine" of the film is irritating and has absolutely nothing useful to bring in any situation. everything she does or says is stupid, and she usually just seems to ruin people's lives. if she could fight, I could forgive her <br /> <br /> All in all, all the women in this film are stereotypes that need a man to save them. and all the men in this film are muscular minds that can save anyone. <br /> <br /> It's a mediocre film, and I urge you to avoid it. look rather something like "the sword of misfortune" instead, I hear it much better than this confused mess of a movie.
