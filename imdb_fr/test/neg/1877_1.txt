I live in Mexico City, so I have to go through caravans for every trash that comes out of all those stupid Mexican filmmakers. Want to admire a Mexican for making good movies? Look at something from Guillermo del Toro (especially The Devil's Backbone), or perhaps Alfonso Cuar√≥n (although I do not really like his films, but I respect them). <br /> <br /> Mexican filmmakers often produce the most terrible garbage ever (Por la Libre, El Segundo Aire, American Visa), but it's one of the lowest points ever recorded in the world. Mexican films. If you respect your brain, please avoid this piece of **** at all costs. It would be smarter to watch a video of a wedding or to watch Britney's reality show. This has more IQ than everyone else in this "movie".
