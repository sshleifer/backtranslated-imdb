Lil Pimp is the story of a little boy who becomes a pimp. The animation and dubbing were perfect for this type of film. <br /> <br /> I laughed out loud for the first 20 minutes of this movie; especially to the concept. After that, the joke was thin. As an animated short of 15 to 20 minutes, Lil Pimp would have been a classic. Instead, this movie consists entirely of a joke that lasts far too long. <br /> <br /> Weathers, voiced by Ludicrous, has several rude and amusing duplicates. Unfortunately, that's all the boy's pet rat is good at because it does not help the story. Finally, his remarks bored me as much as the rest of this film. <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of South Park and other adult animation. I also play several online pimp games, so I prefer the stories of pimps. The transition from little boy to pimp was brilliant; but after that, history and dialogue have become redundant and predictable. <br /> <br /> I give this film a rating of five. It's worth looking for great concept and dubbing. Do not expect much otherwise you will be very disappointed.
