First of all, I just want to say that I'm a big fan of Naruto. I love stories of anime and manga. In addition, the first film has just confirmed that Naruto is synonymous with fun, action, and history, but the second movie has arrived. I was very excited because the first movie was great. But that did not satisfy me at all ... The story was lame, the action was not so great ... especially compared to the Anime series ... the same goes for the quality of the animation. I found it very bad ... The story could it attack everyone ... Where is the Kyuubi Naruto? Not once, it does not become demon ... I mean ... come !!! My advice is ... see the show (until episode 140, so these are just fillers) and then read the Manga because it's always great. Ignore this movie and hope for something better in the future ... <br /> <br /> To all I gave it a 4, just because it's Naruto ...
