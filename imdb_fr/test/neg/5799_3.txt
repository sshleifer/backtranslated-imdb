I have to say that this film really excited me before I praised it because it was a production of Adam Sandler's "Happy Madison" and I'm generally drawn to that kind of silly humor. <br /> <br /> There were some fun moments at the beginning of the film, but this film lacked everything that makes a good movie. I realize that a lot of unrealistic movies can still be quite fun, but this movie was unrealistic and not funny at all. The acting was awful, the cinematography was very poor, the plot was meaningless. I can not forget the fact that 3 older and more elegant ladies would even work for such a mediocre writing. Overall, this movie impressed me a lot and I do not recommend wasting $ 5 to rent it.
