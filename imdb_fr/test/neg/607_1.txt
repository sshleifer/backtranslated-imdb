I can not help but be completely bored by this sitcom. It's as if they did not even bother trying to write a good comedy, but just recite third-rate jokes and hope that sticks. The worst of all is that all this is so uninteresting and lacking in every respect. <br /> <br /> To make matters worse, the ruler Kevin James has a permanent smile "I'm so funny" on his face that would be tolerable if he only once delivered in the comedy department, this that he does not, he just stays there doing nothing like a big baby not funny. Which brings me to the relationship between the Heffernan - undoubtedly the most sincere and poorest representation of a married couple in a TV show, really bad head, unpleasant unworthy. Remini spends the entire series as if it were a violent chore to be around her own husband. Jerry Stiller pulls out the laughter of the series and repeats 100% Frank Costanza's role in Seinfeld, but this time, his allusions go mostly in the water because of the inability of the central duo to recognize a joke, even if he flew next. . The episodes drift in a stream of nothingness, their work adds nothing and their interaction is even worse. <br /> <br /> This is not even a waste of talent, there is no talent here, it's a creativity without laughing. desert.
