Based on the novel Elmore Leonard of the same name, Killshot suffers from a lack of concentration, direction and creativity ?? all the elements that the original story probably had, and the negative test projections forced severe modifications (including the complete disappearance of a character), resulting in a film that almost does not look like a Leonard story. Too many characters populate a story that is too simplistic and straightforward (which is not a typical feature of the author's work) and attention is continually shifting between two hard-to-love hit-boys and a troubled couple who do not command not our sympathy. Although the story itself brings only a few twists, its appeal is unfortunately mysterious at the end of the film. <br /> <br /> The big hit Armand "The Blackbird" Degas (Mickey Rourke) follows a strict code during his missions which inadvertently spoils his last mission. Now on the run from his former employer, he is randomly associated with Richie Nix (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), an unsuitable criminal, to quickly earn money by extorting a wealthy real estate agent. When troubled couples Carmen and Wayne Colson (Diane Lane and Thomas Jane) are aware of the thieving plot of the thieves, they are forced to hide, the crazy killers recoiling at nothing to silence the two witnesses. <br /> <br /> Killshot proves that being based on an Elmore Leonard novel is not a cause for immediate success, nor even a promising adaptation. The characters, situations and even the resolutions of the film are all tired and unoriginal and only suggest something very random. It's not that there was no potential, especially when Rourke's black-haired, calm and collected assassin performed a hit during the opening scene? goal and the main ones are just continually abandoned every minute. The style and manner in which each character is introduced are the most intriguing; visually, the roles of Bird and even Wayne are fleshed out as appropriate, giving immediate interest and depth to the characters that usually end in a creative stalemate. <br /> <br /> The combination of the cold and calculating black bird with the irrational and explosive Richie is an alluring combination (a comparison with Fargo would be exceedingly nice), except that each character seems to slowly lose track of traits that kept them initially interesting. As Richie begins to assimilate the habits of the more experienced killer, Bird releases his grip on his own methods of murder. Regardless of what he sees in his momentary adventure with Donna (Rosario Dawson), it is hard to imagine that his final confrontation with Carmen, panicked, would cause a confession of his true nature and a subsequent recklessness that would dramatically affect his outcome. Probably or not, is the unfortunate loss of Killshot? and little entertainment can be obtained from these characters who gradually lose their originality by continually contradicting the habits that had once intrigued them. <br /> <br /> - The Massie twins
