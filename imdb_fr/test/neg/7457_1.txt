This Canadian "film" is the worst! Incredibly amateur. When the bad guys break into a boat, we see two women with machine guns and one of them says in a low voice, "We steal your boat!" She blinks and is totally shy! Very intimidating. ROTFLOL !!! <br /> <br /> The two heroes of karate cutting are over 40 years old, two twin brothers five feet! They are very bad actors. In fact, all the people involved in this production are non-actors. <br /> <br /> There are so many errors of continuity in this inexpensive production that it is amazing. In a scene, guys wear a type of swimsuit. In the next stroke, they wear completely different swimsuits. <br /> <br /> Absolutely terrible! A must for any fan of bad movies. I have it on VHS. It's very rare. I love him
