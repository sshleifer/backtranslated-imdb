It was on SciFi last weekend and I had to take a look. After all ... it was science fiction, with vampires and Erika Eleniak. What could be wrong with this B movie? <br /> <br /> Many. <br /> <br /> For starters, he can not even be classified in the category "B-movie" because it would put him in the same league as Roger Corman ... and this film does not even respond to his expectations. The most money they spent was on contact lenses for vampires. <br /> <br /> Second: the casting was horrible. Indeed, designating Udo Kier as captain of the Demeter was a wise decision ... but the director obviously could not even ask Kier to memorize his lines. Casting Eleniak, in a vampire movie, is also a wise decision, because it means that a group of horny guys will buy / rent / record this movie to see her seduced by a vampire. But, the director, screenwriter and producer screwed this one too. Granted, they have received money from poor, unhappy souls who like to watch vampire movies with exciting women ... but no one will remember this movie in two or three years. <br /> <br /> Third: small things that only emphasize laziness in this film. For example, Van Helsing calls a cross a "crucifix" and when Mina is suspended in the coffin, the viewer can clearly see that her "chest" is nothing but pillows. <br /> <br /> Oh And another thing: why did they choose George Hamiltion's Dracula instead of something that would look decently scary? Does George Hamilton have a crushing grip on our future? Why did not everyone who saw Dracula mock him for his outfit? <br /> <br /> A waste of time. Even with a TiVo remote in your hand.
