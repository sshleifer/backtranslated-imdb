No matter what you say, it's a serial movie, and the effects are poorly made. If you are a vampire fanatic, I guess it would be OK, not 10 out of 10, you can not honestly say that ?? we must consider this as a film and not as a book. Effects and characters are important, as is history. The story is good, but it does not carry the film, so there is nothing surprising. I write this because I chose to watch this movie when I saw good reviews on IMDb, but I was seriously disappointed. do not get me wrong, I thought that the movies of the blade were great and loved the movies of the underworld, but these characters are not close. the makeup on vampires is poorly done and the effects are worse. it sucks. I might not have been so disappointed if I had not read the reviews here who told me how great it was. the reviewers must have had something to do with the production company or something, seriously, if you think it's great, you do not care about playing or putting on makeup. it's better like a book. 3 out of 10 for a story OK.
