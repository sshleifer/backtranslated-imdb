OK, so I know better than watching movies on SciFi. . . uh, sorry. . . SyFy. Or shifafa. Or anything now. So prosecute me. I spent all my Saturday brainstorming on an advisory board for a non-profit organization. I can be forgiven for sitting in my chair and wanting to watch a movie I have never seen, rather than reading Proust in the original or learning to play the oud. <br /> <br /> That is to say, I did not deserve Open Graves. Of which I did not see any, incidentally. Was there any? Did I fall asleep? Why are we calling it? <br /> <br /> Viscous images. Not a lot of scares. As with too many movies in modern horror movies, no reason is given - apart from shared humanity - to care about these people. A half-point, however, for the legless entrepreneur who cliche, but who has a good scene. <br /> <br /> All this plays like Final Destination, delivered via a board game. The game has an intriguing appearance, and it involves one of my favorite old riddles. I will give it a lot. The downside is that the game had more personality than most characters. <br /> <br /> As for the end, if you do not see it coming, then I think YOU fell asleep. Somewhere at the dawn of the genre.
