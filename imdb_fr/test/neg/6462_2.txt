I am a big fan of Northern Exposure. Men In Trees is a complete imitation of Northern Exposure. There are New York city dwellers stuck in a small, remote town (Marin Frist / Joel Fleishman). She does not immediately get along with a local (Jack Slattery / Maggie O'Connell). The city has only one driver that is not often available. There is only one radio program. And the whole series speaks of weird people with sincere and strange relationships. Too many parallels. Just like Northern Exposure except an obvious demographic element has been changed in each character. I am bored. Give me something new to think. <br /> <br /> The writing is pretty good. But if it was a school project, he would certainly have earned the seal of plagiarism. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the people who love this show have been safe from the dedicated creativity and hard work of Joshua Brand and John Falsey.
