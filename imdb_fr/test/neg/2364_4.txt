A young woman nicknamed "T.N.T." for being virtually dynamited in a fight and a coup de gr√¢ce in terms of insider research, travels to the most lawless part of Hong Kong in search of his missing brother, Stag Jackson. When she learns that he has been murdered, she decides to bring the murderer to justice as best as she can. <br /> <br /> That sounds good, does not it? Well, there is really nothing wrong with the basic premise as a starting point for a martial arts / blaxploitation action thriller, and that's what it's for. The tracks are also very good with Jeanne Bell who fits perfectly in the role of "T.N.T." and Stan Shaw is doing well as ambitious Charlie, power hungry. Where it fails miserably is in terms of the combat it offers. The fight scenes are completely and completely unconvincing and / or sometimes so completely out of date that they reach the point of ridicule, which does not help the main purpose of your film is a Kung Fu action heroine. Also, the low lighting, the actors wear accents that make them difficult to understand, the confusing camera work and the sometimes mediocre sound do not help in any way this obvious effort to small budget. That delivers in a field that may delight some fans, it offers a lot of T in "T & A", in fact, virtually every fight scene in the movie is preceded by some sort of nudity scene and Jeanne Bell actually has a prolonged fight scene in which she is completely topless. <br /> <br /> In the end, this can not be something you want to revisit because the fight scenes are so pathetic, so laughs.
