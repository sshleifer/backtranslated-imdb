The screenplay for "The Stranger" is a bit of the 1969 film "Journey to the Far Side of the Sun" (directed by Gerry & Sylvia Anderson in the films "Thunderbirds" and "Space: 1999"). A parallel universe Earth is the premise of these two films. But there is a difference. Where the world in "The Stranger" presents a totalitarian regime aimed at crushing the freedom of citizens, "Journey to the Far Face of the Sun" simply shows a mirror world where writing, roads, homes, machines of all kinds and good sure, the internal organs were all in reverse order (or mirrored). Thus, the similarity of parallel lands is the only link between the two films. <br /> <br /> Similarly, the television series "Land of the Giants" preceded these two films, having been broadcast from 1968 to 1970. It included a world almost parallel to the Earth, except for the fact that that the planet was populated with giants 12 times larger than the humans who crashed there. The idea of ​​a totalitarian government aimed at capturing and containing the "little people" was more like the premise of "The Stranger" than that of "JTTFSOTS". Perhaps because of the same thing as "LOTG", a series of "The Stranger" was put aside. If it had turned into a television series, it would be a sci-fi version of "The Fugitive", with the star Glenn Corbett continued week by week by the bad guys, hidden in different places, etc. helped this movie along.
