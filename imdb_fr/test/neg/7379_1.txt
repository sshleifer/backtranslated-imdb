As Anthony Bourdain said ... "I wanted to sink my head into a bucket of laundry, remove my eyes and jump off a cliff." This sums up my feelings about this pathetic waste of human effort. No art, complacent, carefree and just plain bad. Bad beyond understanding. What else can I say? If you are unfortunate enough to be in a region where this piece of foolish idiot plays, please feel sorry for soul and avoid at all costs.
