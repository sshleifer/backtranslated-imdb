As much as I hate the film that this series follows, I can at least say that Zangief was fun. The animated series is probably one of the worst things ever produced. The animation is quite often inconsistent, even if it remains systematically bad. The shape of a character's face is even able to change radically in the same plane. The screenplay and dubbing also leave much to be desired because most of the actors seem as talented as those of a third-year play. Characters like Cammy and DJ are so compelled to stereotype their nationality that the episodes that contain them are almost physically painful to watch, even if the show is not painful anyway. Plots of episodes seem to strive to reach new levels of lame each turn and are so full of holes that it amazes me that they have had time to show ads. Honestly, it amazes me that anyone who pays to advertise during the show. In addition to being a bad series, it is an even worse adaptation of Street Fighter. Many characters retain the movie adaptations that failed. Examples include Ken and Ryu being silly crooks (though Ken is supposed to be rich), Blanka being the friend of Guiles, Charlie, and Chun Li, a journalist. It takes talent to take something as serious as the film and make it worse.
