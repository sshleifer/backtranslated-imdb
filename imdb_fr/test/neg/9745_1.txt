I do not care what others say, this film is the worst waste of this movie. What was John Landis thinking? <br /> <br /> I know it's based on a series of children's books, but come on! Even children hate this movie. It's useless and boring. Tom Arnold demonstrates once again that his only talent is to waste production money. <br /> <br /> I think the only reason The Stupids did not feature in the 100 worst movies of all time is that there are only about 20 people. admit to looking at this trash. At least Hobgoblins did it on MST3K.
