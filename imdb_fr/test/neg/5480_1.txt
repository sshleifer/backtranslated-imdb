This game was terrible. I think they worked too hard on the visuals and did not do much with the gameplay, which is the most important part. I mean, the graphics are incredible, but is the game really "fun"? NO! I mean, it's like "hey, let's jump buildings" and all I do is hold and A / X. The game just is not there, and I do not agree with what Ubisoft did, because they had this sexy girl (the producer of the game, Jade Raymond), and they said to themselves "OK, we have this hot girl, let's papper her" and if you go to the gaming sites , you will not see the Assassin's Creed content in the game, you will see his face with a microphone and it will be like "We interviewed Jade Raymond about his favorite cookies!" It's like a man, close the F * @ K UP WHO CARES ?! Apparently ... a lot of people do it, because they bought the game and liked it ... I mean, compare this game to Super Mario Galaxy. A Wii game that does not really abuse the Wii Remote, but STILL is very innovative and offers the most important part, GAMEPLAY! They could do a little bit of everything with Mario Galaxy, the graphics were always amazing, the music of the game was orchestrated and sounded incredible, and it's a game that deserves the game of the year. NOT Assassin's Creed, man, he does not even deserve to be NOMINATED for the game of the year. The hype around this game where it was like "oh that's the next generation of games" .... really? I do not think so! So let me understand, because I think that people who love this game only like it because they are Jade fans, so I will tell you that JADE WILL NOT FIRE WITH YOU OR WHAT IF YOU LOVE OR DEFEND THIS GAME! If you want a REAL game on PS3, get Uncharted: Drake's Fortune, if you want a REAL game on the Xbox 360, get Call of Duty 4 (and a ton of other games), and if you want a TRUE game, in all systems? GET SUPER MARIO GALAXY! I know this comment will be hated by many, but seriously, by pressing two buttons to do all these cool things, is this really a fun game? The only reason other games make things more complicated is because afterwards it will be more innovative and fun. And this game just is not. <br /> <br /> 1.3 / 10 A LIVING HELL!
