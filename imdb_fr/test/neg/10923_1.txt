First of all, I am by no means a difficult film observer. I'm not one of those who have movies just to pinpoint the flaws and criticize, I watch, like most people, watch for entertainment. Basically, I will look at any type of movie, no matter how bad someone is (sometimes, a movie is so terribly done and writes that it invokes some sort of pitiful humor that I take a liking for.) Despite all that, lil Pimp was just pathetic. I saw it on TV and I just did not know what I was watching. It was too badly written and old-fashioned to be an adult movie, and there was far too much sex, innuendo and swearing to be a children's movie, in fact, I doubt that even the children were amused. The humor (quite generous even calling it so) was so pretentious and campy, I could not see how someone with a half-wit could even find it funny. The only thing that made me laugh was that people like Bernie Mac and ridiculous could put their name and their time on something so painful. Luda's character was so cheap a ploy to laugh at, which was way below his goal. The plot was meaningless, the scenario had to be the worst sequence of events ever organized on the screen. I could go on, but I want to see what people think of my reaction before I start talking about specific scenes of pathetic scenes. All I have to say is that you really have to wonder how long these writers have been on their knees trying to get it made. <br /> <br /> J
