... Or is it another way to pass below the masterpiece of the bottom of the drum? Preferably both! Somewhere between 1969 and 1972, many horror horror movies are lost again. Nothing more needs to be explained, asked or shouted aloud. If you followed my writings on CARNAVAL OF BLOOD or GURU THE MAD MOK, then you know what SCREAM BABY SCREAM has to offer. The title sounds good; it's just the weak script that should have gone elsewhere! Nevertheless, it is by far the most horribly written piece of cinematic mastery that has ever been worked on a movie! , more luck next time! The real truth behind the screenplay has nothing to do with the film, which is supposed to tell that a blue-faced psychopath is trying to "kill" and make very bad facial sculptures on his victims. It feels like watching another episode of "SCOOBY-DOO" at the beginning. My favorite scene is the monkey cage where the four young hippie teens play. And congratulations for an actress under the name "Eugenie Wingate" for giving us the worst makeover of the face, never realized! 1969 has never been so bad, but it is! <br /> <br /> Try to find this 30-year-old rarity in a cheap basement for five dollars; it's the best thing about new stuff to get back to those psychedelic days of being able to bloom, go bad, and have trashy music! Interesting note: SCREAM BABY SCREAM is also included in Troma's film archive on the company's website. Only time will tell when this will reach the top of the list of the last 100 with some other cheap products of the early 70s; that then they must NEED !!! PLAN 9 is history !!!
