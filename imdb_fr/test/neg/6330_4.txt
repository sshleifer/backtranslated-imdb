I do not understand people here. The movie is not as bad as some say here. Except for De Kok, the acting is OK. The problem with the movie is mainly the script. The characters are not credible. Sex is good, but the psychology behind people does not make much sense. The film does not look good, but what are you waiting for? The film was shot for very little money on video. Of course, it does not seem to be as good as a normal movie, duh! The only thing I agree on is that the music is bad. It sounds like a cheap and erotic film from the 80s. The film is not good, all right, but you have to admit that you managed to shoot it without money.
