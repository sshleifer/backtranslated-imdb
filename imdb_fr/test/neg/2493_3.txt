I watched it years ago on TV when I was sick (I do not know, I tend to be more complacent with what I watch on TV when I'm sick; use the remote, I guess). <BR /> <br /> As far as I remember, every aspect of the film - casting, acting, writing, directing, etc. - was at best badly advised. I could have forgiven historic inaccuracies if this film had created an impression of what it was to work on Trinity; but that was not the case. There have been attempts to humanize scientists, but they have been inadequate and have never transcended the caricature. <br /> <br /> I did not know much about the people involved in the Manhattan project at the time, but the representations in the film were so caricatural that I was interested in learning more about real people. And I did. So, I guess this horrible film did very little good, after all. <br /> <br /> This is not an in-depth review, but the FMLB does not deserve or require one. You could enjoy it if you are a fan of bad movies.
