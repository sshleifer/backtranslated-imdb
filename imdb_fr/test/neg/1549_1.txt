For a moment, it seemed to me that this show was about 24/7. Then, apparently, there was a second season or some other kind of continuation of this horrible show on the two most insipid and vain people ever filmed. All the other comments perfectly captured the essence of these two selfish airheads, haggish. One can not say much less about it than the others. <br /> <br /> I doubt that these two ladies have a soul and that they are probably a kind of good deal of Faustian to get their stunning muzzles a television series. May fate protect the human race from further exposure to Ghastly Girls!
