Lonesome Dove is my second favorite western after The Searchers with John Wayne. I watch Lonesome Dove about every 6 months and I do not get tired of it. I read all of LD's books, even though I do not remember much about Comanche Moon. I too was looking forward to this mini-series and decided to record it on our digital recorder so we could move quickly in the commercials. Unfortunately, I was wrong and I did not record the first part, but I decided to watch the other parts and try to play. <br /> <br /> There is no one who can compete with Robert Duvall or Tommy Lee Jones. and I expected to be disappointed. <br /> <br /> Although there are so many things that do not sound as expected, the most obvious for me is when Nellie died the day before and that Gus was at the Elle turned to Clara and wrote to her a letter from Nebraska telling her how sorry she was to hear of her death. How in the world could she have known the next day's outing in Nebraska? Moreover, she must have been seven years later, and her children seemed to be between 6 and 7 years old, maybe a little younger, but they still had more time before moving to Lonesome Dove, and Lonesome Dove was there about 10 years or more before leaving for Montana. When they stopped at Clara's in Nebraska, which probably took six more months on the trail, the girls seemed to be between 10 and 13 years old, as they played in the yard like little children. Math simply does not matter. <br /> <br /> I agree that the man who played Gus had a lot of his manners and looked a little like Gus could have looked like a young man. <br /> <br /> I'm also a little confused about something. The captive white girl they brought back - was she the one they captured when they attacked Austin? They said she was captured 25 years ago, but if she was captured in Austin, it was only 7 years later that it happened in the movie. Was she captured earlier? I remember seeing a girl captive after going down into the city and I do not know if it's the same. If anyone can explain since I missed part 1. If it was 25 years, she would probably be over 40 when they found her, because she seemed to grow on the floor. Also, given the way they ravaged her when they captured her, it's hard to believe she would have survived before getting married and having Indian children. <br /> <br /> I must admit that nothing is worse. John Voight plays Call in the wake of Lonesome Dove or Lorena's incredible marriage to Pea Eye in McMurty's sequel to Lonesome Dove, which has never been explained either. In addition, the way he killed Newt was that I heard about their nastiness as they were following up with John Voight without his approval. <br /> <br /> If anyone could resolve these differences, I would appreciate it.
