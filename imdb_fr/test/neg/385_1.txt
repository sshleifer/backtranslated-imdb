I also lent this film to 15 people .. NO Someone finished it .. It was so terribly. ???????? Not good ... just horrible. She is sitting on a chair throughout the movie. She is in a closet. The chair where she sits is beautiful. I can not think of anything else. But 10 lines of text. To print it. My friend Nick thinks it's a good movie. "Because," he can give it to his friends, without having to worry about what CES reminds him. He spread it like a gag for 10 years. And that's how I got it ... Then ... I tried to get my friends to finish the awful horrible horrible of this end ... No avalanche ... no one could finish it ... Takes the boredom to a whole new level. They could use this in Iraq instead of taking water ... PLEASE SEND COPIES Guantanamo BAY CUBA. Makes a great Christmas present.
