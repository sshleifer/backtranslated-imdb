At the time of writing, no user reviews are yet available, but there are 17 votes for an average of 4.8, so apparently some people thought this movie had its highlights. I did not notice, and even though I had it, I did not think I could have stopped rolling my eyes long enough to appreciate them. <br /> <br /> A common debate among moviegoers is whether science, police tactics, etc., so common in B-series movies, should greatly affect its enjoyment. I tend to fall in the camp "Yes, it's a reasonable reaction" - especially when mistakes are at the heart of the plot. With this movie, I can not wait to read how anyone can defend this mess. They completely hide all aspects of military tactics and strategy, the police, weapons, science, folklore, common sense and human behavior (apart from B-movies). In short, I do not see anything trivial that they were right. <br /> <br /> Any film would have work to do when its basic principle is a supernatural mind, insensitive to all small arms, able to disappear at will in another dimension apparently vulnerable to simple bigger explosion. (They do not make ghosts like before.) Combine this principle with every detail that goes wrong and you get a memorable movie.
