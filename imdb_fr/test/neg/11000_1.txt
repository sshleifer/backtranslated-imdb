It's one of the most stupid and worthless movies of all time. It really does not qualify for movie status. It's VERY cheap (apparently filmed on a videotape), horribly played and just rotten. I could not believe how cheap and inept this piece of shit was. It looked like a family video! I mean, I think a guy I know at a few houses must have dug up his video camera and made that shit in 2 or 3 hours. It's so bad. I noticed the name from which this "Asylum" comes from and I will never rent anything with this name on it !!! When you rent a movie, check if it comes from this "company". One thing is true though - if you like terribly interpreted amateur films, then you might love this loser. It is absolutely boring and terrible !!! You were warned !!!
