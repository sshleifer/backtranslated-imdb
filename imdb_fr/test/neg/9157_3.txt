A real yawn and a bad movie even for the Chan series. I like a good movie Charlie Chan or even reasonably good, but this one is far from the height. Charlie is hired to help understand the murder of a scientist working for our government when someone at home stole plans from another power. The mystery is very pedestrian and the acting is not much better. The only thing that saved me in the movie is the presence of Mantan Moreland in Birmingham Brown. He gives a little comedy to the film and has good frightened faces, but after that, the pickings are rather thin. Benson Fong is here as Tommy Chan and paired with Chan's daughter. What about Sidney Toler? He's decent enough, but he looks like he's trying to carry the film. What I have most noticed is the way the film was shot. Chan's director, Phil Rosen, who I usually love most of his entries, uses a lot of long shots without action (like Charlie's first walk into the house from the outside). Why? The film only takes 64 minutes to scream loudly! Shoots like that tell me that the director had to fill his time, because the scenario was even weaker than what he was used to. It's probably not Chan's worst film ever, but so far, it's the worst I've ever seen.
