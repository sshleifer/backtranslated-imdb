It's awful, you could not believe it. The score is annoying, the filming is bad, for example, you sometimes see the shadow of the cameraman appear on the faces of some actors. The quality of the film is ultra bad, seems to have been made in the 20's. It's terrible. There is some blood at first and through the film but still too dark filmed. No gore no effects. The director made a better one like Blood Rites. But there, the man follows, because looking for this cheap film is not so difficult, but you have to pay for it. This will surely enter my top 10 horrormovies of all time, I do not know if I would speak of horror. There are too many discussions, you will be thirsty for blood after watching it
