One would think that anyone engaging in the follow-up of the Revolutionary Civil Servant naked more than 30 years ago would at least try to honor the original with some sort of inspired vision, but no. Here we have a kind of biopic of one of the most elegant people of the late 20th century, who claims no style. Certainly, the filmmakers have brought together exceptional actors and handed them a mug of dull gruel. Everything in the infrastructure of this film is wrong, starting with the screenplay, which is another of those big-life TV condensations where each line is a "famous quote" of the subject and each scene is a -face introduction to the next pivotal character of the subject's life. We have Swoozie Kurtz as Public Relations Manager who promotes Crisp as an artist in the United States; Denis O'Hare, editor of a gay magazine that hires Crisp as a film critic, walks away from him when he seems indifferent to the passions of AIDS activists in the 1980s, and returns to the band as a film critic. that compassionate friend of the dying octogenarian; Jonathan Tucker (in a beautiful performance) as a shy and insecure painter of gay-themed canvases who befriends Crisp; and finally Cynthia Nixon as a performance artist and Woman-About-Bohemia Penny Arcade who, intrigued by the character of Crisp, offers her a place in her itinerant cabaret show. Nixon is a talented and persuasive interpreter, but the script does not give her a chance to embody the down-to-earth and streetwise Arcade. Crisp spent the last 20 years of his life in a one-room studio in an old building in the East Village of Manhattan. He said he had never cleaned up because "after a few years, the dust did not get worse," or something like that. But if you look at the representation of this apartment in this film, you will never get the flavor of this dust. He frequented a local cafe on a busy avenue and could be seen almost every day of the week sipping tea and watching the world go by. In this film, we get a dinner that looks like something on 12th Avenue by the Hudson River. Most scenes of "New York Streets" have a sterile and unreal look without any sense of period. <br /> <br /> The soul of this film is the great John Hurt in the lead role. After nearly 35 years, he can still understand the essence of this singular English post-Edwardian and transmit it to the third millennium. Every line, every gesture is exquisite. In later scenes, he even adapts his vocal projection to a person whose life is about to die. Shortly before leaving this kingdom, Crisp wrote that when one becomes very old, one's skin takes on the character of a smelly coat that can not be removed and that one longs for death. This feeling is felt in Hurt's performance. So, for him and him alone, this film is worth the detour.
