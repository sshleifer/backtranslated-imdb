This is not a bad concept. I only wish they had taken it in another direction. It's a movie that tries to be interesting by shocking you with bestiality to start, which works for most people (prudes with weak belly). It's not funny or romantic, so please change labels, and since I already knew that bestiality was legal in most places and in a million dollar industry, I do not was not really shocked. But most people do not know it, and I thought that the way the film had evolved after the revelation of the secret was simply disappointing, because it could have been one of those revealing films that would open your eyes and would teach the ignorant a fetish that is really a reality for (yes I did my homework) hundreds of thousands of people. So if you like watching bad movies you can dream about how to make them better by watching them than good sure, have fun in.
