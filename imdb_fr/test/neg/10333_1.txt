This film dates from the 80s, but it looks like it was shot in the Stone Age. The effects are far too tacky. On my copy, Sandra Bullock is on the cover, which is why I bought the film. She was in the movie for about 5 minutes of complete reading. She would probably deny any involvement. <br /> <br /> In short, this film does not deserve to be seen, if not to laugh at how bad it is. Rent this to see the worst movie ever, without exception.
