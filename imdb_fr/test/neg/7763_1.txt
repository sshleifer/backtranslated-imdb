"Sex and the City" has very good things. The problem is that it faces a number of drawbacks that have really harmed the final standings and its critics for its "six seasons". <br /> <br /> The advantage of "SATC" is that many conversations sound right. life, love stories are interesting and the characters are fun. <br /> <br /> The problem is that few women act like complete whores. These four women have so many partners, even lesbians in some episodes, that you have no choice but to roll your eyes to absolute absurdity. The men in the series are mostly described as shallow, degenerate, liars, tricks and jesters. The crude language used by these women far exceeds what normal conversation entails. Why do writers do these things? Obviously, be on-the-top and catch your eye. <br /> <br /> Another thing that bothered me (without spoiling me) is the way some of the relationships ended. They just did not seem real to me or the others I talked to. <br /> <br /> But even though I gave 2 stars to the show, I'm happy to have watched the show at the end. In fact, I watched every season several times. I recommend the series to anyone who will not be offended by big profanations and soft-core pornography. I could have done less with offensive language and nudity and sexual acts, but the romance was very good and the saga ends rather well.
