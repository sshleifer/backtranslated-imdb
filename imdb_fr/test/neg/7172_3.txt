This film begins with children who tell stories of urban legends such as the poodle in the microwave and additional dishes in a restaurant. Unfortunately, he then turns to your basic anthology movie. The first concerns a concierge with a little secret. This one is going at best. Then the situation worsens as the next story about this kid obsessed with dead flies continues and continues over and over again. It's too long and not that interesting to start. After that, you get the typical shock scene and this one ends. You need more than that in an anthology movie. You need at least three floors and it does not take too long for it to become terribly uninteresting, especially since you can see how it will end at one kilometer.
