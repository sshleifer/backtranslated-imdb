Although the embryo may have been a potentially stimulating examination of bioethics, it degenerates into a stereotypical parable of Frankenstein, suggesting the now monotonous lesson that there were kingdoms where the man was not supposed to enter or study . <br /> <br /> Rock Hudson scientist is experimenting with ways to prevent the death of babies who miscarry. After succeeding with a dog, he immediately jumps on humans - violating medical ethics and any sense of credibility - with the equally unrealistic help of a hospital administrator. His experience works too well, with some unpleasant side effects. <br /> <br /> Although Barbara Carrera plays reasonably well in her role and animal training is spectacular, the film suffers from being too fantastic. While a message in the prologue assures viewers that it is a contemporary technology, the described scientific work looks very promising even in the 21st century, let alone in the mid-1970s. Carrera is able to find a cure for the side effects of bioengineering by simply typing an issue into a computer is laughable.
