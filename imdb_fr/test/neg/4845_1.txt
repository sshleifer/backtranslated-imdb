I would have liked to read more reviews and more opinions about this movie before renting it. A money loss. A waste of time. Very little dialogue. The dialogue was difficult to understand in every way. The plot and plot were weak. Cinematography was the only thing that was beautiful. <br /> <br /> The characters were interesting. At the same time, you will spend so much time trying to understand, for lack of dialogue, that you will rewind the movie a lot. <br /> <br /> Do not watch this movie. It was a mess and you will feel like a mess. <br /> <br /> You will say: what was it when the movie was finished?
