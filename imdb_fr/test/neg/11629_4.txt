Let's clear things up. I was raised in a Catholic and very Catholic family. I spent as much time in church and talking to priests as at home. It has been useful for two things: to make me a convinced atheist and to give me a deep and insightful knowledge of the Church and its dogmas. And I say: if a Catholic priest attends a murder and clearly sees the face of the murderer, he CAN report it to the police, even if the murderer later confessed. He can not reveal what he has said in his confession, but he CAN talk about anything he sees outside of it, and his confession is useless to keep quiet. So here we have a film entirely supported on a lie. And another lie is that there is no absolution for murder. According to the Catholic Church, there is absolution for all sin provided there is sincere repentance. So far, the biggest plot of this weak thriller. <br /> <br /> As is often said, this film would have improved if Bob Hoskins and Alan Bates had changed roles. Hoskins naturally agrees to play gangsters (I will never regret it enough to have lost Al Capone in favor of one of De Niro's weakest performances in "The Untouchables") and Bates's traits would have been perfect as priest with a gray past. But on top of that, I think the film would have been a lot better if Liam Neeson (then unknown to the general public), from Ulster, was playing Mickey Rourke. Not only is his face perfect for playing tormented characters, but he would make us believe the character as real, something that Rourke simply can not. In the 80s, Rourke was not a bad actor (after, he seemed to lose all his talent and appearance), but he was one of those artists, like Brad Dourif, who is as good as the director with whom he works . And as a former IRA terrorist, Rourke's acting style is more like a pimp. It's sad to think that this film was shot only three to six years later (when Neeson achieved moderate celebrity status in 1990 with Sam Raimi's friendly "Darkman" and superstarom in 1993 with "Schindler's List ", while Rourke became Liam and Mickey could have played a more beneficial role (Rourke would have been effective in the supporting role of Docherty, but simply can not bring this film to the fore.) Yet another missed opportunity , and another film with the potential of classic, which instantly became a forgettable dish. <br /> <br /> Ironically, the often-criticized score (of the underrated composer Bill Conti) worked for me. I did not find it too melodramatic, but properly serious and beautiful.This reminded me of Howard Shore's score for "Silence of the Lambs." Here is the talent of Mike Hodges, who directed "Get Carter", yes, but did not do not forget that he is also the brain behind "Flash Gordon" ... <br /> <br /> It seems that the movie was slaughtered cut room (it shows, because some parts are really agitated and confusing, and others do not stick) and a Director's Cut is waiting to see the light. OK, but I seriously doubt that this is a good movie, because we will always have the wrong cast and the false premise. 4/10.
