The Daft boilers do not come much later, but it's a Douglas Sirk movie that makes it all right. Except that in this case it is not the case. Based on a pious novel by Lloyd C Douglas (he wrote "The Dress") and already shot in 1935 with Irene Dunne and Robert Taylor, he has more strength than a cantilevered bra. <br /> <br /> Rock Hudson is the arrogant playboy who not only feels responsible for making Jane Wyman a widow, but who is then directly responsible for the accident in which she loses sight. To repair, he takes medication, becomes a great ophthalmologist surgeon and restores it. (No, it's not that stupid, he planned to become a doctor before becoming an arrogant playboy). In the meantime, they fall in love. <br /> <br /> I do not find the redemptive social commentary and criticism of American manners supposed to be just under the surface of Sirk's films, this one is not too deep). On the positive side, Rock Hudson is not half-naughty (I think I rediscover it), and of course, it's superb (in Sirk's movies, people live in cathedral-sized rooms) . Nothing in this film corresponds to the best of his later work and even in terms of television soap opera, it is indeed the television of day.
