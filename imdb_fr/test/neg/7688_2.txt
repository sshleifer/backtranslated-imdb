As a fan of Michael Dudikoff, I sat down to watch one of his good old policemen - I'm still waiting. <br /> <br /> The film is based on a group of American commandos trying to get rid of a group of Syrian terrorists who have taken over a nuclear reactor. Maddie Reese (Felicity Waterman) was an English member of the commando unit and, of course, she had a romance with Tom Dickson (Dudikoff). I have to ask since when did the British have female SAS members? As far as I know, if they are useful, they come from other sources. Even if they did, I can almost guarantee they would not be as wet as Maddie Reese. I also think that Tom Dickson would be a little more responsible for his position - or did I lose the plot ?! I know there is always a romantic angle in these films, because it helps to create the welfare factor, but should that always be the case, especially when you have to take into account more important factors, such as nuclear war! <br /> <br /> The signing of the US aircraft carrier treaty intrigued me. The "sacred pen" worn by one of the so-called TV journalists: was there no security check to know who or what is on board one of these ships, especially with the caliber of the people who were there. Notice if there was, I guess there would be no story. <br /> <br /> I could go on, but when he arrived at the "internal bombshell" in order to be able to safely remove a bullet, I dropped the drama been appreciated by the comedy he was. <br /> <br /> By the way, would a journalist really say "Downtown Damascus" ??
