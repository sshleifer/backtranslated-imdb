Starting from a harrowing poem and images of American missiles, hungry children and mutilated Palestinians, I soon realized that it would not be an objective documentary. Five young people sentenced after the Gothenburg riots were questioned and gave a very confused explanation as to why they had to destroy the city center and then (oh my god) actually paid for what they did. I continued to watch and many questions were raised: Was the trial done properly and are the police allowed to do what they did? Many questions asked ... then abandoned. No interviews with judges or documents about the trial. Nothing. <br /> <br /> In short: Nothing new in what every Swede has seen on television a hundred times - poor propaganda.
