This film is nil. It's horrible. If anyone liked it, these people should be examined. The character of Jackie Mason looks like a delay. This guy trying to kill the gopher is a loser and he sucked. Even though Chevy Chase was in this movie, he was not funny. This movie had crude jokes and no laughs and did not have Rodney Dangerfield, Ted Knight and Bill Murray. Even though Jackie Mason's character had the personality of Rodney Dangerfield's character, Mason's character is nil. Rodney Dangerfield was funny! He should have come back! I do not care about Ted Knight, but Bill Murray should have come back too. The original Caddyshack was Murray's performance. If he was funny in the first case, he could have been funny in the second. <br /> <br /> Final comment: I recommend this movie to ... NO ONE !!!!!!!! THIS FILM SUCKED !!!! He sucked, he cracks now, and he will always suck !!!!!!! <br /> <br /> 2/10
