Spoilers !! <br /> <br /> I hate this one, but it's better than others after that, they just get worse. I hope Gibson will have the intelligence to stay out of the next one. With a lot of humor, ie Toilets, children, etc. How long can we watch their relationship evolve? Drugs, bad guys why South Africa! I found it incredible, maybe South American, that a Golden Triangle country would have improved the scenario. It seems that the late '80s, early' 90s, are the wicked blondes, that is Die Hard, the powerful Ducks play Ice Land Gary Busey in the latest Weapon movie, and so on. Hollywood is repeating itself. This one with a similar story must go above. The police attack, the condo scene on the beach and the fight in the end, as well as Gibson's girlfriend, killed by the copper attack, were too much. Like many parts 2, they get worse and 3 or 4 of this series accelerate downhill. 3/10
