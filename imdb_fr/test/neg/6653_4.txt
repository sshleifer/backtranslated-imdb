I really wanted to see this movie - I thought the plot was really unique and intriguing. A policeman (Andy Garcia) has a son who is dying and who needs bone marrow replacement to be able to live. The only match is a doomed serial killer, who escapes from jail. To save his son, he must find the murderer. <br /> <br /> Michael Keaton plays the convict in one of the many disappointing aspects of the film. Keaton is sometimes a great actor, but here he is rather boring. It's too much to think of nothing. <br /> <br /> Garcia is better but tries too hard for a movie that is not up to par. Barbet Schroeder (such a promising director with films like "Barfly" that represented almost nothing on the US market) does quite well - I honestly thought the script was the culprit here ... it's just a big mess . The film ends up wasting a lot of good material, good actors and a good director - all because of a faulty scenario. What should have been a tense and thought-provoking film is just a failed Hollywood action.
