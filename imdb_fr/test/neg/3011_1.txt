The VIP keys are just one of the awful T.V. shows you can and will see on this station. The series is terrible, guys claiming to be real players who compete (there are two in each episode) in stupid games where they try to talk girls in a bar, get the number of girls, etc. . The judges are four other types who also claim to be experienced artists, but they also look like gigantic backpacks, just like the competitors. The series is neither funny nor interesting, it's annoying to watch these guys who are desperately trying to convince us that they are great players (talking even more about the four judges than competitors). Nothing funny happened even in the series I watched and these are obviously faked. Do you really think they invited all those people into the club, asked them to sign releases and tape them while these guys play the same stupid games with them? It's not at all a reality, it's just stupid, it's probably even tapes the day. Someone else here told how he knew someone in the series and that everything was wrong, yes, it's obvious, it's a fake show and even with the actors, it's still not funny . One of the worst shows I have ever seen.
