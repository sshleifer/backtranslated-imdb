Many flames, thousands of extras in battle scenes, lots of beautiful sets. I do not think the plot has supported such an expense. The story could have been told much more effectively and be more psychologically valid if there was not so much sexist rocket in the production. Chinese movies tend to be like that, in my experience. and I think it hurts the film.
