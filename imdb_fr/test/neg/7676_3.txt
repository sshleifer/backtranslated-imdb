The real star of the last of the films of the airport is this great supersonic carrier that the French have created and which is called The Concorde. If you keep in mind that the whole movie is dedicated to showing what this nose-nosed plane could do in the sky, it makes no sense. <br /> <br /> But if you expect a serious drama Susan Blakely plays a television reporter who happens to be also the mistress of the army. <br /> <br /> Susan Blakely plays a news reporter on television. industrial magnate Robert Wagner. One of Wagner's assistants brings him information about some of Wagner's dirty business, selling weapons to people who are not friends with the United States. When the source, Macon McCalman, is killed in front of her and she is almost forked by a hit-man of which she escapes of course, she confronts Wagner with the information. And of course, he denies it. But just before Blakely gets on board the Concorde, McCalman's widow, Kathleen Maguire, hands him the necessary documents. <br /> <br /> But on the way to Moscow with a stopover in Paris, Wagner and his henchmen try to belittle the big bird. But the intrepid crew of Alain Delon, David Warner and George Kennedy is at the height of all their tricks. You will see if you want to see the movie. If you are an aviation enthusiast, you will not worry about intrigue. It's like the movie Le Mans with Steve McQueen that has a legion of racing fans who have made it a cult product. Maybe Le Mans is better at that, because they just did not care about a story. <br /> <br /> Among the passengers is a smoker saxophonist played by Jimmie Walker, a helpless mother accompanying a new heart for her. child, played by Cicely Tyson and Martha Raye, a woman with a weak bladder who spends the entire trip from Washington to Paris in the bathroom. In fact, she is the best here. <br /> <br /> Robert Wagner must have been psychic, because I am convinced that, thanks to the strength of this film, he got the role of the number two of Doctor Evil in the Austin Powers series. <Br/> <br /> I'm sure everyone involved had a big pay day with this movie, but it seems to have killed the movie saga at the airport.
