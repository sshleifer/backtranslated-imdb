When I saw that Icon was on TV, I was surprised. I know the first clue to his direction was the fact that it was on Hallmark Channel - actually - sorry !! I was hopeful when I saw that FF himself was the executive producer, but soon I realized that the only real resemblance between the TV movie and the book was the name and the name of the characters only. The televised plot was a ho-hum to say the least but I agree that, in itself, the action was worth 3 stars. In my opinion, Mr. Swayze could have represented a valid monk, but I think that to do justice to the film, the film would have been much longer, and I do not think that Hollywood itself would have opted for the intrigue of discreditation by subterfuge. The terrible film version of The Sum of All Fears is a good example. Should I say more?
