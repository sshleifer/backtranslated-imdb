Beware of Seagal enthusiasts - He does not do any action scene for almost an hour in this mess. Instead, Seagal RUNS AWAY after many fights, leaving Ja Rule convincingly losing every battle. In fact, Ja Rule could be a star of the action in the making, but Hollywood must let him at least touch puberty (which should happen in a few more years ...) Moreover, what kind of commando / terrorist carries bare clothes? The nana in this atrocity looks like a replacement singer for Christina Aguilera. Back to Seagal - When he ends up unleashing himself, it's his double stunt (HEAVILY PADDED to look like the swollen Seagal) doing a lot of work and taking the falls. I do not remember any aikido either. These are just your classic kicks and punches that you would see in any live martial arts turkey. Not even "so-bad-that-funny" either. Simply dull ...
