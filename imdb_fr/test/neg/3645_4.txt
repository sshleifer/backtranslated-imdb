I was looking forward to seeing this film, which contains very interesting perspectives from Iraqis across the country, not just the main regions. <br /> <br /> However, over the course of the film, it seemed that more and more one-sided, I wondered who had mounted the film. To take several hundred hours to just 80 minutes, you obviously had to make decisions. <br /> <br /> I really would have liked a film that shows how ordinary Iraqis feel on all sides, but with the newspaper headlines contrasted with what people said, and like everyone else in the film had the same opinion in the end, I thought it was obvious that the editing was done with preconceived bias. <br /> <br /> It could have been such a great movie.
