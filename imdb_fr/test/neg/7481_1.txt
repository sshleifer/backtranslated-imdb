Nothing has ever been said or done by Carson Daly on this show that has ever made me laugh, or even smile a bit. I do not understand how this show has survived for so many years. <br /> <br /> Even the "funny" member of the group is like one of those high school kids who thinks that no one is brave enough to look at him. . Daly and this guy are just arrogant boys. Looks like they do not even try to be a little funny. <br /> <br /> AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL show. <br /> <br /> It makes my soul cry. <br /> <br /> I just can not stress enough that this show is AWFUL. Do not look at him. But if you absolutely must, I recommend you scratch your eyes and plug your ears with cement beforehand.
