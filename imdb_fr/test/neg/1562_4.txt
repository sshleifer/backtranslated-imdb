The plot: four people are taken in an elevator. One is a businessman, the annoying guy who is aggressive and complains about everything and everyone. It is a sample of distilled stress and hostility. Then there is his colleague, a woman who is much more pleasant in his character. A rebellious teenager who has just burst into a coke machine and who, by his mere presence, makes the businessman crazy, and an older man who has just stolen 100,000 DM is the rest of the cast. <br /> <br /> The film is all about how they handle their problem, over time, without success to reach the outside world, when the lights go out and when the cables start to break one after the other .... <br /> And yet, that's not too exciting. The characters are stereotypes. The story is stupid and improbable (how could so much go wrong in one elevator?). You do not really like characters, you hate one. And all the twists in the plot do not contribute to the excitement, they are just stupid excuses to add a few more minutes of dialogue while writers continue to lack inspiration and ink for a feature film in an elevator. <br /> <br /> Let's hope that the "phone booth" will be more efficient ...
