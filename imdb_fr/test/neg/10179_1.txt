Supposedly, a film on a magazine sending journalists to investigate UFO reports with one being more or less tolerant or agnostic about the whole affair and the other an Australian, a hardened skeptic who is mocks the absurdity of UFOs. It's all a potpourri, a kind of racket. <br /> <br /> It turns out that this film is actually a deception and a trap to really promulgate the Christian teachings and the Christian explanation of UFOs, the one I have already heard. This is an ad hoc explanation that is not Biblical at all, but has been invented by some modern theologians who can incorporate everything into their mythology. The paranormal? It's real, just demonic, unless it happens in a Christian context, so of course it's from God. Simple, if it's not of God, it's the devil's, stupid! So, I guess since Beethoven's 9th symphony was not inspired by God, it had to be written under a demonic influence. Or logic leads us ad absurdum. <br /> <br /> We are informed that since the Bible does not say about life on other planets of the Universe, so there is none (a version of the Ad Ignorantium sophism) and that God created the universe so huge, so big to show us its almighty power. I think of Carl Sagan's remark that if God had created such a vast universe and blocked life on Earth alone, it would have been a huge waste of space. <br /> <br /> So what are the UFOs? They are a demonic activity and concern the event to come, the disaster, the break ... I mean Rapture. Before the tribulation, true Christians will disappear en masse from the surface of the Earth, causing massive panic, confusion, car and plane accidents ... whatever. Therefore, Satan, knowing that this sends his demons, essentially creates an extraterrestrial spaceship and extraterrestrial abduction illusion, which can then be used to explain this otherwise inexplicable event. Any part of Satan's plan that will of course prevent people from turning to God or Jesus and cracking for the lies of the Antichrist. <br /> <br /> This ad hoc explanation also characterizes the theological mishmash by explaining a mystery with another, in opposition to the scientific method of explaining the unknown, the strange and the mysterious to the extent of possible, first by the known, if not only by the known. <br /> <br /> It's like jumping straight into a stranger kidnapping every time a child is missing and not being accounted for I think I'd first look at some more mundane explanations, like if the child had fled, gone astray or was kidnapped for ransom or kidnapped by a predatory pedophile before resorting to extraterrestrials, the supernatural or Satan, for example. <br /> <This kind of deception or trap from fundamentalists is nothing new, as young people are often drawn to Free Rock Concerts, which can start with something innocuous and then suddenly switch in Christian music, followed by a sermon and altar call. One might think that this kind of blatant disappointment would be more like Satan's ball game. But perhaps because the Christian faith will soon be dying, these guys feel that anything is permissible, any deception or trickery or tactic of fear is acceptable to try to keep the faith alive, which faces a serious opposition from seculars as well as competing religions, such as Islam, the fastest growing religion in the world and which may well replace Christianity, since Islam is much more coherent and unified and it is logically more tenable than Christian fundamentalism. Although this would be of little benefit to humanity, it would replace one intolerant system of thought with another. <br /> <br /> And of course, the film ends more or less with a variant of Pascal's bet. The Atheist Australian who is skeptical about everything is said. Well, if you're right in saying that there is no life after death and death just rot in the grave, do not worry ... but what if You are wrong? <br /> <br /> Roughly, statements suggesting that reality is happening to conform to only an atheistic point of view or a Christian fantasy is a false dilemma or a black and white illusion. Even if atheists are wrong, Christianity would not necessarily be correct by default, any more than if Christianity were fraught with pitfalls in its theology, materialistic atheists would be correct by default. <br /> <br /> Know that Native American spirituality could be the best description of the ultimate reality and that we could all have benefited from it to wish to treat the Earth and its creatures a little better. <br /> <br /> This film must be stamped on the right. on the box: Warning: contains religious propaganda and is not intended for informational or entertainment purposes.
