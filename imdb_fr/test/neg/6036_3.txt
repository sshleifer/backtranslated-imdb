The White Warrior is definitely one of the movies, if not the weakest Steve Reeves. Located in Russia in the eighteenth or nineteenth century (??), Steve plays the role of a Cossack warrior who tries to overthrow a mad Russian czar running in the mountains with his group of rebels in a clumsy white Russian tunic. .... Most of Reeves' superb physique is hidden in a wacky tunic to the knee, with an even more ridiculous Russian hat. <br /> <br /> The action is rather minimal, with only a good fight scene from the average size that shows the great physique of Reeves. This is an apparent attempt by the producers to put Reeves from the sword and sandal genre to another era, with mediocre results. The dialogue of the script is difficult to understand at various times and only the commentary of the narrator allows the viewer to understand what is really happening from one scene to another. Reeves regretted not having filmed his toga, sandals, and platform armor, which helped him make himself known by other historical figures such as Morgan the pirate and thief of Baghdad.
