First of all, this movie was shot in 1978. So that tells you that the movie is going to be bad anyway. But I'm not saying that all old movies are bad. Secondly, the special effects are terrible even for this period. Finally, the acting was so bad, Bozo The Clown could have done better. One wonders how people get the money to make such pathetic films. This film is bad!
