If it does not appear in all lists of "things not to look at", it should only be because people who keep this list are not aware of its existence, which, as long as it remains , is the acceptable alternative. I'm not kidding, it's a * bad * "movie". Joseph Meeker comes back from the dead, with various vague and undefined supernatural powers, the most used of which would seem to appear in new ridiculous and ridiculous (and never scary or frightening ... in general, when it goes last of those- this, it ends up being weird, and the attempts of the first just do not work, point) outfits and stereotypes / archetypes, and it is described by David Keith (in whom I respect ... well, at least Daredevil), does most often terribly inconsistent (which could also be related to the script) and often on top performance. A character or two have such annoying personalities that they are painful to watch. Editing thinks it's a lot smarter than it really is (and what happened with the red hue for flashbacks?). Cinematography ... oh, my dear. Framing, coverage, effective use of the angle (that we could perhaps attribute to editing, perhaps too), please, guys, stop me when I say something that you have heard of the existence of. From the technical point of view, it's a rather ugly excuse for something more interesting to insert in the projector than the unexposed movie. But why stop there? The plot is just poor. The basic idea was made, and it was so much better (The Crow would be the same). The way it is said is fanciful, and although there is an explanation behind the flashbacks, it still does not satisfy. The stimulation is almost non-existent. Lead is distinctly unimaginable, and there is more personality in a barn door, besides these are also much less wood. Kelly Perine and Thomas Ian Nicholas? What are you doing in the name of all that is good and right (pun intended)? Perine, you were already funny before that, in The Drew Carey Show, Nicholas, well, I did not see you in any previous version of American Pie, but if nothing else, you * were * funny * later, and in these productions, the fun was intentional. The dialogue is ... unless we say, the better. The language is not restricted and tends to be stupid. The violence is poorly done and they do not even seem to care about trying to hide it (suggest it was perhaps the smartest strategy). Characters, do not throw me. Why spend so much energy describing unhealthy, sometimes totally illogical events? The more you think about it, the more it gets worse. It's not even passable as a "bad horror movie", or a B movie (it can very well pass through the rest of the alphabet and go even further), it might not scare you the The scariest day of your life had an electrified scare machine. I recommend it only to people who want to refute how bad it is and do not say I did not warn you. 1/10
