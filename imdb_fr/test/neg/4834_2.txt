I have watched this on TV and watched because I remembered the Spin magazine article on which the film is based. I was very disappointed. First, if James Belushi is the lead actor in a movie, it should be a sign that it's not exactly an A-List production. Gregory Hines was a world-class dancer, but unfortunately not a great actor. <br /> <br /> In fact, all the actors in this film are either flat or hammered, which can not be blamed on the director, who is the weakest link in this film. Charles Carner seemed to be trying to mimic Oliver Stone's "JFK" by describing the so-called plot to hide the "real" child murderer, but without the benefit of a good script, a distribution of the A-list or, it must be. says the talent. It just does not work. <br /> <br /> It's unfortunate that a subject as worthy of a movie is not better treated.
