Chuck Norris plays the role of Danny, a policeman who shot down an imposing serial killer. However, when the said killer escapes, Danny knows he is the only one who can stop the terror. However, Danny keeps a secret, he knows it's pure luck that stopped the terror and even more the chance that Danny survived, now a final battle is going on but is Danny ready? Right there in my description tells what is the problem of this movie. Norris plays a defenseless hero who still suffers from psychological trauma. In the hands of a better actor, this concept would be interesting and could be a great thriller. In the hands of a Norris thriller, it just makes him ridiculous and desperately non-heroic. Steve Nin of the American Ninja and Ron O'Neal of Superfly are also on board, but any attempt to develop the character is defeated by the atrocious scenario. Plus, there's almost no action and I've always preferred a Norris movie with more fights and fewer lyrics. Given the rating given on this site, I must not be alone. <br /> <br /> * on 4- (Bad)
