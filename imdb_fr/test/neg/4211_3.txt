I have always been a fan of Chuck Norris for what he has done and his films. All the while, I was going to watch this movie, but for some reason, I did not have a chance. Apparently, I did not miss much. It must be one of Chuck's worst movies. So, this trucker, Billy Dawes (Augenstein) has the opportunity to make his delivery, but he is hijacked and forced into a jerkwater town where a local corrupt idiot, Judge Trimmings (Murdock), who runs the entire city, does so stop and false charges against him. He denies the charges and tries his luck. The local hick police beat him and he disappeared. But now, his brother JD John Dawes (Norris), another trucker is looking for him. He quickly discovers that the city is run by the loser judge and that his brother can not be found. Shortly after, he starts to hit just about everyone in town. Meanwhile, the film's wife calls the local truckers to CB radio and they all rush to demolish it. LOL with big devices. Finally, Norris finds his brother and beats more thugs. <br /> <br /> This movie was pretty bad. It actually starts well and you feel good when Norris starts to crush some of these corrupt corrupt cops, because there are such losers. But there is almost no history, the acting is bad and the end? ... well, it does not really. The judge has his house hit by a big platform and you never know what's going on. Does he live? Norris can not even throw it away. Meanwhile, Norris confronts a rogue policeman at the end. We do not care? Norris also manages to take on everyone in town, breaks his hand, gets shot and continues to fight. Come on! This film was apparently designed to take advantage of the craze of BC for the time; They even use the CBs in the movie. Adding to that, the film seems to be dragging on late and you wonder why it's not over yet. This movie is bad, but if you are bored and need something to watch, it will pass the time. As for Norris, he has made much better films than this one. 3 out of 10
