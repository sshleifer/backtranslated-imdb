(Spoilers) <br /> <br /> Of course, he's based on Moby Dick. Totally obsessed and it destroys him. It's total madness. The film starts pretty well, but at the end of the film, everyone is destroyed and the spirit of the main star is meaningless. <br /> <br /> The supposed half-sister is never convincing. Some very mediocre light effects. The music is interesting. But little else. It took me over a month to finally finish this damn thing. I guess if you like to be John Malkovich, you might like this. But where BJM was an excellent movie that I just did not want to see again, Pola X is a movie I hate too much for hell. The only possible excitement in the film is the sexual scene of gratuitous incest towards the end of the film. (Let's hope you do not think about Catherine either.) <br /> <br /> This film is extremely boring, depressing, and poorly realized. Not strongly recommended. If you like French movies. (look at Crimson Rivers instead) <br /> <br /> 4/10 <br /> <br /> Quality: 5/10 Entertainment: 1/10 Watchable: 0/10
