This version of "The Magic Flute" is not only the worst production of the great Mozart opera I have ever seen, but also the worst video production I have ever seen of an opera. <br /> <br /> I am a big fan of opera and I have more opera on DVD than film. The sets are cheap and cheesy. Papageno does not even have a bird suit. He's just dressed like a guy. The sound is in mono. The color is really bad. It is saturated in orange. Most DVDs from this period have digitally restored color, but they did not care about it. In addition, the language has been changed to Swedish instead of the original German. <br /> <br /> This is not a filmed version of "The Magic Flute". It's a filmed performance and it's not a good performance and it was not very well filmed. You can choose any other DVD available from this opera and I guarantee you that it will be better than this one. My preference is James Levine's version with David Hockney's sets.
