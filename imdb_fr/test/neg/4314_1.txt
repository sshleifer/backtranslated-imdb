Opie, Tom Gilson, was my brother, so I went to see the movie and I never saw it again for all these years. Sorry! it was bad. I am told that I have to write 10 lines, so I will put a little anecdote. Tom and Tuesday Weld were to be "featured" in this picture and Tom was told to go to the first Tuesday but Tom said no, he was going with Joan Collins, and he did and because he did that Tuesday Weld was introduced. I found it very funny at the time and I still do it. The film, while the concept was funny, and the actors that were there were impressive, but some revealed that the film was not funny. The continuity was abstract. At best, it was as if I was watching two different time movies, each clashing with each other. Sorry, Bob Gilson
