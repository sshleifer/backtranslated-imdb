I first saw this when he went out to the theater. Even though he was only 13 years old at the time, I was an avid reader of science fiction stories "hard science". The technical blunders of the film are engraved in my memory. <br /> <br /> Some of the following may have significant damage. <br /> <br /> Even as a young boy, I knew that the principle is ridiculous. The rocket takes off for a lunar mission, in a cosmos where there is always a gravitational effect on the crew (although flying objects float like weightlessness) and because of this, the "cabin" (the area where the controls called this) was gyrostabalized to maintain the "correct" orientation (so that when they landed, why did not they fall on their heads?) and where, at least in a space close to the Earth, the rocket engines had to turn continuously - with the propellant burning without oxidant. When the engines stopped running, the rocket stopped _dead_ in space and could not start until a chemist with a PhD had determined that he needed a little oxidant. This time, the rocket recalled that it had gained momentum and that our heroes are realizing that they are near Mars (even a 13 year old nerd knew that such a trip requiring minimal energy would take more than 200 days). <br /> They land, discover that the air was breathable (although, at the time, scientific data revealed that the pressure, even if the atmosphere was pure oxygen, would be too much low to do the least good). They decide to camp outside the ship and even make a campfire. They arrive armed, even though they are supposedly going to the moon, where firearms would not be needed. <br /> <br /> They see a collapsed civilization, encounter wandering martians who look like human beings, develop an anti-nuclear war philosophy, and those who have survived try to return to their home planet and die in trying to crash on Earth! To do this, a long orbital period would be necessary, they would have died of hunger well before getting closer to their destination. <br /> <br /> The previous film, Destination Moon, used the real science more effectively (even if "rescue" with the oxygen tank forgot the moment the arm goes from the center of gravity of the tank at the outlet nozzle). This film showed a lamentable ignorance of the most fundamental science. Only the most technologically illiterate should see it as a sci-fi film: on par with the old Flash series Gordon, where their rockets took off from their belly and spiraled, and whose engines were still running. <br /> <The story of this film that I considered banal, and I can only recommend it as a film to show students so they can choose technical blunders.
