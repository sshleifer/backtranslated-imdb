This film is a mess of talented people and Hollywood budget It made me think that everyone in the film was paying a favor by being there because they were all displaced and they were wasting talent in this horrible pile of movies. It is an artificial plot that is just pathetic, unrealistic and not even close to fun or interesting. The only thing that caught my attention was the large number of big names in the film who appeared for no apparent reason and who have no talent for playing in the mess of a movie. I always expected that there were good things since all these people had been cool in other movies. But that never happened. This film should be shown in prison as a punishment, but it would be cruel and unusual. You'll be shocked to see so many recognizable faces parade around such a horrible and pathetic scenario with flat lines and horribly bad acting. This film reminded me of another total time loss with many recognizable faces, BIG TROUBLE (2002), which also went from the reading rule to the sucker-meter.
