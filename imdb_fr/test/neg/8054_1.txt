Awful is really all you need to know. Think first about anything that could be bad for a movie. And then try to make a movie that is bad in all these ways. You will have done "Vacationland". The state of Maine should feel insulted: it's a place much too pleasant to serve as a backdrop for a banal, stupid and boring schlock. I am romantic and I always want movies about two people who meet to succeed and I have tried to find the right one in this one. It was hard. very difficult. I could not find a glimmer of emotional connection among the characters in this dreary exercise. Except perhaps in one or two of the bad guys. <br /> <br /> Maine is a good holiday country; this film is not.
