Contains Major Spoilers. If you are really interested in history, we will be interested in this story. <br /> <br /> OK, we have storms destroying a city and a hacker who blocks the power grid. <br /> <br /> Schlock predictable from the beginning, and if that was not enough, the 5 seconds of action between the film and the commercials kill the little suspense that could exist. For example: will they go to the airport on time? Things are not going well as we go to an advertisement, and the action movie before advertising shows them bouncing off the plane! Well, I guess they'll get there after all, but again, they had to because they're good. <br /> <br /> The action is not too impressive (exception and welcome relief: Randy Quaid as Tornado Tornado), the effects were a little lamentable, the bad guys understood it and the good ones were successful . The real disaster of this movie was the script, especially the ending. Not only did they clear things up as quickly as a drama 24 hours in advance, but they also glorified the hacker. So he caused a bazillion of dead? He meant well. And, of course, an edifying televised report about people coming together. Barf. That was all I expected from the commercials, and I'm glad I lost my time watching it. That will make a good conversation tomorrow at the lunch table. <br /> <br /> Does CBS insult us by doing this? But we watched it, did not we? Did you know that there were many announcements of emergency generators for your home during this pig? <br /> <br /> We hope that the next Plan 9 of outer space (which will improve with each viewing). It's not that. <br /> <br /> 1 star.
