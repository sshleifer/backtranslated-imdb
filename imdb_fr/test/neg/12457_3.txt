"Tart" is a pathetic attempt to film a movie that walks among a group of teenagers in Manhattan exploring all the usual stuff of pre-teen girls ... sex, drugs and classical music, almost without history, without interest or purpose. Griffith is in the film for about 2 minutes, while Swain is conscientiously striving to cross another of his long list of dog films. Nothing in this movie works and Wayne should consider finding a real job. Not recommended for anyone. COULD! Ugh! (RE)
