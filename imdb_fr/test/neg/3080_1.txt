Engaged Stars (Heather Graham) with (Casey Affleck) and (Luke Wilson). It is the story of Joline who is determined to find her ex-husband in mid-life crisis. <br /> <br /> Committed was not at all what I thought was missing in the comedy that was ultimately the genre. It was more than stupid and unrealistic, Casey Affleck delivered a reasonable performance, Graham's recent roles were not very bright and it's not an improvement. <br /> <br /> Graham's last role was Blessed, which I also found misleading. and did not attract me at all. <br /> <br /> For Affleck <br /> <br /> Disadvantages Predictable, unrealistic, mediocre and not constituting a comic film!
