This movie was so bad, I thought I was going to scream in the middle of it. It was all I could do to sit through. The beginning of the film where they are at war was promising. Only, it smelled like "Save Private Ryan" for me ... or at least an attempt. Only we do not care about these people. There was no accumulation for the characters. I guess the kid who dies was supposed to make us cry ... but for whatever reason it irritated everyone. Then we have to listen line by line sappy dialogue that desperately tried to imitate "Wuthering Heights", which, of course, was also mentioned in the film. Go understand. The film was not original, it was like sitting in the most banal parts of all the war movies ever made, with a little humor to make you hope that it will improve. Unfortunately, it is not the case. 3 hours later, I leave the theater feeling deceived. Anthony Menghilla should be shot for trying to duplicate the English Patient, which for the time was a good movie, but now I'm wondering ... should I praise him and make sure I'm not trapped in the HYPE ??? Maybe I was, but I was certainly not involved in the hype of this movie. I really went to the theater to love this movie. I am a fan of Nicole Kidman. Save your money, rent it on DVD and laugh as I did.
