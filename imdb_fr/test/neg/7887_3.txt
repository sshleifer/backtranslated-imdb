SAIMIN <br /> <br /> (USA: The hypnotist / UK: Hypnosis) <br /> <br /> Image ratio: 1.85: 1 <br /> <br /> Sound format: Dolby Stereo SR <br /> <br /> After a series of bizarre and seemingly unrelated "suicides", an experienced Tokyo detective (Ken Utsui) asks for the help of a young psychoanalyst (Goro Inagaki) who believes the victims were acting according to a post-hypnotic suggestion. But their subsequent investigations reveal an even darker work force, linked to a girl (Miho Kanno) whose life was ruined by sadistic abuse ... <br /> <br /> According to a Keisuke novel Matsuoka, this film - The Plot of Mystery is based on different sources (Italian gialli, traditional Japanese ghost stories, etc.), although some images of the culminating confrontation reveal a more immediate influence: The recent commercial success of Hideo's RING Nakata (1998). Despite all its ambition, SAIMIN is an ordinary cauldron that stumbles after a powerful opening (the "suicides" are particularly impressive, despite some effects of weak CGI), although the director Masayuki Ochiai - who co-wrote the script with Yasushi Fukuda - Rally the procedure for a prolonged finale in which the surprising secrets of the story are finally revealed. Ochiai is best known for his film adaptation of PARASITE EVE (1997), an innovative video game - which also features the great actor Inagaki (member of the Japanese pop group SMAP) - and although SAIMIN repeats the strong visual sense of this film In short, the drama falls, and most characters are just numbers, which undermines the emotional benefit of the script. Which is a shame, because the last half hour is galvanized by a series of scenes, especially a concert hall sequence in which the symphony of the "new world" of Dvorak is transformed into an instrument of murder! - and Ochiai is well served by an excellent production team. However, those who are attracted by the promise of bloody carnage may be disappointed - the film is long on atmospheres and splashing. <br /> <br /> The performances are varied, because of the limits of the scenario, but Kanno (TOMIE) is remarkable as a young woman suffering from multiple personality disorders - which, we are assured, tells us that printing is under review, is not recognized as a viable disease in Japan! - who is the prey of a sordid television hypnotist (Takeshi Masu), the main suspect of the murders. Inagaki plays a one-dimensional role in madness. He is consistently outclassed by Utsui, a seasoned artist whose career dates back to the 1950s "Sûpâ Jaiantsu" series. <br /> <br /> (Japanese dialogue)
