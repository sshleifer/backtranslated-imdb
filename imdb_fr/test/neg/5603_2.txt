Pretty one. <br /> <br /> Pretty actresses and actors. Pretty bad scenario. Quite common "we are going to undress" scenes. Fair enough F / X. Pretty decisions about the location (the college dorm room looks like an upscale hotel room - probably because it was shot in a hotel). Nice story bland. Dialogue rather awful. Pretty places. Editing rather boring, unless you like the video style of cut music. <br /> <br /> This one is not a guilty pleasure, it's rather an embarrassing one. If you have to watch this, choose a good dance / techno album and turn off the sound of the movie. You will see pretty people dressed in their pretty black underwear and will probably follow the story to perfection. <br /> <br /> The actors may be able to act - I doubt anyone can look smart given the lines / conspiracy he faced.
