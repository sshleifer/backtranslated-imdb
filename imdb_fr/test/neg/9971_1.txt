One of the most boring movies I have ever seen. Three immature young people have sex and talk very little about anything except their "love" for each other. They seem to be interested in each other only a lot and passively. I felt excluded. Most outdoor scenes take place at night, so we can not even enjoy the well-lit views of Paris! I gave up after an hour and ten minutes.
