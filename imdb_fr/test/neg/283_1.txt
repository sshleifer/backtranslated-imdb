Unfortunately, I think it's one of those movies that if you or I were in the studio and said, "Can I do this great movie with my friends Mary, Mungo and Midge from school? the studio would have kicked you to death on the spot. However, if many Hollywood names say, "Listen, I'd like a getaway to Italy with my friends, what about you?" the studio writes a check. <br /> <br /> We start with the casino boss of Ocean's 11, looking for thieves who stole his money, then Brad Pitt is kissing Catherine Zeta Jones. about Amsterdam and Italy, and so on, then everything ends well. <br /> <br /> The film however includes the most shameful moment of the career of Julia Roberts and Bruce Willis, which is a gem movie. I almost vomited on my lap and tore my eyes when Julia Roberts, playing Tess in the movie, pretended to be (you guessed it) Julia Roberts! Bruce Willis is clearly wondering when he can leave and how much the check will cost. <br /> <br /> Well, to be fair, I would have done it for the money, so I guess I can do it. I really do not criticize the poor loves, but I'm a penniless slob not a Hollywood legend.I guess what really bothers me about this movie is not that it's boring and useless and that it's has a terrible story, but I think the actors are probably all fun to do it! I think all the work of the actor is to project his emotions outward ... I feel like having paid to go to the party, but I had to stay outside in the rain Booo! <br /> <br /> Look at it if you like Como or if you like CZJ or something, but otherwise go for a walk.
