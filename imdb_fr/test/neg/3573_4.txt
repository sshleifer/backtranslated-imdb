That's what I kept asking myself during the many fights, screaming games, curses and chaos that permeate the 84 minutes. The comparisons are also valid when one thinks of one-dimensional characters, which have such a small depth that it is almost impossible to worry about what happens to them. These are just badly written words to allow the director to hang on to his multicultural convictions, a subject that has been much better addressed in other dramas, on television and in film. <br /> <br /> I must admit that I am not. really to have spotted bad performances during a movie, but it must be said that Nichola Burley (as best friend of the heroine slut) and Wasim Zakir (as naughty and intimidating brother) were absolutely terrible. I do not know which school they graduated from, but if I were them, I would ask for a full refund after the haste.

Next time, hire a different scout. <br /> <br /> Another fascinating idea is the ugly fashionable soundtrack featuring Snow Patrol, Ian Brown and Keane. Now, I'm a bit of a fan of music and I know most of the works of these artists, but I have not recognized any of the pieces in this film (except the ubiquitous "Run"). B-sides, someone?

But I remained resolutely impassive because the script did not give me anyone to search the root. It is not enough to tackle an urgent problem, you must present us with a conspiracy that has not yet been killed and individuals who do not just paint. As it stands, this film is a noble failure, with only the promising lead actress and some slightly diverted strikes to save him from the trash. 4/10. Must try harder ..
