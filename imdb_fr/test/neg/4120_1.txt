Tedium as only the French can do it. I checked my watch for the first time after 7 minutes and with 143 minutes remaining, I also considered going out. I will not even try to discuss the incoherence of the "plot" or the inability of the characters to be likeable, because about 1 hour, I realized that none of this mattered. It was not just complacent or pretentious, it was a void. A sucker aspirator. This film has no saving grace, no nice character, nothing funny and nothing sad. It's not smart enough to be dramatic and there's no time that's a bit wacky. The most intriguing thing about this film is how well it has been able to get generally laudatory and positive reviews. I was deceived by these critics, but it is not worth it, good reader. All I want for Christmas is my three hours back.
