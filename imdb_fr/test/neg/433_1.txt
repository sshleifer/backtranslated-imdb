Hello people, <br /> <br /> I can not believe that "Shades" from That Chose You Do played that role. I do not think Cory Feldman would have played that role. This movie was a pile of steaming poop. Save your money and time, and see each of the top 250. I swear I wanted to slap the Blockbuster lady to allow her to praise this. Stay away !!!!!! <br /> <br /> Mr. Hipp
