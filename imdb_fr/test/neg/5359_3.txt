Can anyone explain to me why only one American dies in this film, and when he dies, the scene is supposed to be very moving, but the Operation Delta Force team kills hundreds of Russians in scenes of Slow Motion or Thousands of Arabs, even in slow-motion action scenes, you're supposed to cheer and say, "Take this, non-American monsters!" I know I've used a lot of "slow action scenes", but that's because every action scene in this movie is slow, you guessed it. Each one of them ... And this team should be called Invincible Invading Ball Force, because it seems to have supernatural powers that help them avoid bullets. And if this supernatural power fails, they have a kind of super-regenerative power, which is all they need to kill the entire non-American army that separates them from victory. At this point, everyone does not care, since they have been asleep by another idiotic action scene derisory ... That is to say, if they do not laugh loudly at the acting , the derisory dialogues and the incredible story. That's what I did ... The cast is composed of unknown actors, who will probably remain unknown since they do not even play characters. They only play with guys armed with guns (and, let's not forget, super powers) ... The only quality is that the special effects are not surprisingly so bad (although they are slow motion) for a TV movie ... it still sucks ... and at the same time, it's so bad that it's good ... OK, maybe at the end it gets a bit too repetitive .. . <br /> <br /> 25%
