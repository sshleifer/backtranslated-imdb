Cheeky loss of my time as a spectator. It's one of the worst films I've seen in a long time. Please, do not rent it, you will regret it! Guaranteed! I wonder how Kathleen Turner ended up in there! She is a legitimate actress and people may be attracted to this film because of her. But it is really better to act as if this title had never been created! It should not have existed!
