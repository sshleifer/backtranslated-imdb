Despite the potentially fascinating premise, Series 7 is a weak attempt to attack reality TV. Apart from its cheap underground production values, which are horrifying for 10 minutes, the general tone of the film is misguided. Several critics have tackled the role played in the film, but I think the real problem is this lame attempt to turn the movie into a joke. Aside from the fact that jokes are not funny (a pregnant woman swears a lot, a girl gets a lot of weapons), it does not freeze with the tone of the film. If the manufacturers had really made Series 7 a striking resemblance to both the colorful and hollow editions of reality TV, the lame sound effects, the camera movements, perhaps their talk would have been stronger or the less more acceptable. Instead, the Series 7 winds through the already-tried world of death and game show. You can imagine that the director slaps himself on the back for stating an obviousness.
