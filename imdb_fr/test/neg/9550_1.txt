SPOILER ALERT <br /> <br /> An enigmatic film that is sort of an anti-death statement with dignity, although it tries to do the opposite. Washington is a paralyzed scientific police officer who has been suffering and wants to die for four years (apparently, he wrote his huge sales book just a year ago, so it's not despair). He arranges for his doctor to help him to suicide and to return within a week. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, he helps in the case of a serial killer. It recruits courage, I do not want to do it, but I'm so good at it, cop Jolie, and they spot clues impossible to draw extremely unlikely conclusions about moments. Hey, this old bolt means that the killer has the millionaire's wife in a steam tunnel near the old Woolworth building. Shyeah, that's right. It's laughable. Yet no one is smart enough to understand that the doctor who will assist him is the murderer. <br /> <br /> When he comes to Washington for the murder (earlier than planned), he changes his heart and struggles incredibly. for his life. Cut to the bad guy on the verge of turning the scene of the good guys when BANG kicked off --- but the villain did not shoot! No, the woman comes out of the corner, she just shot him in the back.
