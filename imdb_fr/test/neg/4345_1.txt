The producers of this film must be prosecuted for misrepresenting copyrighted material, including the Dungeons & Dragons Advanced Player Handbook. Fear and ignorance engender the kind of senseless propaganda that inspires waste like this film. If some of you have doubts about the innocence of Dungeons & Dragons, why not go to your local hobby shop and see how to get to a gaming group to see for yourself that D & D has nothing to fear.
