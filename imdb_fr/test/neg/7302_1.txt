I bought this film at a market stall three years ago .. I have to give it to you when I sat down and looked at it .. I thought 'OK! It's going to be another great action movie B '. Obviously I was wrong .. Watching this movie .. I began to realize that this film took me to another planet .. full of cr * p! <br /> <br /> I was getting really bored and fed up with this movie .. Although I wanted to see, it was going to happen at the end .. I really felt like I was really pissed off. <br /> <br /> The people behind the film may have brought known actors into this project. But what were they thinking? Even these actors could not save this movie .. <br /> <br /> At the end of the film ... I felt like it was a waste of money .. I do not I had bought that little movie man for a small amount of money. A few months later, I sent the tape to a charity .. I did not want to see her again .. <br /> <br /> Sorry! But if you plan to watch a movie and fall asleep, I can strongly recommend it. Me? I prefer to switch to Pro-Plus and watch something ok ..! <br /> <br /> Disappointing 1 of 10!
