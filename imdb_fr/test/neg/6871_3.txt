And only one, in my opinion. <br /> <br /> This reason is Margaret Leighton. She is a wonderful actress, on stage and on screen. We are unlikely to see it, however. I think this is especially true in the United States. <br /> <br /> Here, she plays a role of sympathy. Not only that, but she is also very pretty and supposed to be some kind of bomb. <br /> <br /> Walter Pigeon does not stand up to the tradition of Drummond's performers. He is always reliable but he does not play much. He is not a rascal or a rascal. As a result, it seemed like a talkative business with little action or suspense. But check for Leighton.
