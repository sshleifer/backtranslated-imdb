When I went to university in the early 70s, it was easier. With the exception of a brief event in 1994, I have been totally free of any influence of illegal substances since then and have never regretted it ... until now. DB: TBTE must be, handily, the best movie to watch when smashed. The dream state he creates is very strange when you do not smoke anything, but I'm sure that would seem quite normal after a big doobie. (It's not that I recommend that, you understand.) The soothing narration, provided by a tuberculosis victim trapped in a painting, as in a quality cinema, would be ideal to help the stunned spectator to follow complicated. Plus, everything in the movie is pretty organic ... old-fashioned natural breasts with fried chicken bucket. <br /> <br /> Now, there is no doubt that the young man with the (ahem) "hand problem" is sailing in the movie. At one point, you just KNOW he's going to say, "Hey, when I move my hand, it leaves traces!" Trust me ... you'll know when you get there. <br /> <br /> The only other thing we need to answer is: how good can a movie be when at least half of the budget has been spent moving a huge bed frame for plans indoor and outdoor? <br /> <br /> Definitely a must for horror lovers, but suits the general public in good conditions (if you know what I mean and I think you do). He only wins four stars because I can not really say that it took talent to do.
