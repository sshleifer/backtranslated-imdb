This film began with a certain promise: the distribution of big names, beautiful scenery, but then it collapsed. <br /> <br /> Most of the time, it's impossible to tell if it's a serious movie or a comedy. One minute, they say that there is no joy to kill and a minute later, there is a fight scene where we play music and fun jokes. <br /> <br /> Some of the actors are pretty bad, mostly Patrick Swayze Piper Perabo. She also has words like, "When I get married, it will be a matter of love." Ugh. <br /> <br /> But the worst thing about this movie is that it's boring. Not enough action, not enough humor, not enough conspiracy, not much really. Just a lot of clich√©s and cheese moments. <br /> <br /> In addition, a movie with "Dragon" in the title should contain many more dragons than the few dragons (and pathetic CGI) that appeared in this movie. Can not the SciFi channel show * good * movies?
