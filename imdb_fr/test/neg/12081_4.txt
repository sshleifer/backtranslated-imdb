"Hardbodies 2" is harmless, aimless and less intriguing. I would add "brainless" to this list, but the gadget "film in the film", although poorly realized, helps to escape this label. The landscape has changed from Californian beaches to Greek islands and the only members of the cast of the first film are Sorrells Pickard (the bearded guy) and Roberta Collins (who at one point falls into a chasm, recalling his classic cat fight memories with Pam Grier in "The Big Doll House"). All the other actors are new, but apparently, Brad Zutaut is supposed to play the same character (Scotty) as Grant Cramer in "Hardbodies". This suite lacks the energy and appeal of the first film, and does not correspond to being in the "hotness" department. Of course, Brenda Bakke and Fabiana Udenio are very pretty, but the Teal Roberts team - Cindy Silver - Kristi Somers is unbeatable. "Hardbodies 2" is certainly not the worst of its kind, but if you only want to see one of these films, you have to get the original. (* 1/2)
