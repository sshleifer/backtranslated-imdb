K, one day, my father took a movie with a "neat" cover. I went home with my mother and we were like we were watching this new movie we had never seen before! .. Ok so it started ... interesting start, fresh and disgusting gore robots (eek) on a strange planet (actually it was Pluto was not it?) ... Blablabla I could tell all the story but I do not point out instead, WTF NEVER EVER pick up a movie with a lame lame name, and seriously, I do not mean NEVER judge a book by its cover (mistake) .. it looked like an interesting movie ALWAYS c sci-fi movies, his disgusting. I mean it was so bad that I just started laughing (I swear it tried to be serious) I CAN DESCRIBE STUPIDITY! That killed more than a million brain cells and I can not even write offspring reviews. HER BAD CEL Argh and I wana you're preparing something "weird" * fucking shit * mechanics p3n1 $ * fucking shit * Sorry to say that. His classic batman laughs but in a new packaging. What the hell was this director thinking?
