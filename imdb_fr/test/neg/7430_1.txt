I really wanted to love this movie. The second film in the series had a silly, silly feel (of course, I was drunk too). I watched this film with the greatest hope of a similar experience of great cinematic hilarity, a Mystery Science Theater 3000. I was wrong !!!!! This movie is a god movie mess, and I loved the second one !!!! From the ugly effeminate with David Bowie's scared wig to ugly ugly naughty women with bursts of laughter that could strip paint from a garage door, all that was a painful mess. In fact, I felt bad for Sue Price, because the film was under an actress of his stature (that says a lot about everything). A horrible film, horrible (it's not a recommendation).
