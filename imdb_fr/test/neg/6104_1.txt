The film begins with a scene that simply could not be. A man wakes up and while his wife stays in bed, he begins his morning prayers in his room while his wife sleeps peacefully. The blessings of the morning are recited, but only those that Gitai finds controversial. the rest is conveniently omitted. then while he is in philactorie and tallis, he fucks his wife hello !! This is not an exact representation of Jewish prayer in any home, let alone in a chaste home. Amos Gittai is not interested in a precise description of the chassidic life. He wants to add to his ever-growing list of melodramatic and empty films. The scenes of mikka (ritual bath) are far from accurate and his Jewish marriage was laughable, because it does not even look like the atmosphere of a Hassidic marriage. The hungry way of life poses many problems for me, but I have no use for Amos Gittai's commentary on these issues. He would have you believe that chassidim are all dense comformists with severe depression attacks. I may not agree with the chassidic lifestyle, but I recognize that the hungry life is multi-layered. Amos Gitai is blinded by his own stubborn pseudo-intellectual secularist and is therefore unable to portray an accurate description of the chaste life. Apart from his mediocre research and his unbalanced portrayal of the chaste life, Gitai also fails on other aspects. The plot is full of holes, the dialogue laden with silence, the soundtrack is too repetitive and the sometimes powerful acting game was too often charged with melodrama. The film hangs around again and again and the end is not worth staying. watch if you have to, but be warned. If you want to know more about the hungry life, go to the communities and talk to chassidim. Do not rely on Gittai's movie!
