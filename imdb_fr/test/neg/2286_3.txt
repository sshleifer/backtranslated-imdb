Connery climbs aboard Moore's jester train in this fucking movie. Rejecting all that made the success of Bond, this film degrades even more the character of Bond, placing it in the category of the inspector Gadget. Get Smart it is not. There is no style here, only second-rate actors play on inexpensive sets. It's a pity that Connery could not lend a class element here, but it does not show. Everything here feels mediocrity, including Connery's bad wolf. Maybe if I were in the snow and could choose between watching "Never Say Never Again" and "Howard The Duck", I would choose the old one. If you want the real James Bond, get a Ian Flemming novel.
