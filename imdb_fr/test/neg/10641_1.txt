That's right, no one really expects anything from the aftermath. But even at this level, it's a terrible movie. <br /> <br /> Essentially an anthology film, this fourth installment of the Hellraiser saga is a story of origins and a synthesis of the entire series at the same time. An ambitious idea. But none of the actors has enough time on the screen to do anything with his characters and the rookie director Yagher has abandoned the film rather than give in to studio interference. The result is a pile of steaming mediocrity that even fanboys have trouble defending. Unless you are an Alan Smithee fan, avoid this one.
