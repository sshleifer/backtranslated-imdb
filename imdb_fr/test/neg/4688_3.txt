For the uninitiated, almost all of Andy Milligan's films are shocking, but despite the fact that I've seen many of his films, this one remains a pledge of pure mediocre. <br /> <br /> Of course, Milligan takes the Sweeney Todd tale, done with period costumes (but not necessarily vintage hairstyles, in some cases) and with the camera work and the usual granular quality causing headaches. As for the gore, well, the version I saw might have been cut off, because there is not much, for a movie with "bloodthirsty" in the title. The best indication of making subversive films here is a meat pie made up only of the tit of a poor victim. <br /> <br /> So, even though I will always cherish this piece of, uh, work, on my video shelf, it's definitely a little disappointing in terms of content. Recommended for the foolhardy and the most curious. 3 out of 10
