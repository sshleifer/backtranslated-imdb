OK, the end of the story is - all the victims are kidding on the main character and no one is really dead. Yes, I know that Cry Wolf did it and did it well, but it's not "Cry Wolf", it's "Scream Crap"! Even if the "characters" do not seem to die, we see them being stabbed to death (and other means by which they are killed), even if these "killings" do NOT happen as no one can see them. Mr. Director, if you want to show people who are being killed, someone needs to see him, if they are not filmed and the character is killed by himself, it does not work - and until end, I liked some scenes but your end has ruined everything. <br /> <br /> The acting is horrible (especially the kid from the beginning who really thinks he's cheated on his friends by making them think they're playing with the brain of his dead grandmother) the scenario is less that if the movie is half-cooked (if the movie is half-cooked), the only reason I awarded a 3 to this movie is because a) they actually did something b) they did go out and c) they shot in the movie Yes you read right, they wasted (at least) $ 5,000 in movie stock for that crap. Sad, if they had shot DV, they would have had money for a better cast and another author to read the script and make it good. <br /> <br /> I admire the fact that the director has done something (as most do not), BUT the fact that he comes on IMDFB explains how the film is "original". <br /> <br /> Avoid the movie if you want to buy it to see, if a friend has it, it could be a fun movie to borrow.
