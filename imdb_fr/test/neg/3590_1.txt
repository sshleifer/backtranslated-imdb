I rated this film at 1/10 and did it in a good way. this film is not what it seems and I did not understand the purpose. take the first joke for example. Their is this sign at the beginning to begin. It was good, but they started having a guy who talks about the hood, then he dies, then the other guys who talk and then die after the other guy says that people are not getting ready for their birthday without die. and he gets a cake now. then he dies. <br /> <br /> The jokes are just stupid, it's very clever and I would have thought it would have been better from a director like the director of the scary movie: <br /> > <br /> Shawn Wayans (written by) & Marlon Wayans (written by) & Phil Beauman (written by) <br /> <br /> but it sucks and I skip the next time they want to make a other comedy, they make good jokes and not lame.
