One of my old high school teachers boasted to see all the movies of his life. One day, one of my friends and I decided to make a film called "Pacific Inferno". Later, we quarreled over whether the lead role was played by Carl Weathers or Billy Dee Williams. Our teacher found the argument interesting, so he approached us and informed us that the lead role in "Pacific Inferno" was played by Jim Brown. We thought he was trapped in a lie until we went to the library and discovered that "Pacific Inferno" was actually a real movie. This incident forced me to rent the movie ... it's horrible. Our composite film had a better plot than this piece. Weathers and Billy Dee would have been much better in the picture.
