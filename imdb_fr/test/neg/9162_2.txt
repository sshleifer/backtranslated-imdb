Do you know the old saw about a train wreck? The one about how you can not look away? This film is not so good. The only reason you're still here is that you brought your kids and you can not leave them alone at the theater. You could take a nap. <br /> <br /> Tim Hill should never turn in a movie after delivering this horrible piece of junk. He managed to take a decent comic actor into Jason Lee and turn him into a robotic and uncertain actor in this production. <br /> <br /> I did not have much hope for this film in the first place, I admit it. If it was not basically the only family film where I could take my son to Christmas, my wife and I would not be gone. God, I wish we could go back and stop ourselves. I leaned toward my wife for about 10 minutes to tell her how much I thought she was a whore, but she punched me hard. <br /> <br /> I'm not kidding. It's putrid. Only David Cross's formidable work as usual prevents this criticism from being just one star. <br /> <br /> The story is disgusting, insulting and stupid, as one would expect for a movie like this "Curious George" was wonderfully smart and enjoyable). The acting is mainly poor. The decision to "update" Chipmunks' songs for today's audience was at best discouraged and at worst thorny. It does not work. <br /> <br /> The old chipmunks were smart, mischievous and clever. These chipmunks are mute, a little petty, odious, and in a surprise, needy to the point of being useless. <br /> <br /> Whether in retrospect, tribute, or as a new production, this film is totally unsuccessful. The final straw? My son was impatient to leave. Spend your money on praising Curious George.
