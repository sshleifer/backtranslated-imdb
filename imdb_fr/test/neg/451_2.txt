To be fair, I did not see much of this show. Probably because it was not as good as the original M * A * S * H, but it seems to me that they moved it every day. Some programs are simply not worth watching every week or so. But I really tried it at first, so it was not so bad. Maybe I was still expecting it to improve, but I can not give this show a 1. In all honesty, I can not give it more than a 2 either. <br /> <br /> It was not MASH (I will not type these stupid * each time). And he was trying to be MASH without making any effort, as if it happened like magic. Well guess what? No magic. The best I can do here is compare it to other shows. <br /> <br /> The trapper John, M.D. was by far a much better show. However, they should have called it B.J. Hunnicut, M.D. because Pernell Roberts looked exactly like an old BJ, but nothing at all to Trapper John. Everything remains the same, just change his name and that of the show. Presto! After MASH was not the only sequel to completely bombard and dishonor the original. Archie Bunker's Place was a lame continuation of All In The Family. There was no heart, no conflict, no depth ?? all the things that made All In the Family so memorable. In the same way, MASH was funny because the doctors reacted to the impossible absurdity of the war. Remove the war and you remove the player for 99% of the humor. Potter can not scream after Klinger wears a dress because Klinger does not wear a dress because he does not try to get fired from the army because he's already out of the army because the war is over . (breathes) All the jokes were forced because there was no motivation for anything. The least motivated was the one who was watching the show. <br /> <br /> And from what I remember, the whole show seemed to be Potter, Klinger and Mulcahy standing abnormally, facing the audience, like a trio of Vaudeville artists. It reminded me of Good Times, where they spent 90% of the show standing behind this couch and talking to the audience, trying to give the impression that they had a natural conversation. They were not. And it seemed even less natural after After MASH. <br /> <br /> Another random treat that I remember is that the people who created MASH never received royalties as a result of the spin-off. The studio used the absurd excuse that After MASH was really a fallout from the MASH movie (which they owned) and not from the TV series. Well tried, but Mulcahy was the only one of the three in the film, and he was never deaf. I guess the studio executives will do everything for their money. Something other than doing a valid suite is.
