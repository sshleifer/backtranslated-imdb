I could not believe it. This film was a total waste of my life. The title is appropriate. Love did not defeat me, this movie did it. I kept looking and watching and waiting and waiting and hoping something happened. And nothing happened! Nothing!! Terrence Howard could not even save that lame work called film. It was dark and confused and I did not understand who had killed the girlfriend at the end. The tone and rhythm of the film were supposed to lead to a dramatic dramatic end. This only served to confuse the audience because the film simply walked along the path. If you want pure torture, watch this movie.
