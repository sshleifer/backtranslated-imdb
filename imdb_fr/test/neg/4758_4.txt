This frothy romantic comedy is based on the kind of story I loved as a teenager, but that I find rather unpleasant now. In the case of attachments from May to September, what the old one has in mind is undoubtedly either lust, or the inability to cope with the reality of aging, or both. And the youngest is probably looking for the kind parent he or she was missing in his childhood. These underlying programs seem to me more pathetic than romantic now; they also have something predatory. <br /> <br /> Dick Powell looked a bit embarrassed - as he should be - to play the old man in this silly story. At the age of fifty, he was a thirty-eight-year-old man romancing a teenager. But the young Debbie Reynolds was a knockout - pretty and sassy and full of vinegar - as a misbehaving teenage girl who was seventeen presented herself as a kind of "gift" to the morally honest and honest screenwriter, as a subject of study. His catchy performance pulled me off a note higher than the one this film would have deserved otherwise. Anne Francis was chosen for her beautiful but fragile fianc√©e and managed her small role very well. <br /> <br /> Part of the dialogue was pretty fun too, so it's not totally superfluous. <br /> <br /> 5/10
