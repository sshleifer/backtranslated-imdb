For all wrestling fans, it's the fight to forget. No logic in the matches, some incredible stuff (make the link with the clown and the giant Gonzalez), it was a forgotten PPV, something rare for the WWE (F). The logic of Hogan's final victory in the world title is nonsense, and many people think that this alone helps put the nail in the PPV. From the insignificant gimmicks of Roman soldiers to mere real big quarrels (Doink vs. Crush being the worst game), through the bad combinations (Scott "Razor Ramon vs. Bob Backlund), how can you have one of his return and his first fight, against an undefeated wrestler at the time), this is a PPV that even the WWE has since admitted, was well below what was expected.
