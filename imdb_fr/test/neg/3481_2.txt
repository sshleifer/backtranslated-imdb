This film is highly unlikely. Read the other reviews to see why. <br /> <br /> I would say that most of the characters were plastic, but they did not even give themselves that little luxury; they simply act like cardboard cutouts. Of course, they had to have real surfers for the surfing competition roles, so it's a shit if they can play. At least Occy did not give a shit and went with her. But "Lance" ??? Fuhgeddaboutit. <br /> <br /> The character who sounds right was described by Gerry Lopez who did not really play, he was himself pretty much. He is quite used to trampling people. :-) The only reason I gave this movie a 2 instead of a 1 was because I was preparing a newsletter on my laptop when it was on a late cable channel in the night. It saved me from having to pay close attention to this stupid little waste of time. Not at all, I would do my best to watch it.
