There are so many logical mistakes in this show that it's hardly worth telling. 1) Mystic Gohan is non-existent 2) Uub is as powerful as MAJIN BUU but does not play any role in the series. In a way, it is easily mastered by all the bad guys. 4) Super Saiyan 4 Goku is not a match for Super 17 but Goku not transformed using a movement he learned in a movie that was not supposed to happen, kills it with ease 5) Vegeta is totally useless 6) No character other than Goku has any impact on the outcome of the fights. 7) The series ends with a spiritual bomb ... come 8) Goku invincible? absorbs dragon balls? lame 9) Gotenks? ... even better Goten ??? The trunks ??? 10) Super Saiyan 4 implies a magical transformation into an adult 11) Goku is a kid 12) Goku is a kid 13) No super saiyan level 2 (characterized by electricity) 14) No imagination with the animation of Gogeta 15) Gogeta totally useless 16) Big Bang Kamehameha is the biggest failure in cartoon history (it's not really logical, but I'm going on a tangent) I had not repressed most of the associated memories to this show. When I make enough money, I will finance the redesign of this series.
