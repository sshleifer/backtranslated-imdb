I can not remember the last time a movie was terribly disappointed. I was probably expecting too much of what's happening (in a way, you can of course expect action in dogma-style movies). But there is nothing happening here. Fortunately, I watched him at home and could change channels whenever the silence and the dumb / numb faces began to kill me. And it was very often! It's really not a pleasure to watch ugly people who do not talk and do not move slowly, caress French pigs and kisses, not to mention ugly bodies having explicit sex. If only that made sense ... the whole situation of a murder is ridiculous; seems to have been created solely to show one vagina more since zero characters are able to solve the crime. Having only four pseudo-developed characters and a film that leads nowhere, it is quickly obvious that the director chose him as a killer. And that makes no sense either. In spite of all the trouble and suffering, I must admit that it touched me in an inexplicable way. Maybe you should check it yourself, even if I do not recommend it.
