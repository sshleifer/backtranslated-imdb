A good example of the differences between American cinema and foreign cinema can be seen in a film I recently watched on TV: Indecent Proposal. <br /> <br /> The two protagonists of this indecent proposal, David and Diane Murphy, are played by Woody Harrelson and Demi Moore. I do not know if it was their total lack of chemistry or if they were acting badly, but why we should care so much about whether these two stay together was beyond me. Love, affection, playfulness, attraction? none of these materialized on the screen in their interactions together. <br /> <br /> Since I knew that Robert Redford would eventually appear, it was clear from the start that the good part, the meat of the film, would be the scenes between him and Demi Moore. Poor Woody Harrelson could not possibly feel emotion for the film. He seemed to be restrained, preoccupied with the loss of his hair. <br /> <br /> OK, move so fast. What idiots do these two people (Diane and David) think they can get back the $ 50,000 they owe to the game? No wrong steps in there, just a horribly bad, lazy and unforgivable writing. Of course, they lose all their money. Surprised? I know I was not. Enter Robert Redford (John Gage in the movie) ?? a romantic man, perhaps emotionally cold, an updated Gatsby. A very good role but not a very good actor, beside these two, Redford looks like Olivier. He falls immediately in love and covets Diane and we, the spectators, feel it for once. Here's how to love a woman! Not like David, talking to Diane on a sticky jetty. (Did I see it?) As a Gage, Redford wears a suit and a tie in every scene. Yes, he is supposed to indicate to the seemingly brain-dead audience that he is a rich man, but he also looks well-behaved and at that moment, the brain-dead public appreciates it! The symbolism of the wardrobe includes David's ironed shirts at the end of the film, meaning resolution, gathering after a long interlude of wrinkled and torn shirts. <br /> <br /> And what are the evenings in Californian gardens illustrated in Hollywood movies? Suddenly, everyone appears British, with lace dresses, three-piece suits for men, hats (HATS!) And of course the umbrella. Yes Diane, her transformation into a fianc√©e of Rich Man now over, the auction turns slowly around an umbrella. Although she insisted that she could not be bought, she eventually succumbed to sexual tension. Here is where the film branched out in pure Americana. I mean, of course David and Diane will finish together, my question is: WHY? Diane was bored with David, why not let her ride the Robert Redford wave? And I mean for a long time? How can she so easily get out of this older man's romantic-sexual desire, simply because Woody Harrelson is bringing his hair back to the garden party, sits down and looks at Demi Moore in the eye. This is not how it happens. He was so LOW. <br /> <br /> But we must have a happy ending. We must swallow the moral lesson. We are not sophisticated enough to have it otherwise. Director Lyn attempted to create a fatal attraction for the Juvie set, the young'uns. <br /> <br /> In addition to receptions in gardens where there is no such thing as a T-shirt or a baseball cap, such films have a reliable public transport system that connects cities and municipalities. away from California. If not, how to symbolize the return to life of the middle class or the working class?
