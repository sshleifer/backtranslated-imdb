This film really shows the farce and hypocrisy of Indian society. What he tries to show you is only one aspect of the story. The other side of the story is the hidden emotional and mental abuse of Indian children, which this movie does not show. <br /> <br /> "Indian parents" are guilty of the following offenses: a. Destroy the individuality of children by making them very dependent on parents from an early age. Such children only become adults physically, but remain in the minds of children. Since everything has been provided by their Indian grandparents, children do not automatically feel the need to work hard or learn the basics of human communication with other human beings outside of their parents. <br /> <br /> B. I can show you so many Indian parents who are trying to prevent their children from making friends, going out or keeping them from doing anything that brings them to to become adults. The reason they do it is the same. selfishness. Indian parents "expect" their children to take care of them as they grow older. They do not save for themselves and as soon as they reach the age of 50 ... They scream ...... We have aged and so we are dependent on your children since we have do the GREAT SERVICE to bring you into this world and take care of you and weaken you intellectually. <br /> <br /> Most Indian parents aged 50 have rundown bodies and health and are financially completely safe. Most people think that they ABSOLUTELY do not need to take care of themselves, because they "expect" their children to take care of them. <br /> <br /> In the west, the opposite is happening. People start planning for retirement at the age of 20 and once retired, they are financially secure. <br /> <br /> Indian parents do not do anything like that because, as I said, they brought the children to the world and what better <br /> <br /> I'm a victim from my Indian parents (I'm sure there are countless other Indian children like me), who have grown up physically but still struggle for their life, THEIR OWN and they continue to have 50-year-old harassing kids who scream at loudly for help all the time. <br /> <br /> This movie shows only one side of the story ..... UTTER piece of JUNK
