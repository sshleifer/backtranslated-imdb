I like Noel Coward, the spirit. I like Noel Coward, writes the piece. I like Noel Coward, the composer and singer, but I hate Noel Coward, the actor. <br /> <br /> For me, this is a man who should have stayed firmly behind the scenes, writing his plays, composing his music and creating his deep and hilarious observations. He should never have been allowed to do it in front of a camera. <br /> <br /> Do not be fooled, he is one of the greatest talents of the twentieth century, but the man simply can not act and his voice ... with it rolls and its tonal quality Excessively round ... well, it could very easily grate cheese in my opinion. <br /> <br /> This is one of my least favorite Coward offerings, as it unconvincingly portrays a psychiatrist embarking on an adventure with a much younger woman, compounded by the fact that this much younger woman is an old school friend of his much younger wife. <br /> <br /> Celia Johnson is a joy to watch as ever as an injured Wife Cowards. It is his performance that saves this film of abject maturity. I guess her little adventure in Coward's Brief Encounter four years ago qualified her for that role because she had to raise her eyebrows playing with such a promiscuous woman, which allowed her to win back some fans and gain sympathy. <br /> <br /> She was a wonderful actress and you can understand why Noel Coward has used so much in many of his productions. <br /> <br /> However, the rest of the movie is dull, badly played. predictable and overall boring until almost tight in the ass. <br /> <br /> If you want Noel Coward, take the time to watch In which we serve, Blythe Spirit or This Happy Breed. Three treasures of Christmas Coward. With pretty movies like these, I guess we can forgive this turkey. <br /> <br /> I awarded him these four stars only for the addition of Miss Johnson, but overall, I would avoid it like the plague. .
