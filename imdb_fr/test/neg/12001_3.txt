Of all the children's movies I've seen over the years, it was probably the worst. I took four children aged 7 to 11 and none of them liked. <br /> <br /> The script seemed to be based on a Willy Wonka story, but it had nothing to do. <BR /> <br /> If you are thinking of seeing this movie, do not waste your time, it's bad. <br /> <br /> They make a sequel, so it may be worth looking to see if they can even make things worse, but I do not think it's possible.
