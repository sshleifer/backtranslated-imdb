I bought this DVD as part of a series of 50 "historical classics". This is not a classic, and as the plot was updated at the time of publication, it is not historical either. The current title of the DVD is "Indecent" and subtitled "The privacy of Becky Sharp". Myrna Loy is not very convincing, even if for her defense, she is struggling with an awful scenario and a banal dialogue. As with many early talkies, and especially those made by small studios, the actors and the team are showing little talent. Loy wears some pretty stylish dresses, but his costumes and makeup in the following scenes are exaggerated. The only saving grace is a tolerable performance by Billy Bevan, who plays one of his many contenders
