The script is the worst part of this film, because it goes from one principle to another, omitting all the important elements that would have allowed the creation of many different stories. (This film is confusing because the audience does not know what the story is.) I had no problem with low production values ​​and the acting was not great, but it's TV, so it was good. I do not mind that some scenes look like a scene. But having such a nonsensical scenario is totally useless. Did a leader actually read it before taking out the money? Avoid that at all costs. <br /> <br /> The prologue in particular was so poorly written that it took a voice to complete all the details left out. The prologue was rushed, it was not clear what was happening, ie. The Russian revolution was reduced to "Some riots take place in Petersburg", the next scene being soldiers arresting them. I know the basic history of the Revolution in order to be able to specify the details, "these pesky communists". It is best to ignore the prologue. <br /> <br /> It could have been a thoughtful study of someone confused about himself. He installs this premise at the asylum. She may have trouble identifying with the rest of the movie. No, gone. The film assumes that she is what she says (even though there is no empirical evidence yet.) He sets up a melodramatic romance, a love so strong that he will believe everything she says. Ok, a soppy romance. No, because it does not make sense. The interest of love is like a madman crazy (and, incidentally, fishy), overflowing with unleashed gestures. It does not work either, because the film stupidly decides to tell the truth in the monologue of the end. They never married and she returned to America. The love story collapses. Despite the many love scenes, I have never been convinced of the reason why they were in love. I find novels more convincing, even if there are only one or two scenes that prove that they even spent time together. <br /> <br /> It could have been a suspenseful movie where the film assumes that she is what she says and she has trouble proving her identity. No, the trial is summarized rather than processed. The weird voice returns, again, to complete the details of a better movie. <br /> <br /> The funniest thing to consider is what really happened. Anna Anderson was an idiot who went to America and married another idiot and they did crazy things together. Throughout her life she has had episodes of whimsical behavior. None of this in the film either. There is a really boring character in the asylum that pops out of nowhere and presents itself as an informant of the type 'Flight over Cuckoo Next /' Twelve Monkeys'. Fortunately, she disappears, having brought nothing to the story.
