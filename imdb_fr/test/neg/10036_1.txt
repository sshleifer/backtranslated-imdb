I hope you are joking? It's probably the worst amateur movie I've ever seen. The casting was awful, the acting was worse than horrible and I'm sorry, the guy at the picnic speed loading his plate full of food was pretty much useless and the demonic poop and pot hunt Drew's room around was nothing more than comical. When I drove around Bell Witch, I wanted to believe it. I read literature about it and thought it was a plausible story. But this movie just destroyed that. Ric White (director, scriptwriter, lead actor, etc.) takes himself a little too seriously and I think he gives himself a little more credit than he deserves .... Do yourself a favor .. skip this one.
