For the first 40 minutes or so, Luna is a real pleasure to watch. The characters and their situation are interesting and the photography and places are beautiful to watch. Then Jill Clayburgh discovers that her son, Matthew Barry, consumes heroin and that the film begins to break, then becomes quite ridiculous in his illness. <br /> <br /> Clayburgh asks him why and when he started using this drug. get a straightforward answer, which would be a little helpful. He says he does not care about anything, but it's not correct, because we see clearly in the first astonishing scenes that he is very interested in his mother's singing, baseball, sex and sex, and that he is apparently concerned enough to refuse marijuana. This film is for people who think that Junior is taking drugs, because Mom and Dad were workaholics who missed his piano recital. I think that such a dangerous and emotionally unstable drug, such as heroin, has been chosen as a kind of intellectual catalyst for later scenes of incest. There is a lot of talk about the love of the mother for the son but it is especially Bernardo Bertolucci who is pretentious. Luna would have been great as a small, picturesque family drama. <br /> <br /> How old was Matthew Barry in this movie? I was more concerned about the weird things he had to do as an actor for this film than for anything his character was going through. ** out of ****
