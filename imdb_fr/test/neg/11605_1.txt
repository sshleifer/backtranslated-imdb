I am surprised that so many people find this film still close to good. Let me say that I'm a huge fan of Hitchcock and I started making as many movies as I could on video, but this one was so far below the average not only Hitch's movies - ah Well, I'm being too nice here. This photo is really bad. I do not care if Hitch did the very talented Carole Lombard, but I've already seen 50s sitcoms with more intelligence and style than this boring turkey. Chemistry between Lombard and Robert Montgomery? Listne I like mashed potatoes and ice cream but I would not like to taste them together. I have seen better chemical spills on the highway than here. <br /> <br /> If you really like Hitchcock, avoid this movie and see one of his best. For shouting loudly, the songs that Hitch did in the old TV show were more fun than anything this movie failed miserably.
