Here is an overview of a typical Rachael Ray Show: <br /> <br /> 1. The horrible theme song starts playing, and Rachael goes down wearing his Snapcrotch outfit in this strange goods lift. 2. She starts running screaming and / or insulting the audience, then shouts them to sit down. 3. A clumsy monologue. <br /> <br /> (The next are in any order) 4. A segment reminiscent of Rachael's horn ("I lost 500 pounds with Rach's recipes," Rachael Ray saved my life, " Rachael's fashion tips. ") 5. A totally useless DIY tip (how to engrave words into pots, how to use your washing machine as a salad spinner, how to build a tube of lipstick with a light on it.) 6. The unleashing of a horrible recipe on the unsuspecting public (we never see the reactions of the first bites) 7. A celebrity guest with an awkward interview, followed by questions clearly written by the public 8. A person who Help Rachael's friends (that is to say, I say yes to all that is woman, that I only have overalls and that I do not find the time to put on my makeup as a housewife). What would they do without you, Rachael? * Sigh * <br /> <br /> Reasons why this show should be avoided like the plague: 1. Fakeness: Rachael Ray claims that the whole show is not scripted. Those who attended the recording of the show claimed that the entire show was scripted. Many of these same people also mentioned that there is even a very strict dress code for the show. <br /> <br /> 2. Her show is spinning around too: where Oprah, the highest-rated talk show host of all time, has a definite theme for her show, Rachael jumps like a child of ADHD soda on crack. Its average issue maybe 10, short, worthless segments of a show. The second, you'll get fashion advice from Kojo, and the next Rachael will prepare "Spanish" peppers stuffed with manchego cheese, and the next will be a giant anaconda on stage, and the next you'll get the picture. . <br /> <br /> 3. Rachael is a poor host with bad ideas: in addition to his squeaky personality, Rachael's capacity is terrible, at best. His questions for his distinguished guests are poor and often irrelevant to the interview, and his segments are unattractive and offer little educational or humorous value. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, you must not waste your time. with this schlock. In any case, it will be canceled soon.
