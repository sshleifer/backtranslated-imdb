It's funny ... one day before I saw this film, I was watching a documentary about Leni Riefenstahl, so the comparison came automatically ... of course there are none :) > <br /> This film is weak in all aspects ... playing is not convincing (especially the one playing Simona ...) and unnatural ..., editing is confusing and always leaves a front taste of the unfinished plan, the music is not suitable, the story does not run, it becomes boring and the film is much longer as it is ... oh, and the characters are not very well shown, you can not really say more about girls (except what you see). .. The film also tries to shock by explicit insults (which is very laughable :) <br /> <br /> So ... 2/10
