Wow ... not in a good way. <br /> <br /> I can not believe people dig this trash. Most TV shows are pretty bad, and this trend has been going on for a while now - it's only getting worse, but Las Vegas definitely wins. What a terrible show ... <br /> <br /> Actors are a group of passionate losers who have never been anywhere (except James Caan ... who knows) so it's not their fault that this show is bad. They just can not help it. Blame the producers and writers. I can not believe they shot them and they were pretty proud of their work to broadcast them.
