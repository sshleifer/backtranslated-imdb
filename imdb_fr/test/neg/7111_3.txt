I was sick one day and I ran chains and I came across this terribly classified movie. The plot and even the subplots (if you find one) have been destroyed. BUT, as bad as the story has been, I reserve a special comment to Liza Minelli. His character was absolutely one of the most annoying characters I have ever had the misfortune to see on film. His only two competitors in this category are John Leguziamo in "The Pest" and Julia Stiles in everything she did (or half done). Maybe she performed exactly as the script suggests or maybe (moan!) Is the limit she has to her acting range. Anyway, they should have been rewritten and killed in the first 30 seconds of the movie (for example, like the girl who fell from the balcony of Lethal Weapon (I) (but at least she had beautiful breasts)) <br /> <br /> Very humbly submissive ...
