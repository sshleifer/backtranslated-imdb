I saw about five or six episodes of this stupid show, and I had to watch most of them. And I did not like the episodes I saw. What happened to Dan Schneider? After giving us shows as impressive as Drake and Josh, why did he decide to create such a stupid show? My problem is not only with Dan, it's also with the guys who proposed this show for an Emmy, were they drunk that day or what's the problem? Drake and Josh have not been nominated for an Emmy, but it's way better than Zoey 101. The producers of this series should be ashamed of the existence of this series, just hope that your pregnancy will influence the series, or better yet, it will be canceled.
