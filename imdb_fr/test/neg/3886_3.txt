With Knightly and O'Tool in mind, this film had good possibilities, and with McCallum after nagging Knightly, maybe a tension. But they threw everything in the trash, then the maudlin remnants of war. It was obviously totally superficial, beautiful English country, seaside or not. The first mistake was to throw Knightly so early in the film, so she could easily have played someone over two years playing the role. They missed all chances of having big conflicts among the actors, and instead pulled stupidly on the elements of easy and inexpensive ropes.
