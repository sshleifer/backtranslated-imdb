Parties: The Clonus Horror is a good horror. There are, of course, the bad habits of the late 1970s. There is the very bad role of Dick Sargent to Peter Graves. And then there are the clones themselves. Their days consist mainly of running, jumping, cycling and fighting with each other. When they do not, they discover America. Not the America group, nor the Neil Diamond song, but an America where they will become part of a larger society. But they receive some sort of strange drug then they all have their body fluids drained (General Ripper was right!) And they are placed in the freezer and wait for Thanksgiving or Christmas when they are thawed and roasted at about 450 degrees. Oops, that's not happening, but it would have been much more interesting than shown. Mario, famous in the group Super Mario Brothers, makes a delicious trip as a doctor who bickers with Dick Sargent.
