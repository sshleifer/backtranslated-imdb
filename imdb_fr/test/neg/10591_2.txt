I had the misfortune to watch this last night on the BBC, I guess I may have been the only spectator. From the beginning, there was something wrong in the film. After a few minutes of viewing, I managed to understand what it was. The movie was bad! Not bad in a good way like Wolfpack or a Seagal movie, just an old bad state. <br /> <br /> Why was this turned into a movie? I saw some episodes of the TV series and I thought everything was fine, but I only saw repetitions because they did it. <br /> <br /> I spent most of the film trying to understand the story. and in the end I was not the wisest. I seem to remember at one point a character, maybe Farina mentions that the Mod Squad can go to places where the police can not. The "place" turns out to be a "club", one of the most difficult places to access, maybe it was the students' party? I lost track of the plot at this point or maybe there was none, and the film has just been cut from leftover remnants of other TV series remakes. <br /> <br /> Was it an action comedy? I do not remember laughing. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie lacked the power to steal scenes from someone like Seymour Hoffman as a villain. With him, Ribisi would have had someone to bounce.
