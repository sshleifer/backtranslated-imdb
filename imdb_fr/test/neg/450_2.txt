Every time I watch Larry King Live, he asks the most complex softball questions to his guests. He rarely receives useful information because he does not ask difficult questions. This comes from his debut on the radio. <br /> <br /> King settles on the radio and has basically not changed the format of the television except that his talking head is visible. He becomes like a puppy for his guests and the only time he really gets useful information is when they do it voluntarily or a caller to the series asks a difficult question. <br /> <br /> Larry is a kind father of a typical interviewer. That means it should not have prime time programming on a big news network if you plan to show it on CNN. It's not because of CNN's story. <br /> <br /> Copying (ie cable) New Network was created by Ted Turner as an alternative to network information because it could broadcast information 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. In the beginning, the only television competition was NBC, ABC and CBS. For this reason, CNN copied the format of its competitors and obtained respectable ratings. <br /> <br /> It worked well for CNN until they got competitive networks that were innovative and provided better / cooler information coverage. In response to rising competition, CNN went into denial and rid its competitors of eating their meals and notes because CNN wanted to resist change. It did not work very long and their notes began to collapse. <br /> <br /> The copy news network is trying to reform itself by reinventing itself by copying the format of the main news network. Unfortunately, this show is a big part of the problem. He is 21 years old and shows very poorly his age. <br /> <br /> Sorry to say that King must be removed from prime time or abandoned completely.
