I do not know where to start. <br /> <br /> Huge problems with continuity, bad acting, etc. For example, Sam is supposed to be away from everyone, but you can see the ski slopes carved into the mountain next to his head. <br /> <br /> But the most fundamental problem is that the essence of the book, Sam's adventure opening the way to the betterment of his entire family, is not even addressed. Instead, in the movie, he is upset by his family and leaves his wealthy parents alone, and when he is fed up, he goes home. Where is its development? Where is the bow? <br /> <br /> If you have never read the book and can get through the 60isms hokey (double / triple / quad visions of the hawk) and the terrible production quality (crunches, ahem, fire, winter the winds stop yelling for dialogue and then restart, etc.) I guess that * could * be OK for an 8 year old. <br /> <br /> But, compared to the sophistication of the book, it's a terrible disappointment. <br /> <br /> Read the book instead.
