Human trafficking is purely an experience "summer, does this" ?? Only this time, it's all soft. <br /> <br /> The main topics are paranoia, male impotence and jealousy ?? <br /> <br /> Much of the film seems to want to emulate Trainspotting (drug culture / clubbing)? but this does not include the low / low tails processed by Trainspotting (eg death / dependency issues, etc.). He even tries to offer a monologue similar to Ewan McGreggor's classic "Choose Life" speech. but `The Milky Bars are on me! Yeah!' ?? what is fudge all that ?! <br /> <br /> The characters try to analyze their lifestyle but when their lifestyle is so superficial ?? their analysis becomes boring and repetitive. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack (for a film that tries to be cool) is pathetic. He understands the likes of Fat Boy Slim and CJ Bolland ?? go? Good dance music IS better than this one! <br /> <br /> The characters become annoying and annoying (especially mid-way through the film) and the lack of attention to the characters is soon felt. <br /> There are some fun scenes ?? But they are few and far between. The mother who caught the son in the room was quite amusing. <br /> <br /> But PLEASE ?? I'm sick of dying scenes of Star Wars analogy. I thought it was much cleaner in some of Kevin Smith's movies (ie: Clerks and Chasing Amy). According to the characters ?? Yoda is an addict, so he is small and bald? huh ?! <br /> <br /> My score ?? 4 out of 10 ?? do yourself a favor and see Trainspotting or Go instead!
