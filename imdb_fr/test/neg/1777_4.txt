Stinger begins "3 months ago" on the SS Newark submarine where genetic experiments went wrong and the crew members are brutally slaughtered by big killer scorpions ... Jump to Camp Pendleton a few months later late, where General Ashford (James Cagnard)) Lieutenant Williams (John Miranda) as part of his mission to board the Newark and assist Dr. Carly Ryan (Michelle Meadows), genetic scientist, before anyone As you know, a group of corporate and marine scientists are aboard the Newark and are shocked to discover it mutilated the corpses of the crew, with the exception of Dr. Mike Thompson (Casey Clark) which does not make much sense. The attack of the scorpions does not delay, the lieutenant Williams falls first. Sergeant Sam Harmon (Christopher Persson) is promoted and takes the responsibility to put everyone safe and put an end to the threat of giant scorpions forever ... <br /> <br /> This co-production for America Swedish was made by Martin Munthe. He also took care of the cinematography and I thought it was a creature devoid of sensuality and unhealthy. It's the beginning of the new year and Stinger is the first giant monster / creature / insect mutant movie I saw in 2007, I hope things can only get better ... The scenario Mat Nastos is incredibly clich√© and gets it all. ideas from other films, including Aliens (1986), note that this is an isolated submarine, a team of marine assembled in a hurry, including one who eats a cigar throughout the film , of scientists including a blonde suede one to try and explain all this and the naughty villainous looting of a company that places the mighty dollar over human life and the last ingredient being the monster / extraterrestrial / insect or something else, in this case there are a lot of big scorpions running around but not used in a unique or imaginative way so they might as well have been locust killers. Yes, everything is there, unfortunately Stinger is not an alien if you know what I mean. It's a long touch of more than 100 minutes and is perfectly predictable even if it is moving at a reasonable pace. As a silly creature feature, you could do worse, despite what many say on the IMDb ... <br /> <br /> Director Munthe does not stand out, it's not scary, there's a lack of atmosphere and action scenes are dull and uninteresting. There are not many scorpion attacks and it takes almost an hour before significant action occurs. The special effects are at the bottom of the scale, but I've seen worse, that's for sure. I mean that does not mean that the effects in Stinger are good, but I have seen worse. There is not much blood or blood, there are mutilated bodies, decapitated heads and someone is torn in two. The only intelligent and amusing moment of the whole film is when the naked Swedish scientist asks her lover to excite her by talking about all the money they will earn scorpions ... However, there was a moment which made me groan and tear my hair in its stupidity while a guy tries to repair the circuits of the submarine and run the projectors by hitting the power / computer cards with a hammer and that it also works ... <br /> Technically Stinger is average at best and there is the usual amount of usual dark corridors that becomes monotonous. Stinger was shot in Stockholm, Sweden, if you're interested. The acting was mediocre and there is nothing else to say. <br /> <br /> Stinger is not a good movie and it's not a big horror movie either, I can not recommend it at all, but I've seen worse. If you liked Stinger (implausible), you may like similar movies "Giant Scorpions on Bulk", Tail Sting (2001) or Scorpius Gigantus (2006) (equally unlikely).
