I saw all 3 now. I can not believe how bad Naqoyqatsi is. Not in comparison with others, but simply on his own merit, or lack thereof. <br /> <br /> I do not understand how the average rating of this movie is greater than 6 out of 10. I gave the first 2 movies 8 out of 10. They were thinking and beautifully made. I gave this movie a score of 1. If a 0 or a negative number was available, I would have awarded this rating instead. What a total waste of time watching this movie. I thought that after the first 30 minutes, I had to turn it off, but then I thought it was just a (very) slow movie. I thought the same thing after 45 minutes, then 1 hour, and so on. Then I realized that it was not going to improve. <br /> <br /> It's very tedious to watch and without any redeeming quality. Do not take me at your word, observe it yourself. Make sure to see the first two movies before this one. If you see this one first, I can guarantee you that you will never want to see the first two, but they are certainly much better than this "work". <br /> <br /> The best part of the movie is when the credits play the role in the end. It is then that your penance on this earth is over and you can forget about 89 minutes of purgatory, because of the suffering that you endured while watching this "film". If God is truly merciful, He will be more generous.
