it was absolutely the most tragic film stack I had to witness. not only was the name completely abusive - since the film has almost nothing to do with piranhas - but the acting is as hollow and flawed as the attempt to make a kind of conspiracy. When you watch this movie, you can not help but spend every second poll when you've had enough and it's time to turn it off. Unfortunately, I waited for the end in my case. It's been two hours of my life that I will never be able to recover.
