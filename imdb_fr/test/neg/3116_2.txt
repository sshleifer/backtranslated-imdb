First, I do not see how the film appears on the "best" list or how it won awards. Compared to The Pianist, who also appears on the "best" list, The Pianist is in gold. This film was missing so many things, at so many different levels, but I can not really explain why I disliked it so much. The main actor was annoying, I felt like I never knew what was going on, and I was bored !! Although it was supposed to be a change in life that Pierre was starting, I wanted it to end ... as soon as possible. Why did it have to be his sister and his cousin? Ugh. And why did Thibault become mean? He has just become a bad bipolar. And also, was it me or did I miss the purpose of what this black guy was? Who were all these people playing music in the big basement of the big warehouse? Why did they have all this strange equipment, these weapons and all those extra pieces to live on? I speak about this very seriously, but does incest often occur in French culture? European culture? I took 5 years of learning about culture and I never heard anything about it!
