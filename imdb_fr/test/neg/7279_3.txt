This movie was recommended to me by several people, and after reading all the positive comments from this site, I went ahead and bought a copy of the movie on eBay. The game in the film is medium and a little hammered, especially from the family of cannibals, a sequence comes to mind when Jupiter plague and delirium to the corpse burned, speaking right in the camera . It's one of those performances where you only wince and feel bad for this poor actor. It is also the proof of some of the worst montages that I saw, there is a terrible jump in the middle of his "speech". There are however some scary moments and sometimes the music works well ... but overall, the movie is not very good and I do not know why people think that Wes Craven is such a good director. So far, he has not shown me anything that I think is brilliant, the only thing that has improved with Cravens movies, the production to produce was his budget.
