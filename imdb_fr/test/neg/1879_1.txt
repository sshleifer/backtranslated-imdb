Cronica from a desayuno combines the worst flaws of Mexican cinema, a feat rare nowadays. <br /> <br /> It's pretentious: he wants us to believe he's deep, only because one scene is blurry, another is pseudo-surreal, yet another play plays with tradition faces crying with laughter, Eisenstein-Infante-Caifanes, the edition is fragmented and so solemn. <br /> <br /> He has a weak writing: the main The story barely grows up, so she has three other smaller and useless stories, stuck in it. They are only useful for extending the duration of the film. <br /> <br /> Most actors are bad. A real feat, knowing that many of the best-known Mexican actors have been chosen. <br /> <br /> There is a gross and useless language abuse. To the point that the character of Paloma, which symbolizes the dreams of freedom of a child, uses it fully. <br /> <br /> He is homophobic. The character played by Eduardo Palomo is the most painful and most punished representation of a transsexual I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> It's very boring. I ended up envying the people who had left the theater before the end of the film. <br /> <br /> Anyway, things have improved in Mexico and elsewhere. <br /> <br /> In other words: "Para partte the madre, nada como una mala pel√≠cula"
