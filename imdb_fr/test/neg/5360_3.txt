Let me first say that I am a ghost-believer and that I do know that they exist. I have enough experience with them to know they are there. <br /> <br /> What I hate are people who integrate the Bible and religion into it all. People forget that there is more than one "Bible", thousands of religions and beliefs and different ways of interpreting what is said in the Bible. Not everyone believes in God and everyone does not believe in a stereotypical religion. <br /> <br /> Religion does not say it all, it's one of the things I should not mention in the Bible, but that many do not know is that even the Bible killer the more creepy breaks the very rules that are written in ... are supposed to never wear more than one fabric at a time, slavery is not a problem, and you can kill your neighbor under certain circumstances. None of this, "Oh, it was the Old Testament, and now we have the New Testament." If the Bible is the word of God and can not be changed, there should be no change, no version. Religion is full of misinterpretations, miscellaneous facts, and people who follow it so blindly that there is no other way. The excuses these blind followers use are either pathetic or they themselves can not explain the discrepancies properly, but instead use excuses that have been passed on to them by their pastor or teacher. <br /> <br /> But anyway, on the exam. I'm a decent fan of Ghost Hunters and when I heard that this show was coming soon, I was pretty excited and I thought it had potential. Even though I like to watch the "Ghost Hunters", I do not like some of their members, and I do not like the way they can return a haunted place, without being able to explain anything that is happening. It's not because your investigative equipment does not detect it that the camera filming the series did not take it I'm glad they're skeptical, but it's as if they do not understand that the fact that nothing is inserted on your recorder and that the film does not make the place haunted or not. If ghosts were so easy to capture, it would be a fact and not a belief. It's more of a kind of thing "in the right place at the right time," and if there's something out there, what makes you think it's going to "perform" for you? This show is a little ridiculous. It's usually boring, and there's a lot of talk, a lot of mediums, yet nothing happens. Filtered storytelling of the main type is usually either boring to listen to or fundamentally useless. <br /> <br /> In addition, the use of psychics is too abundant because I believe that VERY few of them are really talented. I really believe in Silvia Brown, but most are sometimes hard to believe. <br /> <br /> I really wanted to enjoy this show, but among the few that I saw, I'm still terribly impressed.
