With his turn in THE 'TOOLBOX MURDERS' (super classic) 'ultra shabby' (1978), this is considered to be Cameron Mitchell's worst horror effort. It's a bit too slow for my taste, there's no nice character and little action to the end, but Mitchell's dedicated psycho performance as a vengeance-job whack-job, Vincent Rinard, is fun. It's not Anthony Perkins though, but it's pretty fun. As a parody of Hollywood's shallow vanity, it does not matter; as a horror movie, it's just right. And even if it is only a simple image of vintage exploitation, it does not matter. I am a big fan of the free and useless dance sequence, so I was also grateful for the appearance of the Gazzarri dancers, who just came to rule. Five of them do a frenetic, deafening and slippery go-go dance routine on the ground for "Do not Cry, Seek the Rainbow" of the T-Bones. Watching these ladies bounce with huge smiles in their fringed bikini top set and parachute pants is a compelling reason why I give it a slightly higher score than usual. <br /> <br /> Old man movie makeup Vincent Rinard ("The best since Lon Chaney!") is attacking people at Paragon Studios. A flashback shows how Max Black (Berry Kroeger), a jealous and drunken studio executive, threw wine on Vinnie's face as he was about to smoke a cigarette. He is devastated by the flames and dives into a pool, but not before hiding on one side of his face and losing an eye (not to mention his sanity). Now employed by the "famous" Movieland Wax Museum in Buena Park, California, Vincent uses a special serum (described as a mixture of truth serum, neurotoxic drug and special "vitamins and minerals" ... Pay attention to Centrum !) To paralyze the victims. They disappear and the dense detectives on the case (led by Scott Brady) act perplexed when new "statues" are exhibited in the museum. Vince says to himself ("I'm a terribly nice man!"), Channel smokes, mumbles, whistles and describes how he is "excited" by the sound of a woman's scream. <br /> <br /> faces a group of scumbags stabbed in the back and self-absorbed witches, most of whom will deserve what is intended for them. There is also Nick (Hollis Morrison), a muscular and incompetent tour guide who sees a "statue" blinking but not going to see the cops. Aside from Max (a real Grade-A idiot ... who does not even die!) And the stupid cops, the other two main roles are women and both are rather atrocious. Marie Morgan (Anne Helm) is not your typical innocent heroine; this tramp was engaged with no less than five different characters in this movie (!), including Vince, Max and two of the missing wax models / male stars (I guess she never had time to try her chance with the missing girl). For some reason, she begs and begs her irritating baby voice that Vince gives him a "replica" of the head he draws from the last missing actor (and fianc√© number 5), Tony Deen (Phillip Baird). She does not know that Vince has already planted a syringe on the back of his neck, but I love it when Mitchell calmly accepts his demands "so that you can completely get out of reality". He also wants her to "pose" for him, which means that she is finally held in a box. Unfortunately, the box has a hole in which the head passes. We must therefore continue to be assailed by shrill cries. <br /> <br /> The other "woman" is Theresa (Victoria Carroll), one of the aforementioned go-go girls. She was seen for the first time trying to prove she was out of rhythm by hopping on stage in a lime green bikini. Theresa is tolerable before speaking, but when you realize that her scathing presence combines the abrasiveness of Lorraine Bracco with the aerial mentality of the Landers sisters, you would like Vincent to inject the serum as soon as possible. Unfortunately, we are first exposed to a scene where she makes endless requests to the head of the studio and runs into the museum trying to avoid Mitchell. She and the rest of the characters are completely unfriendly, but they work as a way to make fun of the Hollywood system in general, I suppose. And I probably give this film more credit than it really deserves. The benefits are rare, but include (aside from Mitchell and the dance routine), a slightly stylized colored lighting and a bizarre ending that seems to suggest that Rinard will be severely punished for his crimes by spending the rest of his life in his personal hell. .. Married to Mary! ... Oh yes, it's scary. <br /> <br /> Director John "Bud" Cardos (also production manager) is also part of the police sergeant. James Forrest as director, Virgil Frye as a statue, Rini Martin and Kent Osborne as bartender. Many people who have worked on this one (including executive producer and screenwriter Rex Carlton) have also worked on the movie Al Adamson, BLOOD OF DRACULA'S CASTLE and other atrocities. <br /> <br /> My score: 4 out of 10
