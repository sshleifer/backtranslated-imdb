I am not left to find "a redeeming social value". Whatever book or movie people want to delete, from Huck Finn / Heart of Darkness to, I do not know, Deep Throat or the last beheading of hostages, I sincerely hope they would not do it. I am not a lover of porn or violence as entertainment, but whatever their chances, I tend to see the angles of view, the cuts, the panoramas, the lights, the rhythms, almost safe fear or titillation, sometimes even missing the intention of filmmakers or actors. Even from images that reasonable people could support should never exist, I imagine there is something to learn. I wonder more about how a movie does than what it does. Maybe that's wrong with me. Wiser but more difficult than deconstructing an unpleasant cinema, could be to see cups, pans, etc., at the same time as and inseparable from any content. I wonder what horror filmmakers and church architects have in common. Add to this political filmmakers, fascist and not. All manipulate with light, space and sound to change perception and mood. How are their goals different? What is the difference between the goals of those who film real atrocities and make propaganda? <br /> <br /> When the original All Night Long trilogy (ANL) appeared on my shelf, I left it unattended for almost a year. Curiosity had made me buy it. I sampled a few minutes of "1" on the day of her arrival, until the attack around the corner by a clumsy sound that seems to be an attack on the sensitivity of the spectators, found it ineffective, but effective . I should come back to it, certainly, but I did not like the prospect. Clearly, it was not the sublime horror of Kairo, Cure, Angel Dust, Lain, the more raw but still traditionally framed horror of the first Evil Dead Trap, Koji Wakamatsu's openly political book, or even the crudest crudity from the beginning of Cronenberg. <br /> Maybe the word "attack" is the key. Matsumura does not attack his characters, but his viewers. I can not look at them at this point in history without thinking both of Abu Garib (some of whom, I think, was highlighted on video) and the videos taken hostage, but also the torturers of Godard (in The Little Soldier?) For whom the atrocity is just a job, a fraction of a person's work day. And then there's the extended reportage in northern California that I can not really remember, but I can not completely forget, because it's also about "cinema", a notorious serial killer duo, if suggestion does not play with my memory, for being filmed victims of torture. <br /> <br /> The three entries of the ANL are a cinema of revenge, exercises of self-defense, but I join these notes to ANL3 because it is the most ambitious and can constitute a turning point for the director Matsumura . (I did not see the entries that followed ANL3.) In the first two offerings, I imagined a camera that had fallen into the hands of one of those marginalized middle or high school children who were obsessively scenes of war or other atrocities. (Or as if one of Matsumura's revenge characters had become a screenwriter-director, anyone who would watch them without seeing Michael Powell's Peeping Tom would do well to see him.) But ANL3 seems to aspire to the mainstream. The protagonist of Matsumura cultivates carnivorous plants, which allows him to take close-up, typically Japanese, nature photos. There is also, for the first time, a film of Matsumura, a traditionally erotic sequence: the boss of Kikuo sneaks and begins to caress him while watching the hotel guests. Kikou is unfortunately sandwiched between. It's an intermediate voyeur. The brief emotion comes from layers of voyeurism. There is even a philosophical / poetic garbage sieve, a garbage voyeur that reminds me of the poem that is repeated in Wakamatsu does not look like it sounds like Go, Go, Secondtime Virgin. <br /> <br /> I do not succeed and it prevents me from commenting on other films. I can not escape the suspicion that, a few years later, I will be taking part in a Matsumura Retrospective in my local film archive, perhaps animated by a scholarly character who has caught something I miss. <br /> <br /> How important is the director to be or simply "reclaim" his mortally confused protagonists? Must he even understand them? Perhaps the job of a director is simply to say it, and then let the critics, the sociologists and the rest of us unravel things. Perhaps the artistic or directorial responsibility is a fictional notion. <br /> <br /> My last fight with this thing made me wonder what a woman who thinks to watch these extremely masculine exercises. We have put women to this problem again and again, from Star Wars to et cetera, et cetera, and so on, but again and again, is there anything as masculine as All Night? long?
