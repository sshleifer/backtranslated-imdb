Many times, the description "full of sound and fury meaning nothing" is used and goes straight to the point. Unfortunately, "Code 46" lacks both sound and fury. A little fury would have been greatly appreciated. The character of Tim Robbins (William) lacks so much passion that the idea of ​​instantly falling in love with Maria (Samantha Morton) seems almost absurd. These people are so passionate that we begin to wonder if the water supply of this future world may have been dosed to thorazine. There is an atmosphere of the genre "Brave New World" in the film that is helped by each scene filmed about 2-3 overexposed stops. Unfortunately, this technique becomes tedious and rather painful for the eyes. The mishmash of languages ​​becomes more and more tedious when there seems to be no apparent reason for its existence. Many futuristic scifi movies are criticized for their flashiness and lack of substance. This film has neither flash nor substance. It's a code 6 all the way.
