OK, about 11 years ago, the awesome and funny movie "The Mask" came out and everyone loved it. Now, 11 years later, the mask is brought back in this awesome movie, is not it? FALSE!!!!!!!!!! This movie was the most stupid movie I have ever seen !! I mean, when I rented it, I thought I was laughing so much that I would almost piss off my pants as in the first one. but after seeing this "sequential", I also let out a small laugh of barley. I mean no offense to the director or the distribution of this film, but what a waste of time and money. So, the plot of the whole story was about this little baby who has some of the mask in him and that evil person is after him for something, because that's all I really got, I would have added a few things to it so it would be higher than 2 stars out of 10.
