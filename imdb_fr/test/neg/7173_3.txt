You must be a fan of the little man, but I found Burlesque in Carmen dull, unimaginative and absolutely not funny. <br /> <br /> Chaplin tells the story of Carmen and plays himself an important role as Don Jose. It's a story of men and women they like that we do not really know why we would like a woman like Carmen, because she plays men against each other. <br /> <br /> As I said, I did not think much of that. Chaplin has made dozens and dozens of better quality movies so you can leave it on the shelf. <br /> <br /> Oh, and I'm curious to know what's the difference between this movie and the 1915 version ... or is it just an IMDB mistake? <br /> <br /> In total: 3/10.
