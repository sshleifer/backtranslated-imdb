I will not spoil your surprise by mentioning one of the ugly lines of the plot, I will simply say that this film suffers from a bad animation, to play too much, obvious slogans? These are some of his qualities. if you are abandoned on an isolated island and the only connection with the civilization you have is that movie throws it to the fish. I can not tell you how sorry I am to have seen this horrible and horrible film. Speaking of which, this film supposed to be a horror film can not be classified as such for the simple fact that the only horror in the film is the ability of certain actors to play. <br /> <br /> Be careful.
