Because it came from HBO and based on the IMDb rating, I watched the first season of this series, what a mess. The characters are sometimes interesting but mostly like cartoons. The game of actors goes from good to poor talent with an emphasis on the latter. Not only the prisoners, but also the viewers should leave all hope at the door of the cell that this story is credible, it is such a load of dung that you will need exceptionally strong testicular courage to keep watching. Violence, as with most developments in history, is moving and whatever the supposed morality supposed to be served, it is rather light. If your idea of ​​an excellent TV includes the quality of writing, role playing and production seen in THE SOPRANOS, DEADWOOD or SIX FEET UNDER, avoid OZ. If you want to see a Disneyland for illiterate, look at OZ. Things like this give Edgy a bad name.
