I can just imagine how this film was born: <br /> <br /> "So how can we ruin our career?" <br /> <br /> "I know, let's take a hugely successful movie and make a sequel! <br /> <br />" Perfect! We will have B-rated players who have half the charisma and want only 10% of Carrey's initial salary. We will save millions of dollars and make huge profits, not to mention the fact that no one wants to see a second-rate sequel without any of the original actors who made it popular in the first place! As leaders, we always honestly believe that a movie was popular by name and story, not the actors who did it first! "<br /> <br />" Brilliant! Let's put in a huge budget and get the cheapest actors we can find! "<br /> <br /> And really, that's what we could describe Son of the Mask, just a simple category B movie that tries to suck life out of its original classic. > <br /> Nevertheless, if the film did not contain the words mask or anything of the mask, it would be a beautiful film for children.It is a funny film that really wants to shout "like me! ", but only 8 and under will really enjoy it. <br /> <br /> Jamie Kennedy is the only one It clearly deserves to be mentioned in this movie.It clearly tries to make the material work by playing the role of the desperate father, but the scenario is so poor that the only thing that is worth being expressed is my glass after seeing this.The character of Loki also deserves a note It is worth mentioning that it was the most pleasant character and one of the only reasons why older people could see this movie.If this movie is lost, I would have really liked to have the character put on the real mask. Instead, we are reduced to pet jokes and toilet humor towards the end. <br /> <br /> The plot is so much in the books that I will not bother to mention it here. It's quite obvious that even a Disney executive would be green with envy. <br /> <br /> Save your money, this one will go to the DVD in three months. Shame on the studios for once again smearing a quality movie with a horrible sequel. Did Dumb and Dumberer teach them anything?
