"The Patriot" with Steven Segal is a thriller / action movie of the late '90s that is not really a thriller or action movie; It's Steven Segal who plays Steven Segal under another name, but this time he's a Native American country doctor who is getting hurt now. Highlighting the obvious plot line holes, the film itself is absolutely amazing in terms of blatant disregard for character devolution. <br /> <br /> From a marketing point of view, I wondered "who was he talking to in the world?" The bio-thriller plot is far from the average American audience and Segal as a silk cowboy would never be sold to anyone, even if you fried it deep and put it in between a cream donut kripsy. The whole movie is out of the ordinary, even for Segal fans, because it's just not up to par.
