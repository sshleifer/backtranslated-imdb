I went to see "Quit" with a lot of hope, because "Director's Shower" impressed me so much. Despite some failures in mawkishness, "Shower" is at the top of my list of favorite movies of all time for her insight into family relationships and her generally superb action and direction. And I saw him at least three times now. <br /> <br /> But "quit smoking" has fallen flat, in my opinion. It seemed like a useless exercise and I quickly got tired of the unbearable personality of the main character and I wanted the film to end. I admit I fell asleep six or seven times, but it was only a few seconds at a time, so I think it's still OK to write this comment. <br /> <br /> I admired the parents and the sister. The device that involves using all the real characters in the movie is a good way that I have never seen used before. <br /> <br /> Disappointment aside, I will still make an effort to see any movie with the name of Yang Zhang, simply the basis of the beautiful "shower".
