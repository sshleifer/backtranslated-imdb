Most of the comments on this film are positive, so I thought I'd try to turn the bar around. I came out of this movie wondering what was going on. I know now and still consider it a bad movie. I initially ignored a sequence of dreams because it seemed too obvious. I was happy to get a free ticket for the movie or I would have asked to get my money back. Movie critics and critics love this film, which confirms to me that most of them would rather sound smart than see how an audience can enjoy a movie. The 8+ rating of this movie is so misleading. In 20 years, this film will not be comparable to big names such as The Godfather. The film has great performances on both sides but that is not enough to save the film. (nor the lesbian scenes!)
