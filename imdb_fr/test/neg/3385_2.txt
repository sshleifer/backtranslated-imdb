Wow, where do I start? After suffering from this miserable rental of $ 1.00 (thank you very much, Family Video), I had only a few comments to make. I did not bother to write the names of the 3 actors of the film, but I hope you will know who I am talking about. <br /> <br /> A monster truck is terrorizing the countryside and chasing two college buddies their fate. They meet a hot girl dressed in slutty clothes. I mean, it looks fantastic in theory. I laughed hysterically from the DVD box as I walked towards the girl behind the video shop counter. <br /> <br /> Acting: The sexy girl, played by Aimee Whatever, laughs visibly through many scenes where she is supposed to be scared. The other two main actors of the movie, the big joker and the vanilla straight guy are terrible. The fat guy thinks he's Jack Black. He is not. The other actor, our hero, emotes too much and misses all his landmarks and appears as a generic character that you could see in a film specially designed for Nickelodeon on skateboarding in the early 90s. Look: I do not expect to great performances in movies like these, but at least actors can make an effort not to be boring. You can be an incompetent actor while being nice (John Wayne, for example). At least this Aimee gal is attractive. <br /> <br /> Scenario: Good Lord, who found this dialogue funny? I would not have the courage to play it in front of my theater class, let alone present it as a screenplay. Insensibly bad. More information about this later. <br /> <br /> Production: OK, this is the only place where the movie succeeds. The quality of production is incredibly high. The look of the film is very good. Apparently, the only talented person who worked on the film was the director of photography. <br /> <br /> OK, here are my biggest complaints: 1) The guy driving the car never drives more than 25 miles an hour. <BR /> <br /> 2) The guy driving the car is out in the country before realizing that there is a big masked man in his back seat. He is supposedly meticulous about recording gas mileage and keeping his old car in good shape, but he does not notice a 300-pound Jack Black imitator in the back? Go. <br /> <br /> 4) The characters never change clothes. There are two hotel scenes. It is likely that our characters have access to a shower, but during the three days of filming this film, none of the characters have bothered to change clothes. <br /> <br /> 5) Comedy. A happy and joyful comedy does not mix with horror. Period. You can not let our characters escape a monster truck for a second and the next second, have them run verbal jousts with some dopey light / comedy music. This kind of rhythm spoils virtually any tension in the film. Films like Evil Dead 2 mixing comedy and horror understand that tension can be relaxed without ever being completely eliminated with humor. Monster Man does not understand. <br /> <br /> I'm irritated that what could have been a VERY funny horror movie was ruined by a director who thought himself a lot smarter than he really was. Never mind.
