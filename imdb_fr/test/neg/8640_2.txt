I watched this a few months ago on Netflix Instant and left a review. <br /> <br /> Let me say that most other reviews are very specific. This film was bad writing, bad acting and bad staging. I, too, loved Russell and Paré "back in the good old days" and had good hope for them. In my review of Netflix, I mentioned that I lost interest in the movie and started washing dishes and making a sandwich while watching the movie from the kitchen. When I got back into the living room, I was very confused as the last 5 minutes of the movie unfolded. I even rewound it to make sure I did not miss anything. This movie was completely crazy about how to make a late "twist". I guess the idea seemed good, maybe the scenario was intriguing, but the budget was so inexistent that the sets were really lacking. And yes, I guess all these "bad scenery" was an effort to give a clue to the viewer. All he told me was a "little budget". <br /> <br /> Anyway, I came here because over the weekend, I saw an article on Shutter Island and the comments of critics,, let me believe that Shutter Island is the same thing, but with a budget of 50 to 60 times more! (Actually, I have no idea of ​​the cost of Dark World, but I hope they did not spend more than a million!) So, that being said, I thought that if someone reworked the script, little, got a bigger budget for a better "look" (if it meant a better landscape designer, or better post-coloring, just someone with a vision,) they could turn Dark World into a passable product . It seems now that Shutter Island is doing it. It looks like they have understood the vision, but the script could still be disabled. Money can not buy everything, but it should in Hollywood! <br /> <br /> PS: my two stars are awarded to Russell and Pare.
