This show does not make sense. Each week, two ladies go to a field to do gardening and every week, without fail, fall on a murder. Because everyone who owns a big house with a big garden is involved in murder, right? But even if they came across a murder after a murder, would it be best to tell the police? You know, the people who can actually do something ... But every week these two fools come and go, polluting the evidence, committing their own crimes and, in some cases, causing more murders. Once the murder is solved miraculously, the murderer could never be convicted. All the evidence has been sabotaged. And you would think that those who conceal murders would not think of hiring these two people, would they? Yay! We solved the murder! Now, like every week, let's face the murderer ourselves and, without reservation, let's say we know about it. There is no way to put ourselves in danger, is it? Rosemary and Thyme is one of the worst TV shows and certainly the most ridiculous.
