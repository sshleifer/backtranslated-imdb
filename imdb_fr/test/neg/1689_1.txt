I hate, despise and hate this movie with a passion that gives the red doors of hell a cold appearance in comparison. it's nothing but a frightening and frightening trip into the memory of that unpleasant era, the 70s, a decade I'm glad I did not participate in this dish if all that was offered was really great! <br /> <br /> The animation is dated in a disgusting way, especially with its sticky and missing images and its gigantic heads characters, this film is painful for the eyes. of knowledge, snide nodding at parents with the strangely gay hippocampus, and his hand-camp moves and the voice of kenneth williams-esque, to the openly, slightly suave hymn, High Cockalorum, this movie, I I am sad to say, is the one who was forced on me as a child and I never fully recovered from the terror it caused me ... <br /> <br /> This frightful spectacle of terror total should bear a certificate noted R, so disturbing that it is Content!
