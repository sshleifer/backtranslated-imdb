I am shocked by all the good reviews on the cover of this movie and on IMDb. It belongs to the $ 2 bin at your local video store. To say that this is a B-movie is extremely generous. <br /> <br /> Besides the fact that it lacks only one character, it is slightly above average, and an image quality ugly 80s, the scenario of this film is dull and without life. This film is not only boring, it is pathetic. (Of course, there is sometimes some moderately interesting chemistry between the two main characters.) Even the last plot twists - rather the only plot bounce - does not record this movie. <br /> <br /> Rent "Diamond Men" If you must, but feel free to turn it off once you realize its value. 2 out of 10
