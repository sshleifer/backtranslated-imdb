I found myself getting more and more angry as the movie progressed. <br /> <br /> For the most part, Dr. Crawford (Dennis Hopper) predicted that a meteor would hit the earth. The "powers in place" do not believe it, so he undertakes the construction of a mountain survival refuge for a small collection of people. <br /> <br /> Jake Lowe (Peter Onorati) is an unlucky journalist. for a trash tabloid that gets advice from a friend he thought was dead, that something is happening in the mountains. He starts an investigation. <br /> <br /> While trying to break into the Secret Survival Hideaway, Jake spends a lot of time killing people or beating them within a centimeter of their lives. He spends the rest of his time getting excited by Dr. Crawford as to who gave the doctor the right to decide which people should have the chance to survive the meteor. <br /> <br /> I thought I was hoping Jake would do a big favor for the future and turn a gun around. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time with this turkey.
