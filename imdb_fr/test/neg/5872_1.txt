First of all, this film is nauseating and my advice is to avoid it at all costs if you want to eat ice cream again. I tried to look at it because it sounded funny, but it quickly became quite disturbing with the ice made from body parts and amazingly graphic effects. It starts with a boy named Greg who witnesses the macabre murder of an ice cream merchant (Greg becomes crazy then becomes the main character) by what seem to be murderers of the mafia. There is no explanation for this murder, making it the greatest WTF moment of any movie. Other less important moments of the WTF include the Surrealist Haven addressed to Greg (with evil clowns), a woman speaking in tongues because she is possessed by the Holy Spirit (this has to do with with all that I do not know), and the fact that Olivia "His career was so badly fucked" Hussey is there. <br /> <br /> None of these reasons is reason enough to look at it. The only reason is for the character of Tuna, who is a skinny kid with stuffed pillows under his shirt, so he looks like a fat kid. For some reason, it seemed hilarious. I stayed awake much longer in the night than I should have watched this movie just to understand if there was a reason they could not use a real kid for the role. Although I fell asleep before the end, other critics tell me that Tuna ends up losing "weight". Okay, so they did not have the budget to do it realistically. Suggestion to the director: how about making the character ... not overweight? <br /> <br /> That's all; if Tuna's perspective has not interested you enough, there is no other reason to acknowledge the existence of this film. If disgusting horror movies about ice cream are your favorite entertainment source, take a look at "The Stuff", much better.
