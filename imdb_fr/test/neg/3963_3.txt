You know that the movie could have been much better when the animal - in this case, a little dog - is the best actor on the screen! The game in this movie is so bad, so amateurish, on the part of a dog, embarrassed to watch that. He ("Rusty", our Golden Retreiver) could have done a better job than locals. <br /> <br /> The story is almost banal: the boy finds an animal, his pet is neither loved nor desired by one of the parents, but "the animal" ends up saving the animal one of the children and is now a hero and an official member of the family. Sounds familiar? <br /> <br /> I remember that this film was a great success, but it never had time to see it before the mid-90s in VHS. I was shocked to see how bad it was. Why so much noise for a movie? Was it because there were so many movies in the early 70s that a good family film stood out in the crowd? Perhaps. There have not been many healthy entertainments in the decade of the 70s, and many people are fond of cute stories of small animals. Who could resist this cute little dog? Not me. But the movie I can resist is a Grade B screenplay with a horrible acting game. <br /> <br /> Recommended only for pet lovers and I mean "in love" because even the average pet owner will fall asleep trying to watch this movie from day to day.
