I can not believe that I actually put up a "season pass" on my TiVo, apparently, they had a good overview or something like that ... I can not imagine it. After watching for about 5 minutes, I said to myself .. why am I looking at this ... This is definitely not the reality, and some of the worst acting games I've ever seen on TV .. I am totally dependent on reality TV and there is nothing real about it. THE ACTION .. (if you can call it that) is awful .. The only ones that are almost 5% decent are the girls who are supposed to attract the viewers to the show .. although they would need to be a lot more nice to save that train wreck ... if they had more lines, they would probably change their minds because they probably have no talent either. This is obviously a very low-budget production with "actors" apparently very cheap. They could not in any case find a job. Someone has to refer these people to a job in the restaurant industry. Maybe they could do it. Oh and by the way, Parco P.I no longer occupies any place on my TiVo or on TiVo's season pass list. Certainly the worst show I have ever seen.
