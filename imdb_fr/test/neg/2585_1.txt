Of course, everyone has the right to have their opinion on one thing ... everything. The presentation was interesting: black and white film, year 1968, student demonstrations, general strike, youth, ideals, love, etc. Sorry but I did not feel love, romance. A lover who is good that his girlfriend sleeps with anyone? It's love ? But not only that, the movie is very long and for no reason, I had to stop watching the movie several times because I had just lost interest. I waited for something to happen but ....... NOTHING. The only thing that impressed me during the film: a gypsy violinist playing on the street, yes, that was good. I do not think that art should be complicated, encrypted, hidden in secret meanings, confusing. Big disappointment and waste of time!
