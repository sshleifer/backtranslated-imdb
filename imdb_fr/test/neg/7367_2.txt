From the second, the music grew (the second of the film) and it was film-trip, I knew that I would make a very long trip. Clich√© atrociously - (I laugh a lot and I knew how the plot ended well before the end) - they did not use Louisbourg particularly well and the costumes and hair were rather horrible. (My favorite makeup moment is that the only way to age Depardieu as far as I could see was to put on a straight hair wig instead of waving). I could go on talking about the ridiculous unfitness of music for a long time - the film could be massively improved by an 18th century score. <br /> <br /> (ETA: AH, this is the horrible movie guy, Patrick Doyle, who is responsible for the score - do not say more! The "visit to the notables" was also hilarious, especially his little visit to Madame Pompadour which was not particularly convincing. <br /> <br /> I thought the only actor who seemed rooted in the current century was Michael Maloney in the role of James Murray. stole the show during the 30 seconds he spent on the screen Tragically, he made you see what the film could have been. <br /> <br /> The love scenes have warmed up a bit - the two main roles were breathtaking. <br /> <br /> The most terrible scene for historians This is where they get ready for the big dinner in Britain before Wolfe goes to sea. He raises his glass and says the first two lines of "How does the glass go down?" Absolutely atro failure this of historicity, it is better to omit it. Thousands of people know this damn song and thousands of others believe the rumor that Wolfe and his company would have sung it (probably drunk, not stuffy like that). Idiot.
