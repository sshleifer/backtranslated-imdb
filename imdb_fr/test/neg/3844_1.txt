Obviously, the above comments about the movie were made by a member of the team. I do not remember ever seeing a more insulting film for talented actors or the public. In my 30 years of watching movies, it's the only one I've ever released. Bad mood, bad jokes, bad gags, bad editing, bad plot, etc. <br /> <br /> Note to Producer: It's never funny to hunt humans based on race. It's good that you tried to be politically correct by incorporating all the races, but you still chase humans on the basis of race, and that's disgusting.
