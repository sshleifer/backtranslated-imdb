The beginning was decent; the end was going well. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this film suffers from the total superficiality of the characters, unrealistic confrontations / fight scenes, lack of intelligence outside the shuttle. This is a terrible average scenario. <br /> <br /> What to look for: foreshadowing too obvious, fast healing cuts, smoky fires, fun seat belts, delayed reactions. <br /> <br /> I gave him a 4, not a 0, because the beginning of the film included beautiful elements of happiness and basic development of the characters. The relationship between the dark-haired girl and her fiancee is briefly discussed, and the impact of the blonde girlfriend on the impact of this relationship is present, although clumsily. The company discovered at the end becomes more and more commonplace and decent, but, as another contributor pointed out, this is not a surprise. <br /> <br /> ~ viper ~
