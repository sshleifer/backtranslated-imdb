I was so disappointed by this movie. I know the case very well, having read not only Mark Fuhrman's book, but also the very superior "A Wealth of Evil: The True Story of Martha Moxley's Murder in America's Richest Community" by Timothy Dumas. Anyone who looks at MURDER IN GREENWICH should know that she is looking at the story of Mark Fuhrman, not Martha Moxley's. This film is nothing more than an ego trip for Fuhrman. Just look at his character strutting as if he was the second coming (yes, even if it was stung by women). The actors who play the children look way too old for their roles and the flashbacks of the 1970s are totally unconvincing. If there's a hero in this story, it's Martha's family, her mother Dorothy, and her brother John. They kept this business alive for two decades before Fuhrman got involved to make a name for himself. They deserve, as well as Martha, that the true story be told.
