This film is about two murderers who go on tour to kill men they meet at random. <br /> <br /> Wow, "Fuck me" has become the worst movie on my list. The plot is crazy, useless and useless. The whole movie is full of violence and sex, and I'm sure no sensible parent would want to show this movie to his kids. I do not understand what people are doing when making this movie or watching this movie. Maybe someone somewhere has his perverted desires fulfilled. There is simply no excuse or reason for the existence of this perverse and depraved work. <br /> <br /> The only consolation I can give myself is that I watched it in fast forward, not to have lost so much time.
