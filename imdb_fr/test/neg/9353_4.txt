I saw this movie in 1956 and again on Cable a few days ago. The film did not improve with age. Rather the opposite. It's a real epic spaghetti. <br /> <br /> Trojans are heroic and friendly; the Greeks are mean, petty and furtive. <br /> <br /> What if Paris ran away with the king's wife? Hey ... love is love.
