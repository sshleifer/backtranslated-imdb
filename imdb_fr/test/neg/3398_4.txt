The incomparable Paul Naschy, icon of horror films in Spain, lends his talents to this entertaining film, even if it is not staged. What begins as an action movie ends with a horror story. All I can say is to sit down and enjoy the walk. <br /> <br /> Paul Naschy plays the role of a cold-blooded man hired by Japanese diamond hunters in the shade (including his flame carrying his child) to search a cache of diamonds of a Belgian businessman. When the act is over, the lure of diamonds is too tempting for Paul to ignore so that he kills his Japanese cohorts. His girlfriend, whose brother Paul killed, swears vengeance and pursues Paul through the forest, pulling him and leaving him for dead. However, Paul is found by a young woman with two exciting girls and brought to her estate to recover. <br /> <br /> On the estate, the two girls, Silvia Aguilar and Azucena Hernandez, fight for Paul weakened. Silvia Aguilar determined not to lose the sweet and primitive Azucena. But things go wrong for Mr. Naschy who begins to see the ghost of the mother who died long ago on the ground. Add to that the Japanese girl who seeks to complete the job of killing Paul and this one is pulled from two sides. <br /> <br /> HISTORY: $$ (The story goes in many ways and does not fully satisfy.) The scenario builds a fight for Paul between girls but Silvia, whose character seems assertive and unstable, simply leaves Azucena Win the Paul Naschy Contest Without Fighting Personally, I would have preferred the story of the ghostly appearance to revenge in search of the Japanese woman) <br /> <br /> VIOLENCE: $$$ (You play with a gun, a swollen girl and pigs devouring a poor live bastard.Gore dogs will not be abandoned with this Naschy movie). <br /> <br /> ACTING: $$$ (Paul Naschy, as usual, is fun to watch, but he spends a lot of time in bed recovering from his wounds. with the luscious Silvia Aguilar and the beautiful Azucena Hernandez, who teamed up with Mr. Naschy in the gem "The Craving" (both girls are doing a great job). <br /> <br /> NUDITY: $$$ (You get very brief glimpses of Aguilar and Hernandez, but they are strategically placed so that everything is covered.) Nudity is ensured by the two less attractive actresses: the Japanese woman pursuing Paul and the woman African bedroom working for Silvia and Azucena).
