I have never seen a film as unrealistic as this dirty piece of dung. The acting game was on the top. The management was sticky and amateurish. The script was just a joke. The story was written by a person who never attended a high school football match, let alone a professional match. And why, why did Oliver Stone feel the need to be in this movie as an actor? He was terrible, playing the role of the most unrealistic presenter of all time. He could not even be hired to compete in professional wrestling. Then you have Jamie Foxx, who launches like a girl. But he's a bit sportier than old Dennis Quaid. Seriously, Stone wanted to make this film with ADD, 16 years old. That's why we hear loud music, quick cuts and many changes. It just became a bad MTV video. Shame on Al Pacino for doing this shit. Cameron Diaz? Heck, this non-talent takes any role that goes down the pike. When Lawrence Taylor is the best "actor" you have, your movie is bad! And this one does it.
