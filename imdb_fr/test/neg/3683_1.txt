The gates of Hell opened up and spit out that film, then closed again. <br /> <br /> Watching this film makes me appreciate other films I've seen, like all other films. Nothing makes sense in this movie. <br /> <br /> It would be really too long to mention all the problems of intrigue. In fact, except as a warning, it's really not worth wasting some of the almost infinite space available on the Internet to write about this movie. <br /> <br /> From now on, I'll check IMDb before watching a movie. . <br /> <br /> Very hot, IMDb forces me to write more about this film. I guess I should warn you about Edison Force while I'm there. But if you had to choose between the two, choose Edison Force.
