There are so many beautiful stories between Kristen Scott-Thomas and Harrison Ford, but each time the story of their relationship began to gain ground, the script was cut and treated with an irrelevant sub-plot that did nothing to to advance the story. Indeed, the secondary intrigues had nothing to do with history. It was like a commercial break in which we watched a trailer of another movie. <br /> <br /> The writers (or someone who controlled the writers) obviously did not trust each other to write convincingly about the relationships and inner lives of their characters. They seemed uncomfortable unless they started gun battles and fights in bars. Or maybe they did not trust the public to pay attention to the story of a man and a woman trying to understand their relationship in difficult circumstances. After all, we all know how "Casablanca" was boring. <br /> <br /> Perhaps if the relationship between Kay and the Dutch had been further developed and allowed to be played, the writers might have known how to end the story. This film is a disappointment not to do more with its wonderful actors, who have done well but could have done more with a better scenario.
