A terrible deception: controversial film, winner of the Teddy in Berlin 2003, Mil nubes de paz turned out to be a fiasco. The actors recite all (well, they are not exactly actors); the film tried to be a high bet but ends up being a dubious bet: it remains in the superficiality of two guys who kiss and a guy whose lover is gone; this has no purpose: nothing to do with homosexuality presented in other films (for example, Julian Schnabel's Before Night Falls (2000)). Technically, photography is the only thing that works. otherwise, the camera is placed in strange angles (to make it more "art-movie") and the whole film takes place in a black-and-white atmosphere. The film is so pretentious that it disturbs. I mean, it's good to be pretentious when you have the talent to support it. Or maybe it's so much art cinema that it's incomprehensible. The story flows slowly, slowly, slowly. For me, more form than essence. Superb edition? It was good. Superb direction? Do not believe, the movie is weak. It was an interesting project. Too bad. It's a defect. One star in four.
