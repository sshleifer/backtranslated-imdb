This strange Texas film is about Fallon, a rich and dilettante boy of the late 1800s (although he looks like a 60s C & W singer with greasy hair and whiskers) whose wreckage of a ship on an island belonging to Count DeSade (pronounced de-sayd) with his captain. The count is afraid of pirates and tortures a girl who was once a pirate hostage and also tortures the captain. Meanwhile, Cassandra, a former scary nurse, tells Fallon the secrets of the castle. The countess has leprosy and has gone mad! Fallon is trapped but brings provisions. The captain is killed by a racist slave caricature. Fallon is thrown into the dungeon with the leper, who still thinks it's his wedding day. The leprous bride is excited, but Cassandra kills her. Fallon and Cassandra escape from the castle, but the count and his slave chase them with dogs. DeSade kills the slave and Fallon kills DeSade. Fallon and Cassandra fall in love next year, but when the mothership arrives, the crew refuses to take our lovers because they are both lepers. They live in the castle for years ... Fallon's hair turns gray and Cassandra goes crazy. Fallon puts her in the dungeon. Our story of love and leprosy ends. <br /> <br /> So strange that it is visible, you can feel the popcorn of the drive-in.
