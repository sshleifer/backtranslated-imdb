Barney is just horrible. As many other critics of this show say. I am not one to disagree with them (I will not do it). Because I hate this show as much as they do it. They use kids who look like sixth graders, cheese scheming, horrible dialogue and really nil special effects. Not to mention this big purple dinosaur itself. It makes all other children's shows look like rewards (Sesame Street has won awards, which I know). <br /> <br /> Please watch Sesame Street, Thomas the Tank Engine or even Teletubbies. Avoid both, this movie and its movie (which I also commented on). They are both extremely bad and are inappropriate for anyone (even small babies).
