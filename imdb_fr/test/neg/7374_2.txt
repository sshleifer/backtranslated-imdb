It's the worst movie I've seen in a long time. Historical precision is totally non-existent. For example, James Wolfe, portrayed as an anti-French Canadian, was introduced in London in the summer of 1759. Native Americans resemble Indians in a bad 60s Hollywood movie: they wear deerskin clothes and horses (The Montagnais never ride on horseback). The film takes place in Quebec, but the filming takes place in Louisbourg and shows the Atlantic Ocean. <br /> <br /> The initial scenario was to include the Battle of the Plains of Abraham, but producers are abandoning this idea by saying that the costs for uniforms and participants would be more than $ 4 million! I think they have never heard of the reenactment. <br /> <br /> It is expected that the entire film is a new Titanic: an impossible love during a historical tragedy (the fall of New France). There is even a song performed by Celine Dion at the end of the film (yes, I stayed until the end of the film, but I deeply regret it). But the worst thing is that this movie cost $ 30 million. I just do not know how they spend all that money. <br /> <br /> Sorry about my anger, but I'm too irritated.
