It was the most unrealistic movie I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> I can not believe that the screenwriter and the director did not see that almost all the film looked like a SF movie. <br /> <br /> For example: <br /> <br /> 1. It is impossible for the murderer to stay under a cold varnish and get up so quickly after 10 hours. <br /> <br /> 2. You can not be electrocuted by a water pipe like in the movie (believe me, this is my domain) <br /> <br /> 3. With a saw you can cut 10 pipes in 10 hours very easily. Let's say the chain was steel but the water pipe was rusty and iron. <br /> <br /> 4. If you try to cut your foot with a saw, you faint (in the best case, it is more likely that you die because your heart broke down). to reach the bone (tibia). <br /> <br /> And there are more other examples.
