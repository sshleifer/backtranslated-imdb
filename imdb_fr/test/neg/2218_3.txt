"In the heart of the Earth" was on television yesterday. I was in front of my computer working and I happened to take a look and see what had to be one of the worst action sequences ever made. I was immediately fascinated by the film's mediocre production values, its appalling play (including by everyone - even Peter Cushing) and its horrific hilarious and involuntarily hilarious action sequences and its puppet monsters. <br /> <br /> The film is about a Victorian scientist taking a stereotypical Buff American hero on a boring trip into the Welsh countryside. They hardly know that a great evil hovers in the center of the Earth's core .... <br /> <br /> Forget the fact that the title does not make sense. (If they were really in the heart of the Earth, they would be at about 2700 kg / m3 underground and would burn alive in an iron sea or anything there.) Forget the puppets used in competing production. " The Beast Master "to be the most wrong of all time. No, the true genius of "At the Heart of the Earth" is its naive stupidity - a gung-ho action show with no real action and no real show. It's basically a gung-ho movie and a stupid one to that. People who like MST3K-style things will love it - it's horribly bad, and so terrible that it's almost pleasant in a strange way.
