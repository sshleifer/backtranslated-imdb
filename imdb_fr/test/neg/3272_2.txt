This film has one of the worst main characters of all time. I say that because he is made to be the hero when, in my opinion, everything he does in the whole film ruins people's lives and causes problems. He can not do anything good, but the movie makes him look like the cool guy everyone should admire. He has tantrums at all bad times, he has all the wrong positions on things that end up making people angry at him and killing them and has no common sense. <br /> <br /> This is a private investigator hired by a renowned painter to find the woman and son he left many years ago. The detective finds the woman and what he thinks is his son. However, all sorts of things happen to make this story full of crime, drama and twists. It's made for television, what are you waiting for? <br /> <br /> Anyway, the movie is pretty funny. Johnny Depp is very young in this one and has a terrible haircut of the 80s. He chews gum and throws a football for about 5 minutes. That's all we see of him. <br /> <br /> For some reason, the exhausted VHS version of this product sells for $ 40 online auction. . It must be for Johnny Depp collectors only. It could not be because of the plot. It could not be. <br /> <br />
