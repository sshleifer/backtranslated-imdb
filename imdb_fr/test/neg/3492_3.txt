Given the incredible reviews of this film, I was expecting something really exceptional. It certainly starts well with a witty and witty dialogue, and a beautiful cast in place. A series of interwoven Robert Altman stories draws on fascinating scenes. I found the entertainment captivating until the second half of the film, but this one collapses sadly like a card game. A series of ridiculous coincidences and clear messages pile up until I am deeply disappointed and wonder what it is for. Paul Haggis addressed the subject of the race in Los Angeles and that alone seems to have raised this film to a new level of interest. Since most of the Academy's voters live in Los Angeles and have experienced racism to some extent, this movie will certainly have an impact on them. This means that the Oscar for best film will go to the film about the race or the gay movie. Hope this is the last, because Brokeback Mountain is a true masterpiece that deserves to be recognized.
