Here is a movie that was so pedestrian for 90% that it did not have the right to become so difficult and frustrating in the end. Did the director decide to become an author suddenly, 80% thanks to the realization of this film? Yeesh. SPOILER ALERT Initially, that's enough for 50-year-olds gone crazy; there are vagrants, good girls, bad girls, gangs, the nice old diner and the creeping city. Things follow the planned path until about 15 minutes before the end, when the only sympathetic character is killed and the anti-hero is blamed (it would not be so unexpected if it was the film's main plot. .. but all this things start to happen and fall apart at the last reel (major curve ball) .Then things get weird, the nice old coder forms a crowd and strikes the hero to death.The mere presence of the Hero's friend drags a confession about the real killer - the damn scary city (which in any real world he would have been the prime suspect to start, even if the anti-hero had been found with his body). <br /> <br /> We end up with a somewhat weak "happy" ending, which is about as weird as the rest of the film with the events of the previous 10 minutes. <Even stranger, the insistence of this film to play to the maximum of homosexual insinuations, but to constantly present both male roles as straight. Maybe it was deliberately - maybe Bix's resistance to settling with the girl was more due to her sexuality (which in the 1950s should be kept pretty repressed and therefore not discussed or even admitted by him) that his need to be a "drifter". If the director's intention was to turn this into a sexual thread - let the vagabond drift because he feels sexually excluded; that his paternal consideration of Danny is not paternal but conjugal; that her inability to stay with Carrie is rooted in a sexual revulsion that even he does not quite understand - it could have been clearer. Instead, we get this very strange alchemy of homoeroticism and completely heterosexual behavior. <br /> <br /> These young men sleep side by side even if they can leave a place. When Danny is proposed (and once in bed with a woman), Bix turns around and takes him away. Danny pays the way to Bix (of course, there is another explanation for that, but it still sounds every time you see Danny buy Bix's lunch). They end up living together at the end. Since Hitchcock's "rope", homosexuality has not been so flagrant but denied. <br /> <br /> MST3K did the right thing. Apart from Jack Elam, there is little to recommend the film.
