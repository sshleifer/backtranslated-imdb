Yes, the movie was so boring and tasteless. after a certain point, I wanted the fang to eat these people so we could finish the movie. <br /> <br /> The plot is that three Australians go fishing in a small boat to fish, where the fishing guide attaches a gun. He says he is doing it for insurance purposes only, all fangs have been driven out of this river. He is immediately eaten by a Fang. The trio is then chased against a tree and is caught by the reptile in its attempt to escape. They spend most of the film discussing the best way to escape. <br /> <br /> As expected, the survivor finds the guide's gun and shoots the crocodile. Aww, they killed the only nice character of the movie! <br /> <br /> Where is Paul Hogan or Steve Irwin when you really need it?
