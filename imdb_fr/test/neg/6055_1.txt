Paul Telfer, who plays Hercules in this TV movie, must be the hottest thing on both legs of all time. Wow. <br /> <br /> But this film is a 100% distortion of the Hercules story. Like "Troy", this film has nothing to do with the original story. Zero. What makes it particularly insulting is that they actually invented a gay character so that people could hate him, making him as vile and perverse as any character in the history of television or cinema. . This is a triple insult since Hercules may have had a wife, since it was the expectation of those old days, but he also had at least a dozen lovers. So it's ironic to create a royal character for gay opponent in this movie. No, not ironic. Wrong. The creators of this parody should have their heads down.
