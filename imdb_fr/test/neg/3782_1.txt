It's a very bad movie. However, I read that this was done by a high school teacher, so I should perhaps give him at least a glowing eulogy for his ambitious (but terrible) special effects. Here's the plot: a monster emerges from a pile of garbage and pollution in the city of Milpitas, California, and embarks on a destructive rampage. I'm about to ruin the "big surprise" about the monster's appearance, read the rest at your own risk. You were warned! The monster looks like a giant two-legged fly wearing a gas mask. In some scenes, the monster is an actor dressed in a costume. In other scenes, the monster is created by frame-by-frame animation. The acting is terrible. The dialogue is terrible. The special effects are terrible. The plot is predictable. Stay away!
