In the mid-1970s, my NYC apt. The building was finally wired for cable TV and as Showtime (instead of HBO) was the only premium channel offered for recent movie screenings, I signed up. As a writer and night owl by nature, I soon discovered that the channel was broadcasting late in the night and until the early hours I had never heard of it - most of them being independent American and foreign films. had an American theatrical release. Many of them had recognizable "star actors" and respectable directors, and thanks to Showtime, I discovered many top-notch movies that I (and other Showtime subscribers) would never have had. opportunity to see. Most of these half-breeds were actually "dogs", but often so bad that they were unintentionally hilarious. One night, Showtime unveiled a gem of Italian manufacture called "Redneck" (filmed in 1972 and released in Europe in 1973). Although the film was never released in the United States, the rating of the MPAA was indicated as an "R". As the director was a certain Sylvio Narizzano (the director who made a name for himself with the glorious "Georgy Girl") and that the three main roles were Mark ("Oliver") Lester, Fabio Testi and Telly Savalas, I decided to try it. And I found myself nailed to my disbelieving television screen for 89 minutes. If I remember correctly, Savalas and Testi played the role of two criminals, an old raging maniac who, in a shocking scene, carelessly sent a German family to death by pushing his caravan against a cliff, plunging into the depths of the nature. So far, so bad. So, out of nowhere, Testi (as a "nice" psychopath) and Lester (all 14 when the movie was shot) are seen, both naked, in a men's room, Testi throwing a shot Stealthy eye on the child's body while shaving, and poor confused, Lester concentrated on close-ups of Testi's bare buttocks. As a non-jaded member of the film industry and a liberal card-maker (I was as opposed to censorship as it is today), the whole movie made me sick (and, at the beginning of 70s, when I thought I had seen everything in the movies of the liberated era, including the full version of the movie "That Cold Day in the Park" by Altman, a real headache until it was adjusted to get the "R" grade and would have been spelled in. The end of Altman's career if he had not then proposed something called "M * A * S * H"), I always wonder if someone other than me has already seen "Redneck" and was as dismayed as me. Gagging actors and spectators is a joy that disordered filmmakers have happily delivered since the beginning of time. But shyly exploiting a highly respected and talented child actor (Mr. Lester) at a time when he was starting to make the difficult deal between a child actor and an adult actor (and I'm sure his movie offerings had been reduced as a result). to a well deserving junk like "Redneck") ... M. Narizzano, you should have your head down. (Incidentally, I should soon become friends with actors who had appeared in the future, Narizzano's unrewarded efforts.They despised both of them.
