I do not know if I hate this movie as much as I saw it two weeks ago, but if you expect the events described on the box, forget it ... it would have been a good movie. The big descent described on the box is in no way comparable to the one I took while watching this film. If you've seen HBO's taxi confessions, it's the same thing, only fictional, and not even as interesting. If you really want to see something interesting about a taxi driver, check out the 20-minute short film he runs from time to time on Encore ... it's definitely worth watching. I never asked for my money for a movie until I saw this ... thing. Boring, boring, boring. It offers a unique feature, which is: it lets you decide what will happen to each passenger, letting your imagination fill the gaps. Which would be great if you really care about one of these people. Instead, I found myself screaming on the screen, crying like a child, praying for the end of the movie or my own death. The taxi driver himself (well played, recital) goes through seemingly random emotions, ranging from sarcastic to friendly, from mad to apathetic. Sometimes, that's fine, most of the time it's just a display for one's own interest. "Damn, I learned all these emotions in comedy, and I'm going to use them!" Now that I think about it again, I hate this movie as much as I did!
