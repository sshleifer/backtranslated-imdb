Barely an hour ago I finished looking at this, my friend. As Dragonball fans, we think this movie is so bad it's good. We will say one thing: without six beers, there is now a way to survive in this movie. This film should be watched with many Dragonball fans for fun. The best character of the film is the Lord Horn, his makeup, his laugh and his behavior create an unforgettable experience. What we liked in this film is that the Turtle Man Island was identical to that of the comic version. We think that the only character similar to that of the caricature is the Turtle Man. He is also a sex maniac and a kind of idiot.
