Reeves plays Haji Murad, a hero from Russia in the 1850s. <br /> <br /> This is a badly dubbed film, June Foray playing some of his voices. Unfortunately, anyone who was supposed to synchronize the voices on the lips was blind, because the words never correspond to the lips. All those who say that Japanese movies are bad have never watched this movie. <br /> <br /> The plot of the film is instantly forgotten and that's what I forgot when it took the film to end and I sit down. Maybe it has more to do with the fact that the movie is one of the many movies Reeves has made in the hope of moving from action to more intrigue-oriented movies. It may have been a good thing for Reeves, but it's deadly for the public to sneak into parties like this, where it's all-court intrigue with very little action. <br /> <br /> In defense of Reeves, he was a good actor, he was not really lucky in choosing movies that were good. They all looked great, but very few of them did not put those who watched them in a coma for the duration of the movie. <br /> <br /> This movie will put you in a coma. Look at it only if you need sleep and all the other milder ways have failed.
