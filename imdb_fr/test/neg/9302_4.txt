As the title suggests, there is a philosophical and meritocratic thread in this film: if a man has the talent and seeks to make his way in society and money, what could be the result if he is refused for not having the X factor? This adaptation is treated unsatisfactorily in this adaptation of Patricia Highsmith's book and left me rather cold on the way. <br /> <br /> Matt Damon is the Ripley of the title and failed to make his way to Europe. falls in love with his commissioned target, Dickie Greenleaf (Law). Homoeroticism and social insecurity become entangled in a violent conflagration that degenerates and becomes complicated for the rest of the film. Law, Damon and Paltrow, who are terribly nice as Dickie's girlfriend, are doing well. I liked Philip Seymour Hoffman's Freddie Miles cameo, the friend of the bluff company that Ripley can never be. The problem is that the story is lumpen without bow - nor redemption, by the way - which makes it quite difficult to swallow. 4/10
