Aside from the shooting scene, I felt that the film was a waste of celluloid. Robert Duvall, Kevin Costner and Annette Bening could have played these roles in their sleep. The dialogue was marginally tolerable (and there were many - no one sat quietly in this movie), the intrigue was ubiquitous, as if they could not decide how many topics to include in the story, it did not matter. there was no subtlety at all - the prefigurations hit you between the eyes and guided you through the nose through most of the story (I think they added the whole dialogue to make sure you do not miss anything ), and editing really needs to be tightened (each Time spent on the actor screen was more a quantity than a quality - again, too many dialogues). <br /> <br /> The whole story took place over a few days, but everything that happened took on epic proportions, much like the daily events seemed HUGE in high school, but in the big they were really NOT SO IMPORTANT. Yes, the bad guys beat and killed Mose, they hit Button, they killed the dog - everything that would make the blood of Boss and Charley go up. But the importance was diluted by all the "deep and meaningful" conversations that dominated most of the film. These guys have been working together for 10 years and they are just talking about this? The only time there was not much dialogue was in the shooting scene - that's probably why I liked it. <br /> <br /> Finally, we give Annette Bening a hairbrush! The thin strands of hair around her face that were (I guess) to make her a bit more romantic actually made her a bit bothered. If she worked outside the house, it would have been more logical. Besides, why was she not already married? There seemed to be several "nice and kind" single men (his words) in town, aside from the marshal and his acolytes. In fact, none of the bad guys seemed to want to see her either (a common plot in other movies). Most of the time she was locked up in the house and did not really seem to have much connection with the people of the city. One wonders ...... <br /> <br /> In all, the film was too long, too talkative and too artificial for me. It looked like a star vehicle with a lot of screen time for big stars, but not enough depth of character to interest me, despite all the dialogue.
