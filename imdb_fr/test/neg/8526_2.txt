This film was trying something, but failed miserably. All attempts at suspense were inexpensive, and there were so many tired gadgets and holes in the plot that I ended up laughing and making fun of it all. At least I was entertained. <br /> <br /> The ghosts try to warn the family, so why do they attack the girl whose name I did not remember. And what was black and white at first? I know what they were trying to do, but they were far from being up to it. And where the hell did this guy (John Corbett's character) come? He just waltzed out of nowhere in a vast field. And why did he suddenly lose it again when the crows arrived? And if the crows were a manifestation of the spirits of his family, then why did they attack him if it made him try to kill the family? That does not make any sense. So many things in this film have no meaning, and the acting is not too pretty on the part of the main character. It's not terrible, just like its children's movie days. <br /> <br /> So, overall, this movie was not brilliant, but I had a good time tearing it up, and sometimes it's all that a horror movie has to make. Rent for entertainment not quality.
