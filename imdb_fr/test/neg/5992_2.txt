A pile of rubbish that only Full Moon Studios could do to a group of college students, staying free in an old hospital without anyone knowing it, while a demonic creature with two faces (barely visible the whole movie because incomprehensible lighting) passes through the walls kill each member who has a certain sheet of paper with old marks. Someone among them (it will not be too difficult to prove, but a slight twist is revealed so uninspirably and sluggishly that you make fun of) is the brain behind which the beast kills and must be revealed before killing any the world. <Br /> <br /> Disorder cheap, badly acted has a "is that it ?!" kind of weak end that will make you exasperated why you just wasting your time. Tanya Dempsey, who has not managed to find her way through a wet paper bag, assumes the hero's responsibilities as the newest member of the roommate group named Clark. Oh, and the title refers to the sound of the beast before attacking his next victim.
