I totally understand WHY this movie was made. Silence of the Lambs was an incredible movie - a macabre thriller with a superb storyline and a high jump factor .... <br /> <br /> What I do not understand is why this movie was shot ... and why Anthony Hopkins agreed to resume his role as Hannibal the Cannibal in this terrible and unsatisfactory film. <br /> <br /> It's not possible to ruin the film further than to see it, but for those who prefer to waste your money, DO NOT READ. The movie is absolutely horrible. It's so bad that Jodie Foster's transition to Julianne Moore is no longer a problem. <br /> <br /> The only way to really enjoy the movie is to set your watch and leave the theater exactly two hours after the movie starts, because until now, the thriller is quite interesting. The restart between Moore and Hopkins is comparable to Hopkins and Foster, and the performances of the other characters are pretty good. But literally at two o'clock, the film does not turn into a D-quality horror movie ... it's sick, and it's stupid and almost as if the crew ran out of filming time and put end together at the same time shooting. <br /> <br /> The initial buzz of the unsatisfactory and bizarre end of Thomas Harris's book has led director Ridley Scott to order a rewrite ... I do not know what's worse. <br /> <br /> Please - do not waste your time or money on this movie, unless you're ready to leave EXACTLY at two o'clock, as it's the only one how you will I be satisfied with the saga of Clarice Starling and Hannibal Lecter ... continuing the mystery that made the first film, and the wait for this one, so great.
