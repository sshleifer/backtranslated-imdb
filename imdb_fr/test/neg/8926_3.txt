Harlan Banks is a thief at the top of his game but, after a successful career, he decided to settle down with his wife and retire. However, he decides to take one last routine job in Las Vegas. All he has to do is drive the car and it seems simple. Unfortunately, someone tips the police and after a hectic car chase, he ends up in the slam before fleeing and getting revenge on those who betrayed him and made him get there. A typical action party follows. <br /> <br /> Steven Seagal plays himself (surprise!), wearing a trench coat and wearing his beloved Colt 1911 with his usual aikido. Colt and Aikido have always been with him, but the first time I remember him with the trench coat is in 'The Foreigner'. This is not particularly impressive, but it adds a small dent to Seagal's deadly hardship arsenal. Or, he covers the extra pounds he is packing. Look how you want. Throughout the film, his main friend is played by Treach (another new actor, a rapper in an action movie). They both discover a small plot of wicked people on both sides of the law, and give each wrongdoer his due. <br /> <br /> The main problem of the film is that it is painfully what I mean, painfully, without originality. Seagal just follows a watchmaking scenario throughout the film and even that gets duller and fainter as the movie progresses. Then, the final scene is completely ridiculous, as people who seemed to be dead to have killed themselves suddenly, for no reason, start talking. Groan inducing in every sense of the word. The only really positive thing here is the decent opening - a Las Vegas car chase with overturned police cars and generally entertaining chaos, but after this brief summary, you've already seen it all. 3/10 <br /> <br /> R-rated: constant violence and blasphemy
