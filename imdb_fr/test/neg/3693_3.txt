The plot in this movie is very thin, and there is not much to do. Val Kilmer - I do not know why he agreed to do this movie - plays a minor role as a gang leader. In short, the movie is tedious to watch. <br /> <br /> A guy, who looks like a professor of archeology / religion, is exploring an underground region of Moscow, which has some history related to the construction of railroads and Bolsheviks. revolution. A church tragedy in this story makes "spiritual" exploration and evil intent spirits haunt subterranean ruins. A friend of the teacher decides to find his friend in the subway and hires two Russian guides. The whole movie is based on this plot and contains a lot of repeated sequences of the underground, and some camera effects; a bit like those of "Day Watch", "Night Watch", etc.
