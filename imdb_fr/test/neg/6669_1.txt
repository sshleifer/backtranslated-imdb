It is unfortunate that someone so idolized by many children, as well as his parents, lower themselves by appearing in this tripe who operates reluctantly. I often wonder if in his later years, Mr. Wisdom has looked at his excuse for a movie with pride. At least Sally Geeson had the decency to retire to do something worthwhile after appearing in this low budget garbage. A cameo of some long-forgotten pop called The Pretty Things can not save the movie from its atrocity. If you want nostalgia for the '60s, invest in "Here's Our Mulberry Bush Tour," starring Barry Evans and Sally's sister, Judy.
