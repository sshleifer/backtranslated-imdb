Diane Arbus (Nicole Kidman) can be excused from the beginning of her childhood. The film itself does not deserve such latitude. The lack of character development, motivation and justification of the character's behavior makes the film very disappointing. I sat staring, waiting for some explanation of the weird actions to discover that Shainberg was giving me a glimpse into a story that must have been a joke. The fact that the few facts presented do not really correspond to the life of Diane Arbus did not help to clarify things. <br /> <br /> The faded artistic direction in Diane's "normal" life contrasted nicely with the brilliant colors of her "waking up" life with Lionel. And the hatch staircase was a nice demonstration of Diane's attempt to breathe new life into her existing family (however, I do not see how this hatch on the ceiling of her dining room could connect directly to the Lionel's apartment that was two stories away <br /> <br /> Maybe my analysis is a bit too literal in the search for a character development and an understanding of relationships going beyond a I would have liked to see at least one of Diane's pictures, and I will not wait for more.
