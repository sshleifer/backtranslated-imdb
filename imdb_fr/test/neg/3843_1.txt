In fact, I joined this site just to write about this movie. I was sitting in my living room and this movie was on one of the local channels. I did it about an hour before I had enough. Curious to see what the general public of the film thought of this film, I consulted it on this site. I was absolutely shocked to see that there was an overwhelming amount of people who thought it was great. I needed to have my say, and here it is: This film is an absolute waste. It was a chore to sit down. The "jokes" were uninspired stories of other best shows and movies, and Leguizamo's manic portrayal of this odious character should only appeal to 10-year-olds and under. In fact, it can be difficult even for this age. I am all for the blinding ridicule, but there is not even the slightest hint of wit or intelligence. I have an idea, take bad, uninspired jokes and play them twice as fast. Now it's funny. Ha. Ha. <br /> <br /> Movies that you should see and that take stupid humor and add comical timing and originality: A night at the opera of the Marx brothers, The meaning of life of Monty Python, South Park: Bigger, longer, and Uncut, ... and the list goes on. Do not waste an hour and a half of your life with immeasurable shit. <br /> <br /> By the way, I can only assume that the reason David Bar Katz (the other writer) did VERY little at the movies after this movie is because he was instantly blacklisted. In fact, I am impressed by the fact that Leguizamo was able to recover after this mess.
