Terrific actor play, terrible scenario, totally unrealistic. Anyway, The Bumblebee Flies illustrates the clich√©s and sentimentalism that movie studios love to delight audiences. Elijah Wood is incredibly bad in the lead role, and the plot points are artificial and sappy. The relationship between Cook and Wood is at best laughable. But the worst thing about Bumblebee is the script. This is one of the most distressing dialogues I have ever had the misfortune to hear. Bumblebees creeping into my ears and poking my eardrums would be better to hear Elijah Wood spitting his pseudo-deep lines in a robotic way. I wish that a "Bumblebee Project" be executed on me, so that I can happily not have memories of this whore.
