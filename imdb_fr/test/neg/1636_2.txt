There are many critics who describe this film as the worst ever. Of course, there are many mistakes: dull play, rather boring, clich√© and sometimes paradoxical, and the sound and special effects of the B-movie. As noted above, there are many intrigues that make _Cave Dwellers_ a fantastic movie cloth, especially when compared to the Lord of the Rings trilogy. However, this movie is not the worst movie of all time. Most, if not all (including this review) of these reviews are written by MSTK3 fans. As a result, many of these critics are sort of summaries of _Cave Dwellers_ episode MSTK3. <br /> <br /> In this episode, Joel, Tom Servo and Crow point out to mad scientists that this is the worst film ever sent to them. Of course, the loyal fans were inspired by this quote. I found this film endearing - not in a way that finds _Forrest Gump_ endearing - but in the effort put into this film by some actors. In addition, this movie is laughable without its MSTK3 treatment. This is because _Cave Dwellers_ does not take itself seriously and does not try to import into its viewers a kind of right theme. For all the monster puppets, the medieval hang-gliding and the gaps of continuity, this film does not pretend to be more than it is, a superficial representation of a rather superficial kind. <br /> <br /> Similarly, I can not bring myself to hate Miles O'Keeffe or Lisa Foster. Instead, this hatred is for Francis Coleman, Tony Cardoza, Jennifer Lopez, Arch Hall, Jr. and so on. <br /> <br />
