For years, I'm a big fan of Park's work and "Old Boy" is one of my favorites of all time. <br /> <br /> With much hope, I rented this movie and I went looking for the worst film I watched for a while. This is not a good horror movie; there is no suspense and even the "light" part is so lame that I did not know whether to laugh or cry. <br /> <br /> I introduced my youngest brother to Chan-Wook Park and what a disappointment. he has that. For me, an idol has fallen. <br /> <br /> If you like movies like "Old Boy", Mr. & Lady "Vengeance" or even his shorts on "The Three Extremes", do not waste your time, the film is not worth it the trouble.
