Cyber ​​Zone, as this DVD was sold to Oz, is one of the worst B Bazaar I have ever seen. In addition to the impassive act of Singer, stating that he knew how bad the film was going to be, the other actors influence the actual attempts to convey lines (Swanson and Quarry) or absurd imitations of classic movie scenes. . Mathius Hues is the most poignant portrait of the world since the death of Jim Carrey's Mask. All this without any common thread suggesting an attempt at parody, by genre, by period or by any other vein, is simply boring. Do not even try to join the points with the plot. It's Blade Runner, finely disguised, without content, actors or sets due to a very limited budget. "You get what you pay for" is never more obvious. There are often annoying reuses of limited sets, with no special attention to costumes and special effects that would have hit the cutting room for Dr. Who in 1976. The explosion of the helicopter deserves a step back for illustrate my point. Of course, there are masochists who will cash this tripe, but if you watch this movie for a bet, make sure you get more than your pay rate. At $ 2, this DVD will make an interesting and cheap beer coaster.
