This movie was completely bland and uninspired. The basic premise of this film was basically a bunch of stereotypical blacks sitting around a barber swapping painfully naughty spreads. I did not laugh once during the whole movie. I could have sat in any hair salon in America and heard that banal joke, and maybe even have a decent haircut. I can not understand why this mess has received favorable reviews, let alone why so many people have wasted money on it. None of the characters here were funny or worthy of interest. I did not care if the rival hairdresser on the other side of the street would cause Nappy Cutz to go bankrupt. Do not waste your money on that, because that's the only way to make Hollywood stop producing that shambolic garbage. 1 * of 5
