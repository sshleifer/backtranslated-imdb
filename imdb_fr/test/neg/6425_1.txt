Bad plot, bad acting, bad direction. <br /> <br /> He had possibilities, but just did not succeed. <br /> <br /> This film looks like someone who started with an idea, googled a little info and then tried to give body an hour and a half with a lot of night shots and bad suspenseful music . <br /> <br /> Others had to stop watching because they were scared two-thirds of the way - I had to take a break only because I did not care anymore. <br /> <br /> It made me think of an episode of Days of our Lives with a little more suspense. <br /> <br /> Absolutely wrong.
