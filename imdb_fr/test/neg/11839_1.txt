OK, let's make it clear: I like movies about dinosaurs, even bad ones. So with that in mind, let's move on. "Raptor" is a really awful movie. In fact, it's not even a movie in its own right, because it's made of pieces of "Carnosaur", "Carnosaur 2" and "Primal Species - Carnosaur 3". There are some new pictures of Eric Roberts as sheriff and his buxom sidekick who seem confused, scared or anything else trying to emotionally (emotionally), but how can they react? something that had been filmed several years earlier. The producers (yes, Roger Corman, I'm talking about you!) Have even hired two people from "Carnosaur" to play songs so that their death scenes can be reused! So, this film is the cheapest of the cheapest. Look at the 3 original films, there are no Oscar winners but they have value of entertainment and entertainment but avoid "Raptor". Oh, it's also the most useless sex scene that lasts almost 10 minutes! Do you think they were trying to save time?
