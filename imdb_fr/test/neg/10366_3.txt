This film has some flaws, and most of these flaws are a lack of something happening. Perhaps the biggest film to show the rush in Fly-Over Country, "Rolling Kansas" is a movie in which nothing happens and you do not care about anyone. As life begins, it moves, then it ends. Some humor attempts are made, but everything falls flat. The occasional cameo simply reminds the viewer that he could be wasting his life by doing something other than watching this movie and the rock song he bought and used on every occasion. good movie. It's free and often on Comedy Central because nobody went to see it, nobody wants to see it, and it's slightly better than dead air. Without wanting to praise, but the rock song of the film deserves to be listened to. Too bad the movie is not worth watching.
