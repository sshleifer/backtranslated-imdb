Owen (David Krumholtz) and Chloe (Denise Richards) are a young couple living in Manhattan. Owen is a moderately successful magazine author, while Chloe is an emerging actress. Fortunately for her, Chloe plays an important role in a sitcom and temporarily moves to Hollywood. Owen misses him and reserves a flight for LaLa Land, surprise. When he arrives at his caravan, however, the "house" is shaking, while Chloe and his co-star hunky have a little romantic rendezvous. The writer and the actress are through. Wounded and mad like a hatter, Owen returns to New York. Friendly friends decide to organize it during a blind meeting with Nadine (Milla Jovovich) to get him out of his funky funk. But it's bad, because the duo mixes between oil and water, mainly because of the strong personality of each and the thickness of Owen's shoulder. Yet surprisingly, over the next few months, Nadine and Owen become friends who confide and meet. Can it turn into something more? Well, who the hell cares! This movie is so amazing that most people will take it out of the DVD player after the first ten minutes. The scenario is pathetic, dreary and, oh, stupid too. Once again, Krumholtz gives a very odious and offensive performance. Jovovich is not much better, but who could look good with the lines she has to emerge? William Baldwin, too, reaches his lowest point in career with his raw and crazy role of sex as Owen's brother. Richards is the only member of the cast that is good, but she has to step back when she comes back to it. OK, costumes and production values ​​are adequate. In addition, there is ONE SINGLE intelligent element in the fact that, from time to time, the characters will say their lines but cartoon bubbles will appear over their heads with the words of what they really think. This does not save the movie from "bomb" status. Do not be silly, dear movie and romcom lovers. Do not rent, buy or borrow this gigantic turkey. I am the stupidest person in the world today to have watched this thing until the end.
