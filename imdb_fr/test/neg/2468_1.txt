This film is awful. If you plan to see this movie ... two words DO NOT. It's bland, the scenario is really bad and the jokes are even worse. The acting is really pathetic. I can not believe this movie was done. Look rather American Pie, Going Greek or Road Trip if you want a comedy for teenagers. These are two girls traveling to Malibu for their spring break. As usual, they did not do a lot of planning and called Michelle's uncle (I think her name is Michelle) for him to stop at his Malibu home. Uncle Bennie formally forbids them to hold a party and, as you may have guessed, they do. Please, I urge you, do not see this movie.
