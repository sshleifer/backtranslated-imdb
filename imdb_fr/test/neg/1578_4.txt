After starting watching the reruns of old Columbo movies, I thought they would all get pretty much the same vote from me (6). But apparently, I am now starting to see differences in the movies. It happened in some of the previous episodes, which showed a nice realization, and it shows in this one, but in a negative way. <br /> <br /> The movie was so boring that I was sometimes busy at the top of the newspaper instead of looking (this had never happened before in a Columbo movie!), and sometimes it was so embarrassing that I had to look away. The staging seems too pretentious. The scenes with the neighbor "oh-so-mature" are a misguidance. And usually the lines and the plot are weaker than the average episode. Then the scene where they wondered if the trumpeter should be fired (accused of the wrongful murder) is a pure horror, really stupid. <br /> <br /> However, we must applaud the "prelude". In this episode, a lot of attention is paid to how the killer tries to protect his alibi and hide the evidence, etc. I really liked that. But alas, no focus on how Columbo reveals all this. And the "evidence" that ultimately leaves Columbo victorious is the most stupid of all time. <br /> <br /> Rating: is between 4 and 5
