Oh dear. This suite has a mirror, this time, which houses the evil spirit of a psychopath who murdered an entire family with a shotgun in the house of Amityville. The mirror reflected the ugly incident of the horrified family who did not have time to prepare for their unwanted guest. The mirror is given to a photographer, Keyes (Ross Partridge) by a tramp (who happens to be his whimsical father, and the man responsible for the murder of the family) and his evil soon terrorizes those who are in a loft ( .. like the Keyes painter, Suki, described by Julia Nickson-Soul) where he lives when they bend over it. Soon, Keyes had nightmares, looking through his father's eyes as he thundered the family in cold blood, fearing he would follow in his footsteps. Soon, he sees other events through his father's eyes, like that terrible day that hits his mother's head against the floor of an institution or who lives for a moment inside the cell while the doctor gives him medicine to immobilize him. <br /> <br /> Enough solid support actors who deserve better than being stuck in a junk like this, like David Naughton (American Werewolf in London) as owner of the loft with which Keyes lives , Richard Roundtree as an eccentric sculptor / artist, Terry O'Quinn as a psychologist - Detective, and especially Lin Shaye as a hilarious idiot, a rather strange secretary-nurse in the asylum (the one that held Keyes' father) will soon be closed. <br /> <br /> To end the film, the sexy and sticky Lala Sloatman as Keyes' support girlfriend, Barbara Howard (Friday the 13th: The last chapter) as a betrayed woman by Naughton (.. he was about to start an affair with Nickman-Soul), Jack Orend as a sadistic demon who tries to provoke his son to kill innocents as he did and Robert Rusler (A nightmare on Elm Street 2: revenge of Freddy) as a rejected lover (Nickson-Soul) who suffered an unfortunate disappearance while tearing up paintings in revenge for his dismissal. <br /> <br /> This movie is a bad special effects movie that simply uses the title Amityville as cashing. The franchise has never been so good at first, but each suite being green, it has gotten worse. After the third film, the furniture of the infamous house becomes "possessed" objects that torment people. The actors make great efforts, however, but the material (a mirror causing chaos and murder by supernatural means) lacks quality. And the rather mediocre special effects do not help things. O'Quinn, as little as he can work with him, shows why he is such a great actor. It can even shine in feces like this one. All is not lost, you will see Sloatman always dressed in very short skirts (or his man's shirt in panties), showing off his legs everywhere ... you have to find a glimmer of hope somewhere. Believe it or not, AMITYVILLE: A NEW GENERATION was the seventh film in the franchise! The coolest part of the movie was the portraits of demons painted by the artist Nickson-Soul, perhaps inspired by the evil mirror after looking inside.
