Personally, I watched it because of the appearance of Lea Thompson and I did not really expect to enjoy the movie as such, but surprisingly, I watched it until the end. <br /> <br /> Let's face it - it's one. Saga-like stories and is not particularly original or entertaining, but strangely, it just keeps you on TV. My opinion of Will on their own would be much better if there was not one point that I do not understand. <br /> <br /> There is a charming and truly moving scene in which Lea Thompson's character runs across the street holding her baby in her arms, the snow is falling, she is cold, she is afraid and she has not no place to stay, she does not know what to do next. And then, about 10 or 12 years later, when she gets better, she just leaves the same child without any warning to undertake the career she dreamed of. <br /> <br /> I just do not understand. - I do not see how she could do such a thing, it was the opposite of everything she has done so far in her life while everything she did was aimed at the survival of the child. After this reversal of character, I just could not enjoy the rest of the film.
