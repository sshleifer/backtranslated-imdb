This movie is really bad, it is not very well done and it is a missed attempt of luster but I do not know what. I watched it and was very disappointed. It promised a lot, but did not deliver anything at all. The characters are shallow and wooden, and the music, if you can call it that, is awful. There are of course all creatures and all animate beings, but they are so badly made that it does not look like a third-rate movie. It's a shame that you do not pay more attention to special effects, either at the end or the end of a film, but in a film based on them, it's a very important factor. For me, a very sad attempt, and should be avoided.
