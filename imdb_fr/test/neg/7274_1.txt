Lord, it's bad. There is a kind of sex revolution movie of the sixties that manages to confuse sexual assault with sexual liberation. This film is an example. I forgot how many women were beaten, beaten, whipped, or spanked in the movie. And then, there are all the times women in the movie fantasize about being hit, beaten, whipped or spanked (you know they want it, right?). Sometimes it's apparently part of the safe game. Other times, this is clearly not the case, but you will wait in vain to see the heroine report to the authorities that she has just been raped. Instead, we hear her rapist scold her about her inability to "let go". <br /> <br /> Every scene in this film smells of misogyny (speaking as a married man, white and straight, in the late thirties, not a teenager major in studies with a flea on the shoulder, for fear that you have a wrong idea). <br /> <br /> Perhaps the only good thing about this film is that it is a crude reminder of how things really were for women just a few decades ago.
