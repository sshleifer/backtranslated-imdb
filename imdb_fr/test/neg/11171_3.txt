It is really heartbreaking to see a formerly great director, such as Deodato, deliver such a second-rate giallo. This film was so terrible that it effectively ended his career. The box is, it's not an "erotic thriller", during the 97 minutes that the film lasts, Charlotte Lewis barely shows us a nipple! I thought it would resume once William Burger appeared (in one of his last roles), but his character is killed rather abruptly and sluggishly. This film fails in almost every way. The music of Claudio Simonetti is a little more than noise, and the plot was meaningless. For some reason, Lewis is terrorized by ghosts attacking with phones. (?) In the end, the characters all seem to have forgotten the 90 minutes of hell they have gone through and laugh casually as they make the evil spirits of someone else, the ex-boy, sick. Lewis's friend. What?!? This film did little for me and made me angry ... and half bored. To have fun in the 80s Deodato game, watch THE BARBARIANS or THE ATLANTIS INTERCEPTORS, let it break down on the video store shelf. Argento could do a better job than that!
