This film is worse than terrible! It took a good scenario to turn it into schizophrenic cinema. Photography is extremely amateurish. . . It looks like a 5th-grade family film project, filmed with dysfunctional 8mm children's cameras. . . the editing seems to have been done by a person with psychotic flashbacks (while taking drugs and alcohol), with shortened scenes, followed by other unrelated scenes, and then cut scene segments and glued. . . totally useless and gratuitous nudity. . . missing scenes. . . day scenes transforming inexplicably into night scenes, then suddenly back to the day. . . obviously no continuity. Tom Skerritt, Wendy Hughes and James Mason lack talent as actors, as do the talents of the "key" cast - (forget the bad guy and the Anderson women - very amateur actor). This film is a good candidate for a remake, even with Skerritt and Hughes. . . just did it professionally this time.
