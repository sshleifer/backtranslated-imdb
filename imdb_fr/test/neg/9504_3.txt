I usually much prefer French films to American movies, with explosions and car chases, but this film was very disappointing. There is no way to write a spoiler because nothing really happens. This French couple lives in Lisbon for years and they return to Paris for the wedding of a friend. They announce to another friend with whom they dine that they will separate. Then nothing happens, they do not seem to know if they want to separate or not. I do not necessarily think that their hesitations make a bad film, it is very human to hesitate before making such a decision for good, but it could be treated in an interesting way, giving flesh to their desires and their relationship but that does not happen. We leave the theater without knowing why these two have met or want to separate. The only thing I liked was the conversation with the drunkards. It was true to life.
