The first DH was not terrible, but I really did not expect that. But this horrible movie was just beyond criticism. I'm really trying to look at the bright side and give films like this a chance, but I just could not find a good thing about it. I appreciate what Bill Cowell was trying to do, but this movie was so boring. The story of the movie is really not so bad. In fact, it's a bit original. But the shape of the movie is really as bad as many people say. In my opinion, this one is at the top of the list with "The Off Season" and "Dracula 3000". I know a lot of people criticize and crush movies like this, but I really can not think of anything positive to say about it.
