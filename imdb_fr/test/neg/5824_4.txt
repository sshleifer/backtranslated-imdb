I think Purvis starts making a gay "Gone With The Wind" If so, sorry, Tag, it did not happen. It did not happen either as a gay "sexual exploitation" film. I guess I'm confused; what are we trying to do here? Although I would like, I just can not get where I care even a little about these characters. This film is effective to capture a taste of the decadence that lives in the South; it does nothing to explain, enlighten or advance my understanding of a homosexual relationship, or the conflict with which the protagonist seems to be struggling.
