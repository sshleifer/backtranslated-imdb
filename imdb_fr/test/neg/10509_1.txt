This film almost made me cry. <br /> <br /> For starters, false teeth. Then you spot a beautiful set of plastic or drawn. To make it even more boring, the action is followed by a flash of light. Then we talk: sound levels are so different, sometimes too hard, then too soft, never as good as in good movies. In addition, it's so echoed that I think they had a microphone all over the board. And to make matters worse, NEVER heard of stereo? If the camera tilts, the sound is still centered. The actors speak as if they were reading on a board mounted behind the camera. And the zoom on another scene, what a child. <br /> <br /> The music is so badly chosen that it never adds anything. This only destroys any accidentally created excitement. <br /> <br /> Finally, the fight scenes ... my 3 year old niece would make a better fight scene. <br /> <br /> This movie is not even good to laugh, it's just that bad ...
