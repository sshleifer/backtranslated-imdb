Note: * 1/2 on **** <br /> <br /> "The Net" is one of those movies that you will not think for an hour. Well ... just if you keep thinking how bad it is. It's a mediocre trash, miserable, hollow, laughable and predictable. One of the adjectives I just used above is why I added 1/2 star to the one I would have given. So, is this a case of "so bad that it's good"? No, it's a case of "so bad that it's laughable". <br /> <br /> Bullock in a (surprise!) very bad performance plays Angela Bennett, a computer specialist who is at home all the time. She works at home, has no friends and her neighbors do not know her. Suddenly, she is involved in dangerous situations, after the death of her colleague and the same thing that happens to her almost. Her identity, bank accounts, etc., etc., etc., have all been removed and her name is now Ruth Marx. The plot even involves the government and ... Wait! Have not we seen this before? Yes, thousands of times. "The Net" tries to be modern, to be the portrait of the 90s, showing the computer as a villain. Big deal! It's a movie about nothing, just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes. Take the scene of the boat accident. I just laughed when the camera started to slow down ... <br /> <br /> What makes things worse is Sandra Bullock. How terrible she is! Has she ever done a good movie? "It's time to kill," okay. But she is still a bad actress, repeating her robotic face in each of her photos. <br /> <br /> The advantages and disadvantages of the computer have already been shown in "2001: The Odyssey of Space", the best and most complex smart movie ever made. It is not necessary to compare "The Net" with, is it ...? <br /> <br /> The only reason to see "The Net" is to laugh, as I said, and see what it is trying to be. The results are a shame. <br /> <br /> DELETE this movie in your mind!
