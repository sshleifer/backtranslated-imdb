Six stars for the representation of General Groves by Paul Newman, and four negative for the inclusion of a highly fictitious event where the truth is well documented. Michael Merriman did not really exist. His character - or at least his fate - is vaguely based on that of Louis Slotin, a Canadian physicist who only came to Los Alamos after the war. He led his lethal "dragon tail" experiment in May 1946. This was a critical point. The effects of hard radiation on the human body were not known until they were observed in the victims of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki explosions. If someone died of radiation poisoning in Los Alamos before the Trinity test, it is quite possible that the scientists stopped working abruptly and the story changed. Whether for better or for worse, we can only speculate. Someone should ask the producers and the producer whether they have added Merriman's character for a dramatic effect or to deliver an anti-nuclear message. For a fairer and more accurate treatment of the events of Los Alamos during the Manhattan Project, check out the TV movie "Day One" or, better yet, read Peter Wyden's book on which it is based.
