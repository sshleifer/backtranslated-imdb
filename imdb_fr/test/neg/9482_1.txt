OK I watched this movie. Someone has to kick me. WHY should Olsen twins insist on subjecting the world to this putrid torture? It was another film to watch the Olsen twins go to an exotic place, meet cute guys, be pretty and everyone greeting them. The direction, the development of the plot, the acting of the actors. I do not know about the United States, but in my country, it's considered extremely stupid to jump on the bike of a guy you met 10 minutes ago. Although I am now convinced that these girls will never learn to play, I really hope that one day we will see a film with an original plot, even slightly plausible.
