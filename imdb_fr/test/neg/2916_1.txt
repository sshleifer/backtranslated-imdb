Spoiler alert possible, although there is not much to spoil with this movie. I saw the project Part II not having seen the first movie. I do not think I missed much. Project A, Part Two, is not only Jackie Chan's worst film I've seen to date (actually, worse than "Fantasy Mission Force"), this film is one of the most unassailable that the world has never seen. It's quite up to par with "Plan 9 of Outer Space" on the scale of sleep induction. The plot is twisted and tied like a 15 meter wool ball with which the cat played and was finally left for dead. The humor, if you can call it that, seems to have been written by an annoying freshman in high school who, despite the number of people telling him he's not funny, is determined to bring out his lame humor , no matter the pain of a movie. . And this movie is painfully bad. The plot involves Jackie Chan as a naval officer recruited by the police to gather "all known criminals". He gathered them in the first half hour of the movie and I prayed for a quick end that I did not get. Why the movie is bothering to progress from this point I have no idea. The film hangs endlessly, endlessly, without conspiracy, and attempts at humor that fail so miserably, they give Carrot Top the look of a comic genius. Kung Fu in this film is lame and forgettable. There is a better Kung Fu in this movie about the 3 Ninja kids. The A part II project is neither an action movie nor a kung fu movie, but it is a total waste of Jackie Chan and Maggie Cheung's talents that have created worlds beyond the world. While Jackie Chan repeatedly escapes certain death, I enter the 'Blair Witch' mode to ask (and wish) 'Will he die NOW, so the movie can end? `. An example of the ridiculousness of this film: Jackie Chan is handcuffed to another man. A band of pirates (which is nothing like pirates) throws axes at Jackie. Does Jackie catch one of the capricious axes and break the chain of handcuffs? No! You see that it would spoil the "hilarious" gag because it is handcuffed to another person. If you have a friend who laughs at everything, I encourage you to watch this movie with him, and to watch as they will not make this movie laugh. If you are an insomniac, this movie is sure to put you to sleep. Do not use heavy machinery while looking at Plan A, Part II. Possible side effects are headaches, retinal tension and death by boredom. 0/9 stars
