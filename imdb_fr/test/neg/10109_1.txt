Well, I'll start with this: I like horror movies, not even the worst conspiracy or the most terribly terrible actor will spoil the experience as long as there is a certain amount of gore and suspense. Second; it's the worst movie of all time. He even beats Mean Guns and killer tomato attack. And for that, I pay him homage. <br /> <br /> However, the involuntary humor was funny only until half of the film was over, after which everything was so sad. To my surprise, the critics were somewhat divided; and you guys who rated this piece of C-movie-shit from 7 years old and up; I know you're having fun! GOOD ONE !! HAHAHA! Because if there is any reason in the world and we have only a little bit the same notion of quality; you can not be for real. <br /> <br /> Everything that is worth mentioning about the content has already been summarized, but I will leave it. <br /> <br /> MINOR SPOILER ALERT <br /> <br /> But the scene where the guy in masked rubber mask drags the woman through the kennel for ten minutes, with such a terrible score and the hallucinatory dialogue between the two really does it for me.
