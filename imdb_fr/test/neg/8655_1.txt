I would give this movie a 1/10. This film lacks the usual cinematographic substance and focuses far too much on the current "skin trend" in Bollywood films. I certainly would not recommend that teens watch this movie. What makes me really discouraged is how could such an impressive banner like Yash Chopra Films succumb to such horrible production? They may have forgotten to keep in mind that there is a wider audience than the "grown-up" audience as well, which, once exposed to such coarse movies, can make them lose their mentality. and make them succumb to things devoid of meaning and recognition. <Br/> <br /> In general, movies must not only be entertaining but also have some meaning. Admittedly, this film is a huge disappointment for the fans of Yash Chopra, especially for myself. I am really disappointed with the plot, the acting and everything else. Why can not people put a substance that can be cherished after being confronted in the movies, at least for once in the film? The point is clear. I would like to summarize my opinion: "Horrible - Disappointment - Lots of material for adults - Lack of" substance "reasonable - Lack of normal psyche - Worthless - Could take a chocolate Cornetto or chocolate Temptations instead"
