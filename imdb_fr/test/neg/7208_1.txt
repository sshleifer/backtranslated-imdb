Dark Harvest 3: Scarecrow: 1 out of 10: In Einstein's theory of relativity, time is one of time. (Or so I heard) In other words, this movie seems much longer than an hour and changes. Even in fast-forward (and you'll be looking for that fast-forward button), it works somewhere in eternity. <br /> <br /> If you're familiar with Lionsgate's Greenlight project version (that's where they buy a homemade movie but a fancy cover on it and sneak it into the horror section of your Wal-Mart local), you will not be surprised by the total and complete lack of the entertainment value contained within. <br /> <br /> Reading online (I refuse to call it acting) is consistently horrible. This is a collection of fathers and strippers claiming to be in a movie between cans of Schlitz. The work of the camera is a drunk father shot as a holiday movie and although the special effects are correct, the most frightening effect is the breast augmentation scars of the nude scene. <br /> <br /> The story is horrible, the decorations come from a haunted Halloween set up by college kids with ADHD and again, reading online (remember that it's not to act more than to sink in a pool is to swim) distracted beyond words. To avoid.
