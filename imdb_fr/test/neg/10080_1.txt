You could have put the characters on the island for some reason and have the same movie. The first had an original story, the second had stolen King Kong's and at the end (I hope) of this trilogy, the story seemed to have been completely ignored. Drop people on an island filled with dinosaurs and watch them run for their lives. That was about all there was to do. The special effects were decent but not worth $ 8. If you have a discount theater in your area, wait until you see it. I would not even bother to rent it. It would be too much money for this impassable thriller.
