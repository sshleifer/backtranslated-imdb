Ken Foree and Rosalind Cash, along with Brenda Bakke, are among the main actors in this story about a haunted health club. The wacky dialogues and some gore effects make this movie thrilling. Not bad but not great shakes either. <br /> <br /> Recommended for bad dialogues and acting. B-movie fans only. <br /> <br /> B
