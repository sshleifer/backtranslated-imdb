It's about jealousy, racism, manipulation, but the underlying message is love. Geoffrey Sax tried to remove Othello from Shakespeare by bringing it back to the modern context. However, the actors were not convincing enough to achieve this. There were additional bodies to help put everything in perspective, however, John Othello, played by Eamonn Walker, reacted a lot in this film, causing the fall of Keeley Hawes, Dessie Brabant, which eventually resulted in the death of Dessie . <br /> <br /> Ben Jago, played by Christopher Eccleston, was considered the main character of the film. He did not give enough proof for Dessie to cheat Othello with Michael Cass, played by Richard Coyle. Instead, he simply played a friend at all and explained why she was "cheating". In the game, Iago was much more convinced to make Othello suspect something. This change made the film more rage for the wrong reasons, than what the book was based on. However, the film has some positives. This turned the scenes of the army into a darker racist group, where Othello is the main head of the police brigade. These scenes are made credible by raging crowds and burning fires. You are able to feel the amount of racism in the movie more than you can in the book. This book traces the scenes of modern times by making it much easier to understand than the Shakespearian era in which it was written. position. He never gets what he deserves and never gets caught for telling Othello the lie until it's too late. I saw that as a fall in the film, because I feel that the villain is being granted his treasure of promotion out of lying, and in the book he is discovered by Rodrigo. Overall, the film could have done a better job based on the piece than it did. I think the director of the film has left out some of the most important parts of the play that have been mentioned or that allow the play to flow or turn it into a tragedy. I would say that you should read the book first, in order to understand all the events that happened in the movie, otherwise you might find yourself lost and confused.
