To this day, Malcolm McLaren tells anyone foolish enough to believe that the Sex Pistols were his idea and that the members of the group were his puppets to use to make money. He has a good reason to do that, that he is a liar. <br /> <br /> Here are some real facts. <br /> <br /> * The group asked McLaren to become a manager. , not the opposite. <br /> <br /> * The Pistols were an appropriate organic group and had not been created by McLaren or anyone else. Jones and Cook were childhood friends. Rotten and Vicious are also very old. This is something that has led to an unfair criticism of the Pistols over the years, as they have been compared to groups of manufactured boys. <br /> <br /> * The band and no one else wrote the songs, did not record them, did not play live created the advertisement and granted the interviews. <br /> <br /> * McLaren did not instigate the Bill Grundy incident. The Pistols only appeared on the program because Queen had retired. According to the group, McLaren curled up in the back in case arrests were about to be made. <br /> <br /> * Johnny Rotten left the group. He was not fired. <br /> <br /> * Far from contradicting the Sex Pistols, John Lydon (Rotten) sued him in the 1980s to control him and obtain a considerable amount of money. Among the evidence used by Lydon's lawyers are McLaren's boasting in The Great Rock & Roll Swindle. This would suggest that McLaren is not too bright despite his assignments. <br /> <br /> * The layoffs and later spin-offs from A & M and EMI were again not designed, just the way things went. <br /> <br /> * McLaren boasts of the money he has won with the group. If he had been competent, he could have done a lot more. It seems he can not even arrange the concerts properly. <br /> <br /> * McLaren's claim at the beginning of the film that he invented punk rock can be refuted in about 10 seconds. The Pistols were not the first punk band, but the most prominent. <br /> <br /> It's a terrible movie. The only parts that are worth watching are the real images of the group, which were later used much better in "The Filth And The Fury".
