Contains Spoilers <br /> <br /> But if you did not fall on the head as a child, then used as a football, you will agree with me that this is one of the worst and hilarious series never realized. Centering around a woman who was beaten as a child by her father who also killed her mother, she spends her time drawing, but wait, then she becomes her superhero drawing and continues to fight crime, So "intelligent, attracted to pain." The story itself is OK, but that's the way it is, scriptwriter and director Jesse does not know how to write a screenplay. a monologue featuring the 8-year-old hero's version, a 30-year-old man, while his father, who wears a big mustache, walks around the house all day long while looking angrily, showing how the characterization is bad, especially the moment when he gets angry in the first episode and begins to repeat the phrase "no more" while holding his wife's head before killing her using the marble work surface. next sound effect and his terrible game as all he can express is pissed off, even after beating his daughter with his belt, which allows him to moan and seem furious in slow motion. The episodes themselves could easily contain a good clean script of more than 5 minutes, but oh no, Jesse does not want it. Little Jesse shits post-modernism as if he had just eaten Donnie Darko, then killed. Unnecessary camera jerks, all at strange angles, excessively repeated lines and even useless sequences mingled from time to time to fill the long episodes. In conclusion, the idea is not bad, that's how it happens, but there is also a great character on a bench that does not rise enough and that is great, I just want to kiss his smooth cheeks and chubby because they look so sweet. The development of the character is nonexistent since the main character has just said the first thing to philosophical sound that comes to his head, although all contradict each other. But overall, mainly <br /> <br /> Indiana Jones 4, it's much better, type "Jeeharv" in you-tube too, the results may make you cry to the beauty of the world. you will hear a lot of cheap, mostly gay sex jokes.
