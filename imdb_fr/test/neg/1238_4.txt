I'm not sure this review contains spoilers, but I'm cautious that there may be some. Anyway, it is unlikely that anyone watching this movie without knowing the book. <br /> <br /> There is an old madness about working hard and making a mouse appear. "Comanche Moon" is such a mouse. <br /> <br /> The novel is more focused on the Indians than on the Americans. By adapting it to television, McMurtry and Osanna were right in saying that the public would be more interested in whites than in reds. Unfortunately, there is little in the novel that we do not already know about Gus, Woodrow and their friends. So, the film gives us especially a prodigious taste of what will happen in "Lonesome Dove". Indians - who have their own story to tell - are largely relegated to the background - so much so that those who have not read the novel will rightly ask why it is called "Comanche Moon". <br /> <br /> The novel has no plot or "point". This could have been corrected in the film, further accentuating the contrast between the Indians who are losing their land and their way of life to the Americans, who bring the "civilzation". This opportunity has been missed. <br /> <br /> Unlike "Lonesome Dove", "Comanche Moon" has few extensive scenes that develop character or relationships - at least among Americans. The extended scenes with the Indians have been largely suppressed or shortened. And for a film (net) of four hours, it is remarkably episodic and agitated. The impression is that the scenario was longer in the beginning and reduced to reduce production costs. <br /> <br /> The scenario mainly includes dialogues, aphorisms and platitudes clich√©s. Coming from the author of "The Last Picture Show", this is a surprisingly bad script. McMurtry and Osanna had the opportunity to solve the story and description problems, but they did not. <br /> <br /> Some of the best dialogues in the novel are missing or have been changed for no obvious reason. For example, Clara (Cassie) shows her intense hatred against Woodrow (Jack) by condemning Gus (Ennis) for always escaping with his "pard". This little tangy revelation of Clara's sexuality jealously left. Then there is the scene where Woodrow, very dense, warns Maggie not to let Jake Spoon "compromise". The exchange in the novel is shorter and harder; the film softens the tone and does not portray Woodrow as a socially stupid and emotionally frozen stone. (When I read this scene from the novel, I wanted to hit Woodrow in the stomach - or worse.) There are other changes, some of which are understandable. The eyelids of Inish Scull are not cut; to do this, would have liked to need expensive CGI. But Buffalo Hump does not have a bump! (Perhaps it was unreasonable to ask Wes Studi to stick to such a prosthesis.) And Buffalo Hump's character is "nice and kind". There is nowhere as grotesque violence as in novels. <br /> <br /> The only good thing about this quasi-turkey is the remarkable performance of Steve Zahn - less than Gus McCrae, but Robert Duvall plays Gus McCrae. It's strange. It perfectly reproduces the manners and the language of Duvall, without ever appearing "deliberate" or timid. As was the case with Duvall, he is totally "inside" the character. And it actually shows us that Gus becomes "more Gus" in the third part. <br /> <br /> The best thing about "Comanche Moon" is that it will not spoil our affection for "Loneome Dove", not only awesome Western, but an excellent American movie. <br /> <br /> PS: For those who think that Rachel Griffiths was at the top, that's what she was in the book.
