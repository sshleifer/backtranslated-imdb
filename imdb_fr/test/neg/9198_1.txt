If you fill all the shots about the firefighters in the city in 105 minutes; you have Ladder 49. <br /> <br /> He has a story but is deeply clouded by all the clich√©s. This makes it a movie with every event; becomes so predictable that it's not worth looking at. The story has no depth and even the acting seems superficial. <br /> <br /> It seemed like he wanted to be a tribute to the firefighters, but he ended up being boring and pretentious. The parallel between Jack Morrison being fatally trapped under an inaccessible part of a building and firefighters trapped under the rubble of the twin towers was too obvious. <br /> <br /> This does not compare to movies like Backdraft and certainly does not set an example for future firefighter films.
