Ryan McDonell, his daughter's boyfriend, is particularly helpful when he suspects a guy he knows as a police officer twisted to cause a lot of harm to the Van Dien group. <br /> <br /> My only question is: why did not they have Bruce Willis, Billy Bob Thornton and the rest of the crew to deal with the wicked comet? <br /> <br /> Pass to each other.
