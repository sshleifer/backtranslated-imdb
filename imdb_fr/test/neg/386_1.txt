I consider this the worst movie of all time. <br /> <br /> If there was a movie I would like to wish my enemies would be good. The plot is ridiculous, there are only 2 characters and the coincidences between these characters completely stifle the belief. <br /> <br /> These factors combine to make an extremely boring film. <br /> <br /> My wife and mother came out of the movie about 15 minutes. I thought that a film so boring and slow * must have an interesting and interesting twist, and was rather disappointed when nothing exciting materialized. <br /> <br /> I briefly considered sending a bill to the filmmakers for my two hours of lost life.
