Tru Calling was good but it could have been great. The concept was intriguing and allowed to draw seriously weird and scary stories that could have been explored in the future. Unfortunately, the writing and an actor dropped the show. <br /> <br /> The writing was not too bad but there were holes. In episode 13, "Drop Dead Gorgeous", an incredibly poisonous poison would have been used to kill the victim. It was so toxic and so quickly killed that the victim did not have time to run or even cry for help. Yet there was no plausible explanation for how the killer had got such a powerful poison. <br /> <br /> In episode 15, "The Getaway", the policeman on leave responded unrealistically. In the second scene of the restaurant, he (softly) tells the thief to drop the rifle and when it does not follow the order, and in fact, turns the rifle in his direction, he lets it turn into a tussle then turn into a hostage. situation ?? the very situation for which he had been warned. His answer would have been to shoot at the thief when she did not follow his order and after returning his gun to him. There are other flaws in the stories, but I will leave them with these two examples. Despite the mistakes of writing, I liked the show. <br /> <br /> My other problem was that I just could not accept Eliza Dushku in this role. In my opinion, she is too inexperienced and too light to wear this piece. She never walked anywhere, she walked; and all too often, she stopped abruptly at her mark. <br /> <br /> He also lacked a facial expression or a really emotional intonation. She has either a thoughtful look or a cute smile; other emotions are rarely apparent. When she tries to look dramatic, she begins her sentence looking away and "then" turns her eyes to her fellow actor. Or alternatively, she starts her line looking at the opposite side and then looks away. Both are annoying when done as a replacement for real emotion. An example of his lack of intonation is in episode 20, "Two Weddings and a Funeral", during his second wedding speech, is devoid of emotion (for example, a heart in our hearts). <br /> <br /> I liked all the other actors in their respective parts and they were all believable. With improved writing and a track change, Tru Calling could have done it.
