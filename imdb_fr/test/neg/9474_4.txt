First let me take that from my chest I hate Octopussy with absolute passion. What's so frustrating is that he had so much potential and a very good opening sequence. Unfortunately, after the opening sequence, everything goes downhill. First, there was absolutely no plot to start, just an excuse for Moore to tell his lame jokes. Then there are several sequences that would thrill a Bond fan, for example the sequence in which Bond appears to broadcast a bomb disguised as a clown. The villains are poor enough, Louis Jordon does not succeed, Kamal Khan and Bollywood veteran Kabir Bedi are as poor as his henchman. It's funny when people are wondering what is Bond's worst film and Octopussy is forgotten when he can easily give them money.
