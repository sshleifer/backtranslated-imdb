This film was awful. It was too much about Eddie, Clark Griswald's brother-in-law. Eddie works much better when we change good stuff like in "Christmas Holidays" and "Holidays". <br /> <br /> I really do not understand how a movie like this would be approved. Now, do not get me wrong, I like Randy Quaid, but I felt that this movie was totally wrong for him and the character in general. This film leaves a lot to be desired and really needed bigger actors.
