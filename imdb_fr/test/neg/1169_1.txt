I own a lake vacation home not far from Plainfield, Wisconsin. Ten minutes from the Gein property to be exact. I saw his land, the cemetery where he is buried and where he dug, and I shopped at the hardware store that used to belong to the Worden family. While visiting relatives in California, we decided to rent this movie. It was disgusting. The real story of Ed Gein is so disturbing and scary that the creators of this trash have decided to create their own story beyond me. The actor playing Ed is a very tall man, Ed was a very small man, sweet and shy. That's part of what makes his story so scary. He did not have any help digging the graves and anyone who owns land in the area knows that it is mostly sand with some soil. You will not burn a lot of sweat by digging a hole. They did not have to hire an actor with the physique of a wrestler, just do your research. And if the writing was not enough - there are NO mountains in Wisconsin, and I'm pretty sure the 911 was not available in 1957.
