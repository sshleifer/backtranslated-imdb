The animation is great, I concede. But Disney has perpetuated all the stereotypes that the Alaskans have been trying to overcome for two generations. And the names, I mean, go ... Sitka, Kenai, Tanana & Denahi (Denali's nerdy takeoff) ?! These are real places where real people live! And the real people for whom these real places have been named are probably struggling out of the Earth to take revenge on this trivial little movie. Disney, you live in California and Florida, among the other states that still treat us as a foreign country. If you can not stick to what you know, recruit at least and / or work with people who know in what area you are trying to caricature. Maybe then it would not be so insulting! :(
