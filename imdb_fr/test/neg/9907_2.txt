The only reason I know this film exists is because I wanted to see what Nancy McKeon had accomplished since the end of The Facts of Life. When I looked for his name, this relatively new television movie appeared. After much research, I managed to find a copy and was completely disappointed with what I saw. D grade actor, mediocre scenario, horrendous FX effect - it was like watching a dimmed and more stunned version of Day After Tomorrow that lasted 3 hours. Despite the long duration of operation, the characters remain relatively underdeveloped, we do not care at all and wait in most cases their disappearance. Combine that with terrible lighting and cinematography and you get a real disaster of a movie. The way they summoned so many "named" actors (ie Dianne Weist, Randy Quaid, Brian Dennehy) to appear in such garbage is astounding. In summary, I want to find these 3 hours of my life!
