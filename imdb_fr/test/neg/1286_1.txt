This film is like a square peg in a square hole. A badly made ankle. An ankle so cheap that it could not even be produced in a nightclub assembly line in Chinatown, Mexico. In fact, when you try to drive the ankle into the hole for which it was designed, it is reduced to sticky, disgusting pieces that smell like decaying fruit and do not wash away. Quigly is an example. <br /> <br /> This movie is so horrible that it was not even created. A film like this must have been the result of an accident of nature; a weird entity that froze somewhere in the corner of a motionless office, became infected and grew to become too big and terrifying to watch. Only science would be interested in such a thing. Anyone who does not intend to study it would exhume it from this world. <br /> <br /> The challenge is: if you're the type to enjoy first-year violin recitals, racism or Coke Zero, just be your birthday.
