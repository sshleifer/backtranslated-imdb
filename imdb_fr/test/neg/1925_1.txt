A young and beautiful cast is wasted in this empty film, maud and manipulative, which tries to combine a cute comedy and an insightful drama. The plot moves so slowly that the 90 minutes seem interminable, because the characters are just moping and moving. The dialogue is filled with staggered clich√©s and pseudo-fortune-cookie attempts. <br /> <br /> Obviously, the film aims to give a moving and profound look at life and love. The only real weight is the burden that talented actors are forced to wear the best they can. But, do not worry - they are restrained by the puppet chains of the artificial plot.
