It's unique in the Hitchcock films I saw, in that I did not really appreciate it. <br /> <br /> In fact, I found this quite predictable and boring. <br /> <br /> Cary Grant and Joan Fontaine are a newly married couple. This is the kind of "adorable" character that you have seen in many movies, without ever being for me! <br /> <br /> In fact, it was at best a barely believable relationship, and sometimes it seemed particularly wrong and improbable. <br /> <br /> Unable to keep a job and trying to lead an opulent life, Grant borrows money he can not repay. <br /> <br /> Fontaine is convinced that he is trying to kill her to get the money for which she is insured. and presumably what his late father was worth. <br /> <br /> Medium and rather uninteresting, but as usual, you can see the influence on the movies that came at a later date.
