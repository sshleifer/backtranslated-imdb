This movie was useless. I can not even call it science fiction because it takes more than one movie to unfold in space. "Max Q" is not even defined in the space for the entire movie. The story / the plot is not original, distribution is not a subject of writing, although it would be strange to be part of a top cast in a mediocre film ... In addition, it is not particularly exciting or well told. At least it is mediocre balanced, as nothing and nobody stands out. Everything is also bland. I usually find some quality in "space films", even if it's only 90 minutes of semi-lame entertainment, on the edge of a low-budget pathetic, but "Max Q" does not did not even give that satisfaction. In short, a total loss of time.
