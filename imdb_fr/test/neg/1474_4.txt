Sorry, dear friends, but all of you who say it's an excellent documentary ... and the prize he won at Sundance ... well, you've all been duped. For a few years, I heard how I had to see this documentary and I finally watched it. Maybe in 1999, when it came out, and reality TV did not have such a dominant presence in the industry, it would have been entertaining. But Mike and Mark obviously play with each other, Mike and Mark. Sometimes they are fun and some of the lines seem gone, but most of the time it does not sound right. They are the reality version of Jay and Silent Bob. Yes, people are real, they are not actors, but it's put forward, it's exaggerated, and it's so obvious that it's hard to believe that so many people think it's the real case. I was not fooled so it was actually a little boring. Slightly fun, but do not miss a thing if you miss it.
