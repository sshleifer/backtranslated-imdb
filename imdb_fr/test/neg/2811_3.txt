I have not seen any other film by Antonioni and the people who saw it with me agreed that he shares themes and images with the rest of his works. Maybe if I had seen other things from him, I would have appreciated this one, knowing what to expect. <br /> <br /> I saw it as an almost complete failure for so many reasons. First, the film introduces interesting and profound questions about social relations, feelings, the nature of reality in relation to fiction, but it is very often done in the most clumsy way, making the characters speak like if they pronounced speeches, dragged on again and again. , juxtaposing statements rather than having dialogues. The writers seem so worried that we will not understand what they prefer to tell rather than show. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the film has no rhythm, especially in its first half. It's not just that it's slow. Some slow films have been made with an excellent sense of rhythm and rhythm (Victor Erice's El Sur or Scorsese's The Age of Innocence are examples I like), but for this to be a success it is necessary that we found the characters so endearing or so moving story that we can adapt to them. This does not happen in Beyond the Clouds, where the first episode seems to drag on in length, and where the relationship between John Malkovich's "reality" and "fictional" love stories is sometimes fluid, others abrupt, others confused.
