The controversial German journalist Jutta Rabe, who herself had divers on the Estonian wreck, concocted this silly "thriller" to save her investment. <br /> <br /> Donald Sutherland is of course always observable - but he only participates in three scenes. He delivers his material perfectly - as you can ask a professional. JÃ¼rgen Prochnov is sometimes very good. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast is bad. The actress who plays the secretary of the Swedish minister (or whatever she appears to be missing from the cast) is EXTREMELY wrong. <br /> <br /> The storyline has good ideas and the story is actually quite interesting. The final scenario, however, should have been rewritten several times. Some scenes are ridiculous, especially the end scenes. <br /> <br /> The film lasts almost two hours, 45 minutes too much. Presented as a 60-minute TV movie, it could have been really interesting. As a two-hour report, it's pretentious, boring, stupid and completely ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Jutta Rabe could be a good journalist (her ideas about governments using Estonia to transport military items from Estonia to Sweden were concluded It's true recently, when the Swedish army officially declared to have used the ship Estonia for this purpose), but as a film producer, she fears. <br /> <br /> The director, the writer and the actors suck more. <br /> <br /> I give this film 3/10. I would have given him a 1, if it was not for the fact that the story is interesting enough sometimes, Donald Sutherland is there and it contains real archive footage. <br /> <br /> But we do not do it. t even see the boat sink! What kind of movie about a sinking ship is this? Like a werewolf movie without werewolves ...
