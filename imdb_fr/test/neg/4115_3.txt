In a future where an industrious travel agency uses time travel technology to refer wealthy customers to the dinosaur era, the future is inexplicably changed when one of their clients breaks the fundamental rule of not not go astray. In an attempt to repair the damage, an experienced scout (Edward Burns) joins the inventor of the technology (Catherine McCormack). <br /> <br /> The principle is pretty good and engaging. There may be some flaws, but it could still make an interesting movie. Unfortunately, A Sound of Thunder does not really attract the public. He suffers from many problems and he takes himself too seriously. It is difficult to have fun watching the movie. Personally, I thought the script was the biggest problem of the movie. They were more complicated than expected and the movie was a little lazy to explain things. I was hoping to go deeper into the "butterfly effect" but the movie was more fun than anything else. I do not mind, because 90 minutes of brainless fun is always a good way to spend an evening. However, all the pleasure offered by this film was involuntary and lame. Some scenes entertained me, but I was bored enough. <br /> <br /> The acting game is not much better, as most of them seem more interested in a pay check than anything else. Ben Kingsley was the only person to give a good performance. He kept the first half of the movie nice and seemed to have the most fun too. Edwards Burns was rather pale and bland. I do not think he has what it takes to be a prominent man. However, it could make a decent secondary actor. Catherine McCormack was really annoying and not very credible. I have not really seen it elsewhere, but it could have potential. The rest of the actors also perform poorly, although most of them are relatively unknown. This should not affect their career too much. <br /> <br /> The posting of bulletin boards reveals that most people complain about special effects. There is no way to flirt with them and they are terrible. All dinosaurs really look bad. Gibbon's lizards (monkey party, dino party), although they are a creative idea, become flawed after a while and are more likely to encourage laughter rather than fear. The green screen work looks horrible and unprofessional. I was really wondering what the director Peter Hyams was trying to accomplish here. He can not deliver the suspense, the action and the thrills and makes this film a long session. For the most part, the film is rather harmless and it is far from the worst movie of 2005. Let's hope they do it again in the future. There is potential in this project but for now it's the best we've got. In the end, unless curiosity trumps you, there is no reason to see A Sound of Thunder. Note 4/10
