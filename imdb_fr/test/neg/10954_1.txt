This film baffled me. I could not grab myself. Thought that I might miss something. Glad to see that most of you agree with me. This is not always the case (see my recent review of RE: Extinction). <br /> <br /> Explaining more about the flaws of this movie would be a glorious waste of time ... so I'll do it. .. <br /> <br /> They are dressed like cowboys, but we are in modern times, right? No? I do not understand ??? When I picked up the box, I thought: WESTERN ZOMBIE! COOL! That's how it was presented. I have not seen that yet. I hope they did a good job. <br /> <br /> They did not do it! They tried to create an iconic character that would spawn a series. They did not do it. <br /> <br /> They tried to make sure that the Australian independent zombies are on the caliber (and perhaps on the bottom of their coat) of the very successful "UNDEAD". <br /> <br /> OK, maybe they just wanted to make a confusing, disjointed movie salad, which could possibly be changed into something visible. They do not have! This is the new number 2 on my list of Worst Zombie Movies Ever. There are really only two so far, "DAY OF THE DEAD: CONTAGIUM" being the first (not to be confused with "DAY OF THE DEAD", which is one of my favorite zombie movies of all the time). If you want to make a zombie movie (and I'm not a zombie movie director, I'm just a connoisseur), make it a good one. Flight of the Living Dead is a good example of the recent shooting of zombies. FYI. <br /> <br /> If you really forgive, you wonder, well, did not they at least add something to make us feel like we did not want to get our money back? Guess what ... THEY DO NOT!
