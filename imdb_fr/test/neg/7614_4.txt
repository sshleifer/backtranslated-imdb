I'm still waiting for this dark film of muppet where we will not know how it ends from the beginning. I think Linklater could do an experiment with animation. This time, I did not expect an intelligent way to such a thing, but I wished deeply. <br /> <br /> Joan Cusack was bad. She went to a level made for television, playing with it a cynical clich√©. The muppets had more life than life itself. Disappointment. <br /> <br /> But then the whole movie was, except Pepe. I liked it. He was the only one to make me laugh (while Goldbergh, like God, was choking and swearing). If we can not see dark muppets, then at least one PG: 13 with more controversial Pepe jokes and a metal animal head, chicken-egg-chuggin character. Even annoying Christmas singers beat this one. The muppets must avoid these commercial vacations. <br /> <br /> 5/10
