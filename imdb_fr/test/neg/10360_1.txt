Yes, I admire the independent spirit of it all, but it's like Road Trip with a bad cast and no budget. <br /> <br /> I laugh while watching American comedies, I do not laugh. This film made me laugh, but only because of the very obvious attempts to simulate high budget high school movies. <br /> <br /> If you want a good independent American comedy with pot references, go watch Kevin Smith or Richard Linklater movies or something. Do not waste your time watching this movie. <br /> <br /> How to take these comments seriously, while most people complain that their characters do not smoke marijuana! <br /> <And by the way: in Norway, it's called "Dude, where's my pot"!
