It was a film based on the novel written by the modern literary god Koontz? I refuse to believe that this studio bought the rights to this film for all that bears the name of Genius, Koontz. Since my eyesight has become poor enough to require large print, I am unable to read this book because I have been reading it at least twice a year since it was first read. The book I missed a lot and I could not find it in large format. <br /> <br /> I was hoping that by renting this movie, I would at least have the pleasure of the vicarious supervisor, but this movie was a travesty. Due to subtle plot points, I am convinced that none of Mr. Koontz's books, nor the most honest writers, can be cluttered with one to two hours of film. <br /> <br /> It will be the wisest network, cable or otherwise, that buys the rights of this novel and makes a TV movie in several parts, that is to say a mini series, of this book as he must! <br /> <br /> one in five stars - could I go lower ...
