The film begins in Latvia just after the First World War. As a history teacher, I knew that multinational troops occupied a large part of Russia during this period. The spread of Bolshevism raised serious concerns and the troops were there to protect the interests of their country. However, they sometimes participated in missions or armed conflicts with the communist army, the nations concerned really want the so-called "whites" to prevail. However, the whites were deeply divided: some wanted the return of a tsar, others a republic and others in between. Due to these mixed objectives and the lack of real commitment of the foreign armies, the whole expedition was sentenced and left the USSR after a year or two only. However, I did not know that German troops were also involved. This surprised me because they had just lost the First World War and were not in a position to prepare such an expedition. <br /> <br /> This is the backdrop of the film, but it is also about a rich communist lady and his unhappy love for a childhood friend who is part of the German troops. She throws herself at him several times but in each case he pushes her away. Then, she then sublimates these desires by various affairs. Although no character of this sex is all this graphic, this and the underlying reason that does not interest him make this film a rather adult film and that I would not show to the younger audience. <br /> <br /> This film is interesting, the film as a whole is as gray and lifeless as everyone I've seen. I do not recommend it unless you are an incredibly patient person or if you really like overpriced German movies. I especially warn those who suffer from depression, because that will certainly make things worse. The simple fact is that there are so many better German films waiting to be seen - such as MOSTLY MARTHA, DAS BOOT, MOTHER KUSTERS, CANTES OF HEART, WINGS OF DESIRE or ALI, FEAR FEARS THE SOUL (among others) .
