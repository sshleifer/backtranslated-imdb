*** SPOILERS *** Hot and sexy Linda Blair in the role of witch Amelia Reynolds is very unhappy with her friend and rival Sorci√®re on the other side of the city, Erica Barens, Julie Strain. Amelia asks her husband Hal, Edward Albert, to get a promotion to his law firm Giger & Greengrass from Larry Barnes, the most deserving Larry Poindexter, who is married to Erica and has spelled a spell on her. Hal lose control of his car and end up almost killing himself. <br /> <br /> Larry discovering Erica's attempt on her best friend's life Larry must fight violently to knock her down and knock Erica off the balcony when she dies. It's when Larry finds his ex-wife Carol, Rochelle Sanson, that things start to heat up, emotionally and sexually. The nasty Amelia tries to make Erica's dead mind take hold of Carol's body and eventually murder Larry, whom she blames for the injury of her husband, Hal, who has left him confined permanently to a wheelchair. of a story but a lot of cheese and soft-core action with poor Larry being manipulated by Amelia through the resurrection of Erica who plans to kill him at the first opportunity, he turns his back on him. Amelia is a little surprised not to know exactly who is and who does not threaten her. Amelia even brings her poor and innocent gardener, Stan, Michael Parks, to first lose his family in a bloody burglary, then his mind, accused by the police of being the murderer, and finally his life, being smashed by Ameila herself. While he is forced to run into the Reynolds' house, under his control, as crazy as a hatter trying to murder him, she and the disabled Hal. <br /> <br /> Larry Parks was so weird that you felt like you had accidentally stepped on the set of "Sorceress" and ended up in the cast to play his role from Stan. Without the help or the benefits of a script, he improvised his way and slowly realized how horrible the movie was. Being killed at the beginning of the movie was a huge advantage for him since he did not have to suffer, like those of us who watch, through the whole brainless and numb film. <br /> <br /> It becomes obvious. for you as for the directors of "Sorceress" that all this shenanigan on the screen must come to an optimistic and successful conclusion and that a trick ends to end the film. The end is about the best thing, except for Miss Blair and the rest of the very well-endowed female cast, which can be said about the movie.
