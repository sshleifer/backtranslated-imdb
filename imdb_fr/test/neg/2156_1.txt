I love a good western movie, but it was more like watching a play or a show at the local street carnival. I could only stay for 38 minutes in the hope that it would improve, but it only worsened and I had to end it. Each actor has indicated the lines as if reading directly from the script or checklists. There was too much predictability in the lines and actions, not as if it were a natural event or a conversation. The wig on Rachel Kimsey was obvious. The actresses playing Amerindian sisters could have played non-native roles and should have done so. The wardrobe of the Amerindians could have been better and a little more authentic. If I decide to watch it with friends in the future, I will, not with the expectations of watching a good western, but with the expectations of watching an amateur comedy movie production.
