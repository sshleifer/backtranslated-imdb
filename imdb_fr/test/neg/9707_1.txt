If you've never heard of Jane Austen, seen the original 1995 BBC movie or adaptation, or even seen a pop-up version of the book, this ridiculous attempt to show off this classic love story can be considered loosely bearable. <br /> <br /> Since the beginning of the film, we have to remember this film for its terrible game, its abominable casting error and its total absence of the classic spirit of Jane Austen. <br /> <br /> One who has decided to call on actors (to the excellent Judi Dench) who has obviously never heard of Jane Austen, let alone read it, should to be punished! Keira Knightley grimaces and smiles through all the scenes, and has appeared so odious that no one would want to marry her! Darcy seemed to be trying to remember his words throughout the movie and the rest of Bennet's daughters were interchangeable in their lack of representation of their characters as originally written. <br /> <br /> This version failed to show. The pride and prejudices that Darcy and Elizabeth have suffered and, at the end of the two longest hours of my life, care about whether they have met or not! Absolutely abominable - even the very few minutes of Judi Dench can not save that garbage. I can not think of anything good to say about this movie, except that it's finally over!
