With the plethora of repetitive and derivative sitcoms superimposed on fall, summer, winter and spring, it's nice to see a show that stands out in more than one area. <br /> <br /> "Earl" takes an unusual approach. It's not about "everyday thoughts of an eccentric family" (zzzz ..), or other boring stuff you see everywhere in sitcoms. The show talks about this little white-eared thief (Earl) who scrapes a lottery card and scores a lot of time. At that moment, 'Karma' took it away from him. During overtime, he learns that this unusual incident is probably due to all the bad things he has done. So he goes on a mission to repair all the wrongs he has committed and he has all his exploits on paper. <br /> <br /> This is a brilliant premise for a sitcom. Fortunately, he landed in his right hand. The performance of the show produces extremely satisfying results: you get an innovative comedy that is truly funny and very touching many times. You can not help but fall in love with the sincerity and constancy of Earl, his simple mind, his good heart and observations of life, the wild and flamboyant personality of Joy and the moderate behavior and relaxing Darnell that really seduces him very easily. > <br /> When you combine the series' innovation with its authentic humor, good heart, interesting characters and well-written dialogue, you really have a guardian. With shows like this (and the incomparable "The Office"), NBC is obviously on something. Have they finally released a cabin or two for quality assurance? Let's hope so. And hope that other quality shows like these will be on the line-up; shows that will keep NBC viewers and executives crying over the bright days of NBC's golden age (Frasier, Seinfeld, Friends)
