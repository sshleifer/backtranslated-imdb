Filmmaker Bryan Forbes, who once had a sardonic touch with seductive material such as "Whistle Down the Wind" and the original "Stepford Wives", is completely out of date. Not only is his direction inept, but he has also mismanaged Sidney Sheldon's first novel; the results are atrocious. Roger Moore plays a psychiatrist accused of murdering one of his patients; Rod Steiger, singing the landscape, is a policeman under the collar (this is undoubtedly his most embarrassing performance). Elliott Gould is the only actor to have a certain life. He knows very well how to animate a banal scenario. Bland, jerky and cheap product. NO STARS of ****
