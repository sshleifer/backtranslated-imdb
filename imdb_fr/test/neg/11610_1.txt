In my local video rental store, they have a special place for Two Girls and a Guy. It's a long joke really. The clerk lets people rent it for free. They place too much importance on their customers to let them waste their hard-earned money. <br /> <br /> I was extremely surprised to see that people gave this film a good review. Maybe someone can explain it to me. (or maybe the positive comments were jokes, did the people involved in the film write them, maybe the director / writer's mother?) <br /> <br /> Maybe I'm coming to see so many good movies that this one fails in comparison.
