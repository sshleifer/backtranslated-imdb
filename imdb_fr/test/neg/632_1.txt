I did my best to watch this two-hour fiasco. He combined the appalling special effects and original "Blob" plot with an appalling reinforcement of the "Runaway Train" script (remarkable in the original). The only explanation for this film is that someone had to take a huge tax deduction and said he would combine it with a shot to organize a casting. What an incredible stinker! Lou Diamond Phillips is eager to show us why he will take any role, no matter how serious. Barry Corbin continues his career as a role player, as a US Senator from Texas, and plays it well. He should then play the lead role in the story of Trent Lott or Jesse Helms. The women in this film all seem to have won their role as a consolation prize in the Fay Wray Memorial Scream. The special effects are incredibly bad. H.S. children in movie class in North Dakota could have done a better job. The writers had to hold a hold-up at the bank of cliches to accumulate as much. I could not look without having to sit in the Orange Clockwork chair. I do not know how it ended, except, of course, 119 minutes too late. Ugh! Caveat emptor.
