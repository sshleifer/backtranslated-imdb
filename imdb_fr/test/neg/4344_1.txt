Normally, I would not even refrain from looking at rubbish like this, but as role playing is a hobby dear to me, and that was the subject of the movie, I did it. It was a trash in so many ways that I did not know where to start. I would rather attend the "Plan 9 from Outer Space" marathon than watch another minute of this vomit. At least Plan 9 did not have an agenda. How could the media capitulate and irresponsibly represent the extremist agenda when the facts go beyond me? This is a frightening time when a whole group of people can be criticized without ceremony, without defense or any actual fact presented. I know this comment became more social, but we could not do anything about it, as the movie asked. Imagine a pro-Nazi movie submitted to a criticism strictly based on the merit of the film. It will not arrive. Right now, the film's writers are fascists themselves and perhaps should be in a communist enclave where propaganda is accepted.
