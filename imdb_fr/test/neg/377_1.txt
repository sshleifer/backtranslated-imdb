Scenario really flatulent and Marc Singer disappointed me to have agreed to participate. <br /> <br /> In fact, I left the theater about 15 to 20 minutes and I claimed my money back. In fact, I only came out of a film three times in my life (I'm 43 years old) and it's the only one that made me crazy enough to claim the price of my ticket. If I could, I would have also received a refund for the popcorn. It was a really ugly film, and there is no excuse. <br /> <br /> On the one hand, how can someone who has been raised as a pre-tech barbarian learn to drive a car? In California!!!? (Driving a car is a somewhat tricky skill, and in California, even more delicate ... I should know it, I live there.)
