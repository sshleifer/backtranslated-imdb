Almost a master workshop on how not to direct a movie. From the misjudged and often incomprehensible scenario, Dr. Rey relies on a series of bad decisions that make the movie an excruciating viewing experience. Unfortunately, the film never goes beyond some sort of old-fashioned, almost misogynistic gay camp in which women are overworked, OTT and middle-aged and young men, vacant and looking for sex. The director was not able to set the tone of the film or the level of performance. <br /> <br /> There is certainly a lot of "play". Dianne Wiest slips into a pale imitation of her performance of Bullets Over Broadway and poor old Jane Birkin fails in her attempt to give a comedic performance. Although you have to complain because there is very little real comedy here. All of this sounds like a very profitable version of Merchant Ivory's Divorce which, to be quite honest, was not very good either.
