The only reason I rated this film at 2 is because Channing Tatum is beautiful, but the film as a whole lacks emotion and was boring to watch. I usually love a good romance but it was a waste of time, I did not shed a tear, even if it contained a sad content, but it had not been very well interpreted . I'm not a film critic, but I just advise girls to avoid that, unless the only reason you look at it is to see Channing Tatum lol. The rest of the movie is bad and if it was not in the movie was good) I would have stopped watching much faster. It's a shame because if the good actors had been chosen for this film, he could have had the potential to become a real tearer. .. If you are looking for a good cry or a movie for a girls' party ... drop this one !!
