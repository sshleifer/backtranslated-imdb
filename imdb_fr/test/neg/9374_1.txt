After some quite acceptable Dutch action films like Lek and Van God Los, Gerrard Verhage wants to make a film about the life of a Dutch gangster. Well, the gangster is a big word for Klaas Bruinsma. He's not a big international guy like George Jung (Blow) or Pablo Escobar. He is just a lowlife of Amsterdam who has made money selling soft drugs. In the Netherlands, things often explode and this film is just another example. But even in this case, the movie could be very nice if the story was told correctly. Now, there are important jumps in time: one day, Klaas is a drug addict, the next shot, he seems to be a major player in the drug scene. Nobody knows how this is possible (with the exception of those who read the book). The acting is really bad, non-Dutch moviegoers can see one of the worst actresses in the Netherlands: Chantal Janzen. When you think she's finally naked, then you look at a model booth. So: bad game + bad editing + shit story = De Dominee. <br /> <br /> Do not look at it, even if others say it's good, because it's not. I warned you.
