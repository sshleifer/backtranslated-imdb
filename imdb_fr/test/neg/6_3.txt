The British playwright Ronald Harwood adapts his autobiographical drama on the stage to a screaming film about the Shakespearian theatrical troupe of the Second World War, thirsty for an old star agitated, bright, brilliant but unreliable. The actor's assistant works diligently to have his master dressed and dressed for a production of "King Lear" (during an air raid!), But the two men are losing their grip on their difficult situation. Based on the last years of actor Donald Wolfit, wearing Ronald Harwood, this acclaimed production would seem to be a haven for landscape lovers. Unfortunately, Albert Finney (at this stage of his career, not at all old) seems too robust and too fast to play the role of the actor; Finney (and Oscar-nominated director Peter Yates) can not modulate Sir's mood and his episodes of coherence in a way that makes sense to us, so in a scene he stops a train with the echoing his voice and in the next, he's curiously falling apart. With such a human being losing his health and abilities, one might assume that a dedicated assistant would do everything possible to protect his boss (and his future), but the servant Tom Courtenay pushes, as well as the badger and the the sting that Finney bears on rather than rest. Courtenay, who played this role on stage (and was nominated for an Oscar alongside Finney in the Best Actor category), is much more sensitive to his role and, finally, his gaping orders and his confusion achieve the only real feeling of the film. Fortunately, these two are not pecking their heads, and the screenwriter Harwood makes sure not to fall into a scheme of love-hate (which could possibly be perceived in the first act of the film); but, without juxtaposition of servant and celebrity, this portrait has little to see, except the deterioration of narcissism, the suspicion of what was once. * 1/2 of ****
