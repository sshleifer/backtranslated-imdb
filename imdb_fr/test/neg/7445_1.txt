I really do not understand who this film is for. By its absurdity, not to mention its ridiculously bad game, its nerdy dialogue, and the fact that the bad guy is a kid, I guess this movie was supposed to be a children's movie ... but I think there might be to have more swear words like Pulp Fiction, not to mention the constant references to drugs and general chaos and the massacre, so which demographic group is trying to please? This film is too schizophrenic, as if we were trying to combine country music with heavy metal, in the end, nobody would like it because it is a bloody paradox. I would recommend this film because it's so funny (in a bad way), except that the actors are so obviously unbearable that I do not want to suggest otherwise. <br /> <br /> I am completely serious when I say that I could not watch more than 15 minutes of that. Terrrrrrrrrrrrrrrriiiiiiiiiiiiible
