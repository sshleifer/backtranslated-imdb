If we returned to the dawn of the discussion, we predicted a bright future for Harold Lloyd. Unlike his competitors, he was a comedic actor trained on the legitimate stage and not interpreted in the purgatory of the music hall or vaudeville circuit. He had a good voice that matched his image. Moreover, from 1924, his "dumb" films incorporated sequences based on sound gags lost to the audience (for example, THE FRESHMAN's sequence of the Fall Frolic bell and THE KID BROTHER's monkey sequence). . Yet, Lloyd's sound features have consistently failed at the box office once the novelty of WELCOME DANGER was gone. Lloyd attributed his downfall to many external sources, but never realized that the enemy of Glass's character was unhealthy but the Great Depression. The public of the Pre-Depression, full of optimism, may have rooted in this ambitious public in which they saw their surrogate mother; The depressed public despised him as the person who could seize his mortgage and throw it into the gutter. Lloyd's perception as a man of sincere joy further exacerbates this problem of character choice. Sincerity, of course, is a subjective assessment, but it is undeniable that Lloyd, despite his own tragic education, could never play a convincing role. This may be because he was afraid to return to this state permanently. The CAT'S-PAW fails for these reasons, but it suffers on its own from the revelation of Lloyd's pro-fascist agenda. Many film specialists believe that Lloyd was prompted to make this film because he considered the FDR presidency to be a dictatorship aimed at soaking the rich and unscrupulous in the face of crime. We should remember that he was not alone in this feeling. DeMille had made THIS JOURNAL, a pro-police State drama, the year before. We should also remember that America was founded by fierce tax protesters and continues to be motivated by those who want something without paying anything. TCP suffered because he treated fascism lightly in a "comedy" and his release was particularly untimely given the events in Germany that year. The 1934 Production Code would ultimately limit the glorification of the justice of the vigilantes and reaffirm the constitutional rule of law, however cumbersome it may be. The ideal of the benevolent despot, the all-powerful and well-intentioned ruler who creates a utopia once freed from the checks and balances of this omnipotence, goes back to classical antiquity. For this reason, totalitarian regimes fear laughter even if it acts as a safety valve. Ironically, the mere existence of TCP, a film that demonises the home country's democratic experience, shows that FDR America was safe enough to accept criticism. We do not see parallel criticism in Hitler's Germany, Stalin's USSR, or Mussolini's Italy. But can we laugh at the gallows of humor of fascism waiting? Lloyd's unpretentious film is skewed to the right and might have been written by Dr. Goebbels himself if he had a sense of humor, of course. It poses an alternative story in which an elected one reestablishes order and loses honor by all necessary means, and does so with kindness and amusement. The imminent fascism approached by the left is, of course, THE GREAT DICTATOR of Chaplin. This latest film has the advantage of being shot in another country and based on a character and barely veiled events. THE GREAT DICTATOR produces few laughs today because he underestimated the scale of human evil, but he succeeds in spite of his naive and inappropriate language, because he has the distinct advantage of being justified by history. Lloyd, however, should be credited with two things: first, he did not shoot pro-fascist films or produce hypocritically pro-allied films during the war; secondly, he never sold TCP on television. The post-1945 world had seen fascism and it was not fun.
