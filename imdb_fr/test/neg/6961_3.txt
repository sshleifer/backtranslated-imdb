In order to describe what is really wrong with this movie, it must contain some * spoilers *, so if you are going to see it and you expect to be surprised, do not read this! <br /> <br /> I liked everything. about this film except the plot; and in a thriller as this credible plot is essential. It's played well, even if it moves a little slowly, and the work of the camera and the scenes of Portland are exquisite for an unpretentious and low budget picture. The dialogue is very good. <br /> <br /> Mason is a young retiree who works in a telemarketing business and sells insurance. His high school friend, Berkeley, is his employer and treats him like a brother, despite the fact that Mason is obviously mentally ill. Mason has nightmares that cause him to gasp and look for his inhaler. His visions and nightmares suggest that he has had serious problems with pretty women in his past, and the film seems to suggest that he may be a serial killer of women. He meets a pretty, charming girl named Amber and draws it in her notebook. She takes a liking to him and poses for him so that he can paint his portrait. He sees her more and begins to wake up from her withdrawn state, becoming almost half human. So something is wrong. Amber finds sketchbooks with drawings of other girls and begins to marvel. She starts to be scared and goes away. We wonder if his sudden coldness will push him to the end. His behavior becomes more erratic. <br /> <br /> This is the configuration for revelation. In order to explain how this film goes terribly wrong, I have to explain what is happening. * Another spoiler warning! * For this plot to work, we are convinced that Amber, a very sociable young girl, will be looking for a young man who is seriously emotionally disturbed and who, at least at the beginning of their friendship, has a blank stare. can speak only in monosyllables or do not speak at all. It is well beyond the nerd, it appears at the limit of total catatonia. Yes, I know, girls can be attracted to all sorts of crazies, but usually of the Charles Manson type or punk-rockers, types with some kind of demonic energy. Mason is practically a zombie, he is hardly there. Every happy young thing would cross the street to avoid it. It's just amazing that this girl is attracted to him. Moreover, Berkeley has no credible reason to indulge in Mad Mason, it is not credible either. <br /> <br /> But wait, there is a revelation. Amber does not show up at Berkeley for the Christmas dinner where Mason is waiting for her, and Berkeley, his old friend, must tell him that Amber and all his other old friends, the ones he has drawn in his many sketchbooks, do not exist everything! She and all the others are only products of her twisted imagination: he imagined them. <br /> <br /> Well, that explains why a normal, cute amber would choose Mason, it's just a product of his imagination. It could have been the final revelation of the film with the proper preparation and setup, but alas, that's not the case. At this point, Mason returns to his apartment and finds Amber there. He is enraged, he kills her. But now we have been made to understand that Ambre was actually real, not Mason's imaginary girlfriend. <br /> <br /> Finally, after receiving proof that Amber actually exists and that Mason killed him, Berkeley must admit that he was wrong, that he misjudged Mason. It would work if Mason had been half sane from the beginning, but because the public still suspected him of being totally upset and perhaps a murderer of women, that does not surprise us. We suspected what he was from the beginning and we do not understand why Berkeley could not see him. But we are wondering again: if it were real, why Amber would be attracted by the catatonic mason? <br /> <br /> To worsen the end, we were never asked whether all of Mason's other girlfriends, the sketchbooks, were real or if Amber was the first true? And if the others were real, did he kill them too? What did he do with the bodies? <br /> <br /> The problem is that filmmakers did not know what to do with this material. Maybe there was a way to right the situation and tell a credible story of suspense, but this film is not that.
