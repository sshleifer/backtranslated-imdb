I saw "Caddyshack II" when I was ten years old and I mostly laughed because of the horse scene. I should have realized that the movie was as empty as ... I can not make a good comparison. It's stupid and not even really funny. The original cast members who chose not to play this role probably made the best choice they ever made to reject this project. why, oh why did Chevy Chase come back ?! And how did Jackie Mason, Robert Stack, Dyan Cannon and Dan Aykroyd get involved in this swill ?! I bet every person whose name has even been remotely attached to this junk (for example, the caterer) is ashamed of being unable to be redeemed. So, overall, it's terrible, terrible and everything else. Avoid it as the Ebola virus would do.
