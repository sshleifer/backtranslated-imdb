I was pleasantly satisfied with the end. I just saw this movie yesterday and I was going to turn it off, but I changed my mind. It was not at all the direction I thought the story would end. That's about all I can say positive about this movie. All actors are nobodys, especially the lead role. Although she is an attractive young woman, she will never be able to conquer her. The writing, staging and acting are woody, much like what you would see a soap opera day. The filming locations were very adept at making you think that it could be anywhere, instead of blatantly revealing it in Canada. Since this film was shot entirely in Canada, I guess the whole thing was made up of Canadians, which is not totally bad, because some of the recent Canadian television productions: "Cold Squad", "Stone, Underover" are all quite successful.
