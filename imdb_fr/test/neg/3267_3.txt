When I first saw this movie, I did not know its title. I realized there was Chevy Chase with the same name as Caddyshack, so I got the idea that it was Caddyshack 2. At the end of the movie, when I discovered that it was was Caddyshack 2, I was disappointed. They could have done better. Dan Akroyd, I thought it was bad. The whole story was bad. Call this movie with another title, but do not call it Caddyshack 2. You give this great movie a bad name. Jackie Mason's daughter, when I saw her for the first time, looked like his wife. how old is this girl? Geez. Why not make this film a bit credible? I thought Chevy Chase was good.
