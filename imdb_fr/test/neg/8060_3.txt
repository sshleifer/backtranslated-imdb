The first thing I notice is music. It's not as surprising as Ruggero Deodato's captivating Cannibal Holocaust theme or A Tale of Two Sisters masterpiece waltz, but I do not let that stop me so early in the film. <br /> <br /> It must be assumed that the woman seeking her doctoral thesis hypothesis that cannibalism as an organized practice never existed, one might think that they must take into consideration the fact that they are wrong and prepare accordingly, are not they? Or why go at all if you already believe that the hypothesis is true even before being tested? It's incredibly ignorant and gives the movie a much more unrealistic and badly written look. <br /> <br /> It actually looks like Ruggero Deodato's movie, but it's totally unprepared. No guns, no decent hiking gear, just end-to-end nonsense. <br /> <br /> People do not make such trips to a college without months of planning and preparation. <br /> <br /> But I digress ... <br /> <br /> The courageous but stupid adventurers do not embark to miss a jaywalking iguana and their pet ferret almost falls in the truck C is death, then falling into a mud hole, well, I guess it's time to walk. <br /> <br /> Okay, they throw a coin to see if they continue or not. How does this scene make sense? All their conviction is based on a coin? Afterwards, they had to spend time, money and preparation. It only gets worse. Among the worst actors, writers and musicians ever concocted for the film industry. <br /> <br /> Mike explains how he and his friend were captured by cannibals and caged in mud pits with leeches 3 inches long. suck their blood. I found it interesting because if you remember the first cannibal they encounter in the jungle, a man they consider a simple native is sitting on the ground eating such leeches ... ask yourself if they are the same? Really if this movie is just terrible because the script is horrible and the acting is emotionless given the content. They simply agree to be eaten by cannibals, as if it was not a big decision. <br /> <br /> Obviously, Mike is crazy, but as in the first film, they treat the natives with such terrible behavior that it's just unrealistic. <br /> <br /> Ruggero Deodato's film easily senses that the Americans have what they deserve, while it is hard to blame the natives for what has happened to them. <br /> <br /> And because of that the movie seems a little useless. We already understood the point of the first film, so why was the sequel created? The lieutenant's name is Rizzo ?! Could it get worse? Often with movies like these, when we look at the actors, we realize that they have not really played in other films and that their biography is almost nonexistent, so you can imagine that I was surprised to find Giovanni Lombardo Radice in this movie that was in the New York gang of Scorsese. Now, Lieutenant Rizzo looked familiar and I discovered he was featured in the 2002 Spiderman movie as a very small role as a tug captain. It reminds me of how William Shatner went from the admiral of the USS Enterprise to a policeman in a car. Irony, sometimes irony works. Shatner never managed to get the music until his recent album "Has Been", which is really good, just like U2's Bono never managed to get a haircut, and Dan Marino did never won any Super Bowl. <br /> <br /> Sometimes the irony is just sad, like Christopher Reeve, Superman can not walk the irony. The man will always be a legend, because he's a great guy, but I'm moving away from my digression once again. <br /> <br /> At this point, you can say I'm pretty bored of talking about Cannibal Ferox. <Br /> <br /> Cannibal Holocaust's message was who are the real savages and what is really evil? What do the savages do in a natural life unknown to our moral archives or which we do to others with malicious intent? Cannibal Ferox's message seems to be: "Pay attention to what you are looking for, you might find it." I will say this for Cannibal Ferox. When Gloria returns and writes her thesis saying that cannibalism does not exist, she saves the others who would be curious and go where the angels are afraid to walk, but overall, this movie was really bad. <br /> <br /> *** / ten
