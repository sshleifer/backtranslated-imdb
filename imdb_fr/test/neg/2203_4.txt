Designed and published at a time when the Internet was just starting to get huge, it's a scenario Hitchcock would have liked. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Hitchcock was not there to do this and we still have suspense thriller but mostly stupid thriller, which is held (barely) together by Bullock's intelligence. <br /> <br /> It was released in 1995 but it is old-fashioned, and you have to believe in the number and you do not even need to be a dot.com person to spot them!
