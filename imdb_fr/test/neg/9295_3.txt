**** Contains Spoilers **** <br /> <br /> As a fan of Rachael Leigh Cook, I've made sure this show comes at last so I can see it. I filmed it to be able to watch it several times and there is something in this show that really bothers me! <br /> <br /> I recognize that it was a film specially designed for television. Not only that, but this has been done for Lifetime, which is a channel I despise. Because it was made for television, I can ignore the huge holes in the plot. I can ignore the massive lack of character development at Ally Sheedy. I can forget that George C. Scott and Rachael Leigh Cook, two very talented actors, certainly did not reach the maximum of their abilities. I can override the fact that Don Diamont's character was so cliche that you knew, seeing him, that he was the bad guy. I can even skip the obvious mistake in the timeline (she was raped during her winter vacation, and then over a year later, she has the baby.) <br /> <br /> The main thing I can not understand over is this: There are two lawsuits for the custody of the child. In the first trial, custody is awarded to the child's father because he is "better educated, has a community college diploma and has a full-time job". In the second trial, the judgment is quashed because the judge finds that there is insufficient evidence to prove that Emma (the RLC character) is an unfit mother, and custody should not be left to the guardian. the principal and entrusted to a person without prior interaction with the child. <br /> <br /> The problem is this: Nowhere in these trials is the fact that a 30-year-old man raped a 15-year-old girl and put her into consideration! Whether it was a rape or not, he had sex with a minor! Would that not be taken into account when the judge chooses him for custody because he is a "mature adult"? Mature adults do not have sex with minors! <br /> <br /> This is not the worst movie on cable you can see, but it's not a big show either. ** out of ****
