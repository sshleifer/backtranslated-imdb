This French film is supposed to be about a terrifying, weak-minded cop who investigates the rape and murder of a young girl in a small town. However, the film does not really talk about anything and it takes forever to say nothing. If it takes ten minutes for a character to get from point A to point B, the film spends ten minutes on the presentation of this walk. These are the "action" scenes. There are also static images that last for minutes, which causes the viewer to wonder if he accidentally pressed the pause button on the remote control. The script contains enough material for a 20-minute movie. The film lasts about seven hours. You do the math. The actors were apparently amateurs and it shows. Personal note: never again see a Dumont movie.
