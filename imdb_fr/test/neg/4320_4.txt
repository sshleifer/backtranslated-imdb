This film is viewable, but nothing special. During a car trip to Las Vegas, four girls stupidly decide to take a hitchhiker (because he is cute). They all end up spending the night in a motel in the middle of nowhere and the psychotic problems of the hitchhiker with the women become obvious. <br /> <br /> The characters are clich√©s - there is a married and responsible woman; a slut party girl; an uncertain future bride; and a man who hates who has just been dumped. The hitchhiker is really nice until he goes crazy. <br /> <br /> There is not enough gore and far too much rape. I really like the horror movies / thriller slasher, and this one did not do anything for me. The end was as sordid as the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, the actors did a great job with which they had to work. The dialogue is not awful, and overall, I was impressed by the casting, I had never seen or heard of it. And the plot was not irrelevant (although I really doubt that a woman of our time can use a hitchhiker - as attractive as it is), so I did not moan at all. meaning. <br /> <br /> Overall, "The hitchhiker" was well played and made sense, but it was not very interesting. There are many better movies of the kind that I would recommend ("Rest Stop", "The Devil's Rejects", "Texas Chainsaw Massacre", or "The Hitcher", redo). Do yourself a favor and ignore it unless you have other options.
