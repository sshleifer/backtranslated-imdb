If you watched Pulp Fiction, do not see this movie. This movie is not funny. It's the worst parody movie of all time. It's a bad attempt at parody movies. <br /> <br /> The casting is bad. The film is bad. It's one of the worst images of my life. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend Plump Fiction. I prefer the original Pulp Fiction of the great Quentin Tarantino. This is one of the worst parodic movies ever made. <br /> <br /> Plump Fiction is not a good movie. It's not funny It's so stupid and vulgar.
