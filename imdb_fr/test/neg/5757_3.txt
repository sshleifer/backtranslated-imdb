John Carl Buechler, director and director of foreign exchange operations, must do little to terrify me; The sight of his name in the credits alone is enough to sow fear in my heart. <br /> <br /> His dismal video output in the 80s was based on the last shelf of the horror section of my local shop rental; Twenty years later, his DVDs occupy the same space. It seems that the more things change, the more they stay the same. You can count on the old JCB to serve you, no matter what the format and whatever the progress of filmmaking technology. <br /> <br /> In this despicable offer, many friends travel to a remote town where they discover hidden treasure of Jeremiah Stone, aka the forty-ninth - a maleficent, cannibalistic miner who wreaks havoc, who has wreaked havoc in the mid-1800s. Before his death, Jeremiah cursed anyone who had to find his gold and the armed killer of the pick was back, repelling the unfortunate treasure hunters. <br /> <br /> With his formidable script, his makeup unimpressive. Scooby-Doo's evil effects and style, "The Curse of the Forty-Niner" is comparable to the race for Buechler. Only Keren Black, Richard Lynch and John Phillip Law, leaders of the genre, give credibility to this film. /> <br /> Even fans of the terrible horror schlocks will be disappointed, because most women undress and many deaths occur off-screen (which is probably not such a bad thing since the deaths at screen are pathetic). <br /> <br /> "The Forty-Niner Curse" is another long list of John Carl's failures.
