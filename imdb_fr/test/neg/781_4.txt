It's a cop that you can safely avoid. Childish plot and Cameron's bad acting (she really should not take on these serious roles - they do not suit her). In addition, she looks very unglamorous, let's admit it, she is great in Charlies Angels and she was superb in There Something Mary ... The pope would not be a good president of the United States and vice versa , some actors / actresses are adapted to a particular type of character and Cameron is the least suited to this type of serious housewife - there are a dozen other actresses who would have done a much better job. The film itself is rather incredible and juvenile in its plot (did I spell Juvinile on the right?) I noticed a comment from another critic who attributed The Box a score of 10, which was mocking in his comments on other critics who attributed a value to the film. 1 or 2 notes and could not spell. I mean what the spelling has to do with a movie review? Does he mean that people who spell perfectly could appreciate this film more than those who could not? Go professor.
