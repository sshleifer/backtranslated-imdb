As you can see from the other comments, this film is about the worst film ever made. Let me see how many different words I can use to describe it: boring, unbearable, laughable, ugly, stupid, horrible ..... <br /> <br /> I could go on with such descriptions but you will probably point. <br /> <br /> I would have given him a 0, if possible - bad action, bad direction, bad production, bad scenario. <br /> <br /> This was done in 2001 and it looks more like 1965. Very small budget, boring plot, horrible game, really bad special effects, etc ... <br /> < I rarely see a sci-fi movie, I absolutely think it's also bad. I mean they are pure garbage. It has nothing. With regard to a "film B", it is the bottom of the lot. <br /> <br /> I think I'd be more amused watching a blank piece of paper for 90 minutes. Junk like this gives a bad name to low budget "B" movies. This gives a nice appearance to Ed Wood movies. <br /> <br /> Watching live movies is as follows: just when you think you've seen the worst, you're even worse! <br /> <DJ Perry is a horrible actor and has no individual characteristics that sets him apart from others. <br /> <br /> Avoid this waste at all costs! Oh humanity!
