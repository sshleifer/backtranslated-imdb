If Daphne Du Maurier had installed REBECCA in the 1950s in San Francisco, it could well be that it looks like Robert Wise's very unusual black. Valentina Cortese plays a survivor from a concentration camp who steals the identity of a dead woman and insinuates herself into the life of Richard Basehart (who happens to be also the guardian of the dead woman's son) ... c is absurd and disproportionate, but also topflight entertainment. Cortese is great, she slowly falls apart when she realizes the mistake she made. Basehart is fine if it's a little bland ... although lighting towards the end makes it look very menacing. Fay Baker is a very good janitor of Mrs. Danvers. Wise is a good director and keeps things moving quickly. It also stages a car accident now classic and uncontrollable with Cortese (or at least a cascade Cortese) driving.
