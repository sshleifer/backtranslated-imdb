This movie is an excellent film ONLY if you need something to sit on and laugh at the stupidity of it. As a geologist, this film deduces most of the important facts and uses actors too young to be considered as true summits. It is interesting to see how this shows lava splashing in gigantic caverns below the surface of the Earth. It is also amusing to see the massive destruction caused by a magnitude 6.5 earthquake in active seismic zones. They seem to forget that building standards in these areas would be higher and that a larger earthquake would be needed to do so much damage. Also, it's fun to see how the coast of Washington state and Oregon feel like beautiful beaches in southern California. The analogy of Jelly Donut is very amusing, even if the way it is used is wrong. The director did a good job adding more comic relief with the 2 doctorates "supported".
