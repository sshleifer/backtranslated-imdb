The drawings show that ants are able to carry chicken legs, watermelons, people, etc. This may be an admirable feature as the ants make the Phase IV film. It's not because they want it, but because they have to. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a narrator mysteriously explaining that a cosmic event has occurred on the earth and that a fellow scientist is working on the effect this disturbance has on the ant population. The film is divided into segments; the first part after the cosmic event corresponds to phase I, and so on until the end of the film, which corresponds to phase IV. <br /> <br /> What is phase IV? Who knows? We do not see this part; this is probably related to one of the scientists who study ants and a girl who lived in the area. The girl, who looks like a cross between Alicia Silverstone and Liv Tyler, is angry at the ants because they killed her horse, but with the exception of an explosion of anger, goes around the biodome with a blank stare ( "Clueless"?). <BR/> <br /> These ants are very intelligent; or scientists are pretty stupid. I will give ants credit. Why? Anything that usually spoils my picnics, which can then build reflective towers, blow up trucks and adapt to poison with the utmost ease, gets my vote for being the smartest species, at least in this movie. <br /> <br /> Sterno says to trample this anthill. <br /> <br />
