Almost everything Stephen King wrote seems to have been turned into a movie or television series; In fact, I'm surprised no one has tried to make a mini-series from the guy's grocery list. Let's face it. If they did, it could not be less interesting than Children of the Corn. <br /> <br /> According to one of the many news from King, this 1984 horror movie sees Linda Hamilton and Peter Horton play a couple on a long car trip that runs up against a point boring when he falls on the sleepy town of Gatlin, Nebraska, where all adults have been murdered by children who worship an ancient evil hiding in the cornfields. <br /> <br /> Although the director Fritz Kiersch manages to create a good atmosphere at the beginning (after Hamilton's idiotic song and dance, but before we have the opportunity to meet the monster Isaac, the head of assassins), he loses it completely with innumerable scenes without history in which Hamilton and Horton are hunted down by the homicidal half-pints of the city. Courtney Gains, as a violent red-haired Malachai, manages to seem truly threatening, but the rest of the children are not at all threatening; As a result, many "scary" moments in the movie do not work. <br /> <br /> Towards the end of the film, when we finally discover the malevolent force that inhabits the surrounding Gatlin field, the film plunges into a glut of frightening visual effects from the 80s that probably looked pretty ropey almost 25 years old It's true that corn kids might interest King fans who want to see how the writer's work has been translated to the big screen, but your average horror movie fan is the most impressed.
