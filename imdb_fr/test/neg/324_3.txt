On Halloween, three friends seek fun in an old suburban cemetery and remove a cross from a grave where Jack-O was buried many years ago by farmer Arthur Kelly. The evil creature is unleashed, kills the trio and seeks the revenge of the descendants of the Kelly family. <br /> <br /> The "Jack-O" cheese is a combination of a dreadful story and a terrible act. I was curious to see the name of John Carradine in the credits and I can not imagine how a parent allows the use of archival footage in such a bad movie, showing a total lack of respect for the name of that film. great actor. It's awesome to see how bad the game is, change the movie to a comedy instead of the kind of horror proposed. This is the kind of movie to do with a group of friends, drinking beer, commenting and laughing a lot. My vote is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Jack-O" Dem√¥nio do Halloween "(" Jack-O "Demon of Halloween")
