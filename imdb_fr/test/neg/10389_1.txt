Even worse, the incredibly boring "Emily Rose's Exorcism". It started decently, and until the mother said to the father, "I knew she was possessed," I told you. It was a terrible sentence, badly spoken and which foreshadowed the fast end of this incredibly bad movie. Every family member has a past problem with the priest. The father begins to accuse everyone of loving his wife, or having an affair with her, until he kills his boyfriend, then himself in the obvious moment of lucidity after realizing that his friend had not slept with his wife. People are dying, the others are in possession of the ball, and at this point most viewers do not care. With the exception of their employee Miguel, none of the characters in this movie were really friendly, making it hard to care about them. The game was terrible and the writing was even worse. I'm glad I saw him for free. Although I think that for such a bad movie, someone owes me money for the time I lost.
