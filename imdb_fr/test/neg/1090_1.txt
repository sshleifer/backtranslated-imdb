Too bad about the good / bad ... this movie officially became the worst "movie of TV movie" of my book ... except for the value of the camp that it offers, I give it a 1 in quality and a 10 for the camp value. Suggestion: Look with friends, champagne and lots of popcorn ... you'll want to throw some on the screen! Preferably, friends who love Chris Noth at the time of "Sex in the City" ... this movie is terribly funny. This is definitely the lowest point of the career of all the members of the cast ... Honestly, I do not know how they controlled laughter when the lines were delivered! Daniel J. Travanti is absolutely pathetic. Everyone participated in the school of sur-actor; and poor Joan Van Ark, I think she was the only one to take this theater of the absurd seriously ... she is nevertheless considered a producer. His jeans "Mom" and his bad plastic surgery are thieves. This film also crosses the delicate line of social disadvantage when introducing a character struggling with mental problems in the plot. This is an obscure movie released on the Lifetime site and listed under the title {With Harmful Intent}. Did someone else have the pleasure?
