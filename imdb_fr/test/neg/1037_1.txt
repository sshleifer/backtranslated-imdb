Unless you want to see 2 hours of picturesque mountain sequences featuring hysterical characters, many histrionics and cheap 70s, I would recommend avoiding this movie. He is long, elongated and gives off a rather annoying feeling of amateurishness. Masterpiece? No, an average thriller, shot in a medium way, in a beautiful Italian landscape. <br /> <br /> I am a big fan of slow movies of 1970, when there is a plot to delight you and entertain you. In this case, it did not work for me. The plot is banal, interspersed with superficial and stereotypical characters, supported by angry hilarious crowds and your typical Italian widow dressed in black, sobbing. <br /> <br /> If you do not know and do not know the Italian countryside, the film may be worth the detour, the scenery itself being spectacular and breathtaking. This film is not extraordinary, however, there are much better Italian horror movies than this one. Not much more than a yawning party. 5/10
