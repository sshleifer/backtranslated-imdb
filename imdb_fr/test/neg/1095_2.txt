Mel (Ethan Hunt), the main character of this sex-filled sex swarm, repeatedly notes: "She deserves better than that!" The "she" he's talking about is Ginger, played by the beautiful Brandy Davis, who deserves better than that. Brandy deserves better than this film, its lame scenario and its pervert Mel. A guy who sees his dream girl making love with another man, even in a virtual world, does not deserve it at all. An A- for simulated sex scenes, an F for the script.
