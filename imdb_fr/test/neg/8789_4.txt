By the mid-1990s, the career of animator-director Don Bluth seemed to have reached its lowest level ever. Previously, Bluth had directed a series of popular animated films, many of which have remained popular, such as "The Land Before Time" (1988), "The Secret of NIMH" (1982) and "An American Tail" (1986) . But from "Thumbelina" in 1994, his films seemed to be losing more and more in quality and popularity, and one of the many unfortunate entries was the box office bomb of 1995, "The Pebble and the Penguin", a film that did not attract spectators. beyond parents and children under seven. Frankly, these are the only members of the public that I can understand by taking pleasure in this feature film rather bland. <br /> <br /> The story is absurd. The film features a mischievous, stammering, chubby penguin named Hubie (voiced by Martin Short), who falls in love with a penguin with a surprisingly healthy flower on his head (voice of Annie Golden). As in real life, penguins present their wife with a pebble as a substitute for a ring. But when Hubie is swept away by the current, he teams up with a lonely rockhopper (James Belushi) who dreams of flying and struggles against time to return to Antarctica before it's too late. The reason they might arrive too late is one of the many underdeveloped elements of this weak story that would remain weak even though they were there. <br /> <br /> It becomes very early very clear why the animated children's musical will not and will not work for someone older than six or seven years old. He simply does not have any of the qualities required for a good animated film. First, the film looks bad because of a very poor design style. The animation of this film is very cartoonistic (even in animated films); it is dark, lugubrious, colors do not vibrate and, in addition, the drawing of the film and the elements it contains are universally ridiculous and derisory. Take, for example, the penguins who play the main role in the film. With a few exceptions, each penguin does not look like a bird at all. Hubie, for example, looks ridiculously ridiculous, with wide cheeks, a stocky beak, big eyes and that sordid hat that he wears everywhere he goes. Combined with his hand-shaped "palms", he looks like Chris Farley in a penguin costume. Result: he is an ugly cartoon character and poorly drawn. But the most absurd and absurd-looking character is the demonic penguin Drake, who does not really look like a penguin. He is a man-muscle wearing a penguin mask. It has a larger chest than Arnold Schwarzenegger's and larger teeth than leopard seals and killer whales that serve as predators for the film. Basically, he is a two-dimensional recycled villain. He lives in a skull-shaped cave, wears a cape, laughs a lot, and gets upset when people laugh with him. The result: we do not care And what is also bad, and maybe worse, is that it's a lively musical and there is not a single remarkable or memorable song to be found anywhere in the class of its duration. The opening anthem was harmless? Not memorable, but harmless. But after that, the songs became more and more boring and there was one in particular that made me wince all the way through. This is the moment when viewers press the fast forward button each time they get up. <br /> <br /> I felt that "The Pebble and the Penguin" was lame, except for a few moments when Hubie and the jumping penguin Les Rocko are jeopardized by the jaws of leopard seals and orcas , which fortunately have not been discussed and treated as animals rather than as cartoon characters. But in a way, for this reason, I can not recommend this film to children too much. That's the reason. The movie shows killer whales are the natural predator of penguins. I fear that children familiar with "Free Willy" (1993) will be shocked or discouraged to see their favorite inhabitant of the sea portrayed as a bloodthirsty carnivore. The leopard seal was a better antagonist and it was funnier to see how his jaws opened wider than those of a rattlesnake and how he seemed to grin while grunting. But the point is really, these moments with predators - and there are only a few - are the only interesting moments. And they are not extremely interesting, notice. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I can not recommend it to anyone under seven. My advice: if you have children around this page, rent it for them. They could enjoy it.
