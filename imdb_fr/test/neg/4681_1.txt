Andy Milligan, the independent New York filmmaker, makes this little "treat" as his version of the legend of Sweeney Todd. Sweeney cuts the throats of customers in her hair salon and her cohort, Mrs. Lovett, turns them into meat pies. Fortunately, I was well informed of the plot before seeing this travesti film. Milligan, for my money, must indeed run in front of the worst directors of the race of all time. Ed Wood looks like Orson Welles in comparison. This film is so bad in many ways. Let's take Milligan to start. The quality of the film is granular. The sound quality is granular. Many scenes give the impression that Milligan used a camcorder to film. The credits say "Photograped and directed by Andy Milligan". He wants to take credit for the ceilings that appear after a death scene? What about the atrocious musical score selected for the movie? The film cuts with a poor transition after another. Little logic is used in creating the plot. The story has little to do with the legend of Todd. The scenes of murder are numerous but are not horrible. The hands, legs and other appendages are cut using the technique in which the editing was done: in a restless manner! And let's take the breast in the pie scene. Yes, it's in. The pastry cook did not know that a whole breast with a nipple filled an entire pie crust? Later, our characters tell us that they "took care not to get caught" for the 200 murders they committed. Obviously, these are just a few breasts that can not keep up with what's going on (sorry, it was too tempting). The actors are not too bad to be honest. Some even have glimmers of talent, and all seem to be real articles in English. Many non-erotic nude scenes are forced. Milligan apparently has problems with sex. The strands of the plot are left unbound. The end is almost unassailable because of poor camera work. I could go on and on. Did I like something in the movie? Not much to say. I have a high level of acceptance for films of this kind in terms of small budgets and marginal talent, but this film has no other purpose than to be brutal and sick.
