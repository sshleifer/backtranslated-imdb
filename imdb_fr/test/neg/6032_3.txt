Very clich√©. Totally cheesy. Acting becomes more and more difficult as the show continues. Do not believe what people say about the "realism" that this movie is supposed to portray. It's just a shoot'em up. It is interesting to note that VCs that besiege the base have a human face and are not portrayed as evil incarnates.
