A ditzy girl (yes, ditzy is about as complex as her character gets it) will not take no for an answer and will do odd things to get her husband back. It's too exaggerated to be credible with such fragile characters who follow the movements. But not enough far-fetched to be fascinating in the way that was written: Being John Malkovich. So it ends up being boring. <br /> <br /> sv
