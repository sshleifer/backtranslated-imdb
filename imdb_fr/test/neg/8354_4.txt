The daughter of a wealthy businessman who, as a young girl, has contracted rheumatic fever and is now suffering from shortness of breath, discovers that his marriage to a darling little darling has been arranged by Dad (whom she affectionately calls "Darling"). "); Worse than that, he only has a few weeks left to live, leaving his husband free to marry his rival of amorous connivance. Bunk bed. Paul Osborn's scenario (via Jerome Weidman's scenario) summarizes the redundant flashbacks of the second half instead of continuing the plot, which overwhelms the already-so-so-smashing scenario of sinister talk. Why go back when we can understand what is happening for ourselves? This is a "woman weeper" who has no confidence in her target audience, as the organization is simplistic. Dorothy McGuire, covered in furs for most of the movie, is not at all an intelligent and intelligent heroine; when she is upset, she turns inward and is stony. When she realizes that her marriage is fundamentally a sham, she walks away from her husband like a consummate virgin (well, that's a possibility, Van Johnson and she sleep in separate beds after all!). Ruth Roman has the best moments of the film as a society shark with her trap set in Van, but what exactly do these women see in him? Johnson can be charming when needed, but place it in a melodramatic setting and it will also become stony. The production of MGM does not take much, but the director Gottfried Reinhardt tries to add a visual touch to the flashback sequences and tries a perennial pace for the first half-hour of the film. ** from ****
