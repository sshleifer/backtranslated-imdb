The film is not bad in itself ... until you see the original movie Hitch (2005) starring Will Smith. The film is a direct copy with even the dialogues for most of the film simply translated from English to Hindi! The plot in the original is closely executed. The Hindi version fails to keep viewers interested. David Dhawan's extravagant comedy seems to have exaggerated with Govinda's hysterical cries ... sometimes it takes longer to understand the reason for it than the intrigue. :) <br /> <br /> If you know English, which I suppose you know since you're reading this, check out the Hollywood original. At least look "Hitch" if you looked at partner to be able to compare. This is the least we can do to support the creative geniuses whose work, I regret to say, is unscrupulously raised by "inspired" people like David Dhawan.
