The main character is a sneaky and irresponsible study of how to get into a pity party. She loses him in no time, is pathetic, schizophrenic and asks me why on Earth, she does not understand why her "friends" have not called her for three years. (Get a clue, sister - you're a mess!) I could not stand it or my friends. I have never felt connected to any of the characters. To make the film even more unbearable, someone went to great lengths to put a collection of the world's most hideous crocheted and knitted hats on film for eternity (that alone should justify someone be put on probation for a decade.) <br /> <br /> The acting was not awful, but not really believable either, and in the end, the only thing that was close to my heart, was the two hours I would never find again. Do not waste your time - instead make an appointment with the dentist!
