So it's Friday night and you want to go watch a movie ... all you want is something entertaining, not too artistic, or anything that might require a long night of philosophical discussions. So, you pay $ 10 to watch the Mod Squad. The trailer for this film should have warned me, but hey ... it's three of the most beautiful people in Hollywood - sweets for the eyes. But that's about all ... a series of animated ads from Prada. And what do Hollywood producers have forgotten? A terrain. Why do these children run in the streets after an unknown enemy? Where are they? But, do not worry, after a while, you'll stop worrying about it. I was about to come out of this movie, because I thought sitting in my room and watching the wall would have been more productive (and free), but by that time it was over (90 minutes - it's an economy grace). So, always ready to waste $ 10? Go get yourself a good hot meal.
