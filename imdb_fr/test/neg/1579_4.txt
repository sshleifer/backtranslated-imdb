I am a big fan of the ABC Films of the Week genre. I'm only 27, that is, I was not even born before the end of the series, but I try to collect as much as possible on DVD. I have about a dozen. I had read such wonderful things about this film, here and elsewhere, that I was really excited to see it. I just received my DVD in the mail today and watched it anxiously. I admit that the first phone calls gave me goosebumps - the boy's voice would give goosebumps to everyone! But it started to disappear quickly and the whole plot of divorce was stupid. I also discovered that Michael Douglas was the antagonist about half an hour before the end of the film. As soon as this story was told about how the character of Elizabeth Ashley had locked up her mother, I knew something was fishy. Moreover, did not anyone ever think to ask him why he had appeared suddenly that night when the fire occurred in the barn? I admit that I thought he was training a boy from school to make phone calls. I did not guess the dumb part of the boy nor the pre-recorded tapes (did they ever say what voice was actually? I doubt Douglas could ever get his voice so high?). <br /> <br /> I'm just giving this movie a four out of ten because I really liked most of the actors. Ashley in particular is great. <br /> <br /> It's a shame, because this film has such a premise, but hey, that's what happens sometimes when you expect too much for a movie.
