The St. Francisville experience states that "it's not a walk in the woods," a direct slap to Blair Witch's face. Where Blair Witch has turned out to be a film that has overloaded the viewer's imagination with a simple suggestion, The St. Francisville Experiement places the patience of the viewer. It must be said, however, that it is destined to become a camp classic. <br /> <br /> Attention: Spoiler is coming !! <br /> <br /> I watched this film in a local theater in which the film's "paranormal consultant", Troy Taylor, spoke about the film's making. If anyone wants to see this movie without knowing the information to come, stop reading here. For those of you who can not resist, read about my friends and all will be informed. <br /> <br /> Mr. Taylor, an author of rather intriguing ghost stories that he claims all true, informed the audience, during the video projection, that The St. Francisville Experiment was not a documentary . Shock! Unbelievable! As if we did not know it ... He informed us that all the frightening discoveries of the participants had all been staged and organized in advance by the producers of the film. In fact, he informed us that the last 15 minutes had not even been shot in Louisiana, but in California. The four participants were real actors (note that I did not say good ...). One of the participants is actually a special effects technician in the emergency room. <br /> <br /> What makes me furious about this film is that it proclaims that everything is true. He tries weakly to surpass the Blair Witch project by asserting that it is true while Blair Witch was a hoax. The amazing thing is that no one could believe this movie for a moment. Filled with dramatic and hilarious scenes such as "Surround yourself with white light" and "I love ghosts", The St. Francisville Experiment belongs to midnight movies everywhere so the crowd can properly heckle, boo, laugh and sing "I like" ghosts! "<br /> <br /> Talk about false advertising: True stories are not filmed with staged special effects that suggest that the neighborhood's scout troop erected a haunted house. in the sandwich (ooh ... scary ...) at the annoying Madison, of the "sitting" which is nothing more than the quartet playing on a painting of Oujia to the two mice lying under a bed, The St Francisville Experiement is an embarrassing hoax in a film, and Lion's Gate would be well advised to throw this thing into the nearest garbage compactor or publish it as it should: <br /> <br /> "The experience of St. Francisville: a comical look at how not to make a movie ".
