That seems like a pretty innocent choice at the beginning - the name "employee of the month" could ring with "Office Space" and the show "Office Clerk". I do not think so. It's not even a black comedy. The director of this film, whatever his name, was a fool and had a sick and perverse mind. There is no pleasure in being attracted by the pity of a complete loser who cheats on his wife, steals his high-level work and lies between his teeth 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The second where I am enter the room when my family observes (and believe me, they watched him more because they prayed for at least some relief, maybe even a fable at the end, sending a message warmth of good justice done and when the good ones look good). All the good guys were killed so long ago that they did not have time to look good. No memorials were made. <br /> <br /> This film has limitless madness. It disrespects the elderly, the dead and the women - and the director tries to make people love. <br /> <br /> I gave this film to two because the soundtrack was good. But even that was not so memorable. If you're lucky enough not to see this in the theaters, do not do it at home, my friends.
