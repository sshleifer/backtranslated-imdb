I saw this film with the force of the only positive criticism and I can only imagine that this guy is a shill. <br /> <br /> The main female role is actually quite good, but the whole movie is so excruciatingly annoying, I could hardly bear to sit it's the very definition of monotony. <br /> <br /> So far, this film has been rated at 8 out of 10 out of 7 votes. This must mean that the director, the director's girlfriend, the producer, the actress and the drinking buddies have given their own film. this. <br /> <br /> This man of the street must give him a 2 on 10. <br /> <br /> Note from the FDA: while this film can be used as a help to get a good night's sleep sleep, no medicinal value is involved or offered.
