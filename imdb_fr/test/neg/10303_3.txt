On the recommendation of a friend and my admiration for Philip Baker Hall, I rented the record for the first season of the Loop. It's a typical TV comedy with all the clich√©s that the genre uses with the wacky brother (Sully), "ditzy" blonde (Lizzy), pledge of unrequited love (Piper), sarcastic Asian assistant (Darcy, who made me think of Arliss, as if SOMEONE had to be reminded of this show). The plot deals with various misfortunes (usually Sully) that fall on Sam who puts his work on the plane at risk, but the fact saves the situation, with hilarious hijinks in the middle. I did not describe a certain episode. I've described them ALL to a T. That's where the problem lies, because what seems like fair entertainment in the beginning becomes unnecessarily obsolete when you watch consecutive episodes and you get bored more and more after a rehearsal without end. Sully will do something "far-fetched", Mimi Rogers will say something obviously sexual, Russ will talk about his gay son, Darcy will imitate Sandra Oh on Arliss blah blah blah blah. The only good thing is the absence of an annoying laughter track. But do not let that fool you into thinking it's good. Go watch a better comedy. Arrested Development, Always Sunny in Phillidelphia, two names head-to-head. Surprised that it is still on the air. Oh it is true that Fox only cancels the good shows, I forgot. Needless to say, I no longer trust my friend's tastes in shows. <br /> <br /> My note: D +
