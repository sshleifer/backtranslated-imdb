I'm not really a big fan of Abbott & Costello (although I like "Who's On First") and, to be honest, there was not much in this movie that would inspire me to watch more their work. It was not really bad. There were some rather amusing scenes, and in fact a very convincing giant played by Buddy Baer, ​​but anyway, given the duo's reputation and the esteem in which they are generally held, I must say that I am was expecting more. As the story unfolds, they fall into a babysitting job and, during the reading of Jack & The Beanstalk as a bedtime story (the kid reading it for Costello), Jack of Costello falls asleep and is dreaming in the story. There is a sort of "Wizard of Oz" in the story, in that the characters in the dream are all the equivalents of Jack's actual knowledge, and the film opens in black and white and goes to the color during the dream sequence. The fight scenes between Jack and the giant and the dance scene between Jack and Polly (Dorothy Ford) are part of the fun parts of the film. Polly, of course, also leads to one of the film's questions: what happened to him? Jack and his gang apparently left him behind in the giant's castle! I know - it was just a dream, so whatever. Always - I wondered. There were also some cute singing and dancing routines. My 4-year-old daughter laughed a little during that, so she could enjoy a little humor. I thought it was an acceptable waste of time, but nothing could convince you of Abbott and Costello as comic geniuses. 4/10
