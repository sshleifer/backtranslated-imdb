On a Thursday night at 10 pm, my local ABC affiliate on the west coast aired the pilot episode of Northern Exposure. The ABC network usually broadcasts "Men In Trees" at this time, but the program has been preempted for a live sports event. <br /> <br /> Although both shows take place in Alaska and are filmed in the Pacific Northwest (Exposure in Washington State, Trees in Vancouver, BC, look again " Northern Exposure "(as well as some episodes of" Sex and the City ") reminds me of how disappointed I am with the ill-conceived hybrid" Men in Trees ". <br /> <br /> Anne Heche can be a good actress with Unfortunately, his role as a writer ending in a small town in Alaska hurts my nerves, perhaps because I feel that Heche is a bad student, I'm not convinced of his character as "fish out of water". <br /> <br /> I can not help but think that the support cast matches the original stereotypes.The handsome local, the kind owner of the bar, the bush pilot, the local police officers, the animated, but well-meaning DJ, etc. <br /> <br /> The only stereotype that could have been broken was the teddy bear. and veteran actor "ER" Abraham Benrubi as a local bartender in love with two different women. Given that one of the executive producers is filmmaker James Mangold (his films "Heavy" and "Cop Land" had main characters who were tall men), I'm not surprised why Benrubi has has been interpreted in an atypical role. <Br/> <br /> Nevertheless, I understand why there are a lot of passionate viewers who like "Men in Trees". It corresponds to the weird niche for the viewers. I wanted the show to find its own voice instead of borrow ideas for better shows.
