Recently, I watched a lot of westerns from the 1930s to the present day. There are some very good low-budget spaghetti westerns from the late 1960s and early 1970s. This film had all the elements of a decent western: a good story with talented actors and everything in between. Although this is a parody of this kind, and for me the way it was done did not work and was a disappointing film. <br /> <br /> This film can easily be divided into two parts. <Br /> <br /> The first part is great; There is a big opening scene and an interesting story is unfolding, according to which a bounty hunter (a stranger, for example) is attacking a bandit who is attacking a large bank guard guarded, in part , by a banker. During the film, these three characters form changing alliances in an attempt to make money. There are subtle comic signs to the artifacts of earlier films of this kind, but comedy does not disturb the general history. <br /> <br /> The second part of the film is the one where the comedy goes over the head. and essentially destroys the film. The turning point is exactly where the waitress falsely scolded the dwarf to stop firing at customers as he waited for other customers, apparently unaware of the four corpses lying around the place. From that moment, the film moves from a decent spaghetti western with comical nuances to a stupid and stupid parody. <br /> <br /> There are three scenes of horrible fistfights (one at the river, one at the market and one at the baths) which follow one another quickly as if one were not enough. The fights are so wrong that it's ridiculous, and since the sound is not synchronized with the picture, it's even worse. On the scene of market battles, the banker leaps onto hidden trampolines and turns on poles as he is at the circus. it's clownish. Although the worst of these fight scenes is music; It's this light, playful mix that's more suited to a square dance or an episode of "Hee-Haw". These scenes virtually derail the main story. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie was disappointing because it had a lot of potential as a decent western, but the comics ruined everything. If you want to see a good Western parody, see 'Flaming saddles'. If you want to see a good spaghetti western, then avoid this movie.
