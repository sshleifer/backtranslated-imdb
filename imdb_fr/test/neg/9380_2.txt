The only good thing about Persepolis is the shadows created in the animation in the manner of German Expressionism and a hint of history. This movie bothered me. It was a woman dissatisfied with her culture who tries everything and returns to her roots. Here, she finds once again her great dissatisfaction and finally leaves for the final to allow all the other inhabitants of her country to understand the situation and to know what they will do now that she is not there for them. support. This leads to no conclusion and leaves us feeling that this woman has no loyalty. Mind you, she's torn between crops and does not have enough background, she seems to understand what's important and real. She listens to many voices and will most likely end up becoming a world citizen of a kind larger than the one who has no connection with her Iranian culture. The only thing I received from this movie was anxiety.
