The brilliant genius of the Australian comics Barry Humphries had a rare failure with this uneven and sometimes unpleasant comedy, which was torn off after only a few days. Sir Les Patterson, Australian diplomat drunk and lustful, accidentally sets fire to an Arab potentate at the UN and is assigned to his small country as a punishment. Sir Les, with the reluctant help of Dame Edna Everage (both played by Humphries), is nearly defeating a new leader's ploy to release a deadly, disgusting, AIDS-like virus into the Western world. Joan Rivers is a woman president of the United States, her desk plaque bearing the inscription "President Rivers"! Extreme bad taste mingles with the glossy sheet of paper and Humphries' usual scathing satire in a film that is more enjoyable in its many fun parts than as a whole. Lady Edna's viewers could be confused by the presence of another Madge Allsop, unfortunately, who misses the wonderful dull and comical magic of Emily Perry in the role. The film was written by Humphries and his third wife, Diane Millstead, and directed by Mad Max director George Miller. For Humphries fans like me, essential. All the others, beware.
