One of those movies where you bet on who will die first and who will survive at the end. There was just something in the movie that took me out of the area. I think because I keep looking back and thinking "always yeah in this tree ... always looking at the water". Bad character development. I did not feel anything when they were in danger. I voted for the fang. I had a hard time believing that a fang would try to overturn a boat in the first place and then, when it jumps into the boat, I find that very unlikely. The crocodile sometimes seems too supernatural ("knowing everything to see"). Moreover, when the fang attacks, his behavior seems very unrealistic. It is a killing machine and does not allow victims to escape two or three times in a row, especially when attacking in the water.
