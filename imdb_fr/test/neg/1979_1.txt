Final Fantasy: Advent Children is and will remain a classic example of style and substance gone wrong. Instead of drawing on the memorable characters and captivating mythology of the original game, Square Enix has made a frivolous montage of incomprehensible battle scenes. Yes, I said "incomprehensible". Did you know that Tifa knows incredibly fast Kung Fu techniques that magically change the angle of the camera every second? This cloud can hang effortlessly in the air for a minute as he moves wildly with his 2-ton sword? The English dub is mediocre. Although not terribly bad, it is far from being well produced. The quality is comparable to that of an average anime duo. <br /> <br /> Here's what I would like to say to the hardcore FFVII fans who can not help stuffing themselves with this movie: Advent Children is the Best Service for Fans You Could Have Expected from Square Enix , but even a truculent movie like Galerians: Rion had a better story. You will be embarrassed by this film and its lack of reflection in due time. The days of its novelty are numbered. <br /> <br /> Films like Advent Children make me wonder if Square Enix recognizes the potential of its franchises. After all (and not wanting to offend), it's a Japanese company. Japanese developers can offer fun games, but most of their offerings are unfortunately shallow. They are absolute psychos in the quality of production. Advent Children presents some of the most breathtaking renditions in CG's history, but that does not stop him from keeping his intricate plot and cardboard characters. <br /> <br /> All fans who have watched this movie know that Sephiroth will come back. Bending the story to fit his resurrection was a big mistake. <br /> <br /> NOTE: The only argument I give to this "film" is in honor of the 10,000 enslaved Japanese animators who gave their lives to make each hair bleached. on the clouded Caucasian head of Cloud.
