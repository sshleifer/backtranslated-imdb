I jumped to hear that this show was over. The characters on this show were extremely irritating. None of them had a singer of redemptive quality. Damon Wayans is probably the one standing tallest. Kisha Campbell is ... Kisha Campbell. She's as boring as she was at Martin's. <br /> <br /> Children are all very annoying too. The older is an idiot, the older is a stuck kid and the youngest is frustrating to listen. <br /> <br /> I guess I liked the smart little boy. But that's about all. <br /> <br /> It has served the world by ending our activities. <br /> <br /> Let's pray that a Wayan never plays in another show ... NEVER.
