While the dog was cute, the movie was not. It was not the premise or the theme that was problematic. The premise had great possibilities for both humor and pathos. The theme is worthy. It is more important to help others than to accumulate a fortune. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the adorable dog, the unique premise and the theme have been compromised by a mediocre action game, a scalded dialogue and an amateur shoot. <br /> Even my youngest child who will sit through almost everything abandoned before we have halfway through. How many times can this dog run in the same lane? I can not spoil it for you because I have never seen the end. It was not worth looking to the end.
