What an atomic bomb of a movie. The story is not going anywhere and nowhere. He leaves the spectator with his arm raised, saying "Is that it?" What happened to Redford? Once upon a time there was a fair actor. Now, he thinks he can appear on the set and do some scenes and it's a catch. False. What a film without emotion. I do not want to be so cruel, but what a bullshit movie. Amazing amateur shit. If I were in this film, I would be so embarrassed that I would not show my face. I tell you that if I have been associated with this film, I have big problems. This film will remain in the annals of cinema as king of bombs with which all others will be compared.
