The film has started very well ... so far we could believe in the exorcism of Isabelle .... but after that! I did not know if it was a horror movie, a drama or a must-see movie! The possessed creature that attacks the sheriff has no connection with the movie .... the makeup !! Well, at first it seemed pretty real, but at the end of the last part of the film, makeup (especially the eyes and teeth) was very exaggerated. If you want a good movie "Exorcism", watch "The exorcism of Emily Rose". <br /> <br /> Together with "Hard Candy" (totally boring and pathetic plot and the end), these two movies are the worst ve seen of Lionsgate !! But, the movie company has provided great movies to horror movie fans, but with this one, you'll want to never rent it! Exorcist movie lovers, stay with two "The Exorcist" and "Emily Rose's Exorcism"
