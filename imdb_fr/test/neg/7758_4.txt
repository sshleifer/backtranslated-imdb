1960s children's show with ex-vaudevillians playing handsome men for rent. As you can imagine, they are a disaster in everything they do. During the 11-minute episodes (leaving 4 minutes for commercials in the 15-minute slot), they organize tasks such as closing a fence between warring neighbors, helping a magician on stage, and taking care of the trunk. Portfolio found. <Br/> <br /> Growing up, I had never seen this show (which seems to have been shot in New York). I thought I heard about most of the children's shows from that time or saw them, either watching them as children or watching them at nostalgic conventions. Until Alpha Video released it on DVD, I did not know if it existed. <br /> <br /> The series unfolds like the Three Stooges mixed with Abbott and Costello, as do the people who sing the routines. (Indeed, one of the two claims to have created the legendary routine "Slowly, I shot ...", perfected by Abbott and Costello). It's not bad, but it's really not good either because everything seems diluted. The timing is often out of sync (although this may be due to a wrong direction) and the jokes were recycled years before the first performance of the show. Chances are you've seen everything before. On the positive side, this is the kind of thing that would be perfect for introducing very young children to the magic of vaudeville comedy, but parents will try to sit down even during short episodes. <br /> <br /> For addicted to nostalgia only. Everyone should see an original of Abbott and Costello or Three Stooges.
