Intrigue interesting but painfully dull. The script lacks ... lack of play. For me, this film is comparable to the movies of the type "Made for TV". I was lucky enough to survive the movie without falling asleep in my popcorn. I watched this movie with my family. It is safe enough to watch with your children. (Only 1 sex scene) If you want to see a young Meg Ryan ... watch this movie. Very 80-ish. You'll love this film if you like the combination of depressed people at Christmas, alcohol, glue and tar. Or maybe you're like me ... and you have a higher level to play in movies. However, I liked the beginning and the end of the movie! Mark.
