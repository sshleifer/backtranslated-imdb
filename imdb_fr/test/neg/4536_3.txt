Directed by the same Jin Ishimoto, Neoedision and flixer.com (a once-promising online movie community) have been temporarily closed and shut down due to his directorial style and the filming method of his upcoming film, GIRL'S BEST FRIEND. <br /> <br /> THE HOLE suffers from this style of cinema "look at me, I'm a filmmaker" which is becoming the norm in today's Hollywood, to the detriment of the content. <br /> <br /> THE HOLE really begins with a unique concept, but this concept and the promise of captivating content are soon shattered by the "look at me" director style. <br /> <br /> There are some fun moments that still shine is a painful short film to watch. <br /> <br /> How sad it is that the new generation of "filmmakers" chooses not to be the servant of the story, but rather to try to dominate the screen. Heck, they do not care, as long as they have their studio contract, house on the beach and a new car, content and presentation are secondary issues. <br /> <br /> The real sad part of all this is Hollywood adopts the "look at me" attitude so much that the aesthetic of filming is changing. Rather than presenting a story in a simple way that gives precedence to history, today's filmmakers become "experimental", that is, "looks at me". <br /> <br /> Is it me or am I the only one to have really been put on by the opening minutes of Sena SWORDFISH. This film then went beyond Sena's attempts to make cinema "look at me". Unfortunately, this short film by Mr. Ishimoto does not do it. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10 from Elec Tv.
