It is a film that revolves around two mysteries (which I have now debunked). <br /> <br /> First, did the filmmakers understand the concept of "parody" before using it to line the viewer throughout the film? Parody occurs when a reproduction tries to make fun of, comment or pay homage to its humor that depreciates itself to the original work. In other words, there should be reasons to parody such work, and they should certainly be smart. I did not see any of them in the movie. I saw terrible 10-second jokes that fell flat within 2 seconds of delivery. Bryan Stoller probably went to Eric Roberts and said, "Hey, I was drunk last night, I was watching Survivors and I had this puzzle for a DVD release, I want you on board without reading the script ... because I plan to direct this film without one! "<br /> <br /> And here lies the second mystery: the career of Eric Robert. I used to think that Eric Roberts had the career he had because he was unlucky. Now, I realize it's because he's stupid (and so deserves the career he's had). After watching this film, it is obvious that he would have been better if he had turned to mainstream adult films, with higher budgets, more intense ... scenes and roles, a better interpretation and staging, a more elaborate and convincing plot. lines, and a much wider audience than this rejection of B-movie (C-movie?).
