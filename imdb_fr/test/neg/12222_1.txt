It's probably the worst documentary I've ever seen. It looked so amateurish. Chris Hegedus was one of the directors of The War Room, which was a great movie (although he was a little near), but he was gorgeous. Startup.com seemed to have been shot in the basement of a guy. The quality was so pitiful that I could not bear to watch it. I saw about 30 minutes and I had to report it to Blockbuster and get something else. I can not understand how something so amateur of someone like Chris Hegedus. How the hell did he win prizes to start ??? The War Room certainly deserved a prize, just like another great documentary called Ameragosa (both award-winning). This documentary seemed to have been made by Uncle Joe, who also organizes weddings on the weekends. Shaky, dimly lit, unflattering lighting, mediocre sound, a 10 year old could make a better movie than this guy.
