The only good part of this movie was the end. You know the part of the movie where the lights come on and you go home. No no, it can be a little hard - the dance in the movie was sensational but unfortunately, that's where the plot ended. As long as the actors were dancing and did not speak, the movie was going well. As for the debut of Chayanne - not too bad but hope that his next film will have a little more depth. As for going to see the movie, wait for the rental or the television. Do not make the same mistake as me and pay 8.50
