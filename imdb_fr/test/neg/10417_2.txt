I like Steve Buscemi. I really like his work, as an actor and director. You could say that I am -into- Steve Buscemi. A monster of Steve Buscemi. I'm watching Steve Buscemi. <br /> <br /> I remember my first appearance in Buscemi's first feature film, "Trees Lounge". I enjoyed the movie, even though it was not as good as it could have been. It was about there. That's why I wanted to see "small" movies about "little" people in "small" bars located in "small" cities. It was pretty close to where I would say it was a very good movie - a movie that with some adjustments could have been great. But it is okay. I like the movie and I have watched it more than once. <br /> <br /> But this criticism does not concern Trees Lounge. It's about "Lonesome Jim." When I saw the movie description and then who it was, I was excited to finally see the movie that I knew Trees Lounge could have been. But what I really experienced was reminiscent of leaving one of those small town bars with a flank full of cheap whiskey and a bunch of cheap products, to go back to your apartment with a brain stuffed with exciting prospects that inevitably disintegrate into the reality of helplessness induced by alcohol and regurgitation to the head. <br /> <br /> In other words, this film left me unrequited and regretted to have lost the time and money needed to achieve this state - the film's equivalent of waking up the next day morning next to this cheap plush, or if you're the floozy, wake up next to this stinky fool, fart and unshaven. The film had all the substance of a stale white bread sandwich (with brand-name white bread at the store, nothing less) and the emotion of a corpse. I'm not sure of the interest of this film, and as it was supposed to have some kind of point and it was not an abstract surrealism exercise that can do without this or that point, lack of point is a sin of omission. A bit like these new cars that no longer come with ashtrays although millions of people smoke and buy new cars (I'm not part of it, but hey, I can sympathize). All in all, it was a boring film about boring people doing boring things and having neither the courage nor the credibility to transport and save such a movie. I mean, Trees Lounge was to say that boring people were doing boring things, but it was interesting. <br /> <br /> I want a lot from Affleck. Why do people keep throwing these Affleck droppings? They suck the life of everything with which they are connected. An Affleck was in a decent movie (and that was not even the reason the movie was decent) and all of a sudden every asshole named Affleck stinks as many movies as they can. And Liv Tyler is no better. Being the daughter of a rock star is not necessarily an actress. She is as lifeless as Affleck. These people just do not come out of the flat page of the script. People pay to see movies and deserve to see actors and actresses with a bit of charisma - these two failures do not have the spark of the old man who distributes caddies at Wal Mart. I always thought that Steve Buscemi was the kind of guy who would surpass this type of pablum, but oh Steve, you let us down. This film makes me want to poke you in another wood chipper.
