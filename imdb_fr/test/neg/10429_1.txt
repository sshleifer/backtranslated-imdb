Any student at a film school can make a film 1,000 times better than a waste. As someone who had read the book, I expected even a new story from the book to make an honest film. There was a chance that a talented director could go beyond Woodward's story and make a good movie. <br /> <br /> The director went beyond Woodward's story. He added a Hispanic angel called Velasquez who did not appear in the book. He asked Bob Woodward to interview the deceased Belushi during an exchange at the morgue. The film had all the ideas of a person pummeled by the PCP who was staring at his belly button. <br /> <br /> If it's a spoiler, you'll thank me for it, because it's the worst movie of all time.
