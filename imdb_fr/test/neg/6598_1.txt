The authors and creators of this film should in fact be pursued ... For polluting the world with this shit! "Man In The Mirror" is actually more than terrible! Path, path, path beyond! <br /> <br /> ... and people, I'm not saying that just because I'm a fan of Michael Jackson! Or because it's really one of the most delayed representations of his life I've ever met! <br /> <br /> I say that because it's a waste of time, money and celluloid! I'm ashamed of myself just having seen everything! It's been 1 hour and 26 minutes of my life that I will never come back! I tell you; Seeing grass growing is literally more fun than this movie! <br /> <br /> Consider yourself!
