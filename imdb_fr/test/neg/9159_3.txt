Honestly, I thought this movie was going to be cheesy, although I have long loved Alvin and the Chipmunks! I was very wrong. IT WAS GREAT!!! It's the best movie I've seen since October! In my opinion, this is the movie that everyone should see in this holiday season! Delighted (I was still thinking ...) was awful, The Golden Compass was fine, but the end was pretty rotten for fans of Dark Materials, and I Am Legend, well I have not seen it yet (or Treasures National 2) but it looks good. <br /> <br /> I'm not going to give in, but this movie is for everyone, especially children!
