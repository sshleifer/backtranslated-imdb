This is a movie about people receiving a love letter. Nobody knows who sent and nobody knows who it is. A good cast, led by Kate Capshaw, Tom Selleck and Ellen DeGeneres. This, however, is a completely dopey plot. For example, the character of Capshaw, one of the most influential citizens of a small town in New England, meets a young immature student who works in her bookstore during the summer. She chooses it instead of Tom Selleck, the firefighter of the city who loves it. If it's not the quintessence of stupidity, I do not know what it is. Just an example of how dopey this movie is. Watching Kate Capshaw jogging is a pleasure, but you realize immediately that she has never been jogging all her life. Another obviously dopey part of a dopey film.
