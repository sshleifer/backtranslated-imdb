If you are a six year old boy who loves dinosaurs, you will love this movie. If you are someone else, you will roll your eyes every 15 seconds or so. If you want to start picking things like acting, special effects, dialogue or the absence of a coherent scenario that makes any sense, you'll have a lot of material. If all you want is a fantastic dinosaur movie safe for your child, everything will be fine. That said, many entertainment for children are much smarter and some are even bearable or enjoyable for adults. Unless your child is in an uncompromising dinosaur atmosphere, you'd probably be better off looking for something else.
