This film is not worth the time it takes to put it in the VCR or DVD player! Michael Dudikoff and Lisa Howard are two bounty hunters, but they are totally opposed. She is ambitious and organized, whereas he is relaxed and totally sparse. <br /> <br /> In this film, villains pursue Jersey Bellini (the character of Dudikoff). This opens the door to bad godfather impressions, ridiculous fight scenes and Tony Curtis playing the most effeminate gang boss I've ever seen! The end must be the most incredible scene I've seen in a movie for quite some time. I think Terminator, even Matrix, is more likely to be true than this ending! This film just feels cheap. The script must have hit someone as totally ridiculous. However, the green light was given for this dung to be manufactured and left free on an unsuspecting public. I watched this movie with several other people who all agreed that we had been deceived. No one in the group could say anything good about the movie, except it was over.
