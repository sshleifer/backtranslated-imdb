If you want to take advantage of the money you would spend to rent this money, go buy an ice bag and watch it melt. It's more fun than this movie. <br /> <br /> Bill Cowell, shame on you. <br /> <br /> Or if you want to see this movie, go to a cornfield, bring two of the most boring girls you can find, run for a few hours and let the girls scream as loud as possible. Then send me the few dollars you would have spent. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed the first Dark Harvest, after watching afterwards, I will start crying.
