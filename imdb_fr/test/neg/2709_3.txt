In fact, I planned to see this movie when I noticed it in my TV guide, but after about 5 minutes, I decided that the time was definitely more valuable than could "Who's That Girl". Describing how Madonna's acting is impossible and the end result is one of the most boring characters ever captured in a movie. This shit is an insult to the cinema and the intellect. I almost never! note a movie that I do not see from beginning to end, but in this case, the first is impossible. 2/10
