It's actually a violent biker movie with slangs, accidents and clever music. OK, so just slangs and accidents. It is a slight step above most other rates on MST3K, but it is like driving a nail in your kneecap: it's slow and painful. Giving the plot would exhaust my energy so I'll just say you had better skip it.
