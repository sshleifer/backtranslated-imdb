What can I say ... not much to this one. Quite dull and uninteresting. <br /> <br /> The performances of the actors are only correct. The only shining one is Simmons, but he only has 3 scenes. I understand that by keeping his screen time to a minimum, he retains his mysterious psychic aura, but I can not help thinking that his talent has been wasted. No one else has risen above mediocrity. <br /> <br /> The story itself seems intriguing at first, but it does not lead to anything. There is not a single scene in the film that impressed me or made me feel like I had just seen something special. The cinematography was pretty bland ... I mean desert in a sort of faded sepia ... not very inspiring. <br /> <br /> The story of his childhood friend returned to prison seemed only partially thought out and did not really add anything to the story, apart from transforming a script medium 'Twilight Zone' in a feature film. <br /> <br /> Drab.
