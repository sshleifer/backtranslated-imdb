I like Juan Piquer-Simón! He is my favorite bad director and, throughout his career, he has tried to take advantage of all the successful contemporary trends in horror and fantasy. After the great success of "Superman", JP created his own hilarious "Supersonic Man", he participated in the violent madness of the slasher film with the insane "Pieces" and he really outdid himself with "The Return of ET ", the unofficial and downright ludicrous sequel to Spielberg's SF blockbuster. "The Rift" is obviously inspired by the series of profitable underwater monster movies such as "The Abyss" and "Deepstar Six". From start to finish, you can have fun by spotting all the stolen ideas and shameless scams of these classics (and others). When a completely new and sophisticated type of submarine disappears near the deep Dannekin Fault, a second mission aboard submarine designer Wick Hayes is sent to investigate what really happened to Siren One. In the dark depths of the ocean, the rescue mission discovers an underwater cave where the government secretly experiments with mutant marine creatures. The monsters are pretty aggressive but there is also the danger of a government enemy among the crew ... "The Rift" is a forgettable film, but it nevertheless has some ingenuity ?? Although very risky ?? monster patterns. Fans of blood and blood will not complain either, because animal attacks are terrible and ruthless. The actors' game is very wooden although many of the cast's names can certainly do better. It is advisable to just enjoy the clichés and the bloody effects of the movie "The Rift" because if you start thinking about the scenario, you will find that it makes no sense.
