It's just a bad movie. Not as bad as R.I.C.C.O. But I got hooked on the game, and then got totally lost after that. The acting was far and far away. Do not watch this movie at any cost, trust me with all my heart !!!! Brothers directors are not the next HUGHES BROTHERS, who have made very good films like DEAD PRESIDENTS, DE HELL, AMERICAN PIMP and MENACE II SOCIETY. A great actor one day if he makes better films than this one. Cristina Caparoula also did a good job for what she got. I hope that THE FITTEST is 10 times better than this piece of shit!
