Oh, how I laughed during these first two scenes. This silly little movie about an 11-year-old who carries a gun, steals cars, steals shops, burglars, extorts money from other children, burns houses, shoots rats, buys drug, give drugs to his mother and friends, then kill a guy. What a beautiful comedy! But it was not meant to be a comedy. It was conceived as a social drama. How can this be? The events in this film are absurd and ridiculous. The characters are all stereotypes from the immature imagination of 4 years caused by comics. Dialogue is laughable; people talk like morons. It's a very stupid movie. <br /> <br /> The first scenes are really funny, for all the wrong reasons. But the involuntary hilarity of the idiotic premise is exhausted after a short moment, after which laughter rarely comes; at this point, the viewer can not believe what he sees and is in turn astonished and bored by what follows (if he has at least a half brain cell). <br /> <br /> A short film, but that looks like an eternity. The film is actually a serious attempt to show the world a degenerate youth, while imitating movies that are superior to him, such as "Fun". There is such an air of phoniness about everything; children, adults, everyone lacks credibility both in their actions and in their dialogue. The kid in the main role runs the film as if he had seen all of Jimmy Cagney's movies at least a hundred times. And, usually, the child is not described as a reservoir of evil, but rather as a poorly understood artistic talent. But of course. Every young thug is misunderstood - society has made him mean. Poor child. <br /> <br /> The film is embarrassing; a collection of stale shots, sometimes hilarious, together to make a film devoid of intelligence and meaning. The intellectual level of the film is zero.
