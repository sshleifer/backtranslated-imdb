What can I say? It was a horrible movie to watch. Normally, I'm not very critical of gay cinema in general, as most of them are usually on a budget, but that really drove me to ruin. I mean, did it happen to gay cinema? Have not gay producers and directors learned anything from the films of Gus Van Saints and Ang Lee? The fact of having to sit throughout the movie was as if I was sitting in a dentist's chair and my wisdom teeth were extracted. I continued to pray during times when I felt any connection with one of the characters, but it never happened. Most character performances were just not very convincing. It was like watching one of those special films badly produced for television on a local TV channel. I can not tell you how disappointed we are to see this movie after being a big fan of Tori Spellings 'other works and the directors' latest work on "Latter-day Saints". It really was not worth the wait. Certainly, a few hours of my life, I will never come back and certainly will not buy it on DVD.
