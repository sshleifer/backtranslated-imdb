"Beowulf" is like a very bad game: no characters, no story, no real dialogues, bad fights ... This is probably the worst film in the history of cinema. It's deadly boring, a waste of time. I am really sorry for Christophe Lambert, who obviously does not know how to choose a role. If someone suggests you to see "Beowulf", believe me: run like crazy.
