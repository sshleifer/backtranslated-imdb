1) Bad game. <br /> <br /> 2) For a group of castaways on an extraterrestrial planet, it was like home, especially with houses and roads that you can see in the background. <br /> <br /> 3) Terrible plot with stupid characters making silly decisions and gleefully losing valuable survival equipment and clothing, left, right and center. <br /> <br /> 5) Interesting ship at first (this crew must have watched a lot of Space 1999). Too bad it explodes so early. The relief ship has also sunk too fast. * sigh * <br /> <br /> 6) Some anthropologists might find some aspects of the film interesting in terms of primate group behavior.
