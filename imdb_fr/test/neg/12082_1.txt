Jane Eyre with complete frontal nudity! I was not surprised to see that a woman got involved in this awful "woman's image" and I say it in the worst possible way. The problem is that it could have been so good if they had just left out Jane Eyre's stuff and stuck with the much more interesting scenes involving Spanish / Portuguese Jews in the early 19th century in London. When the music of the sound track is better than the movie, you know you have problems. When you quickly advance the video because you can not stand the movie, just to make sure you do not miss anything, you have even more problems. This film will be on the romance television channel to which it belongs, rightly.
