More agile, heavy, full of speech, preaching, nose, and too stylized in a way that only MTV could blame himself, Stop-Loss is a dead waste. I was expecting much more from talented young actors like Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Ryan Philippe, but writer / director Kimberly Peirce is doing everything possible to portray the harmful effects of the war on American youth. I'm sure she's been researching the war in Iraq and the young men fighting there, but you'd never guess it by looking at Stop-Loss. In many ways, this mess reminded me of Catherine Hardwicke's book, Lords of Dogtown, a mess of solid subject that is just as inept, too stylized, like a TV movie. <br /> <br /> http://eattheblinds.blogspot.com/
