This is my opinion on this film, expressed in its dialogues. <br /> <br /> To be more serious, I can not say that this movie is a bad time, but I did not like it either. <br /> <br /> First, I was just indifferent and I could not focus on the world of apes. Although the makeup is very realistic, the constant screams were irritating. May the movie have changed the monkeys for cats and it's a cult movie for me compared to my taste for them. <br /> <br /> The second part is more interesting, with the talent and freshness of the newcomers (Macdowell & Lambert), but I felt insane: the whole story takes place in a large British mansion: also luxurious whatever it was, it was like a prison for me. <br /> <br /> Finally, could it be a good adaptation of the Tarzan story among the Burroughs? I do not know, I never read the book (nor saw Disney). <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I do not have good moments to remember, a single viewing would suffice me. <br /> <br /> I should have guessed my boredom after the endless freezing called "Opening" at the beginning ... What is the meaning? Only the director knows it.
