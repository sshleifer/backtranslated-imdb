It's one of the most ridiculous westerns ever made by Hollywood. Gary Cooper plays "Reb Hollister", a former Confederate officer wanted by law. He meets a moron named Weatherby, played by US Marshal Leif Erickson without any knowledge of guns. Weatherby travels to Dallas to see his fiancee, Tonia Robles, played by Ruth Roman. Senor Robles, Tonia's father, has many men, but they do not seem to be able to keep an eye on his cattle, which the Marlow brothers fly regularly. Will Marlow, played by Raymond Massey, financed the loan on the Robles estate, making things completely absurd. He even has the power to request a mortgage payment before the deadline, simply because he wants to. <br /> <br /> Since Weatherby is a Boston boy who can not fight, since he has only become a marshal, he could visit his fiancée, Tonia (just another example of a more absurd plot. Should we assume that just a written test to get this job? Wait a minute, this guy could not pass the written test either.) He changes his identity with Reb Hollister, who is of course a man armed. Reb takes the liberty of greeting Weatherby's daughter with a passionate kiss, while Weatherby looks like an idiot. Gary Cooper, the number one stallion in Hollywood, is in great shape here as a Reb. Before the movie is over, not only does he take Weatherby's work, but he also steals his fiancée, and Ruth Roman like Tonia falls in love with him so loudly and so fast that she gives Leif Erickson the blast before the movies a little more than half <br /> <br /> There is not a tiny credibility in the plot throughout the film, so despite the good distribution and the lush photography, the film is a failure. And Cooper's character is a complete heel to boot. The film also stars Barbara Payton as the daughter of Brant Marlow, a beautiful and talented actress who has unfortunately let her chances slip by making too many headlines for the wrong reasons. I strongly suggest you pass this one.
