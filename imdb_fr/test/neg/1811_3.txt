To be honest, I've never been to Congo or even Africa, and after watching the movie for the Heart of Darkness TV movie, I do not think I'd like it. The film completely shames the book at the highest level possible. Although the book is not the best I've read, after watching the movie, it seemed to like it a hundred times more. Nicolas Roeg, the director of the film, did a horrible job in describing the news of Joseph Conrad in a film. I recognize that Roeg had the merit of trying the impossible by turning the book into a film, but that may not have been his job. The film failed to express any part of the novel other than the basics of the plot. The scenery and landscapes did not have the beauty Conrad portrayed of Africa in the book either. In the book, Marlow had seen so many wonders, but in the movie you did not experience the same experience. No, I do not blame the whole director; the game in the movie was just terrible. All the actors were boring and without interest. Throughout the film, I had the impression that the actors showed no emotion, as if they read the script all the time. Tim Roth, who plays the role of Marlow, did not describe well the meaning of Marlow's adventure for his trip to Congo. Marlow's trip to find Kurtz was supposed to venture, but I did not experience that in the movie. I would not recommend watching this movie, especially if you have already read the book. This does not do justice to Joseph Conrad's short story. Conrad's words capture the reader and take them on a journey with Marlow in his quest to find Mr. Kurtz, which was not the case with the film. Great news, but a very bad movie. Heart of Darkness, the film, is based on Joseph Conrad's book, also called Heart of Darkness.
