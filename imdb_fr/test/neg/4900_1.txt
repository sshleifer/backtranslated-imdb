For starters, I am not a person who evaluates movies I have not seen, nor a person who evaluates movies 1 when they do not deserve it. This movie was really so bad. The basic plot was extremely formulated, and although it was not great, the plot deserved about a five. What really bothered me was all about swimming in the movie. I compiled a short list of issues with the swimming-related aspects of this movie. <br /> <br /> 1. No character development. 2. Not the sense of time. 3. Swimming scenes completely inaccurate, including: a. A team of six swimmers going to something called both "national" and "regional" without mentioning their qualification. b. The same team that competed was not a real competition at any point in the film. c. The rival program goes from high school to club team, then back to high school. re. In the scene where Ellis is interviewing for a job, the banners show high school wins and national placements, but the team is made up of 5 to 12 swimmers, based on the 3 matches. e. A team of 5 guys and a girl win nationals / regions, whatever. F. This girl wins the men's 100 butterfly. g. In this race, the girl beats two guys from a team that appeared the previous year in the top 3 of the country. h. The announcer resets a race from the chest 200 to the chest 100 to the race 200 again in the space of about 45 seconds. I. In the last relay, the 4X100, which is swimming in a pool 50 meters long, we see a swimmer make two turns upside down. j. In the same relay, team anchor swimmers fear and leave the blocks, triggering inspiring inspiring conversation, which lasts about two and a half minutes, about three times the length of the leg at a national-level meet . k. The film begins in July or August, assuming Ellis has applied before the start of the school year and the pool should be closed in 3 months. Therefore, assuming that to be true, the swimmers stopped not knowing how to swim. win national / regional, in less than two, as the pool had to be cleaned and the kids did not train for a while. l. I'm sure there are a few hundred more, I'm just trying to block them out of my memory. 4. Throughout the film, there is no mention of the swimmers' time. 5. If you have a movie about swimming, it would be a good idea to hire extras who can swim well. 6. The scene where the child is hit at the sea is physically impossible. <br /> <br /> That being said, all the swimming scenes were way too slow, the swimmers had a horrible technique, and the idea of ​​being able to have a national meet within three months of learning to swim. is an insult to swimmers around the world. <br /> <br /> OK, if you still do not believe me, let me tell you that this movie is one of the 5 worst films I've ever seen, and it comes from the guy who owns Gigli, Soul Plane, Manos: The Hands of Destiny, Skullduggery, and any number of other pieces of shit that have been put on film. Please do not leave!
