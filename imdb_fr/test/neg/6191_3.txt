Pepe le Moko, played by Charles Boyer, is a kind of international criminal brain sought after in countries all over Europe. To stay free, he hides in the Kasbah, a mysterious district of Algiers where even the police hesitate to become a superior officer is sent from Paris to capture the Moko once and for all. For the Moko, although the Kasbah allows him to stay out of the police custody, it also becomes a kind of prison at the same time - a place he can not leave, because when he does, he knows he will be arrested. <br /> <br /> Boyer's performance has been good and I can understand why he was nominated for an Oscar. It captures the essence of such a character - a perfect combination of very dangerous yet chic at the same time. The film itself, unfortunately, was a disappointment. A number of parts of the story seemed inconsistent, of which I will mention two. The first was the idea that the police would not enter the Casbah. This was made quite clear at the beginning of the film by the local commander, and yet repeated references in the film suggest that in fact the police have entered the Casbah fairly regularly. Thus, neither Commissioner Jan's suggestion to invite the police to enter nor Inspector Slimane's statement (also a decent Joseph Calleia performance) that they could enter the Casbah but not go out seemed to make a lot of sense. . I also had a hard time believing that the hardened Moko - a hardened criminal brain - could be swept away so quickly by Gaby (Hedy Lamarr) to the point of entertaining the locals by singing love songs before leaving the Casbah. to find it, give yourself essentially. I understand the irony of the last scenes, of course, while Pepe leaves the freedom of his prison (the Kasbah) to regain real freedom during his capture (because he was killed by the police.) Believe that someone like The Moko would fall into such a trap. <br /> <br /> It's worth watching Boyer and, to a lesser extent, Calleia, but the story is disappointing and inconsistent. 3/10
