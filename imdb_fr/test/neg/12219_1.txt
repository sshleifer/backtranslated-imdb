It may be just the format of this film, a documentary, but I think the film would have been much better served by good actors and a stronger dialogue. The fact that the actors are also the owners of the company is a double-edged sword. They know better than anyone the emotions and the complexity of the business in which they were, but as they are not professional actors, they transmit these emotions badly and the documentary suffers. There were some really memorable scenes in this movie and a lot of good aftershocks but they were delivered so badly that they will fade away with time and the only memory I will keep of this documentary is that it contains good scenes of which I do not remember anymore. . <br /> <br /> Look at this if you want a personal account of .com's collapse and see what happened to the 99% of people in the industry who did not become millions of instant dollars. However, get ready for nauseating camera work, mediocre acting, mediocre dialogue, and a bad movie that embodies the era of the Internet boom.
