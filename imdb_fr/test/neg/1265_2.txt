I came across a rare copy of this first film Almodovar with high expectations - Almodovar is a prolific contemporary filmmaker, I enjoyed his 1988 film "Women on the brink of nervous breakdown", and I had read one or two very positive reviews of the film. Well, I must have completely missed the humor that critics have seen in this movie. I just found it incoherent, tasteless and boring. Yes, there is a lot of innuendo, dredging, and gross sexual situations, and yes, these elements may have shocked the audience in 1982 (which was almost certainly Almodovar's intention), but great Part of the value of the shock has probably eroded over the years, leaving a pouting story. Beyond that, the whole movie seemed very chaotic, none of the characters were particularly nice, and for a "comedy" - even dark ", I just did not find this funny movie. that there is a VERY selected audience for a movie like this, but I'm just not part of that audience and I'm not sure I want it.
