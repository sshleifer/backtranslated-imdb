I'm not a purist of Jane Austen, but why make a film like this if you have nothing to say. <br /> <br /> Billie Piper was so wrong that it's hard to know where to start - bad personality, modern makeup, hair completely wrong (it's impossible for a young woman her age to be unleashed in public with her loose and brushless hair like that), she did not seem particularly gentle or insulted by the family and I did not understand why everyone seemed to think of her as particularly holy or kind. <br /> <br /> The picnic (replaced by the balloon) was so small that it was embarrassing to watch and miss the Portsmouth section. destroys the sense of the room (as well as lost scenes that could have added a counterpoint to this pink living room, so claustrophobic.) <br /> <br /> To those responsible: -If you have not imagined (even the budget matters less) than to do something meaningful with an adaptation please do not pretend to be pruring Jane Austen. <br /> <br /> He was about 10% at Mansfield Park and 90% nothing at all <br /> <br /> PS Edmund was very good
