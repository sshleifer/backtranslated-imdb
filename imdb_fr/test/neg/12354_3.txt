Charlie Chaplin responds to open auditions at Lodestone Studios. The rival Ben Turpin arrives in the same studio, obviously another comic unemployed! Turpin tries to pin down Chaplin's action after the head of the studio exclaims: "Next!" Chaplin manages to enter Turpin, however. Charlie is a fun way to spoil jobs as an actor and carpenter. In the end, he gets a big break, but a star will she be born? <br /> <br /> There are many jokes on the buttocks. The initial scene featuring geniuses Chaplin and Turpin is a relative strength. Note that Gloria Swanson is the typist in the background to the left of your screen, at the opening of the movie. Agnes Ayres also appears. <br /> <br /> *** His new job (01/02/15) Charles Chaplin ~ Charlie Chaplin, Ben Turpin, Charlotte Mineau
