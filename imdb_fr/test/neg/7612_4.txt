I found this film extremely disturbing. Treadwell is delusional and disturbed, to the point of probably suffering from a mental illness. The film shown is him and not an actor, but yet he shows a behavior that resulted in death. Is it appropriate to show real pictures of a suicide? Let's not mince our words. The film shows behavioral sequences that directly led to his death. <br /> <br /> For those who think that Treadwell is a kind of hero, think again. The film he shot speaks of him and not bears and foxes he claimed to help. He did not do any meaningful research on their habits or numbers and did nothing to protect them. All he did was run into the bush and convince himself that he was better than the others. The reality is that by helping to desensitize animals to humans, he exposed them to great risks. His indulgent behavior did not cause his own death, but also the death of his companion Amy and exposed his beloved bears and foxes to greater prejudice. <br /> <br /> But I am also concerned about the behavior of Werner Herzog when compiling this film as he did. <br /> <br /> A friend and I had a long argument about this movie, which loved this movie. He thinks that seriously disturbed people address interesting topics and cites the movie Downfall as an example. But at the fall, they use actors. We have not seen the real Madga Goebell put cyanide capsules in the mouths of her own children. <br /> <br /> There was something about the use of real video in Grizzly Man that reminded me of that horrible football stadium tragedy where people were crushed to death and the photographers who could have helped, have chosen to simply continue to record the horror. <br /> <br /> Herzog's film shows us that Treadwell's pictures speak more of Treadwell. But Herzog did the same thing. His own personality and his opinions are exposed in this documentary, which is supposed to concern someone else. Scenes such as the one where he listens to the tape are not necessary. We already knew what was on the tape because the coroner had told us. We did not need Herzog to shed a tear with one of Treadwell's old friends. It did not add to the movie. <br /> <br /> The film showed us that Treadwell was very indulgent, but he also showed us that Herzog was too.
