It's so depressing that filmmakers are trying to be cool and it's so obvious here. This has risky dialogues, shared screens hard to watch and a lot of blunders in this attempt to be a period and autobiographical film. This film should be avoided at all costs. I was told not to go see this movie. I wish I had listened.
