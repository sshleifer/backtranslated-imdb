This film worked well at the box office, and the producers of this mess thought that the stars had such chemistry in the film that they found themselves in the much darker stuffing of the dumpling, The Gazebo. Frankly, I'm shocked to see all the positive comments about this ridiculously ridiculous comedy. The two main characters have the maturity of seven years and are much less interesting. Fred Clark, Harry Morgan and Eva Gabor provide outstanding support. And, the beautiful cinematography certainly gives the lush Spanish countryside. And, there are four or five really fun scenes to do with two wise scenes and a whole lot of recycled and insignificant clutter. <br /> <br /> I can not recommend It Started With A Kiss.
