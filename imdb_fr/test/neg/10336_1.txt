I will not go into detail about why this movie deserves a bad rating, many others have already done so. I'll just say that on more than 400 DVD movies, it's the only one I got rid of, it was so bad that I could not see any film anymore. <However, I have a comment on the ridiculously high average score of 2.9 (at 3-15-06). While browsing the 4 pages of opinion, I saw no note higher than 3 stars. By consulting the voting history, 78% of users gave 4 stars or less to the movie. It seems to me that some people have stuffed the urn to keep this movie off the list of "last 100" IMDb. It would be interesting to see how many of the 30 users who rated this movie's 10-star movie (none of those who wrote a review of the movie) are actual active users. <br /> <br /> Do not be fooled, this movie is not worth your time.
