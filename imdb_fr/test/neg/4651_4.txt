It's certainly not a good movie, but it's nowhere as bad as some would say. Nightmare in Wax tells the story of a man, disfigured in a typical flashback scene, taking revenge on direct and indirect loss-makers in his life - including the love and camaraderie of a beautiful young actress. Cameron Mitchell interprets the artist with his typical, though limited, flair. In fact, I thought he was giving one of his best performances. What does that mean exactly? Mitchell wears an eye patch, constantly smokes the cigarette, wears a colorful tunic and talks about his wax creations. These are not ordinary wax models, but people still alive controlled by a serum that makes them lose control of all neurological functions. They become zombies indeed. I thought the principle here was inventive. He has a ridiculous explanation, but serves the plot. It's a 60s film with a psychedelic movie-camera of Bud Townsend and company. The acting is mediocre but Mitchell, Scott Brady and Barry Kroeger give interesting turns. The wax figures of the bygone era in Hollywood are very effective and most outdoor shots have been very believable. The end of the film disappears into something not quite real - is another example of cultural cinema of the 60s, the end of the creativity of the writer. I rely on it. Despite its many flaws, I enjoyed the film. The opening scene showing an actor in the making nosedive has been carried out, as a pursuit by police on the seafront.
