It is unfortunate that a film with as good cinematography as this one does not contain any plot that is supported by the works of Sarah Cawley (cinematography) and Adam Lichtenstein (editing), and most importantly, no sense of what is happening at Mexico. City. The film tries to be a very realistic representation of city life, but it is unable to do so. It's a shame, a lot of lost movies. An American woman tries to find her brother who was kidnapped. The first story in the story is powerful and interesting, very realistic, but it seems that there has been no effort to better describe the ordeal, especially with regard to the attitude of the staff of the American embassy in Mexico. , when it comes to a problem like this. Compare, for example, with Frantic (1988), who discusses a similar problem. We can say something similar about the role of local authorities. Compare, for example, Todo el Poder (1999). The film is worth watching if you want to get an idea of ​​the city's own appearance, with little or no attention to the rather weak "plot" and the many twists and turns that require quite a lot of suspension. 'incredulity. Who will believe that a Mexican patrol from Mexico City will do everything to catch the main characters up to the US-Mexico border? And that this policeman will be able to use his radio of the border in Mexico! Only the producers of this film. It should be noted that, unlike Frida and other films about Mexico, at least those Mexicans speak Spanish.
