This is by far the worst movie I have ever seen. What were they thinking? Stop preaching to me already! That's why we all look at Walker Texas Ranger and do not admit it to our friends. Terrible actor and an extremely bogus plot. As the film unfolds, the story stops and the actors begin preaching in front of the audience. The director has somehow believed that the two are linked well. It looked like shit! When I saw the title at my local blockbusters, it seemed interesting. Their should have been a warning that he was religious instead of the fake publicity of an action / adventure. For the first time in a long time, I stopped a movie and I could not finish it.
