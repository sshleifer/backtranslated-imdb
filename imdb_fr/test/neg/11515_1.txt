I literally ran to watch him, waiting for a movie that would make me cry or touch my heart. <br /> <br /> What I found was not heartbreaking, but a lame exploitation of a powerful human character. <Br /> <br /> Intertwined between a pair of young lesbians and an obese man. <br /> <br /> In a setting that lacks sound, without forgetting the most common game. <br /> <br /> It was not quite BAD, because I saw the worst - and I left the cinema at $ 10 poorer but wiser - than a well-advertised movie did is not the same as a movie done well.
