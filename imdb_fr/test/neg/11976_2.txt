This is another terrible film of Mr. Boll that completely neglects the adaptation to the cinema of a video game. The way he continues to be hired to make movies is a constant surprise to me and obviously to most people who go to the movies. <br /> <br /> Overall, I will say that this attempt was slightly better than most of his previous attempts. Part of the dialogue was even half correct in Far Cry, although he was still misusing some sentences and in some cases he was not even using them correctly. <br /> <br /> Now, besides the fact that Jack Carver is supposed to be American and not German, Til was always amusing in this role. One exception is the ridiculously lame lines he uses to get to bed with the girl. And we are supposed to believe that she is willing to have sex with him in such a relaxed way after such a minimal dialogue? Emile? Simply there for comic relief, I'm sure and always lame. Jack's character looks old and tired, but he is still capable of the extreme acrobatics needed to avoid one of the modified super soldiers in the lab. <br /> <br /> Do not look at this one for Far Cry's adaptation. But you could lose an hour and a half watching it if you have nothing better to do.
