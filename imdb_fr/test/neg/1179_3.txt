This movie was really bad. First, they did not even follow the facts for that. Half of the film was composed and spoke instead of the deputy whose mother was one of the victims of Ed Gein. The acting was awful, except for the guy playing Ed Gein, but it's not hard to mess up a strange guy. Although I think it was horrible, I gave a three because they started with crime photos. it was the best part of the movie. As soon as the introduction of the film was over, the film deteriorated. The writer of this movie tried to spice it up, but it was not necessary. The story of Ed Gein is quite interesting without falsifying information.
