Boy, this movie is bad. And not funny, old-fashioned and fun either. Even MST3K could not help but be annoying, and it was also puzzling that everyone was doing it. But the most annoying part of this mess is the shrill and ugly voice of Ireland, which I was tired of listening to in the first five minutes. Not to mention how unattractive his character is. Even his father ran away and abandoned him! I can see why, frankly. If he had to listen to him moaning in his little mouse voice for more than a few minutes, he would have been tempted to hurt him a lot. As I was, at the end of the film. Moreover, she is useless and annoying. When she fell into the long hole in the earth at Alice in Wonderland, she would have been exhausted for the first ten minutes if this inexplicably Australian-born miner had not saved her from all the trials she was falling into. He should have just tied it to the Atlantean version of the railroad and finished it. And this underground Atlantis with the strange and confusing obsession of bone density, I have to ask: where did the light come from there? Did they have generators that mimic the sun? It does not matter. Anyway, there is no real plot, there is just a group of oddly costumed Gothic wannabees running around trying to catch Kathy (probably so they can stick a gag in her mouth ). Stupid and useless movie. Thank you Golan Globus, for this cinematic abomination. May you burn in the seventh ring of hell for all eternity.
