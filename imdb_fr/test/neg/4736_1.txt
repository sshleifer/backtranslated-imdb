I'm not even willing to vote for a single star for this shit, but IMDb does not have the same ranking option ... the worst movie I've ever watched. Movie Story 1. A Predatory Ship Crashes on Earth 2. Some are released and start killing humans. 3. A predator arrives on Earth and starts killing aliens and humans. 4. A jet throws a bomb and kills humans, aliens and predators. 5. Some humans find the cannon on the predator's shoulder. 6. The final administrators should consider paying the viewers back. If you still want to watch this movie, download it on a torrent site and say thank you for saving money .. all the film was shot in a dark corner of the earth, you only see dark shadows even in action scenes .. too much violence .. I did not expect a fox movie
