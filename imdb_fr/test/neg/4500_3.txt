Gamera vs Viras was made lazily and suffers to a great extent. <br /> <br /> Extraterrestrials try to seize the Earth and are arrested by Gamera. So they send another boat that manages to kidnap two young boys. The extraterrestrials then take control of Gamera and push him to attack humanity. <br /> <br /> First, I must say that I really enjoyed the monster fight at the end between Gamera and Viras. Viras looks like a big squid with a beak. He has no energy weopons and does not throw rays, but he can close the apendages above his head to create a sharp and pointed weopon. So all in all, it's not a bad monster to fight for Gamera and he's decent. Virera really hurts Gamera by stabbing his pointed head under his shell and I'm surprised that Gamera has survived. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Gamera vs. Viras decided to use the images from his previous films to save time. for this film. They show the battles between Gamera and Barugon and between Gamera and Gaos when the extraterrestrials watch Gameras' past battles. However, when they show Gamera's battles with Gaos, they first show the battle between Gamera and Gaos in the city, and then show the final battle between the two. After showing new images of the final battle between Gamera and Gaos, they show the FIRST battle between Gamera and Gaos !!! Talk about showing the battles in a non-chronological order. They did not even need to show the first fight they should have stopped just after showing the final fight between the two. <br /> <br /> Another problem is that they decide to show again images of Gamera attacking cities when the extraterrestrials order him to attack Tokyo. So, they show the scene of "Gamera vs Barugon" where he destroys the dam. After the show scenes of "Gamera The Invincible" which is a huge problem for me. Mainly because of the fact that "Gamera The Invincible" was in BLACK AND WHITE !!!! Using archive footage of a black and white movie in a COLOR movie is really lazy and it's not a good thing. <br /> <br /> The dubbing is still bad. The two little kids are not so boring, but it would be nice to see a Gamera movie that does not involve small children. <br /> <br /> The overuse of sequences from other Gamera films is therefore a deterrent for this film. The final fight is great, so I recommend going to the last ten minutes and watching this movie. The rest is something that has already been seen before.
