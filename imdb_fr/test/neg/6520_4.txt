There is nothing nasty or mean in this movie. It's terribly dull. Dull is the photography --- the movie looks old and faded and faded. Maybe it was even 16mm inflated to 35mm, do not know. Dull is the script, which is tedious and "Jules Pfeiffer". That's kind of a cocktail of the bosses of the 1960s, cool. Like our beatnik, the grandparents might have talked if they were trying to look really straight. The "slice of life" characters were mostly annoying. True, they were real, but if I wanted to see ordinary people doing ordinary, ordinary things, I would look at myself. I would not want to go to the movies and blow five pounds, and spend an evening watching someone else do it. <br /> <br /> I was expecting a funny and brilliant romantic comedy. What I had was what two smart and moderately talented 19- or 20-year-olds could have produced on their first day with a new video camera. <br /> <br /> I gave them a 4 out of 10 because it seems like someone tried, at least.
