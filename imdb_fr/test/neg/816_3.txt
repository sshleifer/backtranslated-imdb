I'm a fan of Boorman, but it's probably his least successful movie. Comedy has never been his forte, and here, his attempts to prank with balls are poorly done. Yet Boorman's eye for talent is worth a visit: it's one of Uma Thurman's first star roles and, as always, she's lovely to watch. (On a sad note, Boorman wrote the screenplay with his daughter, Telsche, who died a few years ago.)
