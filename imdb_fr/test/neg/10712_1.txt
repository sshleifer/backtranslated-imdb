It must be one of the worst movies in the Sci-Fi channel. This is how the movie begins. Women are the only humans on this planet because, in the not-too-distant future, chemical warfare is acceptable, provided it only targets soldiers (in case you're wondering, men). fires (Big shock) and all men on earth die slowly. All men are condemned to die when the president of Madame is shot and killed by a man. now that we are being led in about 60 to 70 years, two women scientists are working on the cloning of a little girl and one of them says, "Hey, why do not we bring back the men?" The other says no, the world is not ready for it, but ignores it quickly and that is how a man repeats the fault. <br /> <br /> First, this movie assumes that all men who are not genetically modified are blood thirsty monsters. Second, the writer forgot to mention that today's soldiers are a good mix of officers and men, so there is no reason to have such a virus. This is the biggest time limit you can find. This film managed to insult my intellect not only by the bad story, but with the Lifetime style game. Avoid this movie at all costs. <br /> <br /> I give it a 1 in 10 but only because I could not go lower.
