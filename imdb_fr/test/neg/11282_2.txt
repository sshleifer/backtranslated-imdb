I'm coming out of very few film screenings and this film has managed to become one of those I could not bear to watch any longer. As far as the rewards are concerned, the awards given by the Turkish festivals are not credible in my opinion. My only explanation for the Queens Festival prize was to think that a layer of comedy had been "gained in translation", the subtitles helping to distract from these dreadful executions. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the screening I attended, the presenter briefly talked about the history of Turkish cinema and said at one point that the first Turkish cinema was rightly called "cinema as many filmmakers and actors involved were spectators of the theater. <br /> <br /> Ironically, this film falls into this category. English-speakers who read subtitles may think that Turkish is a naturally strong language and attribute all the howling of the film to it, but observing indigenous commentators will immediately notice that all actors are playing with exaggerated voices. You can attribute this to the amateur nature of all the actors, but the biggest source of "screaming dialogues" is the main character, played by the only professional actor in the film. Unsurprisingly, his experience is in the theater. My hypothesis is that, in response to its noisy lines, all the other amateur actors have also made their voices heard, turning the whole film into a series of unnatural performances. <br /> <br /> a scenario that develops at a snail's pace, you get an extremely boring movie. <br /> <br /> I must say that I also have a personal problem with Turkish films that portray fully rural life with uneducated and uneducated characters. Since "Zugurt Aga", one of the best Turkish films ever made, Turkish filmmakers do not seem able to avoid the appeal of the rural part of the country. This is interesting only in small doses and if it is as well orchestrated with excellent writing and staging as in Zugurt Aga. However, most of the time, it is extremely boring and downright embarrassing for the native "urban" Turks. Rural communities are a neglected and under-educated part of the country. Although this provides good comedy material, it has a huge cost for the image of Turkey. <br /> <br /> Member of the Western audience whose only exposure to Turkey is this film will undoubtedly think that Turkey is like Afghanistan. I hope that the filmmakers realize this and give up their passion for the history of the "rural man" and remain faithful to the majority of the country, which lives in cities that shame the metropolitan areas of Europe.
