This film was Jerry Bruckheimer's idea of ​​selling records. No seriously it was. The idea behind this is that if you make a film full of pop songs, you can put the songs on an album, sell them and earn even more for the studio. You can also publish a few tracks in single and interconnect the promotional video with excerpts of the movie so that when MTV broadcasts a track, you get free advertising for the movie. It's a good deal, but an artistic disaster because many of us still have nightmares about Hollywood movies of the 1980s and I think the mid-1980s was the poorest period in artistic terms for American cinema. a 90-minute pop video instead of a movie-like movie <br /> <br /> Jennifer Beals plays dancer Alex Owens who works as a welder to make ends meet and where logic disappears with this choice of career. Welding is a fairly sophisticated profession, it is not an activity in which one learns in five minutes. There are other gaps in logic, such as ballet and "flash dance", which are similar. For example, if you are applying to become a ballet dancer and you are participating in a hot and dirty dance, the male judges may want to meet you after the audition, but you will not get the position. it's a bit like saying that scriptwriting, novel writing, and game writing are sort of the same when they're not. But I guess it does not matter to Jerry when he asked director Adrian Lyne to do the film. . In fact, Lyne is almost a very sexy movie, JenniferBeals is very sweet and innocent. Luckily, I explained why her face was very brightly lit up, while her figure was lit in a dark way, except when the camera was zooming in on her toned body. This is because a double of the body is used most of the time and frequently the double of the body is a man! I bet there are some naughty boys who feel guilty not to mention slightly disgusted to know that
