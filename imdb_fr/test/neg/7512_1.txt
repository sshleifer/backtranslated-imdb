If you like me to see this in a film history class or something like that in your school, try to convince your teacher to see something else. believe me, everything is better than this movie. it's slow, confusing, boring, badly built, gore, gringy, should I continue? The message is good, but I have seen them treated better in several other films. The acting game is not even good. This film is even more embarrassing because it starts out being funny (not intensional though) because of its surrealist story, but in the end it becomes uncomfortable to watch. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I feel 1 hour and 40 minutes of my life was stolen. Why would anyone want to watch a girl describe a trio for 10 minutes rather than watch her cross a traffic jam for 20 minutes, listen to a hippie who can make sheep appear, witness a kind of rape, then see the lead role female eating her husband. <br /> <br /> Honestly, this movie deserves only 1/10. And if you're not happy with my preview, I'm an open-minded guy and I like movies protesting with symbolism, but this movie was awful. make any excuse to avoid this movie.
