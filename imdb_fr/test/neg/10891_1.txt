There are movies that are so bad, they are good. Then there are movies like Rest Stop that should never have been shot because they are just terrible. <br /> <br /> A bad action, incomparable characters, a predictable plot and a supposed supernatural twist that adds nothing to the story are all key. failures. Some rather decent special effects are pretty much the only thing to note. <br /> <br /> I can not even bring myself to write a plot plan because all I really want to do here is to warn you not to waste your time and money in this movie. Do yourself a favor and do not even bother with this movie. It's an hour and a half of your life that you'll never come back. <br /> <br /> 1/10
