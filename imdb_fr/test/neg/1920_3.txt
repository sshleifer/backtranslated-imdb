Rich against poor. Big city or small town White collar against blue collar. These things are not original themes in the movies. Thus, when one chooses to involve these themes, the scenario of the situation must be very original or very good. He was neither one nor the other. I never believed in the novel of the two young lovers in this film. Neither convincing nor convincing, he just fell flat. Do not bother, even with a video rental.
