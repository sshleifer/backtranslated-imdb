I rented this pile of sewage in the hope of laughing. With a title like "Zombie Bikers from Detroit" and Dead Alive productions on the cover, you'd think it could be a funny / horrible movie, but no. It's the worst movie I've ever seen (and yes, I've seen all the movies from the Police Academy). The story (it's a joke in itself) and the dialogue are atrocious. The composition of the so-called zombies resembles the one they used with one of these two-dollar "Make it like a zombie kit" kits you buy from K-Mart. <br /> <br /> I would rather watch Beverly Hills 90210 while listening to the Backstreet Boys and be whipped by a 400-lb novelty birthday card model than get through another minute of that pathetic excuse for a DVD. Honestly, I could make a better movie with $ 3, a few popsicle sticks and a slinky. I feel as if 90 minutes of my life had been taken from me and taken to the land of Suction. I know the Dead Alive production tag does not guarantee a great movie, but you expect to get your money's worth. <br /> <br /> The only thing that made me happy (saving, turning over the horrible mass of elephant feces) was not titled "Biker Zombies from Pittsburgh". I feel for the people of Detroit who wasted their hard-earned money on this one. Unless you have been lobotomized? Do not buy, rent if you have to ?? But ?? You are going to regret it.
