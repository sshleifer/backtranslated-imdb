This movie was absolutely terrible. The only explanation I can think of the good reviews that some have received here is that they were written by cast members. It was really painful to watch this movie. Even my grandchildren (aged 6 to 13) could not bear to watch him. As far as I know, this film has never been shown in the cinema and for a good reason. It's like people are sitting around a beer and saying, "Hey, let's make a movie, who wants to go?" It's so bad. Apart from Luke Perry, who is only in a small part of the film, I did not recognize any other actor. This is not necessarily a bad thing but it is the case here. I liked Sandlot (I) and I usually like stupid and stupid movies, but this movie does not have a quality that redeems. The authors of this film have no idea how children think, speak or act and the film is an incoherent jumble of terribly ridiculous lines and stupid jokes. I rarely write negative reviews, but it's the worst film I've seen since Man's Best Friend and it's certainly one of the ten worst movies I've ever seen in my life. If you rent it, remember that I warned you. The fact that some people consider this film to be good is a sad commentary on their taste and intelligence. I am not exaggerating.
