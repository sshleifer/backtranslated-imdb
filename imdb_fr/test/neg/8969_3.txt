Any chance to see Katharine Hepburn in something I have not seen or since his film debut is a treat, and at this level, the movie is fun, but it's a bad idea for Hill Billy. His famous New England saying slips in, making phrases like: "I'd better roll Vittles" rather ridiculous. She is so pretty and so young ?? it almost overcomes this major flaw. The story is an old-fashioned melodrama and, therefore, a younger generation may think it's a pretty old-fashioned thing, but that's the essence of the American Entertainment show until the 1940s. his moments, but you may need to be an unconditional movie buff to appreciate it.
