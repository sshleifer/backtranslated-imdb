Take a bad scenario, a bad acting game and add a politically incorrect story of morality and what do you get? Something is supposed to go for a quality family visit. <br /> <br /> Seven Alone tells the story of a nineteenth-century family crisscrossing America in the carts in hope of a new life in Oregon. There are seven children (three boys, three girls and a baby whose sex I am not sure), hence the title of the film. <br /> <br /> The story opens when the family lives an apparently normal 19th life. century of life on a farm in the middle of nowhere. His eldest son, John, is an early teenager, "lazy and worthless," as his father constantly reminds him. We see from the outset that he has a penchant for practical jokes when he ties a string to the hair of his sleeping sisters and connects her to a nearby mule. When the mule is moved, of course, poor girls are shaken off the bed. John is caught by his father and is immediately punished with a strap. <br /> <br /> The same day, a train of cars passes. Pa is tempted to associate because it promises a new life in the wild west. The family seizes his belongings and leaves. <br /> <br /> From the beginning, the film seems weak and amateurish. The acting game is below the class, as if any of these movies shown to school on the pioneers. I can not blame the actors, because the replicas of this film are ridiculous and just too sweet and optimistic. <br /> <br /> I have to tell you that I caught this movie flipping through chains on a boring Saturday afternoon. on a Christian TV station. Not a religious spirit myself, I watched in horror as Seven Alone offered moral statements that were not only outdated, but quite offensive! If I were a good Christian, I hope I would have had the good sense to complain on TV for broadcasting such waste. However, because I am a cynical non-believer in the sense of naughty humor, I chose to sit and laugh silly. <br /> <br /> In one of the opening scenes, the role of the father as a severe rule of the house is established when he proposes the idea of ​​leaving for Oregon to his wife. His answer is heated "Above my dead body". I guess we expect to laugh as the film moves on to the next scene. Pa and Ma smile as he steers the trolley across the Prairies. Oh, I guess even the most fervent feminists should admit that this "father knows better" attitude was the norm at the time, and one could say that this dictatorial regime is necessary when living conditions are difficult, but I feel that this film has supported this idea, even for today. Beautiful message from a Christian television channel. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the situation is getting worse for the family and the moral integrity of the movies is further reduced. An Indian (or Native American) steals John while sleeping in a field. Like a common savage, the Indian takes John's clothes and belongings. Fortunately, Pa, with help from Kit Carson, is able to kill the Indian, as well as two of his delinquent friends. Kit Carson tells John that his father is a true hero. <br /> <br /> The family is accompanied by the resident doctor of the wagon train, Dr Dutch (played by Aldo Ray). He shares Pa's feelings about John, saying he is a useless brat. Maybe yes, but he also has the best thing about this movie. Aldo Ray's doctor is a jester, who seems unable to tie his own shoes, let alone treat one of the girls for a broken leg. Fortunately, the young child did not cry when the cart crashed and broke his leg in half, as Dr. Dutch did not seem to have the right habits at the bedside. We know the disadvantages of constantly belittling a child. Here is a movie that encourages this behavior. <br /> <br /> Later, Pa develops food poisoning, or something like that, I did not pay much attention and he dies. His deathbed scene is the stuff with which the game is awesome. Frankly, the man did not even look sick. <br /> <br /> Shortly after, mom dies too. The children are left to their own devices. And that's when the real adventure begins. By dragging him across the rapids, meeting more Indians (though they are good) and venturing on a snowy terrain, these kids do it all. And I was still thinking, "What a pile of garbage!" <br /> <br /> Sorry, but this movie was not redemptive. This small, prairie home on the budget is a shameful waste of time and an insult to "families" around the world. I am surprised that in 1975, at the end of the feminist movement, and at a time when the treatment of Native Americans is about to be focused, such a thing could actually be done. <br /> <br />
