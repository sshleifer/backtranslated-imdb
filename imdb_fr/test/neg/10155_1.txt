O boy, was it really bad? <br /> <br /> I saw it on a videotape. <br /> <br /> In the scenes where the music of the soundtrack was, it was difficult to hear the dialogue. When people were on the phone, it was difficult to hear the person on the other end. It appeared that at least two different types of film or video media were used, as colors and focus sometimes changed dramatically between montages. And there were a lot of fuzzy plans that did not seem intentional. <br /> <br /> One of the indicators of the budget (one among many others) was the broadcast of a report on television. There is just a title card "news flash" badly superimposed with a video effect on a television screen and a voiceover by a news presenter. They could not film a news presenter and then watch it on television. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a killer wearing a surgical scrub, a mask and a scalpel. Supposedly, it is a paranoid schizophrenic who escapes from the hospital to avoid getting a lobotomy. <br /> <br /> Students are left at school for a break and three young women decide to have a sleep party. Three guys decide to crush the party and a geek named Science decides to crush it too. The pajama party is rather boring, and the guys continue to appear at random, wearing masks, removing them and then disappearing. The mother and the father (the surgeon who had to do the lobotomy) of one of the girls continue to show up too. The killer hits people's throats without anyone really noticing it. The thread of the film seems more or less sleepwalk through the film. It may have been a bad action or perhaps an intention, because much of the film is a nightmare and part of that nightmare in a nightmare. <br /> <br /> The end is really horrible too. <br /> <br /> The best thing about the film is the lame frame United Home Video VHS, which was relaunched for the release of the DVD (a dual feature with Terror at Tenkiller). Honestly, I can not say whether it's a photo, a painting, or a combination of both. The women on the cover are not in the film and the clothes they wear are far more revealing than all the women in the film were wearing. The throat slit on the cover is more frightening than that of the movie - where people tend to have a blunder. Besides, that's what the killer has most of the time: head bent and wide-eyed, waving for the camera. Often, the scalpel was held close to the camera, while the killer masked face was close-up but blurred in the background.
