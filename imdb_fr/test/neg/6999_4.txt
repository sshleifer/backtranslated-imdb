Dare Rudd (John Wayne) and his sidekick Dink Hooley (Syd Saylor) are traveling cowpunchers who seem unable to stay in one place for a long time. In Helltown, the boys head for Montana, where they meet Rudd's cousin, Tom Fillmore (Johnny Mack Brown), who offers them a job. It's funny to see the boys wearing an apron as they start cooking with the flock, though Dare becomes self-conscious when Miss Judith (Marsha Hunt) goes to the camp. Judy is Tom's daughter, but the attraction between her and Dare is obvious from the beginning. <br /> <br /> Fillmore needs to move a herd of cattle and promote Dare Drive the Drive, partly to prove to Judy that he can not. to live up to the task. Meanwhile, the villain Bart Hammond (Monte Blue) stares at Fillmore's cattle, but when his henchmen fail to confuse the flock, he realizes it's easier to make money than Dare was paid at the end of the course. Knowing Dare in a rigged card game with his man Brady (James Craig), Dare's money begins to evaporate hand-to-hand. It's only when Dare does not show up at Fillmore Ranch that Tom goes looking for his cousin. Denouncing the tricks, Tom, Dare and Dink queue before the bad guys can take their revenge. <br /> <br /> "Helltown", also known as "Born to the West", was released in 1937 by Favorite Films Corporation, a few years after Wayne's Westerns series for Lone Star Productions. This only slightly modifies the Lone Star formula; Wayne has the girl at the end of the movie, but here he was trying. There is a big scene of runaway horses where Wayne saves Marsha Hunt, in which Johnny Mack Brown's horse makes a complete reversal. Syd Saylor does a good job as a comic book buddy, doing his best to sell lightning rods to unsuspecting victims. Here he replaces familiar faces such as George "Gabby" Hayes and Yakima Canutt, staples of the film Lone Star. The charisma of John Wayne begins to develop here, preparing him for the status of super star that he finally achieved. <br /> <br /> "Helltown" is based on a novel by legendary western author Zane Gray. If you're looking for more movies based on Gray's stories, try "Fighting Caravans" with Gary Cooper, "The Light of the Western Stars" with Victor Jory, "Drift Fence" with Buster Crabbe and "Heritage of the Desert" with Randolph.
