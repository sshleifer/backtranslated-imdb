"Imperium Nero" is the second film in the series of six productions entitled "Imperium". I already commented unfavorably the first: "Imperium Augustus". This second TV film produced and broadcast last weekend by the Italian state-owned network has the same flaws. In addition contains a considerable number of historical errors. Some examples: Nero is a child and Agrippina calls him: "Nero, Nero". At that time, his name was Claudius. He was named Nero after his adoption. Nero did not meet Act when he was young as in the film but after his marriage with Octavia and his appointment to the emperor. Becoming an emperor, his sons were not adults: Britannicus was a month old and Octavia a year old. And much more. If you like ancient Roman history, you can find other examples. The series "Imperium" will continue with four other films: "Titus", "Marcus Aurelius", "Costantinus" and "The Fall of the Roman Empire". Finally!
