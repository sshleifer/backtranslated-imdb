This film is a perfect example of how to treat a fascinating subject, gather 25 minutes of background material and extend it to create a six-hour borehole that looks like a documentary if Fox News decided to create it. Even the participants in this stubbornly obstinate film can not hide their laughter at the stupidity of their attempt to show one of the few great moments in world history where people take a stand and work to create a better world. If only the creators had talked with Ken Burns for 5 minutes, they might have released something slightly clever instead of this cure for insomnia.
