This film was completely and unequivocally terrible. The plot was so predictable and boring and the scenario so corny and pretentious that in the end I wanted to stab my eyes with the nearest pen. <br /> <br /> Normally, I do not write reviews, but I was surprised by the number of positive reviews he had. Although I admit that the game of actors was going well in some places, the weaknesses of the script far outweighed the acting. The only reason I watched this was that some of my friends watched it, probably presenting it as the worst movie of all time, judging by the trailer. We were not disappointed at all. Its only advantage was that it contained my new favorite collection line: <br /> <br /> BRANDON: I just want to meet you. <br /> <br /> GIRL: You just want to get into my pants. <br /> <br /> BRANDON: I want to enter your mind, your heart, your soul. I do not see you wearing pants in this equation. <br /> <br /> Overall, I would say that this film is the worst film I have ever seen and taken seriously.
