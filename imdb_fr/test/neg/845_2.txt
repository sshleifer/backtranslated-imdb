In 4 words, Captain Corelli's mandolin was "completely out of tune" with the book. The novel provided enough character background to understand the relationships and personal challenges that the characters had to overcome. the scriptwriter chose to ignore the details. By ignoring them (for example, the role of the priest at first as a jester, but later as spiritual leader, the bride's inability to read until a socialist rebel teaches her, the expert opinion on the Corelli bomb and its eventual ironic death) <br /> <br /> It was the first film that I left midway. Interesting cinematography, the big actors do not make a film; the story does.
