This rubber monster has failed to be cool, scary or even comical. It looks like a wannabe movie from Porkys or Animals House, but the footage and story is not always clear and can not catch your eye. As far as taste is concerned, the only thing that makes you laugh is the terrible rubber monsters that have to cost a dollar each, because their work never seems realistic, the movements and expressions give the Muppets the appearance of a 3D Pixar movie about this. Hope Marie Carlton is the only thing that makes this horrible film bearable, and when she dies in the movie, it turns even worse than before. A film that should only be seen in fast forward.
