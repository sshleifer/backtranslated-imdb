As the above suggests, I was finally not impressed by this film. It's beautiful to watch, the landscape is lush, but the details of the story, especially the characters, are totally incredible. Movies do not have to be credible, but movies like this, with a political advantage and a social commentary, do it. <br /> <br /> Similarly, commercialism as such does not pose a problem to me, but again, films like this one should not make a casting decision solely on the basis of a draw. This is absolutely the case of Sutherland, who is downright rude to Doyle. His focus was far from genuine, but he fell into the biggest trap of all, his focus is his performance, and we find ourselves with a caricature of irishness without personality outside of his nationality. I find it totally implausible that anyone involved thinks he is the best man for the job. All in all, this is an obvious case of commercial value for quality and when you try to be the Mission, this kind of thing spoils your chances of success. <br /> <br /> About accents, there was a two other problems, one being the striking modernity of Boy's accent, which dispelled the feeling of being transported to another time. More surprising was Samantha Morton's popular Irish accent, which was, to say the least, variable. His voice snaked between the strong north and the soft south, even in the voice-overs, where I would have expected such discrepancies to be detected. <br /> <br /> However, these reproaches are minor compared to Sarah's motivation and actions. She never seems to be at home with the English, and almost instantly with her son and her tribe, the dilemma between the life she has known and the life she offers if it just seems obvious. Maybe a lot of things were lost in the editing, maybe it was supposed to be a three-hour movie or a mini-series where these things could have been spelled out, but I can only judge what I 'have seen. <br /> <br /> Now, the biggest problem, Sarah (Morton) 's relationship with Doyle (Sutherland) is incomprehensible. The fact is that his affection for him is not conveyed in any way before having to choose between him and his son, the conflict that it goes through at that moment was frankly ridiculous and killed the movie for me. <br /> <br /> As you may have guessed. this film did not work for me at all, but it is excellent to watch, you will not really see anything more amazing in terms of scenery, there is good performance and my wife liked it.
