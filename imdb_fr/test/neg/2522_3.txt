This movie was really stupid and I thought it was not that bad and I could tolerate a movie about a people eating in bed. Then the near end where the guy has skeleton hands ended up being the icing on the cake of a bad movie. I could see the screws in the plastic skeleton hands for God's sake. The brother was still alive and moving when his hands were bare bones. The funny thing was that he could still move his hands, which was not right. Without muscles, you really can not move your hands but he did. The brother should have emptied his blood before even moving his hands. The movie was not great but it went to the stage of the hands. I laughed so hard that I did not really remember how it ended. It had something to do with foam or something like that.
