If there is one thing that I want to distinguish from other exciting reviews here is that I am the queen of looking for strange movies in Thrift and Dollar stores. That said, you can not imagine how happy I was when I found this one. <br /> <br /> I even remember that Saturday morning, when * each * station broadcast it simultaneously, so you were stuck if you wanted to watch something else (again, I guess it was idea). As a child, I did not know if I liked the way all the characters were stuck (there are crosses that simply do not work). But I guess the special had the intended effect. Do not use drugs because you are going to have nightmares about the Muppets. <br /> <br /> Now, if you look at this as an adult, you will be treated to the most * odd * anti-drug film. this side of "Reefer Madness". I think I'm just going to stop there before I start having problems.
