We are in the not-too-distant future, globalization seems to have reached its peak, languages ​​are blending (though English outweighs the rest), races have merged, human cloning is a fact and the whole territory seems to have been divided into two areas: the valid and the invalid ... a new world (in the style of Aldous Huxley) in which people are genetically classified and where blood relations are strictly prohibited (for reasons of health ??) is the code 46 of the title-). In such an environment, two souls destined not to meet fall in love with each other. <br /> <br /> Winterbottom has had an important story, with quite a lot of potential. A beautiful recipe that he destroys by giving it a slow rhythm, telling it tiredly, suppressing all emotions ... Coldness is all that Code 46 conveys. Cold and boredom. Even the presence of Samantha Morton and Tim Robbins (both play their roles perfectly), nor the visual and sonic power of certain sequences can do nothing to save the film. What a pity. <br /> <br /> Code 46: what could have been and never was it? <br /> <br /> * My vote: 4/10
