Well, it was probably a waste of Dave McKean's talents, was not it? Do not get me wrong: Dave McKean is perhaps the best in the world at the moment. The layered, textured look he can achieve with just a few pencil lines on rough paper makes the efforts of people like Peter Greenaway and David Fincher look like what they are: a hackwork. McKean was the godfather of a revolution in the look of comics, movies and even magazine ads that borrowed the distinctive collage effect he created. <br /> <br /> But this film? It's junk. Finish junk food. Neil Gaiman's story is, unfortunately, exactly what Gaiman has been offering us since he scampered Clive Barker for the first time: a pseudo-mythical and overflowing dream landscape, populated by characters who have capital letters in all capital letters. names. All allegory, to the point that it is impossible to obtain a human drama, an emotion or an empathy on the part of anyone. People make pithy postulations, enunciating riddles that recall what Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead might have looked like if Tom Stoppard had suffered a disabling stroke midway through his composition. Really, Gaiman, overcome yourself. You are not a prophet. You are a poser. <br /> <br /> McKean's direction does not help - its pace is mediocre, it takes half an hour to get to the main picaresque plot, and then simply provide a disconnected sequence of events, none of between them having no weight. Monsters do not threaten because they are not announced, just thrown on the screen. The plot does not participate because we do not really care about the little rancid protagonists. Half of the dialogue, inserted into the breastplate and the omnipresent masks, is incomprehensible. <br /> <br /> Some of the visuals are pretty, and I'm sure the fanboys will lick it. Pity. Think about how much really good work McKean could have done if he had not been stuck with this lame project. <br /> <br /> Grade: D / D-
