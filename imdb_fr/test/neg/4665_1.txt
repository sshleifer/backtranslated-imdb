This film has bad writing and bad editing. It's hard to follow what's going on because nothing of the characters makes sense. A major calamity occurs every 30 seconds. As a result, none of the "action" sequences are interesting at all. The film has two hours of "throw-away" scenes that are only linked by the fact that they share common actors. This movie does not even have enough humor to be a good "bad" movie.
