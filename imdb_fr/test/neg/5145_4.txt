This well-intentioned movie is a bit short and, unfortunately, in too many areas. <br /> <br /> The landscape is beautiful, with panoramic views of north-central Vermont providing the setting for this mid-century tale. Quebec Bill tries to find his whiskey past to save his farm. <br /> <br /> Moving back and forth between scenes of magical realism and frank action, this film rarely succeeds. <br /> <br /> Kris Kristofferson as a Quebecker Bill seems rather scalded, otherwise it is his replica; or his cross with Yankee and Quebec accents. Anyway, it just comes like a hard down shot. His dialogues with Gary Farmer's character Coville shine, however. The Kinneson Rat of William Sanderson is solid. Charlie McDermott shows real potential as a young Wild Bill; but his part is not big enough to carry a scene and he never steals it. Luis Guzman presents himself on Lake Memphramagog (with a beautiful interpretation of Lake Willoughby) in the guise of a monk with an accent not like boys: who knows? And then there is Bujold's Cordelia: an oracle like this that gave her her name, she channels Yoda as she sings lines like: "You'll marry a Quebecker!"?!? Simply too weird and far from being quite enigmatic. <br /> <br /> The end is really jerky. Still a bad mix of magic realism and concrete. And Yoda never provides an answer that we can understand.
