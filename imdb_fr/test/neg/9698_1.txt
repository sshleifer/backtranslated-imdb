NBC was fortunate enough to make a powerful religious epic such as "The Ten Commandments" and "The Greatest Story Ever Told", but instead chose to make a humorous cartoon that looked more like "Waterworld" than anything else. I do not remember a passage in the Bible where Lot turned into a pirate and attacked the ark, or a passage where Noah's son developed a serious friendship with an orange. commanding a naval fleet and revolving around shouting nautical terms like "hoist the pillar!" It was perhaps the worst marketing decision in history. Obviously, the majority of people who would look at this would be Jewish and Christian parents with their children, so why make the movie so shocking to these people? If they deliberately tried to offend, why not advertise it that way and at least get the attention of the right audience? I hope they will make a REAL film Noah one day, a serious and thoughtful film that will seduce people and bring them money. Until then, do not waste your time with this trash.
