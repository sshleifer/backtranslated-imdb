OK, so she does not have a caller ID. When you are hunted down, you get it! And no cell phone? When you are harassed, you get one if you are one of the few parents who work full time and who is the head of the household who does not already have one. This mother gets a big zero in the parenting department. So her mother is in the hospital and she decides that a shopping trip will help her. Just a stupid movie. Happy to have Tivo and an FF button on the remote. And with the minimum of 10 lines, I do not have much to say about such a bad movie. I guess I can ask why she keeps opening packages because she has no idea where they come from. The son did not add much to the film either. The cops were also a big zero. Now go to the nearest Verizon and collect the cell phone. @@
