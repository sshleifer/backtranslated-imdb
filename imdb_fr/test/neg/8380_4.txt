First, few colleges allow students to take classes given by their parents' lover. Secondly, few female teachers sleep with cooks in dormitories. Thirdly, few copper students have a father who cooks in their dormitory. Fourth, once a SECOND project team member from a small group of a college encounters a violent death, the PRESIDENT of the college will dissolve the whole class and DO NOT CLOSE the eyes when the teacher happily directs the rest from the group to terrible deaths. Since the supernatural elements of CULT have absolutely no meaning, it is useful to study the banal content of this film to really appreciate how bad this film really is!
