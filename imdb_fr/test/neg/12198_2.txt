I saw Hurlyburly on Broadway and I loved it. I do not know what happened with the movie version, because it was awful. Some dialogues that work on stage seem simply inconsistent on the screen. Anyway, I could not wait for this movie to be finished. The acting is universally excessive. Only Kevin Spacey has understood everything, and he seems to know that he is in a bad movie and he can not wait to get out.
