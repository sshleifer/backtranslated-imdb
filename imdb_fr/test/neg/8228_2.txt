I had chosen either on this film. This film is part of my list of sites not to be missed for a while because people have talked about "disturbing" and that the VHS box contains many quotes from people who say how "amazing" or "so" close "you can get to the Texas chainsaw massacre" and lines like that, but, sorry, I was very disappointed.The idea is interesting, but the scenario is under-developed that each character becomes a wrong creation of evolution and that people love the most stupid movies of the film. <br /> <br /> This in turn removes any credibility the plot may have otherwise had.I could not believe how much some sequences "Where is he, find it" are unnecessarily loooooong? A few bloody moments to please fans of Gore, but they are so few that they arrive, it is useless If Luther is a geek , so the filmmakers really have to be in the food chain.
