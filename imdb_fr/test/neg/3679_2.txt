During my stay in Madrid, I was able to see a copy of this film. Wow! Gallo is amazing. Very unusual performance he gives. Aside from Gallo's genius, the film is, however, a dull film that I have never seen in my life and is sometimes so badly done that it is almost laughable. I am also a fan of Val Kilmer, so he contributed to the reason why I made such a big effort to watch the film. The problem is that Val is really only in one scene. Having his name in the cast as the lead role is an insult to my intelligence and the rest of the cast. I only saw Stranded filmmakers from other films. Both films are well below average, but both contain very interesting performances for Vincent Gallo. If you're as much a fan of Gallo as I am, I'll see this movie, no matter what it's like. If you do not like Gallo, all you have left is ZERO to love.
