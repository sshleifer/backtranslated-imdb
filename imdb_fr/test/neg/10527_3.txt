This movie was disappointing. After 15 years, when some information about Mariel Hemingway was recalled, all the regrets I felt about the movie came back. Even though I remembered Peter O'Toole, I was not at all aware of the fact that the "directed" woman (okay, she was hardly anything else in the script) was Mrs. Hemingway . I saw this film at the time when I wrote film reviews and I warned people about it, because those stories simply did not work and fifteen years of subconscious subconscious attempt to fix things n still had no meaning. ideas. <br /> <br /> This can partly be related to the fact that after the original film was filmed (anyway), a publisher came in and tried to gather something from that. I do not know if it was a project of a former studio director and that the successor had sabotaged him to discredit him or if it was a disaster of the original scenario that had failed. The theatrical version just did not work.
