Flashdance is one of those horrible and stupid movies that you really enjoy, simply because they are so crappy. I just watched it on TV and my friend and I were amazed at how doped it was. It's true that Don Simpson and the other producers came up with the idea of ​​a cheap flick with lots of sweaty bodies to help sell a pop band (beautifully catchy). Flashdance is a strange pioneer: the first MTV film. Adrian Lyne started in advertising and it shows because Flashdance is almost an advertisement for himself. You have already decided to watch it, but the film has this strange and panicked current, as if it were afraid that you change your mind at any time. He continues to sell to you again and again, all along his journey, using a clever commercial style edition and glossy close-ups of ruffled breasts. The story is very thin (honestly, I can not think of another movie I've seen with less intrigue) and it never makes sense, but it's a very artificial and calculating movie, so she seems coherent. People say it's dated, but Flashdance has always been hogwash. In the early '80s, viewers knew it was just a lame T & A, but it works in its own way. There is a soppy romance for the crowd of chick films and piles of fat women wriggling for their appointments, all on a breathtaking disco beat. How could he fail? This helps that the dialogue is useless, so that you can catch a popcorn without forgetting anything major and, if this kind of thing is not your cup of tea, you can always laugh at the "interpretive dance" displayed. The scene where a Jennifer Beals lining was convulsed / "dancing" on stage in front of a television with a fan and a face full of white clown makeup has put us in a stalemate. A real guilty pleasure.
