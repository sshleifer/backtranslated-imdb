Most of Lorne Michaels's films seem to fail because they are essentially extended versions of sketches that have barely managed to make people laugh in five-minute segments. "Tommy Boy" is a character from "SNL" - an adorable fat guy (in their opinion) who knows nothing at all. <br /> <br /> David Spade gets the role of heartless upset. He is associated with Slob Overweight Slob and they endure miserable woes as they travel across the country to save Daddy's business. <br /> <br /> The plot, to begin with, is really wrong. The premise - the father dies and the rich and stupid son has to save the family business - can be traced back to just about any movie you want. Like any SNL style film, it is reduced to a simple motivation: empty, superficial; just a reason to see a beefy guy and a slim guy become "funny" together. <br /> <br /> The biggest "influence" of the film is the 1987 comedy classic "Planes, Trains & Automobiles". This film is great because the plot is neither bland nor recycled. It's basic, yeah - a guy coming home for Thanksgiving is trapped. But it's real, damn it. That makes all the difference. The characters are real, the situations are much more real. "Tommy Boy" is a pure slapstick and his ridiculous situations undermine the characters - we do not feel anything for them, and we do not care what happens on the screen. "PTA" worked well between scandalous and quite credible and questionable - "Tommy Boy" is simply absurd, with jokes like a simple deer with the headlights turning into a crash that turns into a fight with a dead stag. is not really dead, then wakes up and destroys their car. <br /> <br /> The whole destroyed car is stolen completely at "PTA" and it's strange how much this movie really looks like Steve Martin / John Candy movie. <br /> <br /> Farley is just too obnoxious to be kind - I never liked to watch him in movies and that did not change my mind. Spade has very little to do and plays the role of the most ungrateful character of the film. <br /> <br /> Dan Aykroyd is doomed as an evil Bad Badie who plans to destroy Daddy's activities. The end is a joke, and not in a "har-har funny" way. More like a "oh my god are they serious ?!" <br /> <br /> Some people dig it, it's cool. But I just can not get in, and I do not appreciate anything he borrows - not just PT & A - without any credit.
