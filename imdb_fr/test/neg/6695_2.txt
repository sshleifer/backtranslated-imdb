<br /> <br /> I was interested in this film not because I'm a fan of American basketball (I rarely watch NBA games), but rather because I'm a fan of Gene Hackman, who usually manages to bring an impressive depth to his performances. In this case, however, I was deeply disappointed. He was not one of the bright stars in Hackman's career. <br /> <br /> In all honesty, he did not have much work with him. As the new coach of a high school basketball team in a small Indiana town, Norman Dale was not expected to play a lot. Basically, his performance consisted of pacing backstage in basketball, blaming the referees. To be honest, I did not find him particularly credible in the role. I was not impressed by the love between Dale and Myra Fleener (Barbara Hershey). Honestly, there was absolutely no chemistry between Hackman and Hershey. The romance never caught my attention, any more than the "action" of basketball, which was quite predictable. <br /> <br /> There were too many problems with this movie to make it worth it. I never understood the depth of hatred that so many city dwellers had for Dale almost since his arrival. The development of the character was mediocre and the story itself was undeveloped. Too much basketball and not enough human interaction, in my opinion. How many plans of children pulling baskets do we need to see to understand that this is a basketball movie? There was no suspense: is it possible to doubt that Hickory wins the big one? I realize this is based on a true story, but I guess it proves that all true stories should not be a movie. Frankly, it was just not a very interesting movie. It's certainly a film that Gene Hackman would like to forget. <br /> <br /> Nothing better than a 2/10 in my opinion.
