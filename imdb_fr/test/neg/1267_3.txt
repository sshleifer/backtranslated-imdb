The film is powerful as a political statement on extraordinary renditions, torture and the politics of the war on terror. Others have already commented on these and other aspects of the film. My review may contain spoilers, so if you have not seen the movie, you may not want to read beyond that point. <br /> <br /> The film raises several questions. First, was the protagonist guilty or not? There is no satisfactory explanation why the NSA decided to have it picked up and returned in the first place. Is there an innocent explanation for why he received calls from what the NSA considers a terrorist? If so, the film does not seem to give one and this made the film quite unsatisfactory for me. It's fine to say if the torture is good or not, but show me first that they tortured the wrong person, we'll move on to the next step. <br /> <br /> If the protagonist was guilty, then what was accomplished by releasing him? Perhaps we have been well trained to resist to a certain extent and then claim to collapse and give answers that could be falsified by a bit of research, thus tending to make the torturers believe that they had tortured a man. innocent without being really guilty. However, nothing in the film proves that he is guilty either. <br /> <br /> The remaining problems are: 1. A CIA agent sees the release and brings him home. What prevents the NSA from taking it back? A little advertising in the Washington Post? Please, give me a break here ... If a senator does not want to stand in line to intervene on his behalf, what does Corinne Whitman have to fear? 2. If the NSA has researched which phone numbers have been called by whom, why can not they listen to some of the calls to determine if something sneaky is being discussed? 3. The plot is even more stupid. Any criminal with more than a dozen brain cells would compromise with his criminal enterprise on an anonymous prepaid cell phone line, not on a line that could be traced back to him and his home. the hearts of the viewers slip on showing graphic and free torture scenes. But when you think about it more deeply, there is nothing substantial in this film, there are only many unanswered questions and the feeling of "what's that ?!" at the end of the film.
