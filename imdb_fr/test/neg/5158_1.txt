Worst film ever !! It's not smart or funny or provoking thought. 84 minutes of bad actors doing their best with a terrible scenario. <br /> <br /> Playing was so bad that you can see the dead breathing. <br /> <br /> Maybe the scriptwriter / director combination believed Quentin Tarantino or something else (you know how to make a movie about nothing cool yet) but failed miserably. <br /> <br /> I hope the writer will never make another film EVER !! Everyone is not born a writer, sometimes we have to count our losses and become a bathroom attendant or something else. <br /> <br /> Do not watch this movie, even when the sound of the channel is still painful for 84 minutes.
