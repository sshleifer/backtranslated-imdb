It is a film about a black man who buys an airline and transforms it into a high-end airliner centered on Africa. They even describe the owner as being not only the control of the airline, but also part of the airport terminal. One day, this guy earns $ 100 million the next time you see him, he walks around the airport acting as the owner of the airport. Everyone calls this movie a parody, but nothing about this film is a parody! This film is a flop and will be forever in the $ 4.95 bins of Wal-Mart. <br /> <br /> I can not even understand why MGM would waste $ 16 million on this film. This film does not even justify the direct video status. Writers (black and white) should be banned from Hollywood forever. Not only do they over-stereotype blacks, but they describe them as ignorant human beings. I would be ashamed to go into a movie that humiliates me constantly. Do not waste your time at the video store, Wal-Mart, pay-per-view or a Sunday afternoon when the movie is broadcast on TBS.
