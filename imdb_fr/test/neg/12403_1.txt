It's one of those movies where the actor, the venue, the direction and the effects are so painful that you have to rent a copy for 5 or 6 friends, a barrel of beer, sit down and watch it. To borrow from the late Douglas Adams, "Watching this movie will be like being brainwashed by a slice of lemon ... wrapped around a large golden brick". <br /> <br /> What is the problem? All. British actors posing as Americans, many are successful, like Bob Hoskins, but it is not part of it. It was not even necessary to choose North America as a location, why not say that it happened in England or elsewhere? The director seemed to prefer taking pictures of boobs and asses of girls than to find a motivation for the character. So at this point, your drunk friends will say, "ALL RIGHTS! Another T & A Shot!" There are not many dialogues, so do not hesitate to go to the kitchen and prepare these sandwiches. What did I like in this movie? After my friends fainted, I managed to get $ 185 back and tell them they had spent it at the bar after they finished watching the awful movie.
