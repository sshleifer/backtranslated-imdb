The future of fantasy has never been so dark! Christopher Lambert manages to fight the devilish demon Grendel in this spooky spooky epic. "Epos" I said? Uh ... there's only one place, so you can not really talk about an epic adventure, are you? The location is a medieval / futuristic 5 inch castle, so how did they manage to crowd with all the actors? Oh, I understand, those where special effects. A miniature Silly me. <br /> <br /> Here are some reasons you will want or will NOT want to watch this movie: <br /> <br /> - Lambert manages to redo his tricks with his sword as he did at Highlander. <br /> <br /> - The sets and costumes are incredibly cool (if you are 12 years old). <br /> <br /> - Rhona Mitra has a voluptuous pair of knockers that she likes to show throughout the film. <br /> <br /> - ... uh, Christopher Lambert has white hair ... <br /> <br /> - Every time they start fighting, the crazy techno soundtrack starts . So why are these medieval killers fighting when they should be dancing? <br /> <br /> - They do not have electricity in this castle but speakers are installed, which seems to work well. So where is the amplifier? I guess they borrowed it from the techno-dj who delivered the soundtrack. <br /> <br /> - Watch for the climax at the end that features a scandalous demonoid CGI creature straight out of a survival and horror game on Playstation 2. <br /> <br /> If all this interests you, go look at it (at your own risk), but do not tell anyone, I already told you. I strongly suspect Pinhead to go on the set during the shoot, because this film has no soul. Anyway, if you want to see the beautiful Rohna Mitra really show some skin, then watch Paul Verhoeven's HOLLOW MAN.
