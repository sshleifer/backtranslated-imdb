My god ... I have not seen such a horrible movie for a long time ... I've seen it last night and I wanted to leave after 20 minutes ... keira knightley is really trying very hard I do not can not stand it ... from his accent from time to time and he did not have the charisma to fulfill that role ... the role played by the millers of Sienna will take you to a point where you start to wonder: has she ever taken theater lessons? judging by the edge of love, she has never been in acting class, but should consider going there in the near future ... they look really pretty ... c ' Maybe that's what they should focus on in their future career ... if they can be actresses anyone can!
