It's a disaster movie, in both senses of the word. Every character, every role, every conversation, every turn, everything in this movie stinks a lot. It's a shame to see the talent of Dennis Hopper wasted in this dreadful film. I can give you hundreds of examples, but see for yourself. <br /> <br /> Or rather: do not do it.
