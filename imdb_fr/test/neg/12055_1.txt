But I can not say what I really feel about this pile of smoking manure. Where to start The quality of the film, there is none. I saw clearer images on America's MOST AMAZING DOMESTIC VIDEOS! The game of actors is below the standards, the effects of gore are good. The clown mask is the best part of this movie, the story is repetitive. The same thing over and over again. At least on a Friday the 13th or HALLOWEEN, we stick to a main character for the most part. There are no main characters, just victims. Dude, now we come to the worst. The last survivor kills the clown and discovers that he was one of his friends. Then when the police finally arrive, they do not believe her and she is locked in a rubber room. What kind of end do you call it, shit, what is it? In my opinion, there is no excuse for a bad end in a horror movie, it was just a sloppy handwriting. The excuse, "it must end badly, it's a horror movie." or "We must end it if we want to leave a sequel", they are only lame excuses and that's all. I must give the camp the blood the generous turkey turkey.
