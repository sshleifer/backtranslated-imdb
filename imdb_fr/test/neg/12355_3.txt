I must add a comment to this one !!! <br /> <br /> First, ironically, we must add "the spolier alert" to comply with IMDb parameters, but there is absolutely nothing here to "spoil". <There are six characters: the pretty girl whose mountain guide is classified in the "climb" zone and apparently among all the guides (including the Mount Everest Sherpas) of the planet; his lost love, which has disappeared from the pass entitled two years before, which the party is supposedly seeking, but never finds; her shop owner friend, also a guide, who may be better than a Sherpa but who does not look like her; the strange main actor who engages his services and says that they will find his long-missing love in the market; his only partner, a hacker with so-called unlimited expertise, of a level sufficient for Gates to seek his advice; and his other colleague, a bodyguard who seems to have an IQ not nearly three digits. <br /> <br /> There are of course harmful actions, and the secret quest of the main actor is to recover the satellite that has fallen into the "Pass" and which has unique data and that modify the world to bring them untold wealth. Exactly what is never revealed. <br /> <br /> Abuse of practice abounds, the script looks like something that could get a C- in a first year writing course (but an F if submitted to a higher level), and the thespians eat up every scene like a horde of beavers. <br /> <br /> The most interesting aspect of this film was to juxtapose portions with three other films or roles that I saw. <br /> <br /> First, The mysterious secret data, undisclosed, recall "The Spanish prisoner", a film A-list / Mamet, surrounding a precious "process" of enterprise ", which has never been it's definitely not the case here. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the lead biscuit turned out to be even more ingenious than "Rambo" to treat quickly when threatened later in the presentation. <br /> Third, I remember a Steven Seagal (he does not remember the title), where he was half conscious and resided about a third of the time , and completely comatose for another third, although I did not look very much for his work, I saw enough to see that he was comatose but that he was providing the best work he had ever done and that it corresponded most to his terse character. watched over, the young hacker was perhaps the most attractive personality on the screen, but indisposed and unable during the last part and unable to emotion, he provided the best acting during these two hours seemingly without end. <Br /> <br /> Take the slim and stupid base for a plot here. Imagine this being compressed into, say, a title on SNL, with Gilda Radner, Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd and Martin Short in all four roles. Here, they could get record laughs by making few changes to the dialogue. <br /> <br /> The most interesting aspect of the last analysis is to determine what information could have been in the spy satellite worth "even billions". many nations, yet rendered worthless (according to the hacker guru) so simply placed on the Internet, with no apparent consequences thereafter? Even a turkey like this should have at least a small trace of logic somewhere. This one is totally lacking.
