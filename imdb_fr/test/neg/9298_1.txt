I like Ben Kingsley and Tea Leoni. However, it's easily the worst film I've seen in 10 years and I see my share of movies. A stench. It's a bad idea for a badly executed movie. Nothing is funny, credible or interesting. I was looking for wit, irony and genuine humor. Instead, it seemed like most of the cast members were going to the set to do a favor at Tea Leoni. It's a pity that such talent as an actor was wasted in such a state of hollow. Do not bother yourself. I wonder what opinion the directors of this film have of their public who submits them to the idea of ​​Polish gangsters in Buffalo, New York, who sends a murderer on contract to become a mortuary assistant during a AA meeting. Bill Pullman should start reading the scripts before agreeing to play in a movie. Sad.
