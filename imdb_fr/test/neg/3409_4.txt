First of all to say that I did not have the edition I thought - I chose the Italian version rather than the R2, but what really happened is a British version of 1998 - claiming to be a special edition - I did not know there DVD release in the UK - but the promised biogs are not actually on the disc - just a few trailers. Anyway - as far as the film itself - as I was recovering from "Night Train Murders", my second thriller on female genital mutilation is aired the same month - this time in (an Italian ) British nubile schoolgirls are offended and Professor Fabio Testi - (unfortunately) married but nailing one of his students - becomes the prime suspect. Joachim Fuchsberger is the detective in charge of the case. Sorry to say I was less than fascinated. It was observable but more than completely missing, and apart from the aforementioned macabre character of the crime, the "surprise" assassination of Cristina Galbo who had been "spoiled" by the DVD cover that spoke to me about it - Grrrrrr !!!! and a surprise that shed new light on the "victims" - I thought it was very common. Itwont put me out of both "suites" though. with Karin (Hannibal Brooks) Baal and Camille (I spit on your grave ") Keaton.
