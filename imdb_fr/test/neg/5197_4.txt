I feel at odds with this film - it's one of the most beautiful films I've seen and it takes a shrewd look at a lost culture. There was an early scene of men in headdresses and mustaches sitting around a table, with a woman serving, and an accordion playing, that made me cry, just because of the way he captured a way of life which must be incomprehensible to many today. It portrays the characters' lives as inextricably linked to village life, another concept lost in today's world. The symbolism is always fun but it seemed a little old-fashioned. The fatal flaws of the film for me were the lack of any compelling dramatic motivation and a total lack of humor. I never had the feeling of knowing any of the characters beyond very basic universal things such as mourning the loss of a loved one, and so on. The characters were stick figures in the director's paintings of natural disasters, war, and so on. The film was a beautiful film scene tragic after another, without narrative wire or humanity. As a result, it seemed very abstract, unrelated to the lives of real people. In the end, I was bored too much to watch.
