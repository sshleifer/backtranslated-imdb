This film shows the brief moments between a mother and her son in rural Russia while she is dying. <br /> <br /> I'm so teased between being nice to the movie or declaring it a patience test. On the one hand, the film is beautiful, the sparse dialogue capturing the essence of their feelings. There is really nothing to say because everything that needs to be said goes beyond words. The son shows so much attention, love and patience towards his mother that I think it is a celebration of unconditional love for his family. It also reminds me cruelly that I could be in such a situation, stuck in a place without joy, having to take care of a very sick person. "Mat I Syn" is a cruel reality. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, "Mat I Syn" moves too slowly. Do I really have to watch a train on the horizon for more than a minute? With my previous experience of "Telets" and "Aleksandra", I am so tempted to put "Mat I Syn" among them as a total boredom. <br /> <br /> I guess you have to be in the right state of mind to enjoy this movie. I can see beauty, but I may not be in the right frame of mind.
