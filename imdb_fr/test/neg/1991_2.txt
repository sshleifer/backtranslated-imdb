I have to wonder if films like this are supported by people associated with the film itself that comes here to criticize it. How can such a terrible thing reach such a score? My parents went to see a lot of more adult-themed movies when we were kids, anything with a R in until we're old enough. I only remember two movies that made them say yuck! when they arrived at home. This one, and "Catch-22". <br /> <br /> The film is made up of scruffy doctors and employees in a filthy hospital, traveling stories and a group of downtown people (who look like 1970s releases Norman Lear sitcom ) organizing a demonstration. The worst is the "mystery of murder", a crazy old man who does "God's work" by killing doctors and others. When he confesses, Scott and his girlfriend show little emotion. They only care about his exit from where he will be "safe and happy". A doctor who falls dead from a heart attack is simulated like the man so he can get away with it. Oh, my god, what a fun movie. <br /> <br /> This film did not make me think, giggle or have a feeling other than "it must be better", but it never does. People are wondering why it was a failure, not surprising here. I wonder how IMDb has enough members who think this movie is good. Yesh.
