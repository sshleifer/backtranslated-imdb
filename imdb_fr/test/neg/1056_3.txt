Sorry not to agree with you, but I found the DKC series quite interesting. So much so that I have invested in the SNES system and in my own copies of the games. It's been almost ten years since DKC 1 came out. The graphics were revolutionary for their time, the first vector graphics games for home systems. The music and characters are all memorable, and the games have brought me and my girlfriend dozens of hours of entertainment. Admittedly, the second game was better than the first and the third was perhaps missing the "edge" of the second installment. But all three offered different games, and I still enjoy them today. By the way, I'm old enough to remember when there were NO video games (and the TVs were black and white!).
