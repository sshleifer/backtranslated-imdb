This entry does not contain a spoiler. It is not obligated. The film is as predictable as the sunrise. The element in Alien's early films was the suspense that something could happen. This was the case in the first two films of Predator, although less widespread. Requiem totally eliminated the element of suspense and replaced it with blood and blood. You know that people will die (well, it's an AVSP movie), but you know that WHO will die and WHEN they will die, AND OR they will die before it happens. The directors should take a lesson from Hitchcock who said: "The suspense is not a time bomb under a table, the suspense is a bomb does not fire under the table". What is the meaning of going in a movie when you know exactly what will happen and when? If you really want to watch this movie, wait for it to be on video, then RENT IT, but I will never buy it.
