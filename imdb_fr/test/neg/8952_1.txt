This TV show is perhaps the most pathetic display of shit on TV today. Horribly predictable and obscene use of slow motion photography, cheese tales. Chuck Norris is an abomination that should never have been allowed to be filmed. The way he chooses to make every episode a public service announcement is really annoying. His game is so bad that it embarrasses a person. I will give some credit to the series ... sometimes it can be fun, but not enough to make a difference. With all the negatives of this series, I always prefer it to reality TV, it can not really become more useless than that.
