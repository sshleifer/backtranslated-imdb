John Hughes, who was once very talented, will soon realize a film with the sperm of "Look Who's Talking" if his stars are rejuvenating. It recycles the 'Home Alone' formula again to produce this silly comedy in which a baby makes its way around Chicago while incompetent kidnappers, Joe Mantegna, Joe Pantoliano and Brian Haley, try to catch him on the way, enduring a lot of fatigue. If Mantegna and Pantoliano can not seem to laugh somewhere in your movie, you have a problem, but the slowness of the movie is particularly striking in scenes where crowds of people do not notice a baby crawling on the sidewalk. A total absurdity.
