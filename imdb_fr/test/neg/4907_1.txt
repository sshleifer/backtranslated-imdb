It was one of the most artificial, tedious, and clich√© films I've ever seen ... and, yes, I've seen Pearl Harbor before. Even Gina McKee could not get out of this dreadful dialogue. It has been described as a "house of art", it can only be a euphemism for dull, appalling and, frankly, without art. How is it that when a film is devoid of intrigue, the critics consider that it deserves to be called art? But much more disconcerting, why did the United States like it? Without you, this film would have remained on the set to which it belonged perhaps.
