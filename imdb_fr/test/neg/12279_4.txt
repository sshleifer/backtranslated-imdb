This film is very violent, but exciting with its original dialogue and friendly characters. He has one of the most moving stories and is very faithful to life. The film begins with action star Leo Fong as a casual policeman approaching the end of his career when he comes across a big deal involving corruption, blackmail and murder. This is where the killings begin. From beginning to end, Fong delivers in this essential action. This film is also alongside Richard Roundtree. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed this film as a child, but as I got older, I realized that this film is rather corny and not very good. I would not recommend this movie and the action is really bad.
