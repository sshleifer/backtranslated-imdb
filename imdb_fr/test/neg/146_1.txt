An exceptionally stupid actor with unworthy leads into a story that might have suited a full Spiderman issue.

The robot is awkward and not very impressive, and the CGI effects (though made by US users of sfx) are ridiculous, totally destroying any remaining disbelief. I'm not looking forward to seeing the Gen-Z cops ...
