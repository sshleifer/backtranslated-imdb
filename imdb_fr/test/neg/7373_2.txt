This is the only major problem of this film, as well as many of the greatest Quebec films: pretentiously done by pretentious. <br /> <br /> It's really sad, but the great directors (driving the Dodge Stratus ...) of this province believe they have the truth, that they know what little people like. <br /> <br /> We are not a rich province, every time a big movie like this ($ 30 million? !!?) is done, it cuts a lot of others who will not see their movie shot because of lack of government assistance. This generates mediocrity; only the movies of "friends of the family" will be shot. <br /> <br /> I seem angry and I am. I went to see New France waiting for a trip in the life of my ancestors, but I found myself stuck in a pool of inconsistencies: the French accent (we must please our cousins, so f *** our Quebec language) and the lack of research is just a few. Add a campy love story and the same score that is repeated over and over again and the silent spectator of Quebec will open up and ask for more. I am happy that this pretentious piece of s *** did not work as expected by the Dodge Stratus Big Shots ... It will help filmmakers who are not part of the very limited "cinema" Quebec. <Br /> <br /> Rent the cruise bar instead and have a good time. <br /> <br /> PS: I will never forgive them for ruining such an impressive title.
