Hedy Lamarr, who may have been screened by more men than any other actress, is once again the guardian of Kent Taylor, Playboy and General Rat. On a Yucatan boat after Taylor gave her the brush, she tries to commit suicide. But Dr. Spencer Tracy prevents him from drowning in the Caribbean. <br /> <br /> Tracy is one of the most versatile doctors. I guess he never heard the word specialist. He runs a clinic in Manhattan for the poor and his trip was a secondary activity of medical research. Lamarr and he get married and she tries to introduce him into his world and he even becomes a partner of Dr. Louis Calhern's company. Of course, Kent Taylor is back in the picture and the inevitable Hollywood happens. <br /> <br /> Watching, I'm taking this woman, it seemed to me that the writers were very influenced by Tracy's movie, Boys Town. Unfortunately, his role as Dr. Karl Decker is not a blot on what he did as Flanagan's father. Maybe they were trying to give Father Flanagan a little love story in his life in this movie, so to speak. <br /> <br /> Tracy and Lamarr did not get along very well. In fact, this film was nicknamed I Retake This Woman because the original director, Joseph Von Sternberg, had left it, probably because Lamarr did not work for him like Marlene Dietrich. She did Lady of the Tropics, then MGM resumed filming with her contract director, Woody Van Dyke, known for the speed of her productions. And a brand new distribution has been added. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, Spence and Hedy both had better roles to play.
