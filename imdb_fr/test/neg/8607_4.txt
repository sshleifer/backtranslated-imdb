The sex life of the potato Men tells the sex life of several men involved in the delivery of potatoes. So, there are no surprises there. In fact, that's about what you can expect from the title: it's an original comedy starring men of sex and potato. Sometimes the movie works. It's an edgy and sometimes uncomfortable comedy about the lives of some rather unimportant and rather average men who have problems of all kinds with women. Where the film does not work clearly and why it failed at the box office is that the odd and uncomfortable parts are perhaps a little too weird and uncomfortable. Instead of laughing during the scene of a man hanging on the ceiling of a basement masturbating in front of another man while he is having sex with his wife, I think most of us simply moan and wonder what Andy Humphries was thinking. Well, maybe he shows us what he thought too clearly.
