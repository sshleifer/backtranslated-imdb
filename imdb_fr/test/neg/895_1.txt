I know it sounds crazy, but yes, I'm a big fan of House Party 1 and 2 (and proud of it !!). I hated part 3, and then here's part 4. I was like you make fun of me with that? Kid 'n Play does not exist anywhere in this movie, and it would have been nice if they had not stupidly titled the movie House Party 4, as if it were somehow related to his predecessors. . In the United States, every time the film comes late at night, I shoot my TV with a rifle. Frankly, it's really so atrocious. * hurling * <br /> <br /> As the only Kid 'n Play fan to admit he would be a fan (tee hee hee), I was dismayed. Do you remember that stupid little boy group Immature? They sneak into the House Party 3. Okay, fine, but how can you imagine that the fourth part is right for them and nothing else and that it also seems that they are not even the same kids than in the third part? Fans of the House Party: Indulge and respect House Party 1 and 2 and Class Act. Beyond that, all the rest is ridiculous.
