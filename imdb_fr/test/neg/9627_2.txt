I saw "Mirrormask" last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience. <br /> <br /> It is a film rich in images but with a slow direction, a line of mediocre trace and a characterization in 2 dimensions. <br /> <br /> I knew it, however, when I entered. I was willing to trust the two gentlemen with whom I went (cartoon-savvy fans) that the visuals would be out of the ordinary and so were they. Unfortunately, the lack of staging experience meant that scene after scene was happening with little tension or dramatic conflict. However, it is a comment that could be made by many artists whose work is transferred to the screen and who are responsible for the direction. The rhythm of the story is lost, the camera lingering lovingly on the pretty pictures. <br /> <br /> I would not have gone at all without this assurance that the style of the film deserves to be seen. I tried with the work of Neil Gaiman but I always stay with the feeling of "new clothes of the emperor". I live in hope, but last night was no exception. <br /> <br /> I do not think I can continue to analyze Gaiman's work without losing the taste for life. Read the rest of the comments and all his faults are eloquently described. I do not understand, however, how he imagined that he understood the spirit of a fifteen-year-old girl, nor that what he had to say adds nothing to the sum of human knowledge about how to grow up and assume adult responsibility, or change the relationship that a girl might have with her mother. These are the central themes of the film and they are treated in an inept, stereotyped way and without depth of imagination. All the pretty pictures of the world can not compensate for imperfect work.
