I like the show of Ali G, I think this guy has a comic instinct, but has not yet developed to become a talent. <br /> <br /> The film is a little worse than I expected. I do not find Ali-G offensive, just stupid. Jokes for 5 years, some good, some terrible. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a film that sounds "offensive", but is actually funny, see "Freddy Got Fingered" by Tom Green. <Br /> <br /> 2/10
