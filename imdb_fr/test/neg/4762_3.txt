If you suffer from insomnia, Radiant would be the best way to send you into a 7-year coma. The film is so ridiculously overworked and banal that it's hard to imagine that director Steve Mahone can forget such obvious dullness. <br /> <br /> The story tells the story of an exiled doctor (who is never seen) who goes to the desert to create a vaccine that will cure all diseases by filling the hosts with antibodies able to fight against all infections (yes, just like this episode of Futurama). Vaccines do not work and human guinea pigs are infected with a virus that kills in less than 48 hours. <br /> <br /> Not wanting to be caught by the state agents, masked, the group goes to the shelter in the desert, hoping that the sun kills the virus. All this is narrated by Michael, the only one of the group not to be infected. And it's the most boring narrative of all time. They could have played someone with an interesting voice, but we rather have someone with a lower vocal personality than Clive Owen. <br /> <br /> In addition, the editor insists on cutting more than half of the film fade. a strange dream sensation and an increase in the public's desire to fall asleep. It is not surprising that half of the audience came out of this room, I was not one of them for some reason. But I should have. <br /> <br /> The end is supposed to be shocking and clever and disturbing. But it's clear and just not. A relief yes, but not dramatic at all. <br /> <br /> The extremely low price of this production and its stifling that makes a lot of unintelligible dialogue cripples what could have been an interesting science fiction story if it better actors, cooler places and a feeling emergency. As it stands, Radiant is the best choice.
