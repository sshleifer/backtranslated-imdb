Although it is horribly dated, I must insist ... PLEASE DO NOT REMAKE! Frankly, it just will not help, because there is nothing that can be added or changed at the moment to improve the film situation. <br /> <br /> The novel on which it is based is atmospheric, well written, really A phantasmagorical work, but on film, it does not translate. Most of King's written masterpieces fail to translate into film. I do not know why, but when you visualize this work, you may see what I mean. <br /> <br /> The book? That's wonderful. It's not a masterpiece, but it's more than entertaining. <br /> <br /> The film? Do something else. You can thank me later. <br /> <br /> The rating is 3.1 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> The Fiend :.
