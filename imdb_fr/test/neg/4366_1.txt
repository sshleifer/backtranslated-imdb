Killjoy 2 is a fantastic song that tells that clowns are usually very nice and fun, but Killjoy is a killer. I do not remember the song of the first film, but when the singer Olimpia Fernandez sings 'Killjoy, yeah Killjoy 2', it's as if the 2 had been added to this terrible sequel. The movie is a lot worse than the first movie and it was really bad. This time, the actors, including the excellent Debbie Rochon, have already given up trying. The director Tammi Sutton creates no tension and presents only a dull and stable film. The images of the full moon were produced during the "urban" phase, none of them were very good, but none as bad as here.
