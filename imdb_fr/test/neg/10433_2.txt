When I think of a film from the 1970s, that's not what I think. I do not want a monotonous soundtrack of a Robin Trower song; I want a soundtrack punctuated by the 40 best bubblegum pieces of the day that embody the 70s. The generic disco karaoke style music during the ball scene was particularly boring. The acting game (if you can call it that) was very wooden and just seemed to read from a monotone script. The quality of the film and the work of the camera were horrible; the dialogue murky, the script seemed to be thrown together without much thought and the plot was thin, if not non-existent. I can not believe people give him the high marks I read here. Essentially, a failed and mediocre attempt to recreate a beloved era of the past. Two stars is all I can find. Sorry guys.
