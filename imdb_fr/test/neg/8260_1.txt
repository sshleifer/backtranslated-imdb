Okay,. so I went to this loving RuPaul. I still love him but think a little less. It's a rude movie that shows a lot of male genitals. It is a parody of the black exploitation films of the 1970s and is deliberately poorly made. The only fun part about it for me is that all voices have been looped with those of drag-queens, even those of real women. It's over, stop laughing without laughing, it's a movie so stupid and badly done. I would never look at it again, but I really appreciate what the filmmakers were trying to do. There is no evaluation on this but it would be R or even NC-17. RuPaul did a lot better.
