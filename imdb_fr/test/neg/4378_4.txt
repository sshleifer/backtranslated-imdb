Well, the hero and the terror is slightly below average in my opinion. Yes, Chuck is a real martial artist and he plays badly in this movie, but it's pretty slow and, in my opinion, the acting is mostly mediocre although I think Steve James is doing a decent job. Like my friend Ryan, I did not understand why the psychopath had chosen to go to the theater at the end of the movie rather than go after Norris's girlfriend. Until then, the murderer had killed only women. Oh, well, I guess it was not as predictable as I thought. Definitely a film that you can transmit.
