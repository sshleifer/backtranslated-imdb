Comedy is a hard beast to conquer. Ishimoto fails in all respects as a writer and director. Some things, like making fun movies, simply have to be left to the professionals. 1 of 10. Horrible. It was not funny. I tried to laugh but it was not funny. I was not the only one, no one at the Chicago festival was laughing either, at least at the screening I saw. Just very bad, sorry :(
