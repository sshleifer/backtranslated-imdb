What was the goal here ... I started to watch it but I realized that it had no purpose ... a bad acting ... no action and no story..i ended up listening to him while I surfed online reading on the $ 650 million contract of the American football contract with David Beckham. Do not rent this Do not borrow this ANY VERSEUR. I saw so many movies that I could realize that it was going to be shit from the start. <br /> <br /> War movies should be accurate and if possible, have artistic merit and do not feel like a Christian melodrama ... This movie is derisory compared to everyone I've seen before .I must say that I am really disappointed with this movie ..
