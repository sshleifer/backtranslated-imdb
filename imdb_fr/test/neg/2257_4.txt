A very short Tom and Jerry. Jerry tells this story that Tom, the cat, fell in love and lost it to his rival Butch. Tom is Jerry's best friend here, which made me a little upset. The drawing is also presented in Cinemascope. Overall, I found this cartoon of Tom and Jerry sad and depressing. They should have put "Puss gets the boot" on the DVD instead and I would have been happy. This experimental animated short is available on Disk 2 of Warner Brother's 2 DVD Collection Spotlight Collection. This is the last on the set and I hope that Warner Brothers will choose to publish a second volume soon. <br /> <br /> My note: C-
