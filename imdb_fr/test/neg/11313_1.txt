This morning, I unexpectedly surprised myself to remember that this movie existed. I thought, "Oh yes, there was a film by Mr. Magoo, was not it?" This is more surprising because I remember following the controversy surrounding this film (a group defending the rights of the visually impaired said the film was humiliating). I even went to see this film the day it opened because I'm a fan of Mr. Magoo and Mr. Nielson and I thought it would be a great choice to play Mr. Magoo. I even remember the opening credits because I thought they were pretty fun. <br /> <br /> After that, it's completely empty. I think it's a pretty sad statement about any film that says it's so lame, so bland and so totally worthless that you do not remember it anymore. I understand that Leslie Nielson is not always known for appearing in first class comedies, but I saw it in "Spy Hard", in "Scary Movie 4" and "Police Squad 3". left at least remembering * something *. Mr. Magoo is, however, completely empty. <br /> <br /> I wonder now if all the controversy around the film was not generated by the studio that produced it, hoping to generate at least some interest in a movie otherwise totally worthless.
