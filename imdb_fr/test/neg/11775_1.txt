Nothing to watch here. Everything has been done (and better) before. Who cares about this woman - deficient in all respects - as a mother as a wife and as a friend? In an instant where she could have taken the high road - she jumped into the outhouse again with both feet and held her breath - for a better reason than "me too!" If she was not the pretty young person she was showing on the screen - but if she looked more like the real human shipwrecks represented by our family members, neighbors and friends who are really suffering from additions, we change channels in a nanosecond. <Br/> <br /> This film starts at the bottom and goes down. Nothing redeems, no lessons taught - nothing that elevates in any way. None of the main characters even evoke sympathy, let alone empathy. (Well, maybe the snake.) I would have had more pleasure if I closed a door in my hand. Who needs drivel like that?
