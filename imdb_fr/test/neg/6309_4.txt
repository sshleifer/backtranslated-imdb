See it last night and to say it frankly: "Style instead of substance". We can already guess that there must have been a lot more for Jerry Lee Lewis than what is described here. The character of Jerry Lee Lewis in this film is not described as a real human being for one minute over the past hour and a half plus the time elapsed, but again, all the other characters are just a trait of pencil among cartoon characters. <br /> <br /> Let's take the start. We see Jerry Lee and his cousin Jimmy Swaggart sneaking into the black jazz club and we see Jerry taking his inspiration. Might be possible We see how the two cousins ​​choose different paths in life (also possible). Then we saw Jerry Lee play the piano as an adult (now played by Dennis Quaid) and it's exciting and a little scary. Break in a scene where he meets for the first time his first cousin, Myra. From that moment on, it all comes down to a recap of some events played in a style worthy of that of a high-speed news. <br /> <br /> The movie is not a bit entertaining and it's good to hear new versions of the songs that made Jerry Lee. Alec Baldwin in the role of Jimmy Swaggart is also a reason why you should at least take a look at this, an indicator of his greatest successes in the years to come. Winona Ryder as Myra is the most famous character of the movie. She teases, she sobs, she chews chewing gum and plays coquette and that's about it. There is never a minute to explain why she became the third Mrs. Lewis and speaks of wives. Where are the first two? That's why it really can not be classified as a biopic, but rather as an inaccurate documentary. We see Jerry play his first song on the radio, we see his second single enter the top ten, we see his third deny. 1 and so on. Then comes the inevitable fall. Absolutely, no basis in reality. <br /> <br /> To conclude another small quarrel: the film runs from '56 to '58 and Myra always says: "I'm only 13 years old" until the end.
