If you're looking for a movie that you're falling asleep, then Heart of Darkness is the movie for you. The book was not what I expected and the movie disappointed me even more. The list of actors was pitiful and the general plot was pathetic and did not look like the book, except for a few scenes. I understand that everyone reads his own point of view by reading Heart of Darkness and creates his own film in his head, but his director cuts out important scenes and adds other useless ones. If there was anyone in the film who was supposed to belong to a certain culture, they should have used an actor who was of that culture. There are actors everywhere and I'm sure they could have found better ones to match the roles. Joseph Conrad was a respectable man and created a book that will entertain you if that's what you're looking for, but the movie was cheap and useless, and someone who could make the film as respectable as the book should have . If you want a movie that takes you into darkness, then Heart of Darkness is the movie for you.
