I have watched this movie many times and have never really liked it. I am not a fan, I am described as "naked horror", so I can not be dismissed for this account. I find it a little sordid, I think that what annoys me in Hammers is the aspect of sexual exploitation, not the spirit of sex, but sexual exploitation. I'm surprised how many people have given such a note to this film, so I'll see it again. But for me, it was not scary, there was no atmosphere, just a little omigode, look at these black / stupid prostitutes in London and this innocent little Anna on the verge of being raped by a other nasty man, ooherh! I guess in the end for me, the movie had no depth, just a group of evil men and wicked women for the titillation value. This is, to a certain extent, what Victorian England looked like, but the scenery is still too clumsy and dull to give a sense of Victorian menace. The horrors of Roger Corman on the other hand, now is the style, the atmosphere and the elegant horror. For me, it was just a basket of exploitation, with flat feet.
