Riccardo Freda may have a good reputation; but since many of his best films have been directed by the late great Mario Bava; It is clear that he was not one of the most talented filmmakers in Italy in the seventies. This film proves pretty much that despite the simplistic plot; it is a sprawling mess and, on the whole, it should even go so far as to say that the tragic ceremony is worse than the insipid effort of Freda in Giallo, The Iguana with the tongue of fire. Freda has apparently disavowed this film, and I certainly do not blame him! The plot simply follows a group of kids who run out of gas in the middle of nowhere. They fall on a house looking for fuel; but it turns out to be a bad choice because the owner is about to perform a satanic ceremony ... ho hum. The film features a lead role for Camille Keaton, who was going to play in the movie I Spit on Your Grave a few years later, but fails to make the impression here despite his role alongside performers without talent. The film presents a decent gore scene towards the end, but it's really not enough since it takes eighty minutes of trouble to get there. I have a great tolerance for invalid Italian films that do not make sense - but even I could not stand it. Miss that, nothing is missing!
