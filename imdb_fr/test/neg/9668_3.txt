Visually, this film is interesting. The light is literally projected, as is the cinematography and a seductive introduction before the titles, which made me hope at first, but then - a movie of type B is a movie of B is a movie of B, no matter how much the show is seen. This film describes the life of Albert Fish, one of the most famous serial killers in the world. Active at the beginning of the 20th century, Fish's life is carefully managed before he begins to kill children in old age. This film is based on two tracks: Fish's life and that of William F. King, lead investigator. What prevents this film from becoming a Hallmark show and a debacle of the usual kind, whenever movies about serial killers are concerned, is the direction, which is a double-edged sword; Director Scott L. Flynn focuses enough on actors B not to let their faults show through, but at the same time creates a truly drab and stereotyped vision of the American police from the king's perspective. Of course, he treated Fish's meeting with Grace Budd, the 10-year-old girl he killed, with great care, even though I'm not sure if his mother is the crazy person in the media that Flynn is trying to really to point out. . The psychological dive in Fish I miss, not to mention the very little time spent catching Fish. Overall, interesting for those who like serial-killers, but especially disappointing; However, if the director shot another movie on another serial killer, I would certainly see it in the hope that the holes would be fixed.
