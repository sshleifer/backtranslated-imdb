Despite the famous cast, this animated version of Dickens' tale is the most beautiful I've seen. Enough for me to get away from me during the first commercial break. The characters do not please me at all and the animation looks cheap. <br /> <br /> I will give a very low note to this film. Give me the Disney version anytime.
