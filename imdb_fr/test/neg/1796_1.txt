After finishing my dull novel, Heart of Darkness, I went to the film, which was a complete and absolute disappointment. At first, I was expecting the film to help shape the puzzle of a book. However, even if I had read the novel, the movie still had no meaning, so I can not imagine how much I would be lost if I had completely skipped the book. It seemed as if the writers had chosen their favorite roles and put them in the film, leaving aside anything that could help the audience to understand the meaningless plot. This horrible movie makes no sense, and I strongly advise you to watch it because it will not leave you any more than leave you completely perplexed and disoriented.
