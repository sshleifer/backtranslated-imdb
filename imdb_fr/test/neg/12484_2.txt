Yes, what was I expecting? I thought it would be a film about young adults at a turning point in their lives, something like "Sonnenallee" or "American Pie", which I really liked. I wanted to see a funny movie, perhaps with an ironic look at the idyllic Wuerzburg. And what do I have? <br /> <br /> Attention, spoilers to come! <br /> <br /> This film begins with a long dialogue that gives you a good idea of ​​what will follow: longer dialogues. Sometimes I thought that Moritz Bleibtreu might have forgotten his text and tried to hide it by improvising and repeating what he said before. But as I think of Bleibtreu as one of the best German actors, I think this effect was really wanted. I think the author wanted to show how much talking to close friends can be boring, especially when stoned. But in reality, I do not need the cinema to be bored by the speeches of stoned friends. The boring dialogue is the essence of this film. <br /> <br /> But hey, that's one thing. I can cope with that, I've seen beautiful movies with abominable dialogues, just think of Schwarzenegger's life work. But the next thing is that the characters are cheap and flat and the screenplay is as predictable as anything. Just an example (SPOILER !!): Why do you think someone is taking a garden hose for his hemp seedlings deep in the forest? To water them? Of course not, in general, you can not find water pipes in deep forests, right? The only reason this garden hose is that a hunter who finds himself while the two protagonists collect their drug can be drugged, abused and finally filled with three bottles of Jaegermeister. I really hated this scene, because it's really violent. Usually, violence in movies does not bother me - crazy comedies are full of them. But in this kind of comedy, there's a mute agreement between the movie and you that people do not hurt themselves if they wash their faces or get beaten up with a chair or something. But if this happens in a film that is otherwise quite realistic, the rented scenes also seem real. In this particular scene of "Lammbock", I really thought that this hunter had to be seriously injured or even dead. The final scene really made me think he was left to die there, completely filled with alcohol that anyone could stand. And the protagonists are leaving. It would have been otherwise if the author had always followed a style; the scene could have been fun enough. <br /> <br /> Talking about coherence is what I missed the most in this film. The whole movie seems to be a list of little episodes that came to the author's mind. Things go for no apparent reason - yes, I know, it's life, but it's not cinema, because cinema is supposed to tell a story, not show boring episodes without any meaning. I found myself asking, "Where is the goal?" All the time. The characters other than the two main ones are not detailed, we never understand why the protagonist's sister wants to sleep with her best friend Kai, in fact, she tells you but I could not buy it, not at all. I think she was right there to give Kai the opportunity to play this childish skit on the AIDS test, which you have seen a thousand times, and especially better. The girlfriend of the protagonist that you once met, then she left Germany (which you do not even see and the guy does not seem to care) and finally, it is mentioned in a sentence that she met someone else in America and separated from the protagonist. It seemed to me that the author wanted to solve some problems. In fact, he did not really know what was so bad about studying law, being Daddy's son (dad arranges everything at the end and serves coffee in the middle of the night, which, in my opinion, was 'one of the most enjoyable characters in all the movie) and living in the beautiful city of Wuerzburg. Even dinner with daddy's daddy, which was perhaps intended to show how horrible it must be to meet his dad's expectations, seemed flat, yet a nice dinner with family friends (at the same time). except the trip that the guy undertakes later, but I think that showing that eating drugs before dinner with parents is not healthy was not the purpose of this scene, if there were any). I had the worst meals in my life and this one and I finished my exams anyway. I did not understand a single character in the whole movie, they just seemed flat and implausible. <br /> <br /> All this made it a not very good movie, but I would never watch it anymore. There were really some good scenes (most of them were not new, though, like the one with the friendly and understanding police), some were really funny, some dialogues were nice and I like the Bleibtreu play, although he repeated his famous song. stereotypes again this time. Not good, not abominable, that's what I thought after half of the movie. <br /> <br /> But then came this scene of incest and I found it really repulsive. Incest is just not funny. I do not even know if it was supposed to be funny, some people in the audience laughed, so it could have been said that way. This scene ruined the whole film for me, I could not feel any more sympathy for the protagonist - I could not feel sympathy for anyone who was a defenseless person, for me it's rape and rape is not funny. So that might have been a hint of drama, but incest is never mentioned again (although we thought it might have been a reason for the protagonist to finally leave Germany, but as it is no longer never mentioned, we do not know it), it is even totally useless. I was almost expecting the sister to become pregnant at the end, which would have just added the finishing touch to this tasteless story, but even that last shot is not filled, just as nothing is really resolved or thought to the end in this film. It's not really funny, it's not really a drama, it's not at all a Tarantino road movie despite desperate attempts at violence, it's really not nice. <br /> <br /> Ignore this movie. Watching "Final Fantasy" is also bad, but at least with beautiful pictures and not so tasteless.
