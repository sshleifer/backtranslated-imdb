May God bless Randy Quaid ... his cousin Eddie, who works in the laundry, on vacation and Christmas holidays has hilariously stolen the show. He even made the terrible Vegas vacation at least a glance. <br /> <br /> I will say that he does his best in this sequel made for television, but that the scenario is so NOT funny that the film never really leads to anything. Quaid and the rest of the veteran veterans (including Audrey, Dana Barron, the original) are lost here. Even Eric Idle of European Vacation can not save the series in the blink of an eye .... <br /> <br /> Pathetic and sad ... really painful to watch .... Christmas Vacation 2 is the worst from the Vacation franchise.
