Predictable, clich√©, incredible, boring ... what else can I say? It is only the caliber of distribution that saves all the redeeming qualities of this bloated clutter. Oh yeah, and the fun antics in the end zone. <br /> <br /> But wait for the highlights of eleven hours, because the result is as predictable as who will win the match Globetrotters / Washington Generals. <Br/> <br /> I was in the second act before I understood that these teams were supposed to be supervised PRO teams (all dressed in old-fashioned Padres brown). And the imitation of Cameron Diaz's character from a young Georgia Frontiere was ill-conceived on the page. (It's not your fault, Cameron, would you go to dinner?) <br /> <br /> Enough of that - I'm just angry because I was looking forward to this movie. RENT THE LONGEST YARD instead. <br /> <br />
