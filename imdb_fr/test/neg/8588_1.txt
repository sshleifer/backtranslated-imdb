Another lame attempt to make a film "gritty" and "provocative" - ​​whatever that may say. Al Pacino says a lot of words like: "TV killed football." Yeah whatever. This is another film that stars Oliver Stone's Delusions of Greatness. If Stone is trying to show us that football will be our loss or something, why does he insist on romancing it with his stunt camera movements and Kid Rock songs? He even throws Cameron Diaz into the fray for purely aesthetic reasons. It's a shame that Diaz and Pacino have to meet each other in such a bad movie. <br /> <br /> Since "Scent of Woman", writers and directors have used Pacino to romanticize their pathetic lines. His characters are nothing more than speakers - their voices hide what would normally be redundant and banal. He has to reinvent himself and show how he can act without shouting. He must stop complaining for hokey scripts with nerdy lessons like "Organized football is messed up" and play a good story.
