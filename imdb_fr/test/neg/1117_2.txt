I guess the people who talk about this story are the director's pals or something. It's bad, and not in the style of Michael Jackson. To compare the rhythm of this film with the progression of a snail would be to insult the snail. This film box for what seems to be an eternity, all this to present us children of zombies scary little with an idiotic makeup and a kind of vendetta, or a thirst for blood, or whatever. Believe me, you will not care. The mere thought that Mom would take her two daughters to this dilapidated and dirty home is absurd. And worse, I was just indifferent. History about zombie kids? Snort. Endangering the mother and / or girls? Do not worry. <br /> <br /> In short, WOW was so dull. Do not bother yourself.
