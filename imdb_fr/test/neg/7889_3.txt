Intended for light entertainment, this film certainly had success as such in its first half, but then succumbed to a scenario that collapsed quickly. Harry (Judd Nelson), a "reformed" burglar, and Daphne (Gina Gershon), a future actress, are employed as window mannequins in a department store where, one evening, they are late and are locked inside. from their lower observation point to protective glass, an apparent homicide occurring in the street. The alleged murderer, Miles Raymond (Nick Mancuso), a local sculptor, returns the next day to watch the models as he realizes they are the only possible witnesses to the violent event that took place the night before and that one of the two posing "bronchus", the pleasure begins. Daphne and Harry report their observations to the local police station, but when the inspector who records a crime report remembers Harry's criminal background, he becomes cynical. A film can become a lot of ways, and it manages to use most of it, including a slow-motion passion scene in a slow motion bedroom. A low budget deal in Vancouver, even the procedural aspects of the police are posted by heart. Gershon, still capable, tries to do something of his role, but Mancuso is incredibly histrionic, oddly, as he attacks his lines with obvious softness. Although the film is nonsense, director of photography Glen MacPherson prefers not to follow suit, as he climbs the camera and lights superbly crafted compositions that the viewer can concentrate on while ignoring intrigue. and dialogues without intelligence. Hal Beckett helped create a well-designed, action-based score. The dialogue mentioned is initially somewhat recent and well interpreted by Nelson and Gershon, but in a subsequent context of continuity and imperfect logic, predictability takes over. Management reflects a lack of original ideas or points of view, and post-production flaws have delayed work beyond what was planned for a basic thriller.
