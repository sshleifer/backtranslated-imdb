Hitchcock is an excellent director. Ironically, I especially find that his films are a complete waste of time to watch. I admire Hitchcok on a purely visual and technical level. <br /> <br /> First the positives. Hitchcock invented the concept of a detection camera. The curious eye that is able to retain or search for information. It's not really a new visual grammar but it was revolutionary. <br /> <br /> Second, Hitchcock has almost perfected the thriller and the hunt movie. He has an economic style and always thinks of the public. It gives them regular chills, regular smiles and regular shocks. In short, he anticipates the basic needs of the audience and plays them like a violin. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the basic needs of a human being are for the most part stupid. Food, sex, shivers of danger and little comedy. Hithcock meets all these needs on the screen, with the exception of food, for which, judging by its size, he answered the screen. <br /> <br /> It is this solicitation towards the public that sabotages most of his films. Another disadvantage is that most of Hitchcock's camera and visual grammar work is now commonplace. What makes his films visible are the simple economy of his stories, the intelligence of his cameraman work and his ability to create very tense action scenes. <br /> <br /> Go to "Saboteur". It is a light effervescence in the vein of "The 39 Steps". He jumps from sequence to sequence, until he finishes at the typical play of Hitchcock's final act. <br /> <br /> On the emotional level, the relationship between the main actors is not up to that of Robert Donat and Madeleine Caroll "The 39 steps". Therefore the whole story lacks some energy. The plot is crawling like a machine, desperately dependent on the addition of new scenes. And new scenes only bring us closer to the end, since it is not clear whether the hero must escape the police, the bad guys or his action to put an end to sabotage. <br /> <br /> There is the usual Hitchcock. logical defects. For example, a guy with handcuffs is released using a fan belt, etc. (Why do not you just drive in? Are not handcuffs so restrictive? He's able to swim in, after all!) <Br /> <br /> If you want a better war propaganda film from Hitchcock of the 40s, I would advise you to watch "Foreign Correspondent". They are both ridiculous with a catchy finale, but "Foreign Correspondant" uses umbrellas and tulips a lot, which Spielberg kindly tears up in "Minority Report". <br /> 7.5 / 10 - A good set pieces. Beyond that, however, there is nothing more to bite into.
