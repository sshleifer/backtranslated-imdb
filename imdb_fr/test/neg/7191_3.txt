When you read the commentary of this movie, it's a smart and fun political comedy based on real events - the only true word here is that it's a comedy. If you are told that it is an insider film about Russian politics, it is not the case. The film probably contains only 2% of what really happened in Russia during this election campaign. In fact, in 1996, it was a thousand times more interesting to follow the situation and it was a great election campaign. There were public relations advisers from the United States who worked with Yeltsin's staff, but their role was minimal. The whole campaign was totally different from what is shown in the movie, it would be much funnier to show all the president's people across the country with cardboards filled with money, and to the celebrities who give the shows to support Yeltsin everywhere - unless it would be true. I give him three only because of my respect for Jeff Goldblum, Antony LaPagglia and Liev Schreiber. And about machine guns in the streets of Moscow. I lived in a place that had the highest number of serious crimes in Russia in the mid-1990s, and I have never seen a gunman on the street.
