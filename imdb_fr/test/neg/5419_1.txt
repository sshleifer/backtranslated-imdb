This movie is boring, boring, boring, boring and boring! It's not the worst film I've ever seen, quite the contrary, but ... how can I say this ... IT'S BORING! There are very beautiful landscapes and a smart spirit, but that's about it. If it were advertised as a travelogue, I would call it 7, but it's supposed to be a movie with intrigue, drama and, for God's sake, a satisfying conclusion. <br /> <br /> The comments on this movie about this movie and I wondered if they had seen the same movie as me. <br /> <br /> See this film (yawn) at your own risk ....... one thing to do of course, it is really classified correctly = G NOTE! (Which means the most for GOD AWFUL BORING!)
