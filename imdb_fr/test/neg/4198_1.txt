I rented Dark Harvest (the first one) because it sounded like a sensational monster ride on the box. Scarecrows also scare me. The film had an effective title sequence, but the following was rather bad (flat, bad lighting, acting, editing, direction ...). Recently, I noticed that DH 2: The Maize had conducted a fairly extensive advertising campaign. I thought the first might have had marginal success, so they slightly increased the bet, perhaps bringing greater budget fears and personal effects from the deadly scarecrows. Well, there are no scarecrows in the video ... That's not a problem. The problems start in DH 2 with a sequence of titles that looks like an unfinished concept, with strange shapes and bars that erase titles and so on. As for the actual photography ... every time the sun shines on a photo, you would have all those whites blown up, confirming that you're watching a mini-DV project at a very low budget that a certain Midwesterner filmed at his uncles. closed. Actor acting did not act at all. The inexpensive scam of the Shining twins was below the standards of the first-year film students. The editing was extremely amateurish and lazy. The sound was discordant and agitated. (For example, each time the editor takes a new picture, you change the perspective of the sound here). It's as if someone is bringing together friends and family (actors), taking a video camera in a corn field for three days, putting a light on the nighttime sequences (no joke - that's what they did), burned They stuck the film in their computer, cut a (very) rough version, embedded music, bypassed any imaginative work or mix, burned it directly to DVD and threw it on the shelf of the video store. Any horror fan should be insulted by this type of direct video work devoid of ANY talent or style. It is not because a person has a video camera and is able to get a tape image that it should be made public. If I could give it a score less than one, I would do it.
