The dots started and grew almost all the time, then were never finished or left with hanging ends. Very poor and disorienting camera work and editing. They should have used subtitles for Christie's British mumbler. <br /> <br /> Too much down and not enough facts for a documentary. <br /> <br /> Probably honored in Cannes because of criticism in my opinion, there were too few). <br /> <br /> We left at 2 o'clock - I do not know how long it lasted.
