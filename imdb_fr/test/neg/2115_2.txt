Will Spanner (David Byrnes, fifth actor in the series) discovers another strange case, this time involving vampires rather than the usual witches, wizards and demons (he is in the hospital to watch his friend's son who was injured in a hit and run when they drove a girl who was attacked by a vamp in). He is using Detectve Lutz to help him in the case of a clandestine organization of vampires trying to get a business merger to allow them to legally hold all the blood banks in the world or such nonsense. <br /> <br /> The plot of this film takes enough room for nudity and simulated sex scenes. (As you would expect from this series, I guess). So, I guess complaining about the lack of good acting, a compelling plot or even convincing characters would fall on deaf ears. If you watch this movie, you do not care about these "frivolities" and you just want "action". Unfortunately, the film also fails in this regard. All women are quite attractive, but the way the scenes are filmed is atrocious. Which makes it more or less a futile exercise in every way imaginable. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Kimberly Blair and April Breneman show everything; Ashlie Rhey shows her forehead full; Aline Kassman and Mai-Lis Holmes show only their breasts <br /> <br /> My note: D
