It's one of the least well-done films I've ever seen. Truffaut must be taken seriously. it's not just a B-movie warped by hacks. <br /> <br /> Obviously, Truffaut could not decide if he was making a film noir or sentimental. and Deneuve either, whose twelve (?) rockers of characters are simply incredible - not even badly acted; just not acting at all. Among other things, the fact that a woman as beautiful as Deneuve can be someone like Julie / Marion simply exceeds anyone's ability to suspend disbelief; the role absolutely requires someone less beautiful. The acting of Belmondo also suffers although, in my humble opinion, his character is not as incredible as that of Deneuve. The end of the clich√© (which I will not describe) is unfortunately too appropriate for this complete error.
