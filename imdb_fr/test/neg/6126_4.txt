The beginning of the film is promising. When Jeanne Pollet (Anna Mouglalis) heard the story of the incident that occurred on the day of her birth, mentioning the possibility that she was the daughter of a famous pianist, André Polonski (Jacques Dutrone), she wanted to know if it was true. or not, and since she also plays the piano, it's not such a distant idea. Jeanne meets André and his wife "Mika" Muller (Isabelle Huppert) and their son and discovers on the way that there are some secrets in this family as well as at home. <br /> <br /> O.K. we have already seen this before and this has been done in a more interesting way than here. The character of "Mika" Muller has remained without understanding her motives for her action and she is not interesting enough to take care of her. The piano scenes look wrong and the whole piano sub-intrigue adds nothing to the character's acumen but serves to make the film longer than it should have. <br /> <br /> In short, a very disappointing output of Chabrol, who can do better than that
