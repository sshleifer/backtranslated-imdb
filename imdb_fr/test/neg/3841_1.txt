I would like to start by saying that I would not go see this film if they were distributing solid gold popcorn and that the note gave me eternal life. This movie was terrible. I can not give it a really honest rating because there are no negative stars. The acting is absolutely terrible. This film is a parody based on the classic "The most dangerous game". If you really want to torture yourself for 90 minutes, rent something like Gigli. At least, J-Lo offers better landscapes, Ben should appease the ladies who look at him. I'm not sorry for the 7 dollars I paid to see the move, I would just like 90 minutes of my life. <br /> <br /> "Can you give me my time!?!" Samuel L. Jackson, Change lane
