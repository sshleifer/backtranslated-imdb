The basic idea behind "Dungeon of Harrow" is not so bad. The acting is bad. The lighting is bad. The music is bad. The scenes of torture are without emotion. There is really not much to recommend this movie. You know what kind of movie you belong to when the credits say "Guest Special" and list someone you've never heard of. We might as well say "Rex Hamilton as Abraham Lincoln." because there is really no one in this movie, you can identify. There are one or two decent moments, mostly towards the end and I think that the basic schema of the plot may contain an original idea, but that is not enough to prevent you from sleeping through this otherwise inept yawn.
