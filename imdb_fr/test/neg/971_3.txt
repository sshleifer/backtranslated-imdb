SPOILERS OF MINOR TERRAINS IN FRONT !!! <br /> <br /> How have such talented actors been involved in such a retread drag? Robert DeNiro plays a silly Hollywood version of the tough cop and resistant to violence <br /> <br /> (ie, He hits the bad guys and rolls his eyes on the cops who prefer to stay the book), and Eddie Murphy plays a less robust policeman who prefers to be an actor (ie, he shouts, <br /> <br /> "Freezes the police!" and has his "hard look" down). Naturally, they are associated <br /> <br /> when Bobby's loose gun tactics put him in hot water <br /> <br /> with the media and he is basically blackmailed < br /> << br />> Reality TV show "Cops". Breathe, because it's funny that it's <br /> <br />. <br /> <br /> No energy has been inserted into the script - it feels like a pale retreading of <br /> <br /> every movie buddy thrown into a blender with "15 Minutes "starring, <br /> <br /> yes, DeNiro himself, pretty much the character he plays here. <br /> <br /> The jokes fall flat, the action is apathetic, and nobody seems to <br /> <br /> have fun. He died on the screen. <br /> <br /> Please, do not waste your time. Even if you have absolute affinity <br /> <br /> for one of the actors - avoid it and do them service. As if this were to make money, these types of scenarios will be considered perfectly acceptable <br /> <br /> for actors of their quality. <br /> <br /> And to Mr. DeNiro. You made serious movies. I remember them - <br /> <br /> they were good. You've been nominated for rewards for them - do you remember how much fun you had? <br /> <br /> Now, after "Analyze This" (which was good), "Meet the <br /> <br /> Parents" (which was also good), and "The Adventures of Rocky and <br /> <br /> Bullwinkle "(Which was not good), I think we need to see you parody less and be more yourself. "Casino" feels like a long time ago <br /> <br /> And no, I do not count "15 minutes" as serious Bobby. Anyone who <br /> <br /> takes the satire of the media seriously must have its weekly world news
