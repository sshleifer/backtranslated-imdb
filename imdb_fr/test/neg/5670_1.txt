I ... No words. No words can describe that. I will try for the sake of those brave people who stuff knives into their toasters ... after watching this show. <br /> <br /> This ... Cosgrove person ... His game is like watching a female gorilla dance on the nest of very agitated insects. I'm exaggerating maybe. However, I feel that the description is a day of writing this show. <br /> <br /> The characters in this disgusting pile of untreated sewage are as useless as a small space rock that flies in the sun. any day of the week. Although we did not have heart attacks while we watched them behave like idiots in inexpensive sets, I have no doubt that this will eventually happen. <br /> <br /> Actors * is that of an idiot who hosts a live weekly show on iCarly.com with his brainless friends, one of whom owns equipment that the producers of this show probably could not to afford. His legal guardian is a kind of moron who is apparently his older brother. <br /> <br /> I did not watch this show for fear of developing cancer, or maybe a cold, but some plot I points saw the brother stuck in an elevator, the porter of the dying apartment, and the greatest priest of the world coming for a visit. No really. <br /> <br /> Avoid this if you are over the age of 0 or have a history of joining mysterious cults because of mental trauma. If you decide to watch it, laugh when the laughter tells you, it will hide the repetitive noise that will end up putting you in a coma if you listen to it too long. <br /> <br /> The show receives a star because IMDb has not inexplicably adopted the use of negative numbers.
