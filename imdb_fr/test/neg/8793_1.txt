I just understood why the colors and games of "Sakuran" were so flashy and screaming, and just painful to watch. The story is about a high class prostitute called oiran in Japanese. Their kimono was always brighter and more colorful than the other kimonos, so the oiran stands out. But the director, Mika Ninagawa, had to make sure that the director stood out even more than the main character, or even the story. <br /> <br /> What Anna Tsuchiya did in the movie just gave me goose bumps. You can not call it play. It was nothing more than satisfying his fanatical fans of high school students. Hi Anna, good luck with this one as you get older. Yeah, that's right, a man like a brutal and vulgar biker chick, prone to violence. Had not we already seen this character in a more appropriate movie? <br /> <br /> The story was painfully boring and predictable. What is the story of "Sakuran"? An uncomfortable little bitch always stays true to herself, which is just that: an unpleasant bitch. She finds that, inexplicably, men are attracted to her and that she has an unexplained ability to manipulate men and becomes a high-class prostitute who succeeds even if she speaks and behaves as if she were a member of a gang of men. bikers. We talk about her so-called seduction ability, but we never see her in action, probably because of the ineffectiveness of the main girl, who pretends to be a biker, I mean "actress". <br /> <br /> The main character of the film makes a strong and powerful man angry at her because it makes him wait while he serves a much more humble client. Not very oiran-like, is it? How could such a woman ever become an oiran? Oh, because the old woman was killed and the house needed a whore who could claim a high price. Who would pay the price for such a cheap slut? Rumors circulate. How could there be any repercussions on what she did to the powerful man? Because the writers are dolts. <br /> <br /> Then a guy even richer and powerful falls in love with her (why?) And she throws him in the place of a penniless guy who is usually cold and distant, but respect who she is really (which makes no sense, how can someone respect someone so worthless?). <br /> <br /> Talking shit, it's as if the director crouched down and took a huge psychedelic discharge on the aesthetics, culture and society of the Edo period. What about things such as sabi, mono non conscious, wabi, subtlety, elegance, a hierarchically rigid society? All this is staged by a director who presents himself as a foolish and new-rich parvenu. The amazing thing is that so many Japanese, watching this film, crouched around the director and took steaming spoons of this stinking shit with flamboyant colors and exclaimed how delicious it was. <br /> <br /> Argentine tango music with violin and bandoneon as a backdrop for the Edo period, when Japan was totally isolated from the world (with the exception of the 3.7 hectares of Dejima)? Why not just let Anna, the evil biker oiran, answer her mobile phone and the rich and powerful daimyo character run away in a hissy fit in her red Ferrari? The music we were listening to was discordant and anachronistic (the same as the artistic conception). <br /> <br /> Near the end, I appreciated the fact that there were only two or three tiny flowers on the cherry shrine. But, earlier, the second she said she would leave the neighborhoods when it was blooming, we all knew exactly what would happen. How annoying, to telegraph the end so clearly. But what is the purpose of the old tree in bloom? This rich and powerful guy has already bloomed cherry blossom pleasure areas like the Yoshino Mountains in the spring. That did not impress him at all? No of course not. I already know it for whores. The guys who treat them well are banging in the balls. It may be shocking for whores to have idealized people when they know for themselves what they are: just cheap and worthless. <br /> <br /> Given the director's obsession with goldfish, the penultimate scene should have been a bowl of goldfish on a veranda accidentally overturned. Two fish fall into a stream that carries them to escape beyond the walls of recreational areas, pointing out that goldfish are stuck in their bowl and can not survive outside (just like the relationship between locals and recreational areas). Otherwise, talking about the fate of the goldfish makes no sense. <br /> <br /> In the final scene, the cherry trees were in full bloom, but the brevity of the bloom is a peculiarity of cherry blossoms. I could not help but think that twilight would quickly erase all the heat and the pink heat of the scene. The sky would quickly go from shadow to darkness deeper and deeper and night would fall. It would become cold, very cold. And dark. It really was not a happy ending, was it? Romantic love (from the Edo period?) Could survive terrible poverty and be ostracized for about as long as these cherry trees flourished. Maybe a few days, unless it's raining sooner. But the unfulfilled romantic love that we see here? His existence at this time is incomprehensible. <br /> <br /> Anna Tsuchiya walking in the shoes of an oiran? She could not do it. Literally. Discover the scene of his "walk" where she seems to wear the right shoes but she must hang on the shoulder of a guy not to fall on his ass. <br /> <br /> I was going to give it the two-star movie for art direction, but then I realized what it was: sickly domination from the director. These colors and sets are the way the director shouted: "I'm the most important here! Me! Everything is about me !!!!"
