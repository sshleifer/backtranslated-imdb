First, let me say that I wasted the night of Halloween cinema watching this garbage. Secondly, let me inform you that the current DVD available by Shriek Show is not yet cut, so you will be upset. Thirdly, this scene is the highlight of the film and as it is cut, you see where I am going. <br /> <br /> I know that a lot of horror fans like this movie. It is atmospheric, shot in the woods with very beautiful landscapes, waterfalls and others. But after the initial kill, which involves a very brutal blow from a machete stuck in the crotch of a hunter, you do not get a real brutal victim after that. And, with a slasher movie, you sort of want that. At least I do it. The director and co. do not do anything new with the killer in the woods, several movies of this type were all shot around the same time in the early eighties. The only thing that goes in this direction is that you do not hate actors as much as you could do in other movies. They are kind of nice. Children have a reason to be there: one of them holds a title deed on a property in the mountains. But what is not explained is why his family has property there. There is no cottage or house, so why buy a property in East Jesus, especially if you are not a hunter or what? Well, I'm sure some people buy land for camping, but that seems quite unusual. Anyway, two members of the back of the squeaky woods introduce themselves and start tracking down the campers and picking them up one by one. And, as I said before, you get practically nothing in terms of death after the machete massacre at the beginning. The end has a kind of brutal destruction of Connie, but even that is not enough to make it nearly equal to that of the completely forgettable movie, The Forest, which is stultifying. <br /> <br /> If Shriek Show was able to get an uncut print, this article might have been a little lenient, but it's the day and age of uncut DVD / unclassified DVD releases. old obscure movies for movie dogs like me. When you neglect us, you get raw criticism. Unfortunately, the presence of grandfather George Kennedy is the only highlight of this film that distinguishes it from other garden waste that was thrown out during the day.
