I accidentally caught this in the middle flip channels. I immediately recognized almost everyone in the cast, the "groovy" haircuts aside, and I wondered what kind of film could attract such a cast of past and future stars. Not having seen the original, I assumed it could be the Poseidon adventure because it was obviously a ship in distress. I was wrong! I really can not imagine why none of these big (or promising) actors and actresses would allow their name to be associated with such waste. There is no story, all the interpretations were forced, the characters were a parody of the usual disaster movie roles that are suddenly reunited by an event and begin to pontificate about the true meaning of life at the level of philosophy stickers. <BR /> <br /> It's only useful to see the unusually terrible performances of personalities such as Sally Field, Michael Caine, et al. They surely needed that money. Can we blame the director?
