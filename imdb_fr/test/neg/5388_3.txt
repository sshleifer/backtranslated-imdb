This film may be awesome, but it's a real scam for the comfort and joy of Bill Forsythe. This is one of the sweetest films I have ever seen without becoming diabetic. <br /> <br /> It's good, if you like, but realize that EVERYTHING in this movie is a real scam. <br /> <br /> The original is http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0087072 I can recommend almost anything by forsythe - Local Hero, Gregory's Daughter, This feeling of darkness. I'd better go rent it tonight. The local has a young Peter Capaldi and an old Burt Lancaster. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, he stopped doing movies after shameful treatments in Hollywood. Sad.
