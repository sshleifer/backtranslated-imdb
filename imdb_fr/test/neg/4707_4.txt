I just finished looking at Goliath Attend that I ordered in my library. I remembered this vaguely years ago and wanted to watch it with my son. Anyway, the movie lasted less than 2 hours and I thought it was a lot longer when I first saw it. The back of the VHS box says that Goliath "creates a Nazi file whose secrets could forever destroy the free world." The divers were supposedly on a secret mission to retrieve the demonic document. We did not even talk about retrieving this document. In addition, the box states that "the insatiable boiler of the bestial ship feeds on human blood". That would make a horror movie and nothing in the movie would be revealed about it. I do not remember the details when I watched it years ago on TV ... but could the back of this box be true? Maybe the 3-hour movie revealed more details ?? <br /> <br /> I was wondering if anyone knew anything about it.
