Once again, seemingly intelligent critics made me look like seemingly intelligent comments about a visibly shabby movie. In fact, I put on my shoes, get in my car, burn expensive gas and go to the nearest tenant AFTER reading the said reviews, I paid the 4 dollars needed and got the rent. I tell you, this one is not worth the small kilograms of energy spent to lift the index to change channels on a television remote control. <br /> <br /> I even gave him a few more minutes after seeing all the telltale signs of a bunch of purebred dogs. These presented as clinical symptoms of a director who is. to become senile or, b. is only marginally interested in the film he is forced to create. I have seen a similar deterioration with John Carpenter's series of ridiculous caricatures in recent years. <br /> <br /> Here are some scenes as incriminating evidence. The priest is realizing a disturbing dream ... supposedly a harbinger of the coming evil, because he seems very inclined to open the archaeological device that houses the devil. The dream is an awkward collage of disjointed images straight out of the image sequences of the Twilight Zone. A clinking clock mingles with the darkness of the dream that implies, what ?, The unfathomable mystery of time? A disembodied head, painted with demon features with a neighborhood-quality Halloween makeup store, wobbles in a convulsive frenzy. Every time I see this effect, a big Jacob's Ladder scam, it pisses me off. That, in itself, discredits a film almost instantly. <br /> <br /> The whole archaeological dig is laughable. Everything is so obvious ... so tired and worked ... the only answer is boredom. At one point in the search, the priest comments on the discovery of the statues of Angels surrounding a sarcophagus ... they are all directed to the crypt with their weapons. He asks: "Look at these surrounding statues ... It's as if they held ... something..wanted!" This is supposed to create a tension ... a critical mass ... but it does not even approach it! How can there be suspense if you treat the audience as a group of idiots to EXPLAIN suspense as you go. The images are overexploited initially, but the added comments only add insult to injury in my opinion. Shortly after, the grave is "decorated" with the remains of the soldiers placed there to guard the main atrium (another brazen swindle of the Dungeon, in fact). Who, for having cried aloud, did the makeup for this film ??! The blood really had that pinkish quality that we could see in Tromaville movies of the 70s. At this point, I'm almost convinced that they simply forgot makeup and had to go to Wal-Mart to save time and money. <br /> <br /> Do not listen to the rave reviews on this one! I will also keep a suspicious eye on Schrader. It looks like it may be time to hang up his gloves. Perhaps a close friend will offer a gentle warning to quit as long as dignity remains in the memory of past movies.
