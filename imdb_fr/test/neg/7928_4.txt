For a film that was most seen in his native South Korea for most of 2004, it was a huge disappointment. Show that Hollywood is not the only place where people can make melodramatic movies too emotional. The film lasted more than 130 minutes, but not much has happened and everything that happened was pretty much what we expected, the plot was so transparent. Of course, if you were Korean, you might get in there more, but for me it did not do much. In other words, as in the case of Korean cinema, the plot revolves around relations between the north and south of the peninsula. South Korea has decided to recruit and train an elite assassination squad of prisoners sentenced to death to kill Kim Il-Sung. <br /> <br /> A tedious plot does not bother me much if the characters are good, but unfortunately, this is not the case this time either. These are stereotypes and most actors are mediocre and too often outdated, as it tends to be in Korean cinema. We spend too much time on the many montages and the characters are far away, cutting a cardboard to one dimension. They should have spent more time establishing the characters and less showing us how hard and cruel training and soldiers are. <br /> <br /> One thing that reminds us is that a lesser of two wrongs is always wrong.
