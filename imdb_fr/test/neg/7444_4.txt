EVALUATIONS: ***** Saturday night **** Friday night *** Friday morning ** Sunday night * Monday morning <br /> <br /> The old Detroit is back and the giant Omni Consumer Corporation continues swallow. The construction of the new city of Delta City continues, and Cain is a cruel drug lord with delusional ideas in the likeness of Christ who traffics a new deadly addiction in the street, called Nuke. As he continues to struggle with the memories of his old life haunting him, the tin-clad hero seeks to bring down this villain - eventually to be cut into pieces of junk. Robocop is out of action, a merciless OCP businesswoman proposes a project for her new Android, a stunned beast of a machine that needs a test no less rigorous to turn it on, which Cain is perfect for. After a brief problem in his system, Robo returns for justice to be done on the street and to settle the score with Cain. <br /> <br /> The original Robocop movie is a film that always amazes you every time you watch it, no matter how many times you've seen it, one of these movies simply can not be redone. That said, it is not surprising that a sequel has been made. It's even less surprising that this suite is really ridiculous compared to the original. Empire Strikes Back director Irvin Kirschner made an unpleasant, slightly incoherent and lengthy film that can not capture the magic of the first film, no matter how hard it strives. And there is no doubt, the fun commercials of the first film never stopping, the corporate satire being a little sharper and the roaring action as fast and furious as before, but with a blood / blood of worse still taste only the first film. The first film earned a name for a bloody and bloody violence (including the genitals of a man and a man who was exploded), but although it is more memorable, the violence / violence that is exposed is a more sadistic and gratuitous nature. nature, with a very unpleasant and petty tone. <br /> <br /> But overall, the film leaves you with a feeling of general apathy: why do you look at this when you could look at the original instead? **
