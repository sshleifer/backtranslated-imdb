Normally, I do not write reviews, but this "movie" was special. I could not turn it off. I do not think I've ever seen a worse movie, but I was sitting there watching. It was like a horrible car wreck with blood flowing down the road. It was disgusting, but I could not turn away. Where do I start? The movie seems to think it's a sports thriller, but it's so ridiculous that it can only be a comedy, but it's not funny, not even stupidly. It's like watching your cousins ​​try to play a skit at family reunions. It's painful to watch, but at least it's only for a minute or two. The second rope lasted more than an hour. <br /> <br /> Anyone who has participated in making this movie should not work anymore. The writing, the staging, the acting and everything was horrible. The problem is that I can not describe how bad it was; it was enough to see him. And I'm sure it will NEVER be shown again, so unless you see it, you're not lucky. I mean, it was almost worth seeing, just because it gave me a better understanding of all the "bad" movies I've seen in my life. And for all the movies that I will see in the future and that I can not bear, I'll say: well, at least it was not so bad as the Second String.
