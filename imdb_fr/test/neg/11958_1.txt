Another suite! Why on earth are they still making them? This must be the lowest "franchise" of all time, but it continues to be funded and to create suites. SCARECROW GONE WILD - that I only looked at to officially destroy the whole series - brings back the bad man of straw who, once again, massacred college kids ... That's all. The acting is nil (as usual), the scenes of death are beyond pathetic, and do not be fooled by the title, this thing does not have as much nudity as you think. A couple of pretty girls with bare breasts, but nothing too tight. Allow me to conclude my continuing insult (or criticism) on this film by saying: if I come across a SCARECROW SCARECROW or FREDDY VS on the shelves of the video store, I will be absolutely amazed ...
