I'm not going to talk about the plot, it's strictly a movie B in the dark. The shock for me, however, is to see what have become of some of the actors in this film. Erika Eleniak, anyway, what could be called a spy anyway, seems to have turned into Anna Nicole Smith (in her great period). Daniel Bernhardt - I almost shed a tear. It has always been one of my favorites because of its martial arts prowess, as shown in the Bloodsport series (also B-series movies, but, if you like martial arts, they can be watched to perfection) . Here he is a shell of his old self sure he is older, but does the mercenary thing and does not even seem interested ... I just do not understand. Do not these people invest? William Forsythe is another "heavy" I've always loved, but his last roles are what you would call "mailing him". I will not even talk about Mr. Reynolds - his job here is a disposable, nothing more. The only winner is Andrew Divoff, as usual, a scary, devilish villain and punched with a sandpaper voice that can curdle the milk - the best! It's a movie you watch for laughter. There is nothing else to that.
