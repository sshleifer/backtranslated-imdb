This film gives a new meaning to the term "unequal", giving us some intriguing characterizations counterbalanced by a clumsy conspiracy that is based on a few well placed stingers to deliver the majority of thrills. <br /> <br /> The plot concerns a group of men who have a secret that has earned them the curse in the form of a ghostly female appearance resulting in death. She may also be seducing their sons. <br /> <br /> It's quite a spectacle to assemble all the famous actors in the same film, but unfortunately, they are not very convincing, especially the scene in which Melvyn Douglas shows off. the deep end begging others to listen to it. So it's no shock that the actors who play these same characters in their youth are terrible, especially Ricky's laughter. They offer the worst scene "I'm not so drunk" that I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The film has some back-up treasures, namely Dick Smith's formidable ghostly make-ups (whatever they are in this film) and Alice Krige's fascinating performance as Alma / Eva. I have never read the novel from which this movie was shot, but I intend to read after reading some of the other reviews on this page. However, you do not need to read the book to understand that it is only the shadow of the original story. There is a good story here, but it seems lost somewhere, in the middle of an exhibition that shows men who have nightmares over and over again and who make unsuspected references to the secret they all share. <br /> <br /> At the moment, it seems that half an hour of footage has been removed from this copy, especially near the climax. After all ... how is it that Fred Astaire manages to mount an excavation of the pond so quickly? What does Gregory Bate and the kid have to do with Eva? And while we're there ... what was she, anyway? Why did letting her get out of the car make the appearance disappear? If it was an apparition, how could he have sex with two men without them knowing? <br /> <br /> These and other questions will never be answered, at least not by this film. Unless restored images are found somewhere, it will probably remain forever a curiosity with oozing makeup, strange sex scenes and nudity, as well as some attractive performances.
