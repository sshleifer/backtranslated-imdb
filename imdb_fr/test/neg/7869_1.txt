Dear director: <br /> <br /> In the future, when you try to create a sense of urgency, it might be better to let your hero * run * instead of jogging / shuffling. Especially if you are trying to strengthen a timeline. For example, if you're trying to convince the public that the villain will really kill the hostage if the hero does not find it, it's probably a good idea to convey the feeling that your hero thinks it could happen ... Let's see things in the face. Making a * good * movie was obviously not your goal. Your goal was to pump waste that will yield more than it would cost. Otherwise, you may have hired actors. <br /> <br /> Sincerely, Bored Viewer. <br /> <br /> It's the worst film I've seen in a long time. I can not say it's the worst of all time, because I was able to finish it. It was bad, bad, bad anyway. Dude, where is my refund?
