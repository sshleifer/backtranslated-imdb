It was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Why would anyone make a movie about murder !!?! Mr. Allen again plays the only type of character he is capable of, the man struggling with sexual stunting who can not have the girl. Get a clue, Allen, there's a reason you're the only character you can represent successfully. Stir well from this movie! It's a waste of time unless you want to know how to succeed in murdering someone. I'm sorry for the actors who say "yes" to Woody Allen. Look at its distribution and tell me how many of these people are still working. My respect for all the actors, who work for him, falls immediately, because they chose to participate in the film.
