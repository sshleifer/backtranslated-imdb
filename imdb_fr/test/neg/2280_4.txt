This is the first recorded effort to put the sound with a movie, and the oldest one that obviously still exists. This historical film is the opening segment of the DVD "More Treasures of Natural Archives". <br /> <br /> This is only the clip of a man playing the violin in front of a huge recording cylinder. Beside him, two men are dancing. Towards the end, another man walks on the stage. William Dickson, the director of this experiment, is the violinist. This "film" has had several titles over the years but the sound experience has not really been a success. It took more than 30 years between synchronizing sight and sound to the point where something could be broadcast to the public for entertainment purposes. However, it was a beginning, regardless of its primacy. <br /> <br /> For more technical information and history of this film process, see the other review here by "Boba Fett1138."
