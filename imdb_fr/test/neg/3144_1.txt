Okay, I agree with all of Barney's enemies on this site. I think Barney and his friends are all ugly and obnoxious and the show is very distorted and unrealistic. <br /> <br /> But what annoyed me the most is how Barney introduced Gays, Lesbians and Bisexuals to his show when we talk about parents and same-sex parents. It would not be a problem if the creators of this show did not use so many derogatory stereotypes of homosexuals. I mean, all gay men do not wear mascara and love the colors purple and pink, and not all lesbians are ugly and virile looking for a sagging chest to the abdomen. As a bisexual woman, I think it's terrible for a children's show. If it were South Park, I would not mind, because South Park is for people who can distinguish fantasy from reality. Many people who look at Barney are small children or people with disabilities who can not usually distinguish fantasy from reality. <br /> <br /> And now that I think about it, Barney looks a bit like an ugly gay stereotype. . Let's see, he has no girlfriend, he is pinkish and wears clothes with glitter (yes, that's right) on it. If you claim to defend the rights of gay and bisexual people, stop making fun of them in front of people who do not know better. If Barney grimaced and ate fried chicken and watermelon at the same time, the show would be removed from the dish before you knew it. <br /> <br /> I give this show a negative out of five. Do not show such bullshit to your children. There are children's programs that are so much less insulting.
