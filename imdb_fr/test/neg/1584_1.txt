I'm not surprised to find that the comments of users of this film are full of nonsense, as the fact that this film "[proves] that when predestined, love will find a solution." I begin with this approach, not to criticize a particular critic, but because this quote characterizes the molasses hyperbolic and uncritical that has been dumped on this film, even before its release in theaters. Even the best movies do not "prove" anything, and they are not. The best movies entertain and move the viewer, and "The English Patient" fails on both criteria. <br /> <br /> I remember very well the promotion of the studio "The English Patient": "Producers of" Amadeus "and 'Flight over the nest of cuckoo' 'An ignorant or carefree listener may miss the crucial word "producers" in this misleading statement and wrongly associate the director of "The English Patient", quite inappropriately, with the great director, Milos Forman.This comparison is shocking to the memory of Mr. Forman. <br /> <br /> Although the Michael Ondaatje novel on which the film is based is good, it is unfortunate that the film has not captured any quality of the book in any way. Apart from the elements of the plot that seem to look like coincidence, the film does not look like the novel. <br /> <br /> Despite the concerns that began when I heard this promotion misleadingly, I went to see this movie at the theater. As I was unfolding, I realized that the novel's particular magic had been misinterpreted, that the actors knew their lyrics but not their characters, and that their characters were flat, dark, and uncompromising. The film was a complete parody of Ondaatje's novel and a cinematic artifact of the worst description that was completely stillborn. <br /> <br /> Those who sprout are very prone to speak with adjectives such as "sweeping" and "grandiose" and "hypnotic". Well, that's none of it. In fact, even Ondaatje's beautiful novel can not be described as "radical" or "grandiose". This could be described as "magical" and "hypnotic". Yet it is precisely these qualities that the film has absolutely failed to offer. It's almost as if Minghella had, as a reader, completely forgotten what was precious in the novel and could only create on the celluloid a pale and skeletal version, a version that not only lacked the spirit of the history, but that was focused on the bad characters. He produced a cinematographic transliteration that not only did not respect the metaphors of history, but apparently did not know them either. <br /> <br /> Minghella diverted the focus of attention from Hana and Kip and put it on Patient and Katherine Clifton, thus missing the narrative track of the novel and its "essence". <br /> <br /> Ralph Fiennes and Kristen Scott Thomas presented performances without commitment, without interest, without interest and without emotion, which were obviously intended to convey a great story of exciting and exciting love for the viewer, but which in reality only provided an inexplicable and superficial connection between two flat, shallow and uninteresting adulteries. Both actors are physically and emotionally inadequate and emotionless, and no performance has provided the viewer with the great emotional reaction manifestly anticipated by the grandiose and exaggerated presentation of Minghella. <br /> <br /> The "sweeping sweep of David-Lean" qualities to which the many indiscriminate critics of this wacky movie like to refer, it's just not there. The comparison with David Lean ("Dr. Zhivago") is a positive insult to another great director. Take, for example, the scene of the sandstorm of the "patient", which is undoubtedly the one in which these "grandiose, sweeping" qualities have resided (or should have resided): the sandstorm is not great - she's not even convincing. The subsequent burial of the characters in the car and their appearance after the storm, which was presumably meant to affect the viewer dramatically and emotionally, were completely lacking drama or emotion - in fact, because it was so obviously weak, of comedy about it where the comedy was clearly irrelevant. <br /> <br /> This film failed. This failed as a rendering of the novel and in film. He seems to have been the "Oscar-winning vehicle of the year" (joining a film slosh as trumpet as "Kramer vs. Kramer" or "Terms of Endearment"). We can only thank God that even the Acadamie <br /> <br /> inspired by the hype had the good sense to present the award for the best actress to Frances McDormand for his performance worthy of the name in the very excellent movie "Fargo". In the execrable "English Patient", there has not been a performance that is neither embarrassingly horrible over-actor (Willem Dafoe), nor really forgettable, mediocre play (Fiennes and Scott Thomas). <br /> <br /> Why this no The entity of a film keeps a group of fanatical (and clearly tasteless) enthusiasts will remain a mystery. Fortunately, the mediocrity of a film will be buried permanently by the sands of time and, fortunately, it will never have the strength to fend for itself.
