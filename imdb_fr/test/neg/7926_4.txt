My first impression of the Saikano trailer: Live Action (visible on YouTube) was "Wow, this could possibly be one of the few best live cartoon adaptations." <br /> <br /> This time, I was just wrong! In other words, Saikano's film, live film, was a puzzle that lacked many pieces; gathered just enough to get the vague picture of all this. <br /> <br /> * HISTORY * <br /> <br /> The story of the film vaguely follows the anime and the manga, but the story of the film is only the frame. of a car, rather than a complete automobile. It seems that many parts of the story behind the anime have been left out, changed or completely changed. In fact, the end is completely different from the manga or the anime. <br /> <br /> Characters in particular; many were left out or had a different feeling. The relationship between Fuyumi and Shuji is reduced to that of Shuji knowing her because she is the saleswoman. The character of Chise already felt too strong and pronounced only the infamous, I am sorry a few times in the film. We can say the same thing with Shuji. We lost the shy but big male lead, the song he sang and his frequent action of calling Silly Chise. Other characters like Tetsu and Akemi had a different and attenuated sensation. Perhaps the downfall and alleviation of the other characters was to focus more on Chise and Shuji, which he did. Too much. Do you expect many action scenes like the trailer? Well no! Those in the trailer, plus a few minutes, is the only amount of action you will get. A good part of the film tells that while I was browsing the film before looking at everything, I thought I got a classic romantic drama in Asia. <br /> <br /> The stimulation was too fast. In the film, we see the famous scene of Chise armed with small wings and a submachine arm, in a little less than nine minutes. There is very little time to get to know the characters and connect with them. What they should have done was divided into two films, or even a trilogy. If it had not been that long, many things would have to be changed or abandoned. <br /> <br /> But again, the film behaves like a frame. The anime was more like a complete automobile, because even if all these little details are so minimal, they can really add up. <br /> <br /> * PRODUCTION * <br /> <br /> -Visuals- The visuals were disappointing. A lot of the special effects turned out to be pretty old-fashioned, especially the CGI. Unfortunately, they looked like the ones found in Sci-Fi movies. They are bearable and this film is not for the effects. <br /> <br /> - The music - The music was average. It was largely orchestral music, except that there was no theme. The film dropped the addictive song that Shuji in the anime still hummed. A remarkable piece of music is the final song heard in the trailer. Not a bad song and a little beautiful. It's a shame that it has not been integrated into the film as such or an orchestrated version of the song. <br /> <br /> -Casting- The casting of Saikano was also average. The main star was Chises actor Aki Maeda, who is best known for his role in the Battle Royale films. The actor who played Shuji was pretty good but they removed the glasses of the original character. Oh yes, and Tetsuo looks like Lupine the 3rd. <br /> <br /> Contrary to what I've heard from a few others, the acting in the movie Saikano has not been so bad. I think rather that the way the story was told and that the series was turned into a two-hour film is to blame. <br /> <br /> * What can we learn from Saikano live action: * <br /> - CGI- I really wish the CGI in Saikano was not so bad. But even with that, we could have had some more fight scenes! Probably the most anticipated animated adaptation in live-action, Neon Genesis Evangelion, will probably not suffer from the presence of WETA studios to perform the effects. <br /> <br /> -Modernism- Fuyumi owned a video store. Chise used an audio cassette player to listen to music and gave Shuji a tape to mix for her birthday. Why? This film is made in 2006! Not only in the cinematographic reality, they can create something like Chise so that it can not happen in the 90s! The future is the era of CDs, DVDs and MP3 players. Hopefully in Evangelion, Shinji will have a Sony Walkman MP3 player. NOT the one who reads cassettes. <br /> <br /> -Story & Pacing- As mentioned earlier, the Saikano movie was too fast and forced the story to give up many details. It was a good idea for ADV Films and everyone else to turn Evangelion into a solid trilogy, which leaves more time to tell a story as faithful as possible at the beginning. <br /> <br /> -Characters- Leave mostly characters characters and let these classic quotes be told! And if the live action Evangelion had not had Asuka "What are you stupid ?!" or Shinji "I must not run away!" Sometimes as small as they appear, these frequent quotes add and make who the characters are. <br /> <br /> * CONCLUSION: * <br /> <br /> In total, the Saikano film has potential. It's really done. Those who are not fans and who see this movie: you will be reluctant to start anime or manga (so do not watch the movie first!) Those who have seen and loved the anime / manga, do not expect do not get out of it on this one. Studies show that you will probably be disappointed. It was still fun to watch the anime come alive in live action adaptation, but it could have been a lot more. <br /> <br /> Reluctantly, I give the live film a Saishu Heiki Kanojo (Saikano) <br /> <br /> As Chise says, "I'm sorry" <br /> <br /> ~ NekoTakuto
