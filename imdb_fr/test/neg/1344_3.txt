I have never seen the original version of the 1930s movie, but this remake is one of the worst I've seen from a big production studio in years. See actors like Meg Ryan and Annette Bening, once close to A-level talent, wandering through poorly scripted roles is painful. Nobody in this film seemed to want to be in front of the camera. <br /> <br /> Jada Pinkett Smith and Debra Messing play worthless roles that have no impact on the plot and add no entertainment value. The character of Jada Pinkett Smith is used as a ploy to look modern, having an African American lesbian character, but in reality she is there to look cool. There is no real reason why Messing plays in this film, except to indicate the number of women in the original I'm taking. <br /> <br /> The secondary characters played by Eva Mendes and Debi Mazar are stereotypical female characters, with Mendes portraying the vixen who seeks to rob the rich but bored and slightly neglected husband and Mazar covering the roles of gossip. <br /> <br /> The film is boring, lacking charm, humor or sympathy for the characters. It almost feels like the film is a punishment for everyone involved, whether in front of or behind the camera. <br /> <br /> There is a glittering hope in the film, though this one is allowed to shine and the dying stars around him are Cloris Leachman. Leachman is still an incredible talent who brings her remarkable charm and humor to the film, in the small role she has.
