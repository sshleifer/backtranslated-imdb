You'll feel like you've been on vacation in hell after sitting down and watching this awful TV movie. This film is an exercise of over-action (very serious over-action) in situations that have turned out to be more than they are. I will not reveal the plot, but once you understand why the characters in this film are fleeing the film's native man, you claim the two hours lost in your life. The only advantage is to see Marcia Brady running in a bikini!
