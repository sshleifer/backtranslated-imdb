Many negative reviews here focus on the historical accuracy of this film. OK, it had about as much to do with the NFL as your average war movie with a real war, or with a western with the real "old west". So, I think we should give them artistic permission. <br /> <br /> The problem is that the director (Clooney) apparently thinks that doing a ball comedy means: a) doing nonsense, b) mug for the camera, and c) taking silly scenes full of mugging and stretch them far too long. Screwball's comedies need a fast pace, not necessarily frenetic, but they move forward quickly. Here, things slip, slide and slide. After watching this film, you'll understand how brilliant Mack Sennett was when he was the pioneer of the genre with his Keystone cops. After 90 years, one would think that the directors would have studied the old masters and learned a thing or two, or even improved a little. But no, it's as if someone had watched a car pioneer build a Duesenberg and, nearly a century later, paid tribute to him and "improved" the concept by assembling a child carriage square wheels. <br /> <br /> I have enjoyed several Clooney movies, I consider him a talented actor. But very few actors can practice competently; Clint Eastwood took some time to understand. Clooney is clearly at the bottom of a very steep slope. The film becomes more watchable during the very few times when it is out of the frame, but when it is in the photo, it is the center of attention. In combat scenes, his aggression is so odious that you would want someone to really hit him. <br /> <br /> If you're doing a ball comedy and want a romance, you have to develop some chemistry between men. and women leads. Clooney and Zellweger have all the chemistry of a pair of dumpsters sitting in a parking lot. No spark, no sizzle, not even post-mortem contraction. Zellweger, who has also produced very good films, must have exchanged his botox injections for oak tannins, which gives him a superb performance in wood. She might have just managed to play the role of "tough in the men's world" if, just once, while trying to defeat testosterone, she had looked at the camera with a small half-smile and flicker in her face. the eyes. But no, she kept her harness tight until the end. <br /> <br /> Of course, the biggest sin here is that the movie is just not funny. Doing stupid things is not the same thing as slapstick. Doing stupid things that are very inventive, like Stooges, or very athletic, like Buster Keaton, can be hilarious. But otherwise, it's boring and, well, stupid. I think I had a good laugh about the whole movie. <br /> <br /> Avoid this one. I saw it for free on the cable and I always wanted to get my money back.
