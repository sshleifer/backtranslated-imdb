A tedious gangster movie that gives hope that someone edited it more relentlessly. I would have thought that the story of the creation of Las Vegas would be interesting, but it fails almost every turn. Warren Beatty's performance as a stupid and inconceivable Bugsy Seigel lets you wish you to look at someone else. Once or twice, he goes through the fog of his performance to deliver an interesting scene, but most of the time, we do not care. Annette Benning is an untrustworthy lover, but she is only slightly more savory than him. <br /> <br /> I would not really care about this drama as insane as Benning's.
