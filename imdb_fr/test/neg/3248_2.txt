OK, I would give a 1, but I will give two because I laughed watching this movie ... First, I can make a much better movie than this one ... in a week .. .The special effects made this movie a joke. Do not make such films with horrible special effects because people will not take it seriously. The acting and the direction was also horrible. The scenario involved many plots and the whole film was not credible. It must be the worst Indian movie of all time. The songs were so bad. The game was bad and artificial. Do I need to say more? Do not watch this movie unless you are curious to see how bad it is. That's why I watched it. I go into the movie and I wanted to see how bad a movie can become. Believe me, I watched one of the worst movies in history, if not THE worst movie.
