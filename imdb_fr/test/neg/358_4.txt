Despite the fact that it was a movie made for television (and an obvious movie: that it was cheap), CLASS WARFARE let me wish I could get my money back and, considering that this poor production was partially financed by Canadian funds. I may just have to get some dollars. <br /> <br /> What made me crack is to see actress Lindsey McKeon, whom I've been watching for two years in her role as "goody-goody" Mara Lewis on the soap opera GUIDING LIGHT, in turn plays "the wicked" to change. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, she succeeds, as Kristen, a rich and spoiled woman who is suddenly poor in the ground, but with a devious tendency and a destiny spell that could eventually change her fortune. back around. The fate of fate is predicted in the character of Richard (Robin Dunne), a socially radical pariah who discovers that he just had nothing to gain $ 23 million on a lottery ticket. Now pair Richard, Kristen, his boyfriend jock, Jason (Wade Carpenter), and their camel-obsessed mutual friend, Graham (Dave McGowan) for the weekend in an isolated cabin, cut off from the world by storms, and guess what is unfolding. <br /> <br /> The film suffers from being too congested by both the story and the personality and motivations of the characters. Everyone is rather one-dimensional and you do not have to be a rocket scientist to realize that some things, and some people, will go very badly, very quickly. I do not think it's an original script and that it does not make any more. The acting is OK, McKeon is a manipulative lead actress, and Dunne is very good, maybe a little too much sometimes, but no one else deserves to be written at home. The only other real merit that I can attribute to the film is the turn that I did not see getting closer to the end (but it's not the end, it's so obvious that it hurts). Anyway, I attended all this and I lived to tell the story, so I can not say it was a total loss. <br /> <br /> 4/10. A film like "something to watch when nothing happens".
