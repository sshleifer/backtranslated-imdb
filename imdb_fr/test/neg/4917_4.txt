At the rate at which these films are scrolling among the artifacts of Amityville House, we will soon be leaning over the floor, but for now, it's a mirror that causes problems for more cardboard characters in this sixth entry from the Serie. A homeless man entrusts him to Ross Partridge, an artist's hairdresser, who then has strange visions and discovers unpleasant revelations about his past. This banal horror crawls at a dull pace, letting us wait for an accumulation that never comes while the various "spooky" events lead to a stupid finale. Bland and lifeless, with Ropey roleplaying and the huge Partridge hair that does not help.
