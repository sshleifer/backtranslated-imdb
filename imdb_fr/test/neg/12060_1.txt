1 st watched 19/07/2003 - 1 out of 10 (Dir-Brad Sykes): A ridiculously lame 3D movie that follows pretty much the plot of many 80s teenage slasher movies. Stupid kids go to a deadly encampment known, are chased away by an unknown masked man and then we try to determine who, if any, will live. We do not really care who's behind the mask, but even it's not hard to know if you've seen a film like this. What a mess of 3D viewer despite 3D effects a little decent.
