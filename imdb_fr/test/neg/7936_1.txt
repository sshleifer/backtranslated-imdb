You expect him to be a minor but you wait for at least one complete and coherent film. Such a waste. I am extremely disappointed, not only to have watched a bad movie, but to have such a great concept that is corrupted by a common film that we have all seen before. If this budget exceeds the budget, the studio would be better off declaring its victory, collecting all available copies, storing them at the bottom of the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository, and then never making a film like this again. Most of this movie will make you think, "That's not what I wanted to see." This film seduces the unintelligent and perhaps the teenagers. It's a shame because most movies are made for this demographic. I had a lot more hope for this film.
