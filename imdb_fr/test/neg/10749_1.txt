I disagree 100% with the critic who was 100% in disagreement with the critic who gave this short an "F" rating. Heavy reliance on political propaganda only obscures Joe Dante's lack of ability to shoot another Screamer from his bag of mischief. The series "Masters of Horror" was a phenomenal collection of really horrible tales, with the exception of this episode. <br /> <br /> Despite the success of those who wish to promote its political direction, "Homecoming" is the least effective episode of MS season one. Unlike the rest of the series, Dante's film is a parody of the genre, lacking both horror and humor in his poetic discourse on a hackneyed political point. <br /> <br /> We can only blame Dante. pulling that stinky out of the shelf because it was not his creation. The zombie subgenus is very popular during this decade and, among George Romero's predictable tributes and empty fantasies, is a number of works designed to convey political or (ir) relativistic messages. Such works are neither written nor intended for true horror fans. Maybe Dante is really not a master of horror either. What has he been doing since The Howling, after all? <br /> <br /> If you want a lame anti-war zombie movie with some references to pop culture considered humor, the homecoming may be your business. If you are a fan of horror movies looking for something magisterial, take most of the other episodes of the series. My personal favorite was Dario Argento's "Jenifer", loosely based on a classic Bruce Jones and Berni Wrightson's classic comics short film - really scary.
