Let's see, cardboard characters like Muslim terrorists forced a cardboard scientist to test exotic drugs on cardboard people who had been drugged and kidnapped. You will be sure to laugh when these pathetic excuses for humanoids find their just desert! It turns out that the drug experiments gave them the ability to feel another world ... the world of religious fantasy! - with cardboard demons that look like paper mache. Everyone is dragged to hell, with the exception of a poor boy who goes to heaven where he can probably spend eternity with the butts that created this masterpiece of the absurd. I think I would choose Hellfire myself. Go see something else, unless you are stoned, in which case you might like it! Could not hurt!
