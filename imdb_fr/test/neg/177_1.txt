The film is annoying. <br /> <br /> Technically, it happens too often to see blurry scenes and very grossly mounted. One could easily get a cleaner movie using a decent amateur camera and a $ 100 video editing software. The feet on the ground, the man of the street does not mean that the assembly is neglected. Fuzzy scenes that do not contain important instructions must have been deleted. The same goes for making sure the head / hand / other of the object stays in the frame. My 8 year old already knows it. <br /> <br /> The film is too long. The essential (anti-globalization) is understood after 30 minutes, why bother with everything else. After the interview with James Suckling, I pressed the "Stop" button. How long is it? <br /> <br /> The main theme just does not work for me anymore. I have seen too many small wineries producing mediocre and marketed wines and many great wineries producing exceptional wines. The film identifies small producers as those who produce wines with more identity or terroir. The biggest are accused of producing "internationalized" or "commercialized" wines. The film tries to make a black and white statement in a world full of gray tones. However, the film did not prove this statement. They examine some sporadic examples, "bind" some of the big producers (Frescobaldi) to fascism and provide "interviews" with key people. Well, have not all the small producers spent the Second World War in the resistance? Is it relevant to see that Parker has a problem with Bulldogs? The film is very manipulative and unconvincing.
