No wonder it's free with the Mail on Sunday, slow, bad acting and filming (flare, near the beginning of the film, it's not even artistic) = Right to the video, but not in this case, why not get back some of your (film production costs) by publishing it for free with a British Sunday newspaper, at least in this way, you get a captive audience and recover some fees. <br /> <br /> I did not give this film a rating of 1 out of 10, because of the efforts to extract old actors from their shells, it was nice to see old faces (Vanessa Redgrave It's not Blow (up), but Vinnie Jones in the lead, and I think he was better in Gone in 60 seconds when he was not speaking. <br /> <br /> This film is becoming less popular, I think it will find its true mark in 3-4 out of 10, in the very near future
