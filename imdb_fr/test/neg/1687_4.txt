My wife and children were featured as the 2000 Cosby show, but unlike the latter, it was neither funny nor unbeatable. In fact, it is so badly written and some of the jokes revolve around Michael Mickey taking the muteness of Michael Jr and the fact that he is a loser - which became more and more tedious and boring over the series. What was supposed to be a promising success ended up becoming an idiotic and idiot show where ideas became so ridiculous and ridiculous. And as for the second Claire, I regretted this character so much: she became a spoiled child, childish and moaning, in most of the last episodes. it was rather a bad black sitcom in general terms.
