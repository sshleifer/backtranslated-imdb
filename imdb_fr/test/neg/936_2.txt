All I can say is that this movie is made for the Lifetime channel on television, which means that there are no strong characters, no particular style, that there is no type suggested sex, but that there is no breasts or tush (because it would be a catapult of the film) in the depths of sleaze, is not it?) but sex very simulated, well, its good. <br /> <br /> When I watch these movies, I have to wonder when will these types of TV channels and their advertisers grow up? I think these companies are actually very late. They really have no idea what the younger generation is listening to and if they knew they would demand that we change. The interest of many US television channels such as these seems to mostly regurgitate the same disinfected and diluted waste, such as a generic film assembly line. I guess it works for them ... or at least it worked. Not sure of the future though. <br /> <br /> Do not be bored like me. Look for real TV movies on HBO, Showtime, IFC, Starz, etc. Any chain that makes efforts in its work and does not have to ask a priest what she can or can not show.
