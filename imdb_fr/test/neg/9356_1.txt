I can not believe some of the comments here in the comments. The film is dated of course, and from our comfortable point of view, in the era of CGG, many special effects are not convincing at the moment. But even with this in mind, Helen of Troy is so bad that she is almost laughable. <br /> <br /> The script is horrible, just horrible, without any characterization. The performance suffers, you can see people like Hardwicke and Andrews writhing in embarrassment as they deliver the most ridiculous lines of shallow fund-codes. Writers seem to feel the need to explain almost everything in a dreadful didactic scenario that allows the viewer to decide nothing for himself. The beginning of the film describes the historical context as if no one had ever heard of ancient Greece; I know they had to take into consideration the American public, but the condescending way that was told to us twice to make sure that we understand that the action is really horrible. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I can not believe the comments above that describe this action. movie as a great epic movie. Even taking into account the relatively primitive cinematography and relative sophistication of today's audience, this film really stinks.
