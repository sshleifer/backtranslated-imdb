Yes, that's what I felt after I finished watching this movie. The acting is below average and the special effects are horrible. In fact, the worst I have ever seen. It's a very small budget film. There is no way this movie can scare you, it does not have terrifying or scary moments. Mr. Bone Eater was more of a funny creature for me. It could have been a lot better, but hey, they did not have a big budget. The film does not convince you that you are watching a horror movie, lol. I would call this movie The Time Eater. I'm sure you would have a lot of better movies / etc to watch. Look at it anyway if: 1. you have nothing else to look at. 2. You can watch it for free. No need to rent at all.
