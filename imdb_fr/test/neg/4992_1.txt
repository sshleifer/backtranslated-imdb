This is the worst movie I have ever seen. Boring, illogical, terrible. Do not miss even a minute of your life to watch this shit! I hope that the directors will not make any other film because this film ruins them. The film seems to have been created in one or two days with friends of the directors (if we can use this word for these 2 guys). They only use the camera in their hand. Many scenes are in the dark and nothing can be seen. Many scenes (80% of the film) are only in conversation. ! There are movies like Vampire vs. Zombies that you can laugh about, but this one is just bad, no need to make such movies. Please, stop Jason Horton and Shannon Hubbel. Do not make more movies!
