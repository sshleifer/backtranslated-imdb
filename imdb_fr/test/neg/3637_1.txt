For all the Nickelodeon fans who watched the network in the '80s and' 90s, there was always something positive. You had entertaining acts like You Can not Do That on TV. You've had weird but good shows like Pete & Pete. You even had caricatures that taught morality like Doug. But just like Disney, Nickelodeon has fallen into the box, limiting its population to shallow tweens and giving us a lame excuse to come up with new, innovative shows. As I tried to watch Zoey 101, I shook my head in disgust. <br /> <br /> The parameter could not be more wrong than this one. Each character attends a boarding school called Pacific Coast Academy, offering everything a spoiled child wants. A sushi bar, laptops everywhere, flat-screen TVs in every room, nice dorms to hang out with, and so on. The kids on this show are rarely seen in class and there does not seem to be any real teachers. It's more like a place you'd like to spend during the summer holidays rather than working and studying while getting ready for college. <br /> <br /> The characters were also a factor that discouraged me. Each episode is composed of problems of boys, situations they themselves caused and problems to solve. Each character is a stereotype. Zoey (Jamie Lynn) seems perfect in everything she does and each of her friends asks for help when they feel that they are in serious danger. Leading it only to have no other side. I went to school and I can tell you that nobody is like that. Chase is stupid. Logan plays the arrogant tough guy. Quinn plays a nerd that is very unrealistic in what she does. Michael is an idiot. Lola is a clone of Nicole. Dana is just fine, a tough person. Why not use some originality? Something that is unique for these characters and different from other personalities? Are stereotypes what the creators of this series can offer better? Instead, these actors are boring personalities with the sense that their roles lack creativity. There is nothing here that can surprise or surprise. <br /> <br /> Not only that, but the series is clearly aimed at targeting teenage children, facing a stage in which they must evolve from childhood to being an adult. During this time, they must learn to study for themselves, make their own decisions and do what is right for them. Zoey 101 does not contain any of these values. In this case, we are supposed to believe that to succeed, it is enough to have a stereotypical personality. I'm sorry, but that's just not true. People can not expect things to be given to them, as the actors on this show do, and just let these things stay there. If I expect things to happen in real life Zoey 101, I would live in a fantasy world locked in a dream house. Nothing in this show is about those who face health and money problems. This does not apply to children who want to learn something meaningful. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, Zoey 101 is a Nickelodeon show that falls flat on the face. It displays a horrible message for kids and I strongly think that the show itself is just inappropriate for them. Of course, he has no morbid violence, but he teaches everything to make a child act and looks stupid. A horrible sight, and should be forgotten with the rest of the trash that Nickelodeon has done in recent years. <br /> <br /> 1 of 10.
