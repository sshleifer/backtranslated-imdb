'Carolina Moon' is a suitable TV movie for a girl with psychic power who returns to the city where she grew up and where her best childhood friend was murdered. It turns out that every year, on the same date, another girl is murdered and Tori, played by Claire Forlani, must solve the mystery before dying. Claire Forlani (Meeting with Joe Black, CSI New York) is the main woman and is doing a very good job. It is brilliantly supported by Oliver, a deliciously delicious, and a Jacqueline Bisset, always bright. The script, adapted from a novel by Nora Roberts, conforms to the standard standard and the plot <br /> <br /> is tediously predictable. This, however, is compensated again by, as I said, the very delicious Oliver Hudson.
