Hollywood has thrown another trash that is extremely over-treated and disappointing for the first time. Hannibal is bad, terrible, inept, lame, funny, stupid, ingenious, laughable and utterly atrocious (no pun intended). Small spoilers follow ... <br /> <br /> This movie has huge logical flaws - more than any other Bruckheimer / Bay movie - or even any other movie showing the indulgence of Hollywood hype. This is a Hollywood production designed to take advantage of Hannibal Lector's mania, directed by the director of "So-Somber-It-takes-It-too-Seriously", Ridley Scott, and produced by an Italian producer with a swollen ego whose creed is "no matter whether the film is or not, the money is good". <br /> <br /> I can not forget the fact that acclaimed screenwriters David Mamet and Steven Zaillian have written this gutsy fit of a lame and a pretentious book by Thomas Harris, a good novelist turned hack-writer. David and Steven - well-known and immensely talented screenwriters - have squandered their efforts on a mediocre scenario in exchange for high salaries. Another factor in the disappointment of this film. <br /> <br /> There are too many ridiculous scenes to list that are laughable in a clumsy execution and bad logic, for example. A Starling / Pazzi cell phone in pursuit of Lecter that reveals Inspector Pazzi as a victim. Not to mention the ridiculously bad dialogues delivered by Tony Hopkins with a smirk and Julianne Moore, Ray Liotta and others who can not act with the impassive face. Hopkins gives the true meaning of "scene-chewing" with Hammy acting by Gary Oldman as a deformed psychopath dedicated to an unstoppable revenge against Lecter. <br /> <br /> The gore effect is good, but only serves to repel provide the suspense that is notably absent from Hannibal. The predecessor - Silence of the Lambs - is more believable with tension and suspense. The suspense is what made Silence of the Lamb work like a spectacular mix of psychological horror and thriller, as well as superb writing and tense direction. The "dinner-brain" sequence is so false that it looks like self-parody. <br /> <br /> The end is a bit blatant and silly - are we supposed to believe that Lecter is still a threat to society with the last shot building his sparkling eye staring at you? Ooh, scary ... <br /> <br />
