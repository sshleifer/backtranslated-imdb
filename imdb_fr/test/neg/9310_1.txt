I can not emphasize how bad this movie is. This director took all the inexpensive and unintelligent steps to give these people such a "distressed" look. Why are their clothes so dirty? Why the hell would you like the new Clark Kent to play head? Buddy Giovinazzo should be banned from motion pictures for the rest of his life. <br /> <br /> I seriously offend this fool who wants to make real actors thugs and lowlifes as a kind of smart joke. Why would you ask Clark Kent to play a crackhead? Why are they screaming so much? Why is everyone so mean? Why are these kids so dirty? Nobody would want to be so dirty? Not even a crackhead child. <br /> <br /> You must grow and never make movies again.
