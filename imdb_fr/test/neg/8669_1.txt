Why did they have to make such a terrible adaptation? The entire "Complete Jane Austin" series as part of Masterpiece Classics looks like a huge disappointment. The characters are totally wrong and there is no chemistry on the screen. Everything seems rather hasty. The release of the 1999 film based on the same novel seems to be a masterpiece compared to that. I really want to forget it. I'm really happy that "Pride and Prejudice" is not being redone as part of this project and we will see the iconic and beautiful Colin Firth and Jennifer Elle as protagonists. If you skipped this production of "Mansfield Park", consider yourself lucky!
