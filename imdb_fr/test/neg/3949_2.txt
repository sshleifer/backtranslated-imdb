I was not very excited to see this movie, but a group of us decided to go see it at the opening night. I wanted to get up and go out and try to get my money back 20 minutes after the movie started. I felt that the movie was very boring, uninteresting and not true in many ways, including the "game". I did my best not to fall asleep during the movie because I watched one of the worst horror movies I've ever seen. The series of scary movies was more frightening than this movie. The sad attempt to attract a Gothic girl, an overworked businessman, a 15-year-old geek and some random guy in a video game that kills you is a bad plot to start. Then they try to create a very horrible love scene in which the main character kisses another girl after rescuing her 10 minutes after the murder of her girlfriend. The theater was packed at the beginning of the movie. A little over half of the population had already left before the end of the film. If you feel the need to lose just 1 hour and 16 minutes of your time watching this movie ... get ready to feel cheated.
