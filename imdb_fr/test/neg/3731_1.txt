Feeling Minnesota is one of the worst movies I've ever seen, it's also one of the most disgusting movies of all time. This has to do with a woman who is forced to marry a man from the disgusting crowd. At the wedding, she meets her brother Jjaks. After eating the cake, they have sex at home and then decide to flee together. The other brother, of course, comes after his weapons are inflamed and he kills his wife. Jjaks wakes up to find his corpse in the bathtub and buries it. He seems to be friends with the Jjaks and they try to raise money because someone is singing them because he has seen them and the body. It goes around and many characters die or come back to life, but that never comes with anything that could be called a good plot. The performances are horrible to just about everyone. Cameron Diaz, Keanu Reeves and Dan Akroyed. The direction, the dialogues and the visual effects are simply horrible. A disgusting and horrible movie.
