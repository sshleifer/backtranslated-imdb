I was totally disgusted with this useless sequel to "The Poseidon Adventure", a movie about which I gave an excellent comment. <br /> <br /> This movie is amazing from the word GO! I agree, why were there no other lifeboats and helicopters? The one who saved the first survivors had just flown over the boat on which Michael Caine and Sally Field are. WAS THE ONLY RESCUE TEAM? Hard to believe. <br /> <br /> The acting is usually mediocre and the show seems cheap. I really hated the talent wasting of good actors. <br /> <br /> Do not watch this movie unless you catch Sally and Michael in love. <br /> <br /> gord
