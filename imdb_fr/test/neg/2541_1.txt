First of all, it's the worst movie I've ever seen. It may make you want to see it, but it's not bad in a good way. It's annoying, improbable, badly shot, ridiculously scripted and devoid of disastrous effects. <br /> <br /> Worse, it is intensely patriotic without any trace of irony or pleasure, wallowing in Japanese uniqueness and victimization. Everyone leaves the Japanese at the right moment. In particular Koreans. The most noble characters choose the seppaku - descend with their ship while their beloved island sinks. "Only the Japanese would think that way," said the prime minister. <br /> <br /> If this film reflects in any way Japanese opinion on its place in world opinion, the first thing to do to correct the problem is stop making movies like that.
