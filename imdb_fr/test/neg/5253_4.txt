I've heard a lot about Beowulf, maybe because I'm Romanian and a lot of it was shot here in my country. And I was expecting a lot from this movie. In the end, I was disappointed. It's not as bad as other users have said, but it's definitely bad. This is a monster that kills people in a castle of the 6th century and Lambert who comes to kill him. Lambert is good, as he is in all his roles, but the rest of the characters are nil, and the action is not too good either. In addition, maybe the only thing that could have saved this movie, the special effects, is also very bad, the monster looks awful (not scary, but awful). Oh and another bad thing: music. The film tries and manages to create the atmosphere of the 6th century. But all the action sequences are presented on rock music, which is very very bad. I mean that rock action works perfectly on a movie like Charlie's Angels - where it's the perfect way to turn your action. But here it was a very bad idea. <br /> <br /> Rating: 4 out of 10
