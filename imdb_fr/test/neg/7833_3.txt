Brief summary: soundtrack almost nonexistent and poorly chosen, shooting continuously with stable cameras, but with a lot of coffee and a hyperactive cameraman, NO conspiracy and nothing really happens. The film goes from one dialogue to another, sounds hollow, never reaching depth, never creating the illusion that you are really in a web of conspiracy paintings, and that everyone has a business with everything the world is only a boring excuse to show the leading actress in beautiful underwear. (which, with its rusty voice, is certainly nice, but without which to found a film) The highlight for me is the opening scene and the film has deteriorated to a point where I just wanted to leave the film close to 45 seconds. minutes in the story. I regret not having done so.
