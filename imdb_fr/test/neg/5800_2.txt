this movie has NO conspiracy. it was supposed that a guy moved to his grandmother and everyone thinks he is a loser and he must redeem himself. but what happens when everyone discovers who he lives with? they have a big potty party at grandma's house. the highlight of the film did not even relate to the rest. all the plot was presented a few minutes after the end of the film. I can see how it could have been related to the so-called story - that grandma's skills as VG are buying it back - but it just was not there. <br /> <br /> However, the film was really funny and was clearly based on jokes. <br /> <br /> "Her pussy feels the great depression" "He just sucked his first nipple ... yeah for 13 hours" "It's for you ... I think it's the devil"
