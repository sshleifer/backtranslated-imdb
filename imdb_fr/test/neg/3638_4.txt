I have seen this program a few times and the more we see, the less I like it. Jamie Lynn Spears has been approached to do this because she is Britney's sister and I am sorry to say that this is evident in the series. They created the Zoey character as everything people want to believe: Jamie Lynn is smart, original, smart, pretty, popular, and so on. The characters around her are only there to make her better, by becoming smarter than them, more popular than they are, more sought after by boys than they are. There is nothing original about it and it's full of money, so every kid has the coolest fashion possible. I must also say that for a girl of 13 years (or whatever her age, she can not be much older), she wears very ripe clothes, these short skirts are too short, it makes you want to the young people of them wear, and everything else. this makeup, this adds to the growing problems of why girls have so many problems. The only thing I will say is that the opening credits are sung by Jamie Lynn and, given his age, he is not bad at all, much better than his sister anyway with respect to vocal abilities. Sorry, he is too mature and yet too silly. He has done wrong with predictable scenarios and there are far too many stereotypes.
