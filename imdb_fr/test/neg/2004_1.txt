I will not repeat what so many others have said about this film. I will try to add some new points. Coolio-as-vampire is a nod to fans who know his role in Blondie's song "No Exit" in which he assumes the role of a vampire rapper (it is in fact a musical concept and song). Casper Van Dien is no worse than Brad Pitt and is actually more beautiful. And really, what do you find in a Brad Pitt movie for anything other than candy for the eyes? Same thing here, although it is badly filmed (look rather "Starship Troopers"). And of course, Udo Kier, after playing Dracula in the movie Morrissey / Warhol, has little more than a brief appearance. Enjoy it if you can.
