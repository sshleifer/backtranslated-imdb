Steve Carell is the only feature that redeems this movie. Like John Wayne, I've never seen Steve Carell stretch as far as an actor, but whatever. He always plays his role perfectly. <br /> <br /> As Marty Feldman said, comedy must have internal coherence. You can have four men on stage sitting in garbage cans, and that's fine, but if you bring a fifth man on stage who is not in a garbage can, then you have to explain to the public why he is not so . . <br /> <br /> Why does not Evan accept his role as messenger of God? Why, when he accepts it, is it so deeply embarrassed? Why is no one more impressed by the way animals follow Evan (they are explained by foolish skeptics as "trained animals" perhaps from a circus). There is a terrible flood at the end, and most of the people we see jump into the ark and are saved, but thousands would certainly have been killed by the flood; there is no post-disaster emotional mood at the end. Instead, most members of Congress have finally seen the light and are about to sue the only member of Congress, deemed in bad faith, for "profit", <br /> <br /> Evan .
