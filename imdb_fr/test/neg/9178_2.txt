Fred "The Hammer" Williamson delivers another cheap movie. He could have set a new standard. Look for the painfully obvious special effect mortar gun that is visible in the street during a hunting scene. You do not see it just once, you see it many times. Look for blurred shooting in a scene and the camera operator tries to fix it as the scene progresses. Watch this with a group of people and create your own mystery science theater!
