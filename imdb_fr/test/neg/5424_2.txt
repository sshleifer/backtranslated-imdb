There is not really much wrong with Crash of the Moons. Basically, it's about a few episodes of Rocky Jones, Space Ranger merged into a movie. He is extremely dated, however. Winky's treatment of Vena is a good example. It must be remembered that it was designed to be shown to children in the fifties. In this respect, it succeeds. If you love science fiction for children of the 50s, go ahead, take a look. You will see John Banner in a pre-sgt. Role of Schultz. He does a very good job. Overall, I would give it a 6 out of 10. Not great, but not bad.
