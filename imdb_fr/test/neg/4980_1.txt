I watched movies on demand and saw Underdog for free. It was only 82 minutes, so I decided to watch it. I did not expect much but it exceeded my expectations of being awful. Everything in the movie was crazy. The dialogue was atrocious, with lots of terrible word games. The jokes were so terrible. I found myself screaming and turning off my TV screen while I was in this trash. He has very well touched his target audience but I do not see how anyone else could appreciate this movie. It pissed me off and almost cried because of all that this movie was terrible. <br /> <br /> The only nice thing about this movie was to be able to give it a 1/10 after watching it. I beg you to avoid it at all costs. I understand the fact that it's done for kids, but there is nothing nice about it.
