I love documentaries. Andy Goldsworthy's doc was excellent. I was looking forward to it, but I was very disappointed. I knew Kahn and was intrigued by the idea of ​​his lonely death in the bedroom of a Penn Station man. I mistakenly thought there must be a story here. The only story here is that of sadly deceived women who had a relationship with a very famous married little man. In the absence of any explanation of the horrible behavior of this type, we have constantly repeated clips of walking Kahn and long painfully supposed - contemplative - plans of his soulless buildings. In reality, some buildings are interesting but the film ask us to think of the guy himself. The overworked soundtrack refers to an emotional tug that is totally absent from the movie. Kahn's apparent gifts do not excuse his behavior or torment his mistresses. This film seems to want to give Kahn the free pass of the great artist and thus make the director and his mother friendly - I do not buy it.
