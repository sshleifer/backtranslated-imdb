I like the concept of CSI, but the show is ruined by serious actors. The forensic pathologist has the best lines and delivers them in a haphazard and casual manner that drives the story. Unfortunately, he spends a short time on the screen. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, why does Jorja Fox always look so unhappy? I know that forensic investigation is a very serious matter, but the characters, for the most part, seem to confuse the seriousness with the lack of humor and the total lack of personality. I can not imagine going out with Sarah Sidle or Catherine Willows; what would you talk to one or the other? I'm waiting for the episode where, at the end of a shift, Catherine takes a remote control, points it at Grissom, turns it off and throws it in a closet until the next day.
