Jack Black and Kyle Gass play fantastic versions of themselves in this comical showcase of their Tenacious D side-band, an art-rock outfit with satirical and barbed lyrics. A former fugitive obsessed with heavy metal and a smoking smoker, who claims to be a rock god, meets and forms a group (the birthmarks on their two buttocks form the group's nickname). "The Pick of Destiny" is a relatively well produced film for older children. It begins with a funny prologue reminiscent of a video of Twisted Sister dating from the 80s; it sometimes looks like nothing more than a middle-aged version of "Wayne's World", with jokey-stoner interludes and a decisive fight with Beelzebub himself, but Black and Gass have an extremely comfortable relationship (they have also acted as producers, co-have script and all the music). The target audience will obviously be self-evident, even if the inspiration is a little weak, especially in the second half (at about the time when our heroes impulsively exceed the cops in a student pilot car). The musical sequences are much more successful than the satire attempts of films and, for the first thirty minutes or so, Jack Black's manic enthusiasm is contagious. * 1/2 of ****
