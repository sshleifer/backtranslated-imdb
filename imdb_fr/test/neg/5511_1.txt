I try to remember the name of this movie for years (not in a row, of course). I had seen him at the local dollar cinema at the age of 11 and he was so excruciating that I almost went out. I think I did not realize we were allowed to leave before the end of the film. Anyway, it kept me in mind as the worst movie I saw growing. I can finally give him the evaluation he deserves. <br /> <br /> 1/10 (it was strangely satisfying)
