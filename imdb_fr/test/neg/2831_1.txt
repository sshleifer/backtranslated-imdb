First of all, it's one of the worst "erotic thrillers" I've ever known. Of course, as all erotic thrillers want to do, it's a madam and takes place in a brothel. This, of course, makes the simulated softcore sex that appears every 10 minutes seems "in context". It does not matter. <br /> <br /> Forget for a moment that this was never designed to earn rewards. The actors are terrible and the reading of their lines made me cringe. The woman who plays the policeman is so mean that it's inconceivable. She must be REALLY a good friend of the guys who made the film for this terrible adventure, if you know what I mean. <br /> <br /> The production is only slightly higher than that of porn. Other than that? I guess if you're really drunk and need something to laugh at, that would be a perfect movie. And if that's the case, I recommend you move quickly in all the scenes with the policewoman. What is this accent, Brooklyn? Hilarious!
