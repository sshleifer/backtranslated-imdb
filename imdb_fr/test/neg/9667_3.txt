There is something odd about the anti-social sentiment found in some Cheech And Chong documents. One of the songs in Up In Smoke, well, I often want more songs to start this way. But in this excuse for a video, the stoner duo shows us the four-song videos from their current album, also titled Get Out Of My Room. You hear a voice-over during the opening credits, in which an anonymous producer describes the recording as a novelty record that will occupy a prominent place in the charts. Unfortunately, this opening voiceover is striking. <br /> <br /> Most music recordings approved by the RIAA seem to respect the rule of placing the best material at the beginning of the album. Often, when one goes beyond the first song, the informed listener notices that the recording has little, if any, to hold his attention. On the other hand, groups that challenge traditional conventions often keep their best material, or at least distribute it evenly on the disc. In this case, Cheech and Chong seem to have decided to protect themselves. The first part, Get Out Of My Room, is a hilarious theme song with an incredibly bad video. Many viewers of a music video of the 1980s will find this direction a little nostalgic. Cheech's design of British punk is also incredibly fun. <br /> <br /> Wherever everything goes, it's the second number, I'm not at home right now. Nothing kills the interest of a song like repetition, and it is difficult to get more repetition than this auditive shit. Honestly, we feel the urge to slap Cheech in the face and tell him that we have understood the idea, he is not at home at the moment, so keep going. The next song, on the theme of love being a strange thing, is the absolute bottom of rock, not only for this collection, but for Cheech And Chong in general. It's almost as if this song was made for the sole purpose of extending the playing time of the album. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, the stoner duo has kept the best for last, but it is also curious to note that Chong is completely absent from this cup. Born In East L.A. is a simple number based on the former Bruce Springsteen issue that mocks Reagan's vision of multiculturalism. As we are crazy about Cheech's story, one has to wonder how many poor schleps who could not speak a word of Spanish were deported to Mexico simply because their skin was not white as a sheet. Racism was an integral part of American culture in 1985 and remains so today. If something has gotten worse, one has to wonder what would be Born In East LA if it was written in the present day. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, two cuts do not make an album, especially when there is so much boring filling between them. The interviews before Get Out Of My Room, for example, are pretty funny. Not like the others of Up In Smoke, but fun enough to justify their existence. Unfortunately, the two middle songs are reflected in their making-of. A boring song makes the load boring. If you removed half of the half an hour of content from this video, you would have something much better. <br /> <br /> I awarded Get Out Of My Room three out of ten. They are won by the first and the last video. I'm pretty sure the stars are looking at this stuff today and wondering what they were thinking about.
