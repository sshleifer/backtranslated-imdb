The Spanish Inn is less funny and less interesting than any episode of Dobie Gillis. Where is their Bob Denver? Do they even have a Dwayne Hickman? A French settles in Barcelona to take classes. He moves in with other students who are no more interesting than him, and they do and say uninteresting things. This film is incredibly bland. The only good thing was a pretty French girl who played a Belgian lesbian. She places her hands behind her head and reveals shaved armpits, not the usual tufts of dark, smelly hair. But bare armpits do not make a good movie. The Emmerdeur was funny, as well as La Cage aux Folles. L'Auberge Espagnole and Le Placard make you wonder what's wrong with French comedy.
