I never read the book. Now, I do not really want to. I had no idea what this movie was like when I entered the theater. I still do not really know how much it was meant to be heard, but I know that two good hours have been lost in my life. Two precious hours that I will never be able to recover. <br /> <br /> The story was so predictable that it was laughable. Werewolves ... or something ... a plot very like Romeo and Juliet. I predicted the end within five minutes of the film. And I was right. <br /> <br /> The acting game is not horrible. The only two cool characters in the film were the British cousin and the guy from the graphic novel Rambo. The other characters are too ... the dialogue is very bland and predictable. <br /> <br /> The worst part of the film concerns the transformations between "humans" and "wolves". If you wanted something teasing like Van Helsings, you'll be really upset. Imagine ballerinas, a bright light, then a wolf. Yes ... that's about it. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie. Period. Especially if you read the book, because you just want to hit the babies.
