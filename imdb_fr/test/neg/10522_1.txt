Even my five-year-old was bored. <br /> <br /> Very predictable, and overexploited. This movie could not decide if it was a slapstick or a twisted commentary on the state of sports "pee". <br /> <br /> The characters were underdeveloped, could have done more with the connection between father and son both coming from an orphanage. <br /> <br /> Did not like the reference to the goalkeeper slipping the laxative to his teammate ... very quick-witted for a children's movie. <br /> <br /> The typical behavior of the "mafia" was boring and stereotyped. <br /> <br /> The dog, however, was really cute !!!!
