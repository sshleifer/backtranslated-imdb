If you thought that Herbie was trying to kill herself by taking a bridge in "The Love Bug", that was silly, wait until you see him being horny in this surprisingly stupid second sequence. Dean Jones is back as a driver participating in the Paris to Monte Carlo Rally; This time, her sensual VW falls in love with another race car, a Lancia driven by Julie Sommars. At this point in the series, energy and charm are lacking even more than in Herbie Rides Again; the film is too long and torn, although it is visible thanks to the return of Jones' generally nice performance, some funny elements, and the frantic behavior of the cast.
