Let me start by saying that I did not expect much and that watching it at prime time on opening night should have helped. I think that would have been the case if there had been more than 20 people on the theater. <br /> <br /> He sucked so hard. the acting game was at best robotic and nothing was really explained before the last 30 minutes of the film. I imagine that was their way of distorting the plot; keep everyone in the dark on the crucial information to understand the direction of the film until the end and THEN explain things and hope that it looks like a twisting of the plot. <br /> <br /> Unknown until the end of the film: -What effect is a dark-ling? the CG was cool but I want to understand! -Why can not powers be wanted? especially if mass murder is the ultimatum. -Why are the consenting powers so bad? you're just normal after, right? -who farted? <br /> <br /> about 50% of the minutes with only men on the screen, were photographed with threshing machines, sleeveless t-shirts, then a heart-rending scene featuring all the teenagers in the riding. leaner speedos knowing they have never been made. I swear you could see the beginning of one of them ... well, it was close to soft-core. And of course, there was a shower scene, and to mix it was DUDES. The crevasses were plentiful, a sausage festival underway. But there was a single shower scene in which you could not see anything and she was walking in the most beautiful bathroom in her dorm for about 12 minutes. Then there was a girl talking PJ party. The other thing I could not forget was the amount of driving Caleb had done in his SUPER GTOL Ford Mustang GT. it was a fording ad for about 1/4 of the movie. <br /> <br /> I do not see it. or go see him with a friend who likes to make fun of bad movies. so it might be worth it. but do not expect anything extraordinary.
