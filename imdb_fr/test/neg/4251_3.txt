A family of land-growers moves west. <br /> <br /> The head of the latest motley generation of Walnut Grove is named "Charles". He works at the sawmill and saws a lot of wood, but he does not really know who cuts all this wood, because none of the inhabitants of the city has enough money to buy a shine, let alone two years. four. <br /> <br /> At the head of the city, there are the Olson, a rich but stupid clan who moved to these areas to harvest all the dough they make selling eggs to eleven hundred the dozen. They have two children, a boy, 'Willie', and a girl, 'Nellie', who, between them, have only one asset to save their lives. Nellie is horny and it's fun to spy on her when she takes a bath in her pussy. <br /> <br /> The preacher of the city is also the idiot of the village because he thinks himself really special in this forest of rural suburbs, when in reality, they do not support his boring sermons and the only thing they pray because Sunday is for him to fall as quickly as possible from the nearest cliff. <br /> <br /> The city doctor is a dinosaur who has seen better days about 20 years ago, but he still hangs out to give free breast exams for the old witches living in the city. Unfortunately, the only time these old hot moms get on their knees is to take a loaf of bread out of the oven and return it to Doc. But that's no problem with Doc, because he knows that these old ladies give good bread. <br /> <br /> The back of this colorful collection of country potato chips is Charles 'wimpy wife, Carolyn, and their three daughters, Mary', 'Carrie' and 'Half-Pint'. Mary is another hot girl that all guys take a look at every time she takes a shower or shit. Carrie is an annoying little boy, but put a biscuit in her mouth and you will not even know she's here. In fact, where is she? ... oh, there she is ... she is in the yard playing with a bag of cigarettes ... it's cute! Half-Pint is the youngest stupidity of the city. She may not have the brain or any body, but she may spit farther than any boy in the entire school freaking. <br /> <br /> It's a big city, Walnut Grove, where there's always someone falling from a roof or being run over by a cartwheel, and it's beautiful too, made of 'one building ... church / school / hotel / town hall / billiard room. Ah, it gets a little hairy in the meadow, but it's ok, especially when Mary takes a bath in the bath ... that's when you can see how hairy it is.
