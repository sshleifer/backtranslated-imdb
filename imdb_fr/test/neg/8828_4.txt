It's very possible that I just did not give the film enough luck because it immediately seemed unattractive (something similar happened with Triplets of Belleville), but I really should have let me take the stage when a roommate, a student in exchange for Japan, immediately began to laugh at the film saying it sounded silly. Now, I do not agree that it's silly, the animation is very simple but clearly very competent. It's like a classic animation with added layers that add another element of realism while staying strictly in the Surreal Realm at the same time. <br /> <br /> But I miss the subject completely. It contains an interesting message about greed and greed, but it is packaged in such an unpleasant packaging that it is almost worth studying, especially since you already knew it anyway. The sound effects while the man is sucking noisily cherries and cherry stones, for example, are indeed repulsive. his head when he pulls the young tree from his scalp, but it's been so long that he seems to be obscuring everything else. There are so many actions in this sequence that it's almost as if the whole movie was talking about it. <br /> <br /> As I said about Triplets of Belleville, it would have been a good thing for late night television. program as an adult swims, or his Japanese counterpart, but an Oscar-nominated film? This gives me the impression that there is usually not a long list of animated shorts from which the Academy can choose.
