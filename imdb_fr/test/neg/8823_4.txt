"I have not laughed so much since grandma found herself trapped," says one of the potheads in this hilarious parody of all those Val Lewton and George A. Romero films that we love (or that we hate), according to your personal taste) over the years. <br /> <br /> In this story, a young couple of actors makes a macabre farce on the rest of their troop after, a frightening night, they go on an island to the cemetery. Their artistic director, Alan, claims to bring the dead back to life by organizing a highly stylized ritual. <br /> <br /> Too much time in front of the screen has gone unnoticed; the amateur dialogue includes lame words, melodrama, and other types of useless comments about the fillers (and Alan can not stop that irritating laughter ... way too much!). Once the action has started (which approaches the end of the film), the wait is worth it. <br /> <br /> I saw this one on a television show of a local channel which diffused films very similar to this one ... only this one scared me 13 years old ... but again, you risk laughing until the end, which is probably the reason why, today, very few people still wear striped corsairs.
