Start with the premise that you will do everything to replace your lost love with a look-alike. Add to that your scientific knowledge of a deforming disease (is not what Leo G. Carroll has contracted because of the spider's venom in "Tarantula"). Add to the fact that the main character, instead of finding a way to attract the young woman, engages in brutal harassment, until he totally draws attention to himself and has to hatch this insane plot If he can make the girl's father sick, then help him recover, she'll marry him. The problem is that most events are random and unpredictable. Anyone with a half brain would have seen through things. There is a third, a woman whom the doctor, interpreted by J. Carroll Naish, treated with great insensibility. You know she's going to be a factor. There is also a gorilla kept in a cage that is sometimes used for heaven knows what. Never mind. There is so little sense of it being played and people get their desserts right.
