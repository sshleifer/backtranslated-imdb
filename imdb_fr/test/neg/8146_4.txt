Froggie is sorry to never organize a big party like all the other kids. Spanky and the gang are trying to remedy the situation by organizing a surprise party. Unaware that all the decorations and preparations are for him, Froggy sabotages everything to realize too late that the party is for him. <br /> <br /> Okay, our Gang comedy works great. The bits work, but I do not think it really works as a whole. Part of the problem is that we all know what's going on and that a lot of the humor needs to be surprised if we want everything to go well. I think strangely that the film is simply missing. That's the kind of thing they really thought could have been more than a failure. It's worth trying if you reduce your expectations
