I was subjected to this terrible excuse for a movie made for television. I only watched it because I did not have a cable and my only other choices were golf, college basketball or local news. The plot is very generic and has no substance that I can see, not to mention the fact that it had a major flaw in my eyes. The main character, Dr. Sorensen, is an astronomer who believes that an asteroid named "Nemesis" will hit the Earth, ceasing all life. He bases his conviction on the discovery of rock paintings by an Aborigine (I'm sure I misspelled that one). The paintings show an apparent chronology, showing important events throughout history, such as the construction of the Great Wall of China. All events are displayed in perfect chronological order, and the last picture in the timeline is that of the destruction of the Earth. Now for me, if the chart shows things that really happened, why would the big doctor think he could somehow change what was going to happen? All that aside, the film evolved with extreme precision of calculation. There is nothing in the film that surprised me at all. The actors were not very good and, on a few occasions, I just felt they did not even take the film seriously enough to try to convince me that the characters were worth seen. The entire film was mounted on a clich√© and a waste of time and money. I would recommend Armageddon to this shit every day. At least Armageddon has a good acting (compared to this one), not to mention the sweet-eyed Liv Tyler. Now that I think about it, golf is not so bad .......
