Recently converted to Curb Your Enthusiasm, which prompted me to watch episodes of all seasons, I was expecting much more from Jeff's efforts. <br /> <br /> When I see a movie with a slice of "Joe" I need reasons to be interested, take care of myself, feel and believe. And with Jeff Garlin at the helm, I also expected a host of brilliant comedic moments. This film failed me many times. <br /> <br /> Jeff lives with his mother, a fleshy and sad bag that is a social disaster. He has not had any relations, real or occasional, for many years. He seems to be largely unemployed and, as previously mentioned, in huts with his most expensive mom. Can things get worse? Sure. In no time, he is fired by everyone around him, including Silverman, Second City (his comedy studio) and his agent. All reinforce his "loser" status. Silverman's "fat" experience was as cruel as it was absurd. His obsession with the role of "Marty" as a way to save his career also falls into a stalemate. <br /> <br /> While the last moments of the film offer a glimpse of the best things to come, the journey of cinematics, albeit with occasional golden light, was sorely lacking.
