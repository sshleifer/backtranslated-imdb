"Carlito's Angels" is a parody of "Charlie's Angels" who is not afraid to forgive even sometimes, but that does not mean that the film is above the critics of the spectators - he is amateur and youthful (I think "quick -motion" stopped being funny around 1914). Rap music often darkens the dialogue and the movie seems longer than it is, even if it lasts just over an hour! The girls themselves are warm and adorable, with wonderful skinny bodies and, even if they never undress, their outfits leave little imagination. By visiting their IMDb pages, I discovered that one of them (Alessandra Ramos) is living a film career. I wish him good luck, because although this movie is bad, she (and the other girls) gave her all the energy she had and I would not mind seeing her on screen again. (*)
