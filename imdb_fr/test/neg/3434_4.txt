So I received it from the rental store where I worked before it was published (8/21), I looked at it today and I am now speechless. They could have had a good movie here, but they ruined everything cruelly obvious. <br /> <br /> First, the roles of John Krasinski were funny, that's the only reason I gave it above. 3, but they are broken by bad actions and terrible "serious" reflections on life between the main character (Andrew Keegan) and his girlfriend (the contrarian Lacy Chabert). It would have been much, much better as a straight comedy like Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Smoking. <br /> <br /> I wanted to appreciate it because I think Krasinski is funny and wants to see him succeed. The story was not bad either, but not very original. But the staging (and many actors) was terrible. I swear they struggled to keep the faces of people in the shot and they went there anyway. <br /> <br /> Their negligence is enhanced when the gun expert corrects another character and says that a "Dirty Harry" pistol is not one. 357 magnum but a .45 (it was, as everyone knows, a .44 magnum). <br /> <br /> Let's see if you really like John Krasinski 2- like to watch low-budget movies -directed) movies or 3- Do you have too much time (that's me!)
