Continue in the chain of "Stalker / Slasher" in the vein of "Wolf Creek", "Hostel", "Joy Ride", etc., comes from "Rest Stop". The most original and the most useless of all. <br /> <br /> We begin, reasonably promising, with the violent death of a pretty girl in filthy toilets. <br /> <br /> This is where our interest is lost. We then go to the couple shot on the road, en route to LA with eyes fixed on the celebrity. . . that they will never succeed in making movies like this. <br /> <br /> Sexual deluge in the park, the couple drove while talking to a deserted and disgusting rest area for the girl's use in the bathroom. Harmless until she gets out and finds her boyfriend gone and realizes she's being stalked by a lame version of Rusty Nail's "Joy Ride". . . Drive only in Mater from "Cars". <br /> <br /> Honestly, if it had been done / written / produced / played by someone else, it might have been good enough. But no. <br /> <br /> Because then comes the story of ghosts. Yep. . . you guessed it. A lot of "oh, I'll help you, but wait, you're dead" to "wait is this stalker a person, a monster or a ghost?" <br /> <br /> But wait? Who comes to the rescue to save the girl's life and maybe the movie? This brother Lawerence. Excellent. Have been saved. (sarcasm) Oh, wait, no, we are not. <br /> <br /> You know. . . if you want to laugh, or if you get free rentals like me, try them. <br /> <br /> If this is the case, you will learn to NOT make a film. <br /> <br /> -AP3-
