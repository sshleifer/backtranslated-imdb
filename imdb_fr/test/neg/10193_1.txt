This film should have contained a warning that it was akin to the Left Behind series. I did not know it would be an amazing movie. I was expecting it to be a movie about UFOs and abduction by aliens for entertainment purposes. As the previous commentary comments, it would be good to show to a church, but not to a public theater, at least not without the prior knowledge of the consumer that the film is the premise. I felt disappointed by my dollars spent on this film, because nothing in the summary refers to its religious connotations. If you go to church, he will probably be shown some time for free. Other than hiding its real subject, the film was good with respect to acting and scenario. But I must say that I left the movie one hour after I saw in which direction he was heading and I was not going to be entertained, but preached.
