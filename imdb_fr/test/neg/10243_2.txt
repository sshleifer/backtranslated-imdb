This is not the worst movie I have ever seen. I did not want to take my eyes off Galaxina. It's not good. The jokes are almost funny, but they are all short. The few gags that get closer are repulsed by repeating them again and again. Production values ​​are non-existent. The sound is bad, the lighting is bad, ... it just seems to be cheap; too much. The dialogue ... well, often it misses - a lot of awkward silences; they are all standing and it seems that someone should say something. The film seems even ambivalent as to what it wants to be - it is not always clear that it is a comedy - as perhaps the one that developed after the start of filming. It looks like a movie project they put together the day before the deadline and if they had spent two weeks in the movie, it was fine. <br /> <br /> And I am easy to please. I thought "Mom and Dad Save the World" was a good idea. I like "Pluto Nash". "Mystery Men" is one of my favorite movies. "Spaced Invaders" is almost a classic. This turkey just does not do it. "Space Truckers" was more believable. <br /> <br /> Avery Schreiber, who can be very funny, tries too hard. His role calls a henchman, and he plays him down to the sitcom. Dorothy Stratten is OK in her role, but not particularly noteworthy. <br /> <br /> Oh, yes, the "My watch is still slow." the line was funny. I will give this film all the congratulations it can get, it needs it. <br /> <br /> Space vehicle models are not bad, but they are few in number and not used effectively. The scenes in space are vague. No fast passes, no close-up overflights, not even proper action scenes when they dock. (The Infinity collapses very strangely at some point.) The flight dynamics is terrible; worse than anything you've seen, they are jerky, not smooth. The initial battle is elevated and static; Although both ships have just shown that they can maneuver in a jerky fashion, they exchange short-range (slow) fire in a manner more reminiscent of a 16th-century naval battle, unless it is so exciting. <br /> <Extraterrestrials - imagine if Star Wars was a cantina scene. That a lot of rubber masks could get dull pretty quickly, right? Some are used as visual gags that work correctly the first time, but not the fifth. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, if you try to watch Galaxina, you may fall asleep. (I was busy doing something else and I missed the last ten minutes and I did not think it was worth it to play it again.) If it does not say "it sucks", I do not know what's going on Unfortunately, there is a lot of potential, and it could easily have been a good movie. It would be easy to redo this and have a decent movie. <br /> <br /> MadKaugh
