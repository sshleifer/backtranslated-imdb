I saw this on the shelves of the rental location and I rented everything else so I said why not. Why not, it's because it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It looks like he was shot with a camcorder at home. I guess everything the budget would allow. There were fewer breasts than I thought. Some people have made some soft porn with some murders. For me, the funniest part of the whole movie lies in the extra things. There is a place with deleted scenes. Well, there is only one, but it's the dumbest and I think it may have reduced the rest of the movie. The girls enter a hot tub and find chocolate syrup in the bathroom. Yes, it ends up covering them. Super trick !!! This movie is really bad. Do not bother yourself.
