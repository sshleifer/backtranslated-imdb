I only watched this because I saw some good reviews about it, so I was expecting at least a half-crappy movie. Toybox does not even provide that. There are so many problems with this movie that I do not even know where to start. So I will list some main problems (Again, spoiler warning, just read it, it will save you from watching this movie later). <br /> <br /> First, this film begins and often mentions the mythical folklore of Celeste Noir (a witch, whose main character claims to be reincarnation), and the folker (or something like that, an evil man with a big smile that opens people with hooks and sells their innards in pies). I liked that, it was a cute concept, everything about pies is just nice. But then you watch the movie and it's all about this silly girl and her boyfriend (and what was the deal with him?) Was he psychic, had he any powers, and why did he continue to see visions that even the so-called "Witch" did not "do not notice"), and meet their insane family.Not really crazy, they argue a lot.That's what most movies present, arguing, and they almost never return to the supposed myth, except in two confused scenes that you can not create heads or tails. <br /> <br /> In one scene, Bérénice (the main character related to witches) gets lost and did a sort of ritual in the candlelight, that seemed pretty important, but absolutely nothing happened after she did it, it made me lose more time. <br /> <br /> And who the hell was this guy with his dog? You see him heading home from the beginning of the movie with this dog red-eyed, then he finally gets there and gets killed? What is going on?? Was he the mid-folker? Was his dog possessed? Did someone kill the dog? They never really showed that. Moreover, any scene involving the vicar was completely useless and only served to explain the lame end feebly. It was as if they had all these interesting character ideas and they did not go anywhere! The boyfriend, who obviously had some kind of powers but never explains them. The grandmother, who seemed to have some sort of witch powers, but never used them. The vicar, who ... Okay, that does not matter, his existence did not make sense. And then there was Berenice and her stupid amulet. Could she really do magic, or did she just use it to reflect the light and the blind? It was a total waste of time, and the only reason I give her two stars is because a) Berenice is a bit cute and b) it's about pies. Save money by renting this and dear God, do not even think about buying it, unless the waste of money is a new fad.
