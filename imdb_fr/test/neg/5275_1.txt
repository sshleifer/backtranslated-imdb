I'm a big fan of Kevin Spacey's work, but it's a sub-standard movie. If you think it sounds interesting, or if you've seen and loved it, check out John Boorman's "The General". It is basically the same type, but it is far superior in all respects (and does not suffer from Hollywood's glorification).
