This film promised a lot, so many actors beautiful and good at the game but with a plot that has virtually nothing to say. So many potentially promising conflicts between family members could have been developed and elaborated, but they have all been abandoned and unresolved. There was no story to tell, just a demonstration of actor, technique, beautiful scenes - all of which were EMPTY. But again, the acting is excellent, many individual scenes were fun, but as you become aware of the lack of underlying ideas, even the acting has lost its meaning. So since the promising start, you have become more and more disappointed as the non-story continues.
