A group of 7 gold diggers head for a mine recently opened following an earthquake. Of course, they do not pay attention to the local legend that something is killing people. This low-budget horror movie ($ 25,000) has a slight cult and I do not know exactly why (unless it's because it's so obscure). I admit that the last half hour is quite funny, but the time we get there is a real torture. Many marches and conversations and our strange strangeness only appear after 45 minutes. Even in the supplements, Chris Huntley, admits he commits the unforgivable sin of being boring. I would forgive them if they were true amateurs, but this group is a graduate of the USC and I hope they know that a film exploitation must be exploitative. Anyway, as I said, the last half hour is cool as three survivors fight the monster in stop motion and there is a cool score, similar to that of John Carpenter. I wanted to see more of the monster, but it stays literally on the screen for 45 seconds. <br /> <br /> Even though the movie is not the best, Code Red DVD has paid such attention. You have interviews and an audio commentary from director Melanie Anne Phillips, producer / actor Mark Sawicki and co-writer Huntley. The stories about how the film was shot are quite fascinating and inspiring (like a set of caves under construction in a backyard). The short films of USC students from Sawicki and Huntley are even more interesting. They are actually better than feature film production. Huntley was a pretty talented artist and it's a pity he did not move on. Sawicki worked regularly in Hollywood as a guy in visual effects and camera. The VHS film is quite legendary for its darkness and I'm sure it's much better. However, you still get scenes where the only image consists of five helmet lights bouncing in the dark. Sure to say, the original MY BLOODY VALENTINE is still "champion of the horror film in a mine".
