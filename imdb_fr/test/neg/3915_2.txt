I had never heard of this movie until I saw it on TV last night. I really hope there has never been a movie outing because it would be an insult to the big screen and moviegoers. <br /> <br /> Was it supposed to be serious, supposed to be funny? Why the plot outrageously basic? Does anyone really care? ... <br /> <br /> Dreadful movie. <br /> <br /> 2/10
