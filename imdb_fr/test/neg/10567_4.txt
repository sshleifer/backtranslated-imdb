Whether it's extraordinary alien lasers or an elementary-school-style shuttle crash, "Nightbeast" is more of a ridiculous mix of fake blood and bare breasts. The film's almost pornographic style seems to be an unsuccessful attempt to recover from a coherent or effective lack of history. However, the game of actors is not so stupid, many budding actors present admirably a hidden talent. Especially Don Leifert and Jamie Zemarel, who cast a light on this otherwise terrible film. Nightbeast would never have come on the set if he had known the terrible director of this little village in Maryland.
