Based on the excellent novel Watchers by Dean Koontz, this extremely horrible film should probably be viewed by no one. Since "The Running Man", I have never seen a book slaughtered beyond recognition. The difference, however, is that the movie "The Running Man" was always nice as a fun action movie loaded with a million slogans. This film?? No, nothing fun at a distance. In fact, if you like the book, like me, you will hate this bastard even more. <br /> <br /> ** WARNING ** CONTAINS SPOILERS ** Rightio, I will basically tell you the story here, almost in its entirety. Why? Because you, dear reader, do not need to suffer from this abomination, I'm fine, because I like to watch shit. Because I like to complain about things * shty. Now, let's move on to the ugly film: This film is centered on a boy and his mother fleeing the government and on a mutant monkey-creature who escaped from a destroyed genetics laboratory with a golden super-retriever whose " hero "calls" Furface ". Groan?? Believe me, in the novel, this story has rocked. I will come back to it later. Be that as it may, the hero is none other than Corey Haim, a dreamy boy. Oh, I'm not kidding. Our hero runs everywhere, in a scathing voice and all, trying to convince his mother to help save this dog from the "evil government" that brought him into the world and made him genetically ultra-intelligent. The monkey creature, slowly called "Oxcom" (God's Helper), is also the genetic stew of a creature designed to be the ultimate fighter on the battlefields of the future. Michael Ironside (Total Recall, Starship Troopers still plays a tough guy) is also in this movie, and no, I could not understand how someone convinced him that it would be a good idea. He plays a government agent with the ONS to hunt the dog and the creature. Oh yes, here are a few words: It is also a creation of the government and the same laboratory, and now the film is essentially about being an idiot and killing people? And all these murders are supposed to be done by the monkey-soldier. Instead of a scary and scary horror movie, we have rectal hemorrhage from a teenybopper horror movie. The dog's intelligence is too conveniently discovered and it is believed easier that we can not believe that we can see the clouds while looking outside. Breakdown !! <br /> <br /> Passage from the book to the film: <br /> <br /> - Main character (Travis) transformed from man to boy child. <br /> <br /> - The loving love of the man for the book (Nora) is now his mother - and all his depth and character growth have completely disappeared. <br /> <br /> --Lem Johnson, a black man, is now a white man, Mr. Ironside. This matters because the character's strength was built on his legacy in the book. <br /> <br /> - The relationship between two characters completely ignored, Lem now kills the guy who was originally his best friend. <br /> - One of the main characters of the book is now totally absent, "the immortal" who chased the heroes - maybe it is supposed to be a fool, but then why is there anybody another one? <br /> <br /> - Dog never gets the deserving name of Einstein in the movie. <br /> <br /> - No part of the book was in a high school, at least nothing that could have a significant impact on the plot. <br /> <br /> - takes place on a few days, rather months as the book ?? unrealistic stimulation. <br /> <br /> - Corey Haim's girlfriend in the movie appeared in no more than two chapters in the book - and they never met in the book. <br /> <br /> - The character of Lem Johnson no longer has a cool head; Instead, he is a total jerk who kills his way through people. <br /> <br /> --Hero Travis was part of Delta Force (military segment specialized in the hunt for terrorists), instead, his father, who was never seen in the film, was part of this group. <br /> <br /> --The perceived intelligence of the monster is now totally absent. <br /> <br /> - Schemes involving Soviets and The Mob have completely disappeared from history. <br /> <br /> - These are just the most heinous changes, and the ones I remembered best (and a day later). <br /> <br /> The good: <br /> <br /> - Finally, after 90 minutes of pain and mental anguish, the film is over. <br /> <br /> I did not hurt her, I did not help her: <br /> <br /> - - Michael Ironside ?? I usually like it. <br /> <br /> --The dog is always pretty friendly. <br /> <br /> - A wacky title screen "totally 80s". <br /> <br /> The Bad: <br /> <br /> --Of course, writing for one is extremely horrible. <br /> <br /> --The management is so half-murdered that anyone watching the movie wants to feel superior to everyone Does not participate. <br /> <br /> - The action is unpleasant and weak, especially Corey Haim. <br /> <br /> - The story is loose, weak and diluted. <br /> - The monster looks simply pathetic, that is to say when one is actually allowed to see the bloody thing. Her head is gigantic oversized, the yellow eyes that were so much part of the thing in the book are not seen more than two seconds. Instead of a slender, powerful, fast and smart killing machine, we have a fool in a disgusting monkey costume that we've been forced to impose on ourselves. <br /> <br /> - No character development absolutely. <br /> <br /> - Even violence and gore are badly done, for fun, it's supposed to be a HORROR movie !! Usually, the violence is at least well done! <br /> <br /> The Ugly: <br /> <br /> - The Idea That Dean Koontz Has Developed His Bright Novel To Become That Dirty Piece Of Sh * That does not get me dangerously to throwing up everywhere about myself and people close to me. There are worse films than that (which may seem like a source of migraine), but so far, only "Alien vs Predator", at least for me, is a bigger parody and a more painful disappointment. <br /> <br /> Memorable scene: watch the end credits. <br /> <br /> Interpretation: 3/10 History: 4/10 (the novel was really good, it's just terrible) Atmosphere: 5/10 Cinematography: 4/10 Character development: 1/10 Effects special / Makeup: 4/10 Nudity / Sexuality: 0/10 Violence / Gore: 4/10 Music: 5/10 Director: 3/10 <br /> <br /> cheesiness: 7/10 crappiness: 9/10 < I would recommend to anyone to watch this movie ever, except for a few extreme fans of horror - and only if you have not read the novel. Instead, I would recommend anyone interested to avoid all of this and buy / consult / borrow the book. <br /> <br /> www.ResidentHazard.com
