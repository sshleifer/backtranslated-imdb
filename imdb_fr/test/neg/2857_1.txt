I've never seen a film B like this ... about the nanny Sofia being killed ... a woman's hand appears on the tape manipulating the stick ... what harm is it doing ??? LOL, I seriously laughed and wanted to stop seeing the movie, but I kept looking at it to see if this movie could get worse ... LOL ... it's bad for itself ... poor Pinocchio ... the only interesting thing is the first time you see special effects of Pinocchio's face moving ... other than that, the whole movie is awful ... it's really not worth your time if you do not really have much to loose! But if you have nothing to do ... go on ... give yourself a movie "Z" because movie B is still too good for this one ... LOL
