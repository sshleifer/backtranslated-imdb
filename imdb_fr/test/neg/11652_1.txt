Disney's "Snowball Express" is not as dated as some of their productions from this era. There are no hippies or boilermakers, just a boring Dean Jones inheriting a rundown hotel / ski resort from a dead parent. When Jones and his family enter a sleepy Colorado town, the people who give them instructions - which look like "Deliverance" supplements - are oddly vague about the hotel (we expect it to look like to a one-room slum), but in reality the accommodations are very nice. Jones's teenage daughter has an acidic look on her face forever (which does not stop one of the yahoos from taking a look at her), and of course, the awkward pop Dean Jones is a regular in panic on the slopes, causing many falls. in the melted snow. Maybe this square scenario could have benefited from a magical fantasy, because this script is frozen. * from ****
