Wow, what a bad movie. Not at all scary, and barely understandable. The plot is not at all and the acting is absolutely horrendous. What is this line of a famous critic? "She manages the emotional range from A to B." Yep. it sums up pretty much. Not even good for the value of the camp! I did not expect gear for Oscar, but that? And that, then, her friend is a ghost? You would need the IQ of a particularly stupid mollusk not to see it happen. <br /> <br /> This film (and I use this word vaguely) is an insult to the public who goes to the movies. If only someone who worked there knew how to chain the story! This gives a 1 in 10, simply because there is nothing less. On the bright side - at least it's not two full hours.
