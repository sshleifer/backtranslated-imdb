I do not know why it's got good reviews because it could be the weakest horror comedy I've ever seen. Englund is just in the game for a cameo and his performance is as useless as most lame attempts at jokes (and scares). The direction is terrible and the acting is worse. It seems that every year the producers are trying to make another Evil Dead, but these unoriginal and original attempts only stomp the memory of a true classic of horror. <br /> <br /> Let his filmmakers say: "It's not a remake, but it's a throwback to the 80's (which is not as original in my opinion - Hatchet) or People who are trying to connect this with other horror classics for that matter. <br /> <br /> AVOID AT ALL PRICES!
