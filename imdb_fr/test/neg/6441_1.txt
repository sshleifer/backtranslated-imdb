Eastenders has been on course since 1985, becoming a must. It's such a bad reflection of the nation that this shit goes beyond the odds. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​intrigues can not be simpler than putting a character's name in a hat. The first two (regardless of their sex) will sleep with each other, the 3rd and 4th will compete in Vic, the 5th will be stopped, the 6th will develop an addiction, 7th to get pregnant, etc. etc. <br /> <br /> Producers are smart though. The 30-minute show actually only includes 3 lines. <br /> <br /> 1) Someone will walk in the Vic and say "What's going on?" 2) Someone else will get up saying "let it go" 3) A woman will then say, "Doan choo comes before the mah fam'ly insult" <br /> <br /> That's it . It's every show. Aside from time to time "Get it sort-id / Is it sort-id?" <br /> <br /> The show was once a realistic representation of East End folklore and lifestyle. The buffers broke off when 1) they extended it two nights a week and 2) the Slater family arrived. How they attract viewers is beyond me. Kat's character symbolizes everything that goes wrong in society and treats anyone else as something she has pulled off the bottom of her shoe. <br /> <br /> The people who vote it as the best personality in these polls must be the same people who vote for Jamie Redknapp 'best sportsman' despite the fact that he has not played a game since 3 years. <br /> <br /> What I will never understand is if the show is the pinnacle of British TV's biggest names go? Ross Kemp, Martin Kemp, the list is endless. <br /> <br /> How long has the marriage of the longest couple been faithful? Yes, people leave, but until writers realize that the characters, a couple can be interesting and friendly without sleeping around the series, the situation will continue to deteriorate. One episode of last week had 3 separate tracks. And Zoe and the doctor even top the list as "The most convincing couple of all time to appear on television". <br /> <br /> Yes, Eastenders is the most watched show, without question. But many external factors contribute to it. 19:30 / 20:00 is the perfect time to win the most spectators, it has an omnibus edition for 2 hours, and more than that, millions of viewers have watched it, nothing more than out of habit, but if they were anything honestly for themselves, they would admit that (in 2002, more than ever), it can be absolutely pitiful.
