This mischievous, sloppy spy melodrama featuring two jesters (an idealist and drug addict) of California kids delivering secrets to the KGB never seems to have enough strength to withstand tension and suspense before he dies very slowly two hours later. The finished product of John Schlesinger gives the impression that he is asleep most of the time while the film is lagging behind and the actors are sleeping, with the exception of the extremely annoying performance of Sean Penn. <br /> <br /> Chris (Tim Hutton) and Daulton (Penn) and their childhood altar friends set up a secret sales plan at the KGB when Chris gets a job that allows him to access very government documents secrets. Disillusioned with what he sees as American interference in foreign affairs, idealism Chris and drug addict Daulton get in touch with Russians and start routing them to classified documents. When Chris decides he wants to go out, things start to break down at a casual pace. <br /> <br /> The eighties were not favorable to the distinguished director John Schlesinger. In the 60s and 70s, he had a critically acclaimed film series in England and the United States, then Honky Tonk Freeway in 1981, marking the beginning of the end. The hawk and the snowman have more or less put a lid on it. Lacking the suspense of Marathon Man and quality performances (Hoffman Voight, Christie, Jackson, Finch, Olivier), he had already managed to convince Falcon to go around in circles. <br /> <br /> Sean Penn nibbles the landscape from start to finish with such a smell that you make his executioners do more. Tim Hutton is governed by his limited acting roles and most of his scenes show a need for more rehearsal time. Lori Singer plays Hutton's girlfriend and plays with silence. Schlesinger is content to film his tasteless expressions. When she gets emotional, you understand why. Only David Suchet, in his capacity as head of the KGB, with a penetrating introspective presence and restraint, performs well.
