In the confused film of Michele Soavi, Dellamorte Dellamore, entitled Zoom Art House, Rupert Everett plays the role of Francesco, a guard in a cemetery where the dead do not stay buried long. Assisted by his simple assistant, Gnaghi, Francesco solves the problem of the cemetery zombies by shooting the undead at the head or splitting their skulls with a shovel. <br /> <br /> However, soon after falling for the mysterious beautiful widow of one of his friends recently buried, Francesco is more busy than ever ?? <br /> <br /> After receiving particularly favorable comments from more respected horror officials at IMDb, I decided to see what the problem was. I just finished watching the movie and I can honestly say that I have not been so disappointed by a horror movie for quite some time. <br /> <br /> With his confusing pseudo-philosophical plot, an extremely bland performance of Everett, Dellamorte Dellamore is an annoying and painful mess that even a few gore splashes (courtesy of Sergio Stivaletti) and free nudity (taken from the busty Anna Fialchi) can not save. I can not understand the depth of analysis and in-depth discussions that this pretentious kitty has received from its lost fans.
