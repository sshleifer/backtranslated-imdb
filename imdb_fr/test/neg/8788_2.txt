Hubie - like Stanely Troll's troll in Bluth's Central Park - does not have the spark of personality to be the main character who makes a movie. We're supposed to like him because he's nice, but that's about all he is. <br /> <br /> The design of his character is unappealing. The top of his head is a kind of dome narrower than the lower half of his head. <br /> <br /> And the penguins must not have teeth. I know that Aladdin's parrot, Iago, had teeth, but maybe it worked because it made him look like his vocal actor, Gilbert Gottfried. Hubie, with his silly little voice (provided by Martin Short), looks funny with that big pair of trumpets in his beak. <br /> <br /> Tim Curry, who is usually ravishing about being naughty, does some kind of damn Surfer guy like the bad guy (could have been a good voice for a comic complice of relief, not the main villain allegedly threatening). <br /> <br /> The whole plot revolves around the love of the hero and the villain for the female Marina penguin, who is as dull as her two suitors. <br /> <br /> The worst is stimulation. We keep talking to the villain to see him threaten Marina more - this time in dialogue, this time in song ... <br /> <br /> Barry Manilow may be a great songwriter, but in animated films like this and Thumbelina, his songs are soft and apathetic - especially ballads. The only song I liked was the song "Good Ship Misery" of the 1930s. <br /> <br /> I read that the distributor cut in this film against the will of the filmmaker, which could have cause some of the problems - although I suspect that the real problem is that they have not cut the rest;).
