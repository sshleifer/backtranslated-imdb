I do not think I spoil the experience of this movie by telling you not to see it if you have something better to do, like cleaning under the stove. It is dirty underneath and you have to clean it from time to time. <br /> <br /> I think the film suffers from a lack of sexuality and violence, although there is a cascade of car chases that seems so dangerous that it could only have been filmed in a country where life is cheaper than beer. "Gargoyle" has the heart in the right place, but his aspirations are conservative. It's at least not pretentious. But I had a good time playing in the horror movie that says, "What's going on in this hole?" and die for his pride. In addition, I met Michael Par√©. Every movie buff should work with a B-series staple at least once before they die. And the Romanians are the most beautiful people I met. Literally the most beautiful. Walk the street in Bucharest: if 7 out of 10 women are not absolutely beautiful, you walk in a street that I have not met; and rest assured that at least 5 out of 10 people are available for a drink. <br /> <br /> Part of the film was shot at Casa Radio, an abandoned and unfinished building of the nightmare-Georgian classicist communist style. intended to house the KGB's propaganda ministries, namely Radio Not-so-Free Europe. The building has five floors and occupies one block; Better still, while its facade exudes a solid, it resides near the city center as a post-apocalyptic ruin in a jungle of burdock and hemp populated by dozens of gypsies and many wild dogs. Work on Casa Radio was suspended when Caucescu and his wife were shot on TV in 1989. There are still gaping holes that fall from the top floor heated by the sun (offering surreal views of a modern concrete roof). a quarter of a mile, decorated with protruding rebar and old car parts, overlooking a ruined city) to the wet and scary basement (which doubles in the movie for the Gargoyle's lair.) No American railings or warning signs for Bucharest. <br /> <br /> Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, Casa Radio has organized several non-syndicated film shootings, including "Highlander III". It's attractive to producers, because it's a cheap place, a large size and volume, a weird appearance and any insurance risk, because it's always the property of State. In addition, no one complains if you do not clean up after your production: all that is left behind is interpolated in the construction by Gypsies of their slum in this urban jungle. <br /> <br /> An assistant director was bitten by a wild dog during the filming of "Gargoyle". The apples provided by the caterers were put to the service by actors and members of the team in the form of projectiles to keep the dogs prowling at a distance. I too was bitten by wild dogs in Bucharest, once in a bar (!) And once in an urban park. I also survived two car wrecks in two weeks, both in taxis, and the drivers involved did not consider either of these reasons as a reason to stop the cars. <br /> <br /> NOTE GEEK: The network or channel Sci-Fi or other was one of the sponsors of this film (the smaller the budget, the more producers there were on the set) so it's a bit weird that no one had a problem with the original title, "Gargoyles", until it was almost time to show it on network, even though Sci-Fi already owned a series of that name unconnected. The title was changed relatively shortly before publication, because I have a color-corrected copy that bears the old title.
