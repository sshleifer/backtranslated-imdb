Note that I only saw the last half of this film, so do not hesitate to take my criticism with the grain of salt that you consider appropriate, that being said, see what I saw was amply enough to convince me The star rating is sufficient. <br /> <br /> In short, this is a sad slaughter of the wonderful precursor (NL Christmas Vacation) with Chevy Chase, but it does not have a Chevy Chase in it takes place in a generic tropical island , without any connection with Christmas. <br /> <br /> Ol 'Chevy probably did not want to enter because the plot is so devoid of pleasure, but instead they had the damn Cousin Eddie, who, again, was great in the original, but it is just above all, and constitutes an extremely poor base for any movie considering plot and acting. Humor attempts are generic to a point where even contemporary TV comedy wins, and considering that it's supposed to be comedy, I doubt I need to say more. <br /> <br /> his qualities because he has none, but his failures and again, how Hollywood is shedding its blood of the past in pursuit of a quick money shot. <br /> <br /> I think I'll look at the original before the Christmas season to come back just to try to regain the innocence of my childhood, after a lost time where the moving pictures were more than garbage at wholesale budget, but insane.
