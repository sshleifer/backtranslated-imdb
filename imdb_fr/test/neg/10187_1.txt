This is the worst film I have seen so far. 85 minutes of bad acting (half of the distribution seems to suffer from Asperger syndrome). Terrible wigs, a strange makeup (including tide lines around the wig areas) and characters more sacred than ever with a dialogue that makes you want to throw up. A comic aspect of this movie, if you have the patience to watch it, is the impressive number of costume changes such that the unhappy cast appears from stage to stage - was this film supported by a pastel casual clothing catalog maker? Have the actors been paid in clothes for their efforts? They certainly did not deserve to pay with anything else! This horrendous effort of a film delivers a disjointed plot in the first half, blending into an archie Christian biblefest equally confused in the last. All actors and the production team must be burned, or at least crucified!
