Sometimes, Full Moon makes entertaining movies. This is not one of them. The full moon is like a discreet Troma. Their films are not as violent or out of the ordinary, but they are usually so talentless. Playing in this movie is not that great, but the screenplay is pretty bad and, overall, it's pretty boring and does not even contain nudity (like in many Full Moon movies) to redeem it. Skip this one, and go rent "Head of the family".
