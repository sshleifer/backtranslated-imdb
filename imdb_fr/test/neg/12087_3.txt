THE GOVERNESS is a moody time piece, the sinister story of a Jewish woman who, on her father's death, went to Scotland in the 1830s, posing as a pagan to find work to support his family in London. <br /> <br /> Rosina - or Mary, as she calls herself in a rather subtle symbolic writing - is a child without rudder, a socialite dreamed of being an actress. She enters into an alliance with her employer and accidentally solves a crucial problem in her research on photography. Overwhelmed with success, they begin a difficult and uncomfortable affair while the eldest son of his love falls madly (and inexplicably) in love with her. <br /> <br /> And, like a child, she does not understand her consequences actions - ultimately, betraying those she deceived in order to make a living. <br /> <br /> Many claim that this is a feminist manifesto, but I do not agree. Whether intentional or not, this film resonates with me only if I consider it an edifying story. In the end, Rosina's biggest disappointment is the truth: she lied, found a way to help a man she wanted to be both her father and her lover, and finally did not do anything about it. other than destruction. As such, the end of the film gives me the impression that nothing she did, no one she used, made her happy - and that's exactly what she should be. <br /> <br /> Do I need a film that long? and languorous to teach me this lesson? Not at all. On the contrary, without the excellent cinematography, the single score and my hope that she can make her comeback, I would not have held until the end of the film. <br /> <br /> Minnie Driver fans will probably be disappointed by its uneven performance, but may want to see them anyway. I doubt that young fans of Jonathan Rhys-Meyers are able to stay awake for the desired result, and I can not help but think that it contains too few cultural details to be of interest, even for photographers. The 3 points that I attribute to the film concern only his visual style and his score. Based on their other work, I guess the actors' performances are so disappointing because of a poor storyline and a poorer staging, but they are ultimately insignificant.
