I've read a lot of comments here about how this movie stays stuck to the book. I do not think any of them actually read it. Edgar Rice wrote about a dangerous African jungle and the great apes were killers and hunters. We know differently now and this film portrays monkeys in a more modern perspective. I have never seen a Tarzan film that is even close to Edgar's vision. Maybe one day, Hollywood will trust talented and respected authors to tell the story. So, if you have never read the book and you like a good story about the feelings and a stuffed animal rabbit plush, maybe a good cry, see the movie. I hope John Carter from Mars will get more respect than Tarzan. We miss you, Edgar!
