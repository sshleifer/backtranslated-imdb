I expected it to be hilarious and it was mediocre at best, the only funny character is, believe it or not, Andy Dick. The timing was just horrible on most jokes and gags and the writing was bad, I mean I know it's supposed to be like blaxploitation but it just worked. in addition to all this genre has already been beaten to death, with all the movies of Austin and his clandestine brother, he just looks old, he looks like a scam of a clandestine brother (who was not hysterical either) but a lot funnier than this). In addition, for a comedy / action movie, the direction was rather bland. I do not know if it will come out in theaters, but it's really done for television.
