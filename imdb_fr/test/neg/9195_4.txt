As much as I respect firefighters for what they do. I was not impressed and bored by this movie. The acting was OK, but Joaquin Phoenix was a mediocre casting choice. <br /> <br /> What bothered me the most in this film was the Celtic music that moaned again and again at the worst possible moment in the film. movie. The direction and continuity were pretty bad too! <br /> <br /> ** SPOILER ** For example, after the Phoenix character has lost several stories and is seriously injured, he can barely move to talk to his captain on the radio. Then, miraculously, he manages to crawl through an immense space covered with rubble and fire to pierce an opening at the size of a man in a double-thick brick wall using only a piece of bar of more than one foot ???? And to top it off, he becomes extremely weak and upset again. <br /> <br /> Has anyone noticed that throughout the film, whenever you see Joaquin's plans to fight and shoot rescuers, there is little or no smoke in buildings. I would think that the smoke should be quite thick in a building engulfed by a flame. <br /> <br /> I'm also fed up with hearing the search and rescue team yelling "I need some equipment here !!!" <Br/> <br /> I really thought this movie would please me, but I thought it was a faint attempt to represent the real life of a firefighter. The intention was there, but honestly, I think this movie could have been so much better. I could not help but think that the producer was trying to meet a deadline with this film and had to rush to put it in theaters. It would have been necessary to devote more time to the assembly and the fluidity of the film. <br /> <br /> The special effects were impressive in some scenes but disappointing and almost ridiculous in others. A bit like a film by Jerry Bruckheimer. <br /> <br /> Call me criticism, but I do not see how this film is great. At least, it was not as bad as "The Whole Ten Yards", which is by far the worst film I've seen in recent months. <br /> <br /> I really hope there is no scale 50 in the making!
