The last of the "Airport" suites. This has Alain Delon and George Kennedy (who was in every film from the airport) as pilots; David Warner (!!!) as a radio engineer; Susan Blakely as a targeted journalist to death; Robert Wagner in brilliant scientist (stop laughing!); Eddie Albert as president of the airlines; Charo in an awful "comic" bit; John Davidson as a journalist (loves the way his hair stays in place even AFTER the plane turns around!); poor Martha Raye is humiliated; Cicely Tyson plays a mother who steals her heart from her dying son (stops rolling her eyes!); Jimmie Walker as a clarinetist (what did I say about not laughing?); Mercedes McCambridge as a Russian gymnastics coach (OK, you can laugh); Bibi Andresson as a whore and Sylvia Kristel and Sybil Danning as love interests. <br /> <br /> Just pathetic. Plenty of stupid plots and dialogues that will make you roar - watch Davidson "get married" on the plane towards the end! Concorde takes all these people to Russia. They are attacked with missiles, escape, land safe and sound in France and leave the next day !!!! Do not you think the flight would have been canceled or something? Most of the actors are terrible - McCambridge is a sight to behold in a red wig and a horrible false accent. The only good acting comes from Kennedy and Delon (who look fantastic) which gives a very attractive performance. It is still not enough to make you sit through this drivel. Special effects too long and ugly too. It was a mega bomb and (thankfully) prevented Universal from continuing to do so.
