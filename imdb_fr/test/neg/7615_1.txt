I am and am a serious collector of movies, TV shows, special holiday shows, etc. related to Christmas, for over twenty-five years. Please, consider my warnings and do not be misled by the critics and the hype of this movie. It's not a Muppett movie as we know it and it's certainly not for kids. The fact that it was produced for a large television network is not surprising given their level of exploitation at that time. What is hard to believe for me is that the organization Jim Henson has leaned so low to get involved in this parody of Christmas. I would have liked critics reading me to warn me before I wasted my hard-earned money on this movie. garbage.
