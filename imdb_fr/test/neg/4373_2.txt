Police cops Logan Alexander and Debbie Rochon escort five young black offenders across the country and get stuck in sticks when their van breaks down. After a deadly clash with a racist white dog with a shotgun (played by the director), the survivors take refuge with a blind priestess of voodoo. One of the teens uses a spell to call Killjoy, who finally comes halfway through the boredom in a makeup makeup artist who is bigger and fatter, who seems to miss him at all times. He then proceeds to destroy the stupid characters while recounting some of the worst one-liners heard since the cancellation of Hee Haw. <br /> <br /> The game of "teenagers" is terrible, the dialogue even worse, the FX stinks and it looks much cheaper than the first movie. Trent Haaga (who tries to emulate Jim Carrey here) is awful and does not stand up to Angel Vargas's overactive bidding in KILLJOY 1 (which has at least had some stupid laughter). <br /> <br /> Another nail in the coffin for Full Moon Studios, whose reputation as a fun franchise live filming has completely disappeared since the days of TRANCERS / PUPPET MASTER.
