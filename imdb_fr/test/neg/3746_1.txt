I came out of the cinema after suffering this film after 30 minutes. I left two friends stuck by a big guy to support the rest. <br /> <br /> As soon as the opening sequence of the movie unfolded, I felt that something was wrong and it did not take long before I stopped myself to hide under my folding chair from embarrassment. I'm not one to release movies, no matter how bad they are, because they usually have a feature film, but this one has suffered from a catalog of bad directors, bad actors ('Bruno' bar and the impeccable Jean Rochefort - according to my friends), a terrible editing (in terms of theme and meaning), a soundtrack and a correlation of horrendous images that seemed to make an extraordinary art placing the bad peace of music on the image and the scene at the wrong time. The most serious crime was his insipidity and incredible credibility (a consequence of the atrocities mentioned above). Why was it so terrible? I do not want to waste more time explaining. I would say go see it for yourself but I do not want to fill the coffers of this project more than necessary. Oh, the projection had a redeeming element: my friend arching over the rows of seats in silhouette with his umbrella hung on his arm as he tried to stabilize - more pathos, tension and entertainment at these moments that 'to 125 minutes of this effort unfortunately terrible.
