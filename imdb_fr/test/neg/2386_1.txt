"The New Twenty" is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Granted, some might say that low-budget formula-driven films looking to get less may seem worse, but I would say that an "independent" pseudo-intellectual anti-formula film, claiming to be more, is worse. <br /> <br /> "The New Twenty" was written and directed by Chris Mason Johnson, and I will never recover the 91 minutes of my life lost in his film. <br /> <br /> THE SCENARIST AND CHARACTERS <br /> <br /> From beginning to end, the scenario failed to provide an anti-hero or hero with a moral core that the audience would like to see it succeed or fail. <br /> <br /> In the story, the three dramatic conflicts are man against man, man against the world and man against himself. <br /> <br /> The storyline centers on a group of friends at the university in New York, and is concerned about the dynamics of the man against himself, where each of the characters in the film is so absorbed by self in a stupor of depression and self-destructive behavior that the film atrophies before the very eyes of the public. <br /> <br /> Each of the main characters engage in unexplained misbehavior (heroin addiction, no explanation for being an addict, a fiance who has sex with the boss / investor of his fiancee, even if the character is written too intelligent to have sex with such a sordid character, a man who starts as an honest man, but who is attracted by a rude investor, and who transforms himself for some unknown reason in a similar business idiot, a cheery chubby cyber-geek, who does nothing but finds appointments online, and a gay Asian who goes out with an HIV-positive man, but who has not scenes of why the relationship works and why love develops). <br /> <br /> Crucial scenes establish the cause of the addiction of the character, sufferings and hatred of the bride's self that could explain why she would sleep with a sleeping bag; the back story that would explain why an honest guy would be attracted to a "Gordon Gecko" character and become a fool; a story for the chubby cyber-geek; and more scenes of interaction between the Asian man and his HIV-positive boyfriend are all missing. <br /> <br /> Without proper details, all the actions of the characters seem forced and artificial. <br /> <br /> DIRECTION, CINEMATOGRAPHY AND SCORE <br /> <br /> I found that the direction of Mr. Johnson was without a point of view, leaving the actors with an emotional inconsistency. <br /> <br /> Cinematography can at best be described as banal. Mr. Johnson chose small spaces to shoot and failed to capture the grandeur of New York City. This failure created a claustrophobic film, which resembled the filming of a play and not a film. <br /> <br /> The score was absent from most films. I guess Mr. Johnson is to blame because he could have asked for the full score to improve the understanding of each shot. <br /> <br /> CONCLUSION <br /> <br /> "The new twenty" is a boring and total failure in the making of movies.
