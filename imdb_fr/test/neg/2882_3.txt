I do not fail to recognize Haneke's above-average skills in filmmaking. For example, I appreciate the fact that he dwells on the unadorned settings, the natural lighting of the day, as a powerful way to impose a strong sense of realism. However, regarding the content of this film, I am very sad to note that in the 21st century, there is still an urgent need to pathologize relationships or feelings of domination-submission (and / or BDSM practices). The problem that the main character has with his mother is incredibly relevant, as is the alienation and misunderstanding felt by Walter (I do not speak of the frustration of a lover who is not loved in the same way which is understandable, he looks at her as if she were crazy or as if he were a monk, come on!). I mean that D / s is not something new in the world and I think it is rather ridiculous to treat the subject as if it were a "weird" or pathological phenomenon; it's not. In general, movies dealing with this subject are really lagging behind. <br /> <br /> I think that this film ends up being a rather programmatic film, preoccupied by psychicoanalitic theories very outdated (isn '). is it almost embarrassing?), and it does not really correspond to the real life and experiences of those who are engaged in D / s relationships (personal experience, forums, irc discussion forums, even recent academic studies will show it ).
