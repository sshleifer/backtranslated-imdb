I never thought I'd be surprised to say this: But I think "Dog the Bounty Hunter" is more entertaining than this 90s crime drama. Walker is very melodramatic and actually sets a standard like Police series "High Octane" such as CSI, CSI: Miami, etc. I'm not saying that all these shows are bad, but they are not good either. I like Walker's karate action on the enemies of justice, as well as the diversity of characters, as well as the scientific technology of the CSI series. But there are things I hate in a show like this. Stereotypes / counter-types! That's right, stereotypes / counter-types! Unfortunately, this is a program aimed at moderates from Red State America who refuse to get rid of the old prejudices of the past, especially in terms of crime. For example, there was an episode in which a psychic child ventures into Dallas where he meets a group of children dressed in Goth / Punk clothes and starts harassing him. Now! This is exactly what Central America perceives as Gothic / punk culture. Come on, how often do people who dress like that steal and steal from those who only care about their belongings? Whenever there are blacks and Latinos in the plot, it's still gangs in a poor neighborhood. Okay! Not all members of a minority are desperate recruits to a gang surrounded by crime, drugs, poverty. Once again, this is what the Red Middle East sees about these people. Finally, why is the Trivette the clumsy teammate, can not you make this teammate equal?
