Ugh. Yes, it's exactly like McMartin's disorder or the horrible arrests in Wenatchee, Washington. In the film, the mother questions her little boy aggressively, again and again, until he finally tells her what she obviously wants to hear. Court investigators and "therapists" repeat the pattern. The questioning in itself is sexually frightening, and constitutes an assault repeated in its own way. <br /> <br /> The directors join a doctor who talks about material evidence of abuse, perhaps to justify the point of view of the film: the four-year-olds never do "things like that". Well, they will if all the adults they know ask them. The manner in which this article endorses such discredited interrogation techniques makes observation an exercise in frustration for anyone who knows what is needed for the prosecution to succeed in real life. <br /> <br /> (They also add a special arrest to "prove" their case - no parallel to this fictional incident has ever occurred in real life.) We can not say more here without turning that. in a spoiler, but you'll know it when you see it.) <br /> <br /> Yes, children are abused, sometimes by paid caregivers. But watching a film that reports ridiculous and hysterical accusations against so many totally innocent people, watching a reenactment of the trials that have ruined the lives of countless children as well as the life of the accused - I did not think I would have 'lasted' until the end. It's simply too sad, especially since the editorial team apparently endorsed the abusive, paranoid, obsessive questioning techniques that began - how can we call it? The bonfire of sanities? <br /> <br /> Thank God, no one I know has ever been charged with child abuse, but my grandmother, who is 12 years behind, has been accused of witchcraft and killed for her. Crowds full of what they think are holy wrath are just as dangerous as three hundred years ago. A sensational sensation like this: "These accusations of satanic abuse are multiplying all over the country, there must be something there!" "So tell the jury!" - Just the eggs on. <br /> <br /> And who thought it would be a good idea to have children under ten, some of them under five, play those roles? It's traumatic to see them deliver their lines; how much more traumatic was to act these parts? Filmmakers' commitment to fighting child abuse does not seem to apply to themselves. And what did the parents of the child actors think? "Melinda" (uncredited, at least in the A & E network version in 2005, but I think it was Cassy Friel) and "Teddy" (Brian Bonsall) were fantastic. Professionals or not, however, they were too young to be exposed to this material, let alone to be paid to play it. Despite the ruthless exploitation of these real-life children, "do you know the man of the muffins" was he nominated to the Emmy for staging - which shows how crazy the situation was in 1989
