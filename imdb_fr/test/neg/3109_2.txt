Honestly, I did not really have expectations for this film, but at the same time, I had hope. The film directed by Albert Pyun - one of the best-known b-movie writers - has not really raised my hopes. I mean, how many of Albert Pyun's films are in this category? Yes, exactly ... but the film still announced a decent distribution. Rob Lowe, Burt Reynolds (celebrity before the rebirth), Ice-T and Mario Van Peebles. <br /> <br /> All this comes down to squatting, the film is so boring and moves so slowly that the energy just seemed to drip as soon as it lasts a long time. It lasts more than 90 minutes, but tells a story that could have been told in 30 minutes. I do not know what Pyun wanted to do here. I mean, the movie looks like an art style, but it's sometimes fuzzy and maybe I'm foolish to wait for Pyun this time. Here, he seemed to really have a budget and an excellent distribution for the material, but all is lost. Crazy Six is ​​not really an action movie, it's really not really something. <br /> <br /> I guess the saddest part here is the fact that I found the end credits of the film's most entertaining movie. The score is actually half decent with sweet female voices too, but the rest is a total waste and the less we say, the better. To avoid.
