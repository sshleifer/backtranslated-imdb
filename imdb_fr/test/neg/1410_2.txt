I was a little eager to be named Man of the Year. Some girls at work said it was a very good movie and my mom said she liked it. So I waited for the rental and I watched it last night. Honestly, I must say that this film was a huge disappointment. I barely managed to understand this, because to be honest, the beginning was pretty good and very rhythmic, but it became too dark and not in the film I saw in the trailer. It sounded like a good comedy, then a very dark drama, it was not even interesting, considering the number of stories of this kind that we have told about the government conspiracy. <br /> <br /> Tom Dobbs is a very popular comedian with a prominent show and a show where many people would like him to get involved in politics, simply because he seems to have a good idea of what should be improved. So, he does, he's running for president, but a lot of people doubt he can win because he's a comedian, but he wins! But Elenore Green, who ensures that all votes are counted, tries to solve a computer problem, but when the government tells him not to fix it, he tries to get rid of it. Tom quickly realizes that this may not be his job. desired. <br /> <br /> The acting was good, the staging was OK, it was simply the story that did not work in my opinion. As I said, it has changed drastically, because if you saw the trailer, you might think it's a comedy, and when you start to watch it, that's what you get, but it becomes so a very dark drama and a little scary. I would not really recommend this movie. This was one of the biggest disappointments I've seen so far. <br /> <br /> 2/10
