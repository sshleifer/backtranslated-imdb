When I heard that this movie was a NATIONAL LAMP, I thought it was going to be great, but I really had a say, it was a disappointment. I saw most of the movies they made, Christmas holidays to van wilder, and this film is the worst film of their name, very bad actors and a very intense film. This movie is probably good to watch if you watch it with a crowd of pissed off people and the ability to laugh, but if you like good comedy, as I am, I do not suggest this movie, I would much rather watch van wilder a second or third time, than watching this movie ... you've been warned.
