When I first saw "Race Against Fear" (I do not like LMN movie titles?), I had to scratch my head. Was it supposed to be serious? Why could the main character not even run like a normal runner, let alone a star runner? How did I know that the coach was diabolical only 1 minute after the beginning of the movie? All these questions, and no answers. Then I got carried away by the senseless scenario and the horrible staging ... it was easier not to resist ... then the movie became funnier by the minute, and I now rank it among my ten best junk movies from LMN. . Some have said here that Ariana Richards was really talented but the material was defective - I totally disagree. Not only can she not convince me that she is an athlete, her eyes are wide open in the rest of the story, as if she had just landed on Earth. Maybe the coach has escaped from prison and completed it ... at least I hope so.
