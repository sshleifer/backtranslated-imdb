CANNIBAL FEROX (1+ of 5 stars) A miserable excuse for a movie ... which will please you if you like the boring and senseless movies of the jungle, embellished with scenes of graphic violence. Two fugitive drug traffickers travel to the jungle of Paraguay in search of emeralds and cocaine. They meet another young traveler and his two very sexy acolytes, including an anthropologist seeking to prove definitively that cannibalism does not exist and never existed. One of the two traffickers turns out to be a little psychopath and he tortures and kills some natives to get them to tell him where they hide their jewels. (And how could they even tell him when he does not seem to speak their language in the first place?) Well, the natives are suddenly no longer delighted by the whites in their jungle and capture them all for retaliatory torture. Bad acting, mediocre plot and bad direction. Not a moment of decent suspense in the dismal 90 minutes. Even the special effects are not particularly convincing (although some shots still make most viewers shudder). The only good scene in the entire film is the one where the two women are trapped in a mud hut and seem to touch the hearts of the natives with their interpretation of "Red River Valley". The following is a quote from the movie, but I would not be surprised if many viewers do not say exactly the same thing at that time: "Oh my God, please, let her die soon. soon too, please. "
