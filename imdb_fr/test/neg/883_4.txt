If you read the book before you see the movie, you may be disappointed like me. The book was great and after watching the preview of the movie, I was sure the movie would be great too, but I felt like watching a movie where the director and cast did not even read what these characters were. The film is short and they never really give the impression that these people were really in love and felt like loners. Even if the film does not go in the same direction as the book, they could at least make the romance between these two characters more intense. I think Diane Lane and Richard Gere were perfect for these two characters and they have good chemistry, but they just did not develop a script long enough for us to see how much they wanted. The book was a real love story and I think this movie could have been a lot better.
