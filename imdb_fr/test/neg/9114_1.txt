I had a bad feeling ten seconds after the beginning of the film while a pair of overworked sleepwalkers (probably left by a bad western) was blowing through the scene. The discomfort grew ten seconds later, when the forced opening, for no apparent reason, became a man's sacrifice, for no apparent reason, lowered his rearview mirror to see a shadow in the back. During the five minutes following the opening credits, we are entitled to an aerial view of the car that tilts and only the dramatic music made for television informs us that a murder takes place, and not an improvised session. For about 27 hours, we are dealing with two idiotic psychotics who, for some reason, seem forced to cross the Southwest Desert together, pursuing themselves like a mad abbe, Costello. Even with the "shocking" twists in the end, all we have to do is shake our heads and ask ourselves if the producers and the director / writer feel as ashamed and embarrassed as they should be for creating this incoherent absurdity and inconsistent.
