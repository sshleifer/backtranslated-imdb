iCarly is all that is wrong in the world. All the main characters except Carly's brother and Freddy are morally bankrupt. <br /> <br /> Sam inflicts material damage on others. She breaks a children's locker and is forced to pay $ 100 to fix it, and all she says is "Tough Chance" and goes on to break Freddy's cell phone. She just caused at least $ 300 worth of damage and focuses more on the food. What is going on?. The only time she felt guilty was when she made fun of Freddy in the series. And that's only because Carly has stung her mouth. <br /> <br /> Carly is a "I'm perfect, everything I do is good." kind of girl. All she does is for her own benefit and she is often shown to feel remorse for herself. What's worse, she encourages Sam's shit. Sam ruined Freddy's clothes? She laughs. Sam ruin a class of children? She shrugs. <br /> <br /> Do not even get me started on humor. The laughter track is played every moment. <br /> <br /> Sam: It's not that hot Carly: Yes, it's Sam: Yeah you're right * INSANE QUANTITY OF LAUGH * <br /> <br /> shows that Humor is about degrading others and saying obscure words and sometimes mocking trivial questions using similar phrases. <br /> <br /> Not to mention all the "super special effects of techno" that can be realized in Windows Movie Maker.
