White spots and various shapes, a beautiful nude, random images. That's what this little experimental short film is. <br /> <br /> It's pretty interesting to see how, at the beginning of the film, such images could be transferred to film, but despite my love for many surreal images and films, and a fascination for strange, this movie just did not do it for me. <br /> <br /> I'm not sorry I looked at it, but if there is an underlying meaning, I do not get it. Visually, it's not exceptional, IMHO. As an example of Dadaism, I suppose it would be fine, because it seems to reject any semblance of logic or reason, although I would have preferred it to do so in a more visually interesting way. <br /> <br /> But to each his tastes.
