Whenever I see a movie like this, my heart hurts. When I watch a movie, I like to see what I see in everyday life. During my day, I see blacks, whites, Asians, Latinos, etc. How can you shoot a movie without thinking about the possibility of other ethnic groups going beyond you? I'm sure they did not do it on purpose, but be careful. I do not care if it's happening in Kansas or south-central. All I saw was a symbolic black. It was typical of the 80's. Hey! This is 2007, with all the rappers, singers and athletes playing the role of actors, Thomas Haden Church could have paid more attention to its distribution. Are not the actors supposed to be more liberal?
