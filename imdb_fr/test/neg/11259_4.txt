If you have already listened to a James Lee Burke book on cassette or CD and the reader was Will Patton, you will agree with me that Will is the personification of Dave R. <br /> <br /> Tommy Lee Jones is a Texan native (that's what I heard) and nobody describes a better texan in my humble opinion, but he's not a Cajun. His delivery is all wrong. I lived in this state for several years and I still hear the strange patois that contains a Louisiana accent. TLJ has nothing like it. <br /> <br /> I thought Marry Steenbergen was a good choice for Bootsy, but I missed seeing Cletus (who will be chosen to play this role? The Rock? Mickey Rourke? Whoever it is, he will have to to be great). <br /> <br /> Overall, I thought the movie was only a 4 - the plot unfolded like a fish out of the water and did not have the normal interesting linear continuity that the book has typically. <br /> <br /> Hopefully Hollywood will try another JLB book, "The Last Car at Elysican Fields" would be a good choice. We would have the opportunity to see some of JLB's best villains.
