... with a budget of $ 500 and a bottle of ketchup. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of C movies without any talented actor, a ridiculous story, inexpensive effects and a lousy camera, this movie book. <br /> <br /> All others are warned. You could probably make a similar movie with some friends in your backyard and a camcorder at home. <br /> <br /> The film is good for a little laugh. Watch it with friends and discuss how NOT to make a movie. <br /> <br /> 2/10 for an unintentional comedy. <br /> <br /> Why on earth do you have to write 10 lines? I have seen comments with fewer lines and write that this is just a lousy fill.
