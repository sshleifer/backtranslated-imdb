If you really want to experience magic (?) From Don Dohler, then take a look at "Alien Factor" or maybe at "Fiend", but not at that. Alien Factor is actually quite imaginative considering the small budget and its rather scary character, but "Nightbeast", which is sort of an update to Alien Factor, is just stupid. The actors somnambulate through their roles, especially Mr. Monotone Sheriff, and the monster is some kind of silly mask of Halloween mask instead of extravagantly imaginative (but rather dumb) Alien Factor creatures. A spaceship crashes on Earth and of course there is a creature inside that is walking around vaporizing people. And tearing off arms, etc. And he has a cold ray gun that he uses to spray people too, until he is shot in the hand. And that's really about it. "Alien Factor" beats this mess hands down, if you really want to see a good Don Dohler movie, take a look at it. And RIP Don Dohler, 12/2/06.
