I had this DVD to watch, thinking to see a kind of biography of the painter Goya, but the film was about everything but Goya. This film is about a young woman kidnapped from her family by the Holy Inquisition, allegedly because she practiced Jewish rituals (only because the poor girl did not like to eat pork!). The rest of the film is about torture and humiliation, inspired by a mediocre scenario (I can not believe it's JC Carri√®re, because I could not believe that this character is directed by Mr. Milos Forman) and centered on a religious and young man. woman and that's it. <br /> <br /> Ah, and there is Goya, I forgot, playing a completely peripheral role - this could be the role of John, Paul, Peter, Manuel, Joaquim, Jose or anyone else. Very disappointing - one of those movies that will be forgotten forever (if it has not happened yet). Rent "The name of the rose" if you want a film about the Holy Inquisition. And I do not know what you should rent if you want to watch a movie about the Spanish painter Goya. Perhaps a good director, not Forman, must still do it. PS: The Spanish painter Goya - the main role that is lost in the plot - is described by a Scandinavian actor, which makes this film even more difficult to take seriously. Maybe next time we should send Javier Barden to interpret the biopic of the Norwegian painter Edvard Munch!
