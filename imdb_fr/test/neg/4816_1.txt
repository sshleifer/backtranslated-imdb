This film is the worst thing ever created by humans. You think that Manos is the worst movie of all time? He does not even come close to this trash. I do not even know where to start. The "Russian" commander and the rebellious chic are the worst "actors" of all time. They make Troll's sister 2 look like Meryl Streep. She must be seen to be admitted to kung fu. Then there is the oompa music during the prison, the totally misplaced love scene, the stupid song that plays during the misplaced love scene, the false castro, the fact that everyone wears a headband and / or a bandana a part of their body, the most wacky rape scene ever filmed, and the worst theatrical action ever staged. This film deserves to be better known to bad moviegoers. Certainly the worst movie of all time.
