About 5 minutes after the beginning of the film, you are immersed in this warm love relationship between the cat and the mouse between the two main characters. The biggest problem is the characters and how incredible they are. That's what Hollywood's extraordinary 50-year-old producers and screenwriters think of the stoner's life, as if they were giving pan to the cast of Friends. Bland, dull, boring and completely unrealistic. I despise this movie.
