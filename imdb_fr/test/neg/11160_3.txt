Arnold fans will scream with joy, brainless action fans will scream with astonishment and Catholics will scream just. <br /> <br /> Illumically written by Andrew W. Marlowe and hand-led by Peter Hyams, * End of Days * releases The Terminator from his open-back hospital gown (the return of Arnold Schwarzenegger to the screen after heart surgery), while blowing things up in Mysterious Ways and blaspheming the Bible verse to give Catholics something more to cry. <br /> <br /> We are in 1999 and critics around the world are worried that their computers will deteriorate and lose their downloaded porn. As the technological scourge of the year 2000 swept the streets of New York City, former police officer Jericho Cane (Schwarzenegger), with the superficial story of "the dead wife and the child" for Loose Cannon effect), was to brave the theme. waters to prevent that Christine (Robin Tunney), a virgin of 20, is recorded as ?? wait for that ?? The bride of Satan. Dun dah daaaarrrh! Stupidity ensues. <br /> <br /> For each anti-hero, there is his anti-Christ. Gabriel Byrne is the devil here ?? and he went to party like in 1999, in order to impregnate Christine with the Antichrist between December 31, 1999, between 23h and midnight ?? Ironically, when all the porn will be lost ?? thus causing the end of days. Being able to read minds, create hallucinations and use unlimited magic, Satan does not have the idea of ​​speeding up the process of impregnation by appearing months in advance and courting Christine as a teenager, then closing panty raid easily at the desired time; instead, he appears on December 28 as a Terminator Keyser Soze and wonders why she does not welcome her open thighs ?? (See comment above on stupidity.) Here is a film where nothing makes sense when it is pronounced, let alone after contemplating its veracity or mythology. A priest (Rod Steiger) told Jericho that '666' is really '999' upside down with a '1' in front. So wait - * Prince * is the Antichrist? <br /> <br /> Satan Soze pursues Jericho and Christine (J & C get it?) In town, doing nothing that can precipitate their capture. In one scene, Satan recreates Jericho's wife and child to reveal where he hid Christine. But if he can see so deeply in Jericho's mind by recreating his family with enough nuance to inspire nostalgia, why does not he see where Jericho hid Christine ten minutes ago? <br /> <br /> Satan can make a murderer without a language speak, but he can not make this assassin a semi-automatic weapon. And when Jericho pulls at Satan at close range, Satan is courteous enough to open his shirt to reveal the wounds that are closing. Jericho is not worried about Satan's health - and not hygienic if his gunshot wounds are open ?? In fact, instead of just owning Jericho himself to get close to Christine and raping her, Satan devotes such unnecessary energy to parallel projects (crucifying the guy without language, blowing up Jericho's partner (Kevin Pollak) and the save then, and then blow him up again, ridiculously fighting Jericho when he could choke it with the thought effort) that we were wondering if a more effective assassin / lover should not be put on the case ?? say, Antonio Banderas. <br /> <br /> What I find most valuable in * End of Days * are the valiant attempts of Arnold against The Method: "sad" means squinting and not erasing everything that has a foreign accent; "depressed" means carrying a bottle to one's lips and not scrambling with a foreign accent; "deadly fear" means to widen one's eyes and not to scramble anything with a foreign accent. There is certainly a model here, if we could only decipher it. <br /> <br /> Finally, the devil is not sent by the holy men to whom Catholics pray to be delivered from apocalypses like these, but from atheists. Jericho. While the timid men of an impotent god exhort "faith" and tremble in their cells without doing anything for Satan to walk among them, the Prince of Darkness is thwarted by a Nullifidean with a fat rifle and a foreign accent. This clearly says something that Catholics blindly refuse to hear: that even if the devil were to exist, those who were indoctrinated to fear unconditionally and irrationally that he could not believe in his loss, act even less against him . Also, they might not really REALLY defeat him, because it is only by the opposite polarity that their god will become lasting. <br /> <br /> For it is written in the book of revelation: "And the prince of darkness will come down to the earth without a solid game plan, and imbue a virgin on a date that will have no meaning until that the Gregorian calendar of the 1500s adopts the numbering of the days that will bring it into line with the equinoxes and the Anno Domine syntax that will hinder For millennia, Christians will have forgotten the actual birth date of Christ and will have appropriated the festival pagan Saturnalia in his place, and the Prince will carry out a revolution using purple trousers and ambiguous-lesbian group members "I can believe that people are being drained and crucified, and that the alcoholic is constructed as a Mr. Universe; I can believe that a supernatural giant monster can not kill a guy armed only with a foreign accent; I can even believe that the devil has to perform a hokey ritual of the 13th century Celtic Druid as preliminaries - but what I can not believe is the 20-year-old virgin in New York in 1999. <br /> < Especially around Prince ...
