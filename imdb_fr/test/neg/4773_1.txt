I have not seen a film so stupid and stupid for a long time. It has absolutely no logic, no horror - it does not scare you, no suspense, no thrills .. I mean, I have not found a single part of the film attractive .. <br /> <br /> You know what they thought when they made the movie. You watch the entire movie to discover that there is a plant that can walk around, drag human corpses and eat human flesh. Not only that, but it can also speak, that is to say imitate sounds, like a cell phone that rings or a human conversation ... it's like a plant emitting the sound of a mobile phone. .. how smart of the plant to set up an ambush. <br /> <br /> This is clearly the level of creativity of a primary school child ... Bad !!!
