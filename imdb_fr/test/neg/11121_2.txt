In general, I prefer horror movies that scare me so much that I'm afraid of everything for the next day or so, not those where people are stupid and get killed by an indestructible monster. This is one of those movies. The legendary chupacabra is a greenish-gray, lizard-skinned monster with a dog's face that jumps like a kangaroo, has fangs and claws, a row of sharp spines sticking out of his back and sucking the blood of cattle. As in many horror movies, good and bad, this film takes the liberty with the legend. Not only does it attack humans, but it feeds on their intestines and has a foolproof, almost indestructible constitution. So tell me, how can a hypodermic needle penetrate its skin when a bullet can not? And why, when the marines realize that piercing bullets can hurt her, separate themselves so that the chupacabra can eliminate them one by one? John Rhys-Davies gives a performance that goes beyond the bad movie, and Chelan Simmons and Dylan Neal also deserve credit for their performances. Otherwise, the rest of the game was bad to bad, just like the rest of the movie. My rating is based on Rhys-Davies, Simmons and Neal.
