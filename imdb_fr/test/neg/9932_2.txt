I caught this on HBO in its "Guilty Pleasures" category, and I would agree that I felt guilty (and happy) to watch it. One is a basket and a basket really hot. Secondly, the plot is slow and predictable and once you learn "who did it", you think, "so what?" However, I must admit that I am quite a chauvinistic pig to want to get through what is obviously a bad movie, if only to see Peta Wilson get completely naked several times. Do I feel dirty looking at him? Yes. Am I sorry to have watched? So there is a contradiction between being a lover of good movies and a lover of female anatomy, even in a bad movie. Sigh!
