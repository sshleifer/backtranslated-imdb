The performances are better than the mark given to this work, simply because I will not support a film that shows any child or anyone with a developmental disability how to get, cook and inject drugs into their bodies. <br /> <br /> It's a disgusting film, which is useless in the world, but glorifies and attempts to legitimize the narcotic lifestyle. It carries convincing performances, which adds to my disgust. What were these people thinking ?! I could not enjoy such a movie. It is enough for someone who has never used drugs to think about it, and those who have redeemed themselves and redeemed themselves, look back. I'm surprised it does not bring down all the addicts who see it well. <br /> <br /> There is nothing good in this "film", which is rather a document "How to get stretched" drama. It's the quintessence of what's wrong with Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Absolutely disgusting. <br /> <br /> It gives a rating of 1.3 / 10 of ... <br /> <br /> The Fiend:.
