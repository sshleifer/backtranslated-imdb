The bad news: the Canadian version of Beast In The Cellar published by Maple Pictures that I saw was of poor quality. Dark and faded, he seemed to be baptized at random from a VHS tape. He even jumps at some point because of some missing pictures. <br /> <br /> The good news: this film is so serious that the poor quality of the DVD has not hindered my viewing pleasure. This horror movie does not create tension and lack of fear. It's a horror movie without horror. While most scary movies have limited dialogue, Beast In The Cellar is a gabfest, so much so that a character repeats what two other characters have just heard. Presumably, all informal discussions play the role of filler for a little imaginative and low-budget film. Unfortunately, the dialog box is not colorful enough to warrant monitoring.
