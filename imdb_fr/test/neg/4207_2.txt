I caught this movie a few years ago one night, and it was one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. However, since it is supposed to be an action movie, I can not give it more stars because the humor was not intentional. <br /> <br /> Chuck Norris plays the role of a truck driver who returns from the road to see his family and in the first five minutes a conflict occurs that pushes Chuck to take revenge for the rest of the film. It's a good thing too, because the subset of actors began to age very quickly. In fact, the judge was very good, but I can not really describe what makes it work, you will have to check it yourself. <br /> <br /> And the custom order of van Chuck Norris is horribly classic!
