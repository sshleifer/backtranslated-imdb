A terrible film that is amateurish at almost every level - a boring and derivative scenario filled with stereotypical characters played by embarrassed actors for a director devoid of the most rudimentary understanding of his art. Everything stinks. He plays as a slasher movie from the early eighties, to the rotten score and SFX ketchup, but without the nostalgia for childhood necessary to watch such slag with tenderness. One of the worst horror movies I've ever seen - certainly the worst that has ever had a theatrical release. In my life, I never left a film - if I had the misfortune to see "Hatchet" at the theater, it would have been a first. Avoid at all costs.
