I decided to dump this show from my memory in the bathroom of a bad television show in the darkness of hell of a distracting, disappointing and uninteresting television show. <br /> <br /> Skyler guy who is the host / star / creator of this show is boring, uninteresting, amazing, not particularly beautiful and not funny at all, so why is this guy he's on TV and especially why is he in a comedy show when he's not funny, claiming to be a professional scammer when he's definitely nothing but an obvious suitor? Others have already said it here, but this guy is a false total and a fraud. If you believe that one of these disadvantages is against, I think you should seriously consider having your head checked because they are all wrong, and those that might be true. are so useless, like spending the whole day convincing someone not to give you an average meal in the restaurant? Seriously, this guy needs to leave, glad that this show is canned.
