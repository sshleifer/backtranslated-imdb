The most predictable movie I've ever seen ... extremely boring, I feel like I've seen a hundred movies with the same scenario as this one. At best, playing is ok, there is no real action and there is absolutely no thrills. Actors capable with a terrible scenario, I think it could have been better written by a grade 10 student. It was like a chore to watch because I was hoping that there would be something in this movie that would distinguish it from all the other garbage but that it would go perfectly in the heap. All the movie, I was waiting for something good, but it never happened. I never evaluate movies and never see them, but this movie was so painful that I had to log in here and post a review to try to save some poor souls from wasting their time (and / or their money) with this movie. I hacked it and I never wanted to lose disk space. If I spent $ 10 to see this in the theaters, I would kill myself.
