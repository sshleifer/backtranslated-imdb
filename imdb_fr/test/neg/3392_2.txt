This DVD does not last more than 30 minutes and contains some gloomy interviews that reveal that the average Slipknotian has an IQ of about 30. But these aspects are the least problematic here. <br /> <br /> The real problem is that Slipknot is one of the less talented metal bands selling more than 100,000 units of their shit. (The only reason I say "one of the" instead of "the" is because System Of A Down is even worse.) Just like Ed Gein's friends, the music of this group is restored from secular metal clich√©s, which must be found in both their image and their ultra-dull music. In fact, their image is rather amusing. their videos are like excerpts from horror movies, so they fill at least one goal as entertainment. <br /> <br /> However, their music contains nothing of quality - anything: just a bunch of gadgets heard. a million times before, riffs played only on the neck of the guitar are in no way related to each other, but are nevertheless grouped together at random to form "songs" without cohesion, without highlights, without anything. But if the riffs are really bad, the voices are even worse: the Slipknot singer has a stereotypical and therefore uninteresting roar - like 90% of the current metal bands - but it's nothing compared to when this deceived deceiver begins to try singing! Yet what could we expect? Rule # 39 in the "Nu Metal" manual says very clearly: "You'll growl and sing in turn, just ignore the fact that the two styles do not mix well because most of your fans are so deaf that you will like, even if you **** in the microphone. "Slipknots are at their worst worst when their" singer "begins to vomit" melodies ". <br /> <br /> But back to their image. It is stolen, copied, scammed, hacked, borrowed, taken without anyone asking, except Mr.Bungle. Have you never heard of them? Of course not. You only listen to nu-metal, and Mr.Bungle is quite far from that, and beyond any categorization anyway. They also wore grotesque, horror-like masks similar to those of Slipknot, I might add, in the late '80s and early' 90s. This band, singer Mike Patton of Faith No More, never made much noise, as their music was not meant for ordinary music fans (to say the least). <br /> <br /> So basically, Slipknot is not even original in the image department. They have nothing new to offer and will be forgotten in many years: once the masks become boring for the legions of their fans zipped, Slipknot will be forced to compete in the music market only with their generic music. <br /> <br /> About Mike Patton, it is interesting to note that many nu-metal bands often consider his singing as a major influence. As expected - and thankfully - Patton is not flattered by this and has denied being proud of having influenced it in one of the worst sub-genres of metal of all time ... <br /> > <br /> That said, have fun! this short DVD and the thrills it could give to an untrained ear and a bored eye ... And then, polish these posters Slipknot, because in a few years, no one will take care of them, the poor darlings . <br /> <br /> Having seen Corey in the documentary "Get Thrashed", I finally understand why he wears a mask: it is a ginger with blue-eyed baby's face, which looks like the younger brother of Dave Mustaine! Not really scary. <br /> <br /> For more guarantees from my musical world, go to: http://rateyourmusic.com/collection/Fedor8/1 <br /> <br /> Please, punish me loud, very hard, by clicking on "no" below.
