The artificial melodrama with a scenario adapted by Mel Dinelli from his play "The Man" is about a pension owner taking care of a troubled man who could be homicide. Despite the hard work of Ida Lupino and Robert Ryan (both trying to do their best), this tedious thread is not very inventive in its main set (which quickly becomes dull) and its under-populated cast of characters (There is however a smart doggie the worst!). Hokey and humorless, with Harry Horner's lofty direction (maybe Lupino should have directed it?). Where is all the suspense promised by the ads? Dinelli also served as a co-producer. * 1/2 of ****
