My husband wanted to watch this movie because the reviewer in the newspaper said it was better than Fatal Attraction. Well, do not like Michael Douglas or Glenn Close, I would agree. Not for conventional reasons though. <br /> <br /> This is one of those films you have to watch late at night when you do not want to watch something that really requires reflection, but you do not want to go to bed. > <br /> Yancy Butler is a very nice villain. She is not the best of actresses, in fact she is not even good but she is perfect for this role in this movie. All other participants vary from pine to oak, including the slightly disturbing boy who presents himself as a veiled Pinocchio. <br /> <br /> SPOILER: The end goes too far, with a clich√© not quite dead yet. , with a roar, he'll always take you a moment and then there's a shot of Pinocchio with his icy wooden smile that makes you wonder if they were going to cool or just forget that there was botox in the makeup. <br /> <Anyway, it's about eighty strange minutes and, despite the fact that it's a bad movie, you'd have the gene of humor not to enjoy it a bit . Do not pay for it, but if you are in such an apathetic state of mind, then it's perfect.
