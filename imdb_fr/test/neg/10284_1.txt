I'm not bothered by the sordid hosts, nor by the cynical and self-righteous position of those responsible for this shit. <br /> <br /> What bothers me is that the vast majority of episodes are fake. I would not even be surprised if ALL the episodes had been staged. As a result, it's not a reality show, but something much worse than even Oprah: a garbage-free, zero comma television. Like a daily soap opera, but with more action and combat and less conspiracy. <br /> <br /> The premise would have been great - if only it had been executed without misleading the viewer. If only this idea were free from all the legal complications / pitfalls that would most certainly result from it because of what would happen with real people and what would eventually be broadcast. Therefore, the only way to create this "" "reality show" "" was to call on rather desperate actors and have them improvised (and what pitiful and unconvincing improvisation is most of the time!) . Should not this be obvious to anyone who has completed primary school? Most of the critics I read here do not even mention that all of this is false, let alone all of it. Fictive reflection or boundless naivete? <br /> <br /> The actors hired in this pathetic show are the kind of unemployed actors at the bottom of the barrel waiting miserably on the tables, waiting impatiently for a call from a talk show (or that shit ), then they finally have the chance to win several hundred dollars. I even recognized an actress (in the role of "cheater") that I had seen years before in "The Jerry Springer Show". And I only saw 6-7 episodes of "Cheats". How many of these losing actors are those who appeared in Springer and "Cheaters" that I do not even know? <br /> <br /> However, comparing "Cheaters" with Springer is not fair to him. The Springer show is not all wrong. most episodes are not staged, which often makes them very entertaining. There is no value to find in "Cheats" unless you are a troubled actor and want tips on how to NOT act in front of the camera. <br /> <br /> Producers use various means (very cheap). , transparencies) to create the illusion of reality, to give their film this elusive documentary sensation. But everything is in the vein. In the end, the smartest viewer looking for train wrecks is completely slumped. The "professional fight" has more credibility than that.
