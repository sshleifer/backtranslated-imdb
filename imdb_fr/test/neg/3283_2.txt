If you have not seen "The War at Home", let me tell you what you are missing. It's a show about ethnic diversity and sexuality that could only have been annoying and amusing in the sixties. Where America has grown in its acceptance of race, sexual orientation, religion, etc., this show seems to be quarreling with this progress. It is a step backward in the evolution of America. <br /> <br /> For example, one of the jokes in the series is that the WHITE girl is dating a BLACK child from school. It's obviously hilarious to see how you can not see this type of relationship in any shopping mall in America. I lived in small and big cities, so do not give me a type of red state, a blue state excuse. Not only is it a joke, but the father, who is supposedly not racist, finds it disturbing and asks his daughter to separate repeatedly from his boyfriend, which goes against his character "He may sound racist, but he's just stupid." <br /> <br /> As if that were not enough, a second joke is that one of the sons, who will soon be metropolitan, is ambiguous in his sexual orientation. The public is constantly learning that he is not gay, but the father is not convinced. He therefore constantly avoids his son, perhaps fearing that his son would attack him, because all homosexual men are nymphomaniac wild men, who can not control their will. The father always accepts his son once a show, but usually avoids it in the next episode. <br /> <br /> The only way that this show can heal itself to me is if the exhibition continues facing these "unnatural events in life", open a few eyes of the father, but that's maybe too much to ask - and besides, with jokes like these, I'm sure we'll have hilarity in the coming episodes - Episode 13, "Father votes against female voters" and the episode 14, "My Muslim neighbor is a terrorist". <br /> <br /> Thank you for dropping this show, FOX. We live in a world different from the one in which your leaders grew up.
