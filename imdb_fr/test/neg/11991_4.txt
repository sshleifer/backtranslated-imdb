One of the best attempts of Bolls. It just shows that if you do something long enough, you just have to improve by chance. It's still not good but it's at least observable, which is an improvement over the Bloodrayne. The main difference between Bloodrayne and FarCry is that Farcry's story was not the highlight of the game, while Bloodrayne had a solid story and Boll was more likely to ruin it. <br /> <br /> The action in this movie The film is actually pretty good. From time to time a little exaggerated but in a good way and deserves a watch just for that. <br /> <br /> By acting wisely, it was rather decent. Most actors are good enough but you can say that they do not take it seriously based on comparisons with other performances. But the lighter atmosphere that gives the movie really helps. <br /> <br /> Although I think that being a little closer to the story of the game could have created a slightly better movie, the changes made are rather practical and impractical. big enough to make a difference. Especially considering the plot of the game, it was hardly Oscar who won a simple vehicle for the carnage FPS. I wish it were in the jungle because it was an integral part of the game, but Canada does not have a lot of jungle and is at least in a kind of rainforest. <br /> <br /> Why Boll feels the need to change game plots already scripted and directed by professionals I do not know, but he does. And until he starts letting the source material speak through his adaptations, he will always miss him. Look at the movie for a laugh, that's good for that, and maybe to watch a party while drinking fodder.
