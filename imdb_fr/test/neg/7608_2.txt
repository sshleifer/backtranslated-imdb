I watched a movie called Dark Talon, dated 1974. The credits for this film are exactly the same as Dark Star's. So I guess it was an alternative title. Dark Talon was not nearly as funny as everyone here said. The acting was nil, the writing was neglected and overall stupid. At first, there's a boring 1970s truck song called "Benson, Arizona" that has absolutely nothing to do with the movie. Basically, the plot revolves around a small interstellar bomber crew that bypasses unstable bombing areas. Bombs are sensitive and respond to people. Mandatory disaster disrupts communication between the bombs and the crew. One of the crew members comes out and has an absurd and silly existential conversation with the bomb that makes no sense. The film I saw was shot in less than an hour and a half and commercials were screened. So I guess Dark Talon is an oversized version of Dark Star. <br /> <br /> The Stranger is an inflatable red beach spray painted with a pair of monster hands on which he walks. It was stupid and unconvincing as a foreigner. <br /> <br /> It is hard to believe that John Carpenter played a role in this case. His other films were so much better.
