It is important to check your expectations when you see HATCHET. The buzz generated on this site far exceeds the real impact of the film. What can help someone on the verge of seeing the film is to realize that it is not supposed to be scary. It is a pure camp and an attempt of amusement. It's not - funny - just campy. Do not expect anything like SHAUN OF THE DEAD; nor something like Friday the 13th (Part II to infinity). <br /> <br /> HATCHET has passable actors. Cinematography is directly Ed Wood. The effects of creatures and makeup are stupid - probably by design. Blood and blood are something between Romero and DEAD ALIVE. HACHET is a film of the in-between. It's between SHAUN OF THE DEAD and LESLIE VERNON. It's between campy and comedy (there is a difference). It's between ultra-violent comics and violent comics. <br /> <br /> Instead of "capturing the essence of American Horror", or some other silly jargon used to describe the movie, he's trying to capture something between -American-- horror like Friday the 13th and new Horror like SHAUN. Fortunately, he stays away from Torture Horror. <br /> <br /> In the end, HATCHET is somewhere between a bad film and a decent movie. <br /> <br /> * I think there are more and more people in movies flocking to sites like IMDb to rate and comment on the movies in which they participate. At the very least, there are ongoing campaigns to have associate associates leave their positive comments and ratings. There is no other reason for this film to appear in the top 7 with 600 votes and fall quickly after a wide circulation. This movie is just better than the versions of HorrorFest and should not be so inflated.
