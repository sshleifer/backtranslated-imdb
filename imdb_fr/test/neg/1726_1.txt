Like many others, I counted on the appearance of Dennis Hopper so that it is not a total waste of time. I was wrong, unfortunately. All that is said about this cop is more than true. However, what takes the cake is the horrible and horrible scenario of the main character. <br /> <br /> Here is why: the planet could be destroyed, the only way out, so that the whole human race is saved To achieve this, we need to bring together so many intelligent, capable, pleasant and competent in an underground hiding place. And Dennis Hopper is the only scientist / visionary with a vision that was prepared for the worst and who realized it. But what is the main motivation of Stevens (Sonny D'Angelo) ?? He is angry because Dennis has decided who should be saved or sentenced! While it made it clear to Stevens that Dennis's character did everything to warn people of the danger, but he made fun of him. The character of Hopper was the boy with his finger in the dyke, and now Stevens blames him for "choosing and choosing" ??? And if that was not enough, he wants to prevent everyone from entering this hiding place, because "it's not fair!" AND .... he is responsible for the death of one of the guys who is the savior of humanity! OH GOD, how stupid can you be? <br /> <br /> What is also annoying is that IMDb forces someone to write at least ten lines about this shit. I mean, TWO MILLIONS of budget, what could we have done with that? Think of clerks, Blair Witch, and many other movies that cost less than $ 100,000 and are even better. Aaaaargh! I consider myself lucky not to have paid a penny to see this shit, and to sit to the end is one of the most heroic things I've done this year. It is not surprising that the writers of this pile of excrement have already held positions as cameraman and title designer ...
