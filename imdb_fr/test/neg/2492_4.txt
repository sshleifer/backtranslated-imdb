There are many other comments here about the poverty of this movie. What I wanted to emphasize is how this film took the biggest science project in history and made it smaller. The Manhattan project has been an incredible and huge achievement. Virtually all the money in the country has gone into making electromagnetic separator wire. If there was a choice between two different ways of doing things, they just did both. The first powered nuclear reactor was set up under the bleachers of the University of Chicago football stadium with graduate students using axes as a scam mechanism. It's a fascinating story involving hundreds of places and thousands of people that this film seems to reduce to a small group of eccentrics in New Mexico. <br /> <br /> The other thing that really displeased me was the moral debate should continue the project after the surrender of Germany. Okay, we have thousands (mostly) of men who have worked for years to make a real boom. Does anyone think they did not want to see it work? There was some controversy at the time about using this device, but it was not so serious, it's clearly not the huge debate that this movie claims to be.
