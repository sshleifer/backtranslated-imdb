Let's face it, it's a very bad movie.However, if you're ready to make fun of him, you can survive the experience.Okay, you're going to scream a lot in agony.Jungle Fun African way of play. <Tom Conway (who spends most of the film wearing a funky hat) uses the wizard and the crazy science of the place to create a "perfect" being. He looks like a drunk varmint who has been drunk for six weeks and is wearing A bag dress is ugly, it's nice. But it does not kill him because he uses a good girl as a subject. He needs a naughty girl. <br /> <br /> Marla English and Lance Fuller are two little crooks looking for African gold. The acting lessons for Mrs. English should have been at the top of the search list. She's a bad girl and she lets everyone know it in a performance worthy of a college game. Mike "Touch" Connors is the English & Fuller White Guide who knows how to lead the expedition. <br /> <br /> English & Conway finally meet and it's a match made in hell.She is the perfect subject of Ecome her voodoo creature because she will do everything in her power to get what 'she wants. You will do everything to stop the agony of this movie at this point. <br /> <br /> What made this movie interesting for me was Conway wearing a funky hat / hat / floral piece! We were still trying to figure out what kind of dead animal he was. He thought that if he lowered it low enough on his eyes, nobody would recognize him. <br /> <br /> Really bad cinema.
