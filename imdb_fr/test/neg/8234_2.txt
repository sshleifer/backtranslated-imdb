I consider myself a big fan of low budget horror movies. The more weird and imaginative the film, the more blood and guts it gets, the better, and I really fall in love with inexpensive movies, if they are well done. Luther starts pretty well ... his circus background, a scary run in a supermarket, the attack of an old lady and his troubling occupation of a woman's farm created the mood. A hot sex / shower scene ensues when the woman's daughter and her boyfriend arrive home. When Luther steals the boyfriend on a motorcycle, the film runs at worst. <br /> <br /> The characters have many opportunities to: A) save their loved ones, B) to call the police, C) to escape, or (more importantly) D) KILL LUTHER !! ! I do not feel empathy or fear for characters too stupid to help themselves. Characters love to try their luck with guns and knives in the absence of Luther. A police officer finally arrives and is just as ineffective in arresting Luther, even though, at one point, he has a well-directed rifle on Luther while Luther crackles and makes his restitution of the Polish chicken dance. I found myself unnecessarily directing my television: "Make sure he's dead!", "He's gone, get out of here!" Or "Kill him already!" <br /> <br /> Luther is a bloodthirsty savage, but he is hardly Hannibal Lecter. If you can not go wrong, you deserve what happens to you. Halfway through the film, you will be so lethargic about the fate of idiots that only a morbid curiosity will allow you to last until the end slightly fun. This movie was rated as one of the 101 greatest Fangoria movies you've ever seen ... well, Fangoria is half-fair in the case of Luther the geek.
