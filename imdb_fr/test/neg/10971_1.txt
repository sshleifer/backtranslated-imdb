This film takes a lot of liberties with known historical facts. Even small things like Flynn licking one shot after another, when he almost certainly used a damp sponge, is one of the boring things. Flynn has never been prosecuted for murder or murder. He is not known to have surprised his mother having sex with another man, nor for having a homosexual relationship with anyone, and he did not end up in Sydney. He did not get his $ 2 billion role in In the Wake of the Bounty by imposture and that role did not turn him into a well-dressed movie star. <br /> <br /> This is just a mediocre film where the name of Errol Flynn has been added, just to sell more tickets and more videos.
