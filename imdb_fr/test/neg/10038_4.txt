I wanted to love this movie. I really, really did. I was so excited when I saw the preview, which scared me. But when I saw the movie, I was disappointed. The acting is overheated and comedy attempts are displaced and forced. And I'm sorry, but a boy chased by shit in a bowl is not funny or scary, it's just stupid. I grew up in the legend of the witch Bell, so I know a little bit about it. Many facts in the film are accurate, but this film should have been much better. The birthday party scene, for example, lasts about fifteen minutes, adds nothing to plot or story and should have been left in the editing room. A more severe editor might have been able to get a movie worthy of this mess. <br /> <br /> Please understand, I'm in no way involved in the other Bell Witch movie, and I'm not trying to "attack" this IMDb list. I'm just saying that.
