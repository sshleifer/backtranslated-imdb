The only positive thing that I can think about this absolute junk is that now, I finally have a good answer ready if someone asked me what was the worst movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> It would have taken so little effort to make it more observable ... much more effort and it could have been brilliant even. <br /> <br /> Why would someone want to produce such waste? <br /> <br /> I refuse to believe that a director can be ridiculously talentless. <br /> <br /> Making a movie completely intolerable must have been the goal. <br /> <br /> Any other solution does not make sense.
