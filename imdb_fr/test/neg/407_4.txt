In a way, you must respect Arachnia. This is clearly a tribute to the big movies of the 50s, and even if the special effects are terrible. at least, the movie does not show CGI. However, on the other hand; you can not respect the film too much because it's a pile of garbage. The acting is terrible, the special effects (as mentioned) are impossible to take seriously, and once you've seen a giant spider explode; you've seen them all, so it's getting boring. The plot follows a group of people who are unlucky enough to be in a plane crash after a meteor shower. They go to the only house in the area; which happens to be a house where a man has a huge spider he used as a circus attraction. Coincidentally, at about the same time, meteorite rain caused more and more giant spiders to emerge. All the characters in this film are poor cartoons; none of them have anything that looks like a third dimension and they will soon start boring you thoroughly. You must be sensitive to director Brett Piper because he obviously did not have much to do with this film; but that does not make Arachnia worthy of interest, and all in all, there are better movies on giant insects than these, and so Arachnia does not receive the seal of my approval.
