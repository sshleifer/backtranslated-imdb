After a blizzard, the roads are blocked and highway policeman Jason (Adam Beach) goes to the restaurant of his friend Fritz (Jurgen Prochnow) and informs his customers that they will be able to follow their movements the next day. Among the strange strangers, Jason meets his former friend Nancy (Rose McGowan), who has just left her husband in Los Angeles. Throughout the night, without any communication with his base, Jason faces agonizing and suspicious situations with clients and finds dead bodies, which indicates that there is a murderer. <br /> <br /> "The last stop" could be an average thriller, but the scenario is just awful. Most of the characters are despicable people and the motives of the surprising serial killer are never revealed, and viewers have no other explanation as to why the killer decided to kill the guests. My vote is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Encurralados" ("trapped")
