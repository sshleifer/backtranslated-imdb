I saw this film on videotape with my younger brother a long time ago, despite the fact that I was a hearing-impaired boy. At the time, I did not have the closed caption decoder (it was 1986, the year of The Transformers: The Movie), but I could follow the plot and understand what was going on. It's not my fault that I saw the animated film for girls. My father rented the video to show to my other younger sister. <br /> <br /> Ten years later, I rented the video (50 cents) to watch it again with closed captioning turned on. My memories of this movie have been completely destroyed by none other than a written script. I've seen a lot of badly-written movies (like COOL AS ICE and JASON GOES IN BELL: THE FINDAY FRIDAY), but I've never seen (nor heard) the dialogs as bad, only flooded with enough inanity for you make your head spin. in hysteria and screaming for the pain of enduring the sitting torture through this movie. Despite a good plot and intriguing plot concepts, the scenario must be ONE OF THE WORST SCREEN, NEVER WRITTEN, WITHOUT ANY! The incompetent Howard R. Cohen should never work as a screenwriter, professional or otherwise. I can not believe they would even allow the awful scenario to produce a movie like this in the first place. Did Japanese producers read the script, broken or translated English before knowing what they were? Even shit like G.I. Joe The Movie and My Little Pony Movie have reductive values ​​compared to this abomination. <br /> <br /> If you are a big fan of the 80's or you have just made a nostalgic trip, BEWARE OF RAINBOW BRITE AND THE STAR STEALER! It does not matter if you are thrilled or traumatized by the badly organized film with an atrociously written script, or you have not seen the film, STAY WITH THIS FILM. The film should be viewed with care to learn NOT to write a bad script!
