My fuzzy childhood memories have kept the echo of Belphégor's cult series in the 60s in France ... So I was impatient to see the adaptation on the big screen. I should have kept my money and gone to the Louvre. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​the scenario is still very relevant and interesting (the ghost of the Louvre) but the adaptation is ridiculous. The dialogues constantly hesitate between French irony and the serious "American business", without success neither, but not without false note. ?). <br /> <br /> What's left of all this? Not much except some good shots of Paris ... which is rarely a disappointment. <br /> <br /> Belphegor was worth more than that. <br /> <br />
