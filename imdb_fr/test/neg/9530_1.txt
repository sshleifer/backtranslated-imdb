The critic in Variety said it was "overwritten and too long", and I tend to agree with that. Some events seem forced and improbable, for example, when Cal (Crudup, again, as a "lost, vacant and rather boring" man) and Julianne Moore find a map of the United States in an incredible place. The story is one of those 1970s stories "the guy must find meaning in his life", and I found myself imagining Jack Nicholson playing his lead role in the lead role of Cal. The whole theme "Take the road to find meaning in life" is always interesting. Does all this really bring back to the family? I was not so sure. The acting is ok, I especially like Karen Allen and James LeGross, who unfortunately have only supporting roles. I would give him a "five".
