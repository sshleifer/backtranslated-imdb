Strangers with old-fashioned sweets in all the bad context, the situations are just not funny with nerdy voices and bad brow comedy timing, the obvious attempt of dry / black / black humor is obvious and it does not take into account of all the joke elements. <br /> <br /> With a high squeak factor and a low laugh ratio, I was shocked by the show that spent the first season, I personally like Scrubs, The Office, 30 Rock, Trailer Park Boys, Pulling, Peep Show, Simpsons, Family Guy and I know what you're thinking, these shows are not at all strange, so some other good shows I've seen are Jam, Garth Marenghi's Darkplace, The Book Group, Asylum and Snuff Box, which are original with dry / black humor / black / satire and are all at least 5/10. <br /> <br /> Garth Marenghi's DarkPlace is particularly cheap, hyperactive and weird, but the context has been thought through and is making it truly entertaining too.
