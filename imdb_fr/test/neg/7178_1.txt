Yes. It takes a Norwegian to ruin and slaughter two big books and a concept that would work well in a film - this film is really the worst Swedish film of all time. I hated him so much that I even considered walking on it, which I never did. But it was so horrible that I was almost convincing. I had to sit to the end. Just like some Stallone action movies from the early '80s, this one REALLY brings Swedish action back to the Stone Age. It's so much fun, so full of logical errors and stupid mistakes - but that could never see anything good in this terrible acting game, Mark Hamill surviving in a minefield or in silly action, useless and irrational? <br /> <br /> Let me ask you: are the clocks not finished, the hero quickly escaping and two friends become enemies who meet at the end? STUPID !!!! <br /> <br /> And one more thing: the product placement in this movie is amazing. While other countries have realized that this should not be so obvious, the Swedish film industry has apparently not understood anything: look at the credit card used by Hamilton to open a window? Or or or .... this movie makes me really crazy.
