I was out of town to visit an old friend. After dinner, he expressed reservations about his daughter's boyfriend. She is 15 years old, she is beautiful, intelligent, sporty and the young man is also from an excellent family, kind and sporty (if not so smart). I told him that he may be feeling normal paternal concerns; However, a few minutes later, the young man arrived with his DVD of this movie that he was apparently eager to share with others. <br /> <br /> These people have a real home theater, with a screen of more than 4 feet, and the two young people have preceded to watch him, while the young swain started to boast of his virtues almost image by image. <br /> <br /> I've seen enough in a few moments (and with some fascination in its horror) to approve all the most critical comments I've seen by scanning here. <br /> <br /> I told my friend that I would not go so far as to disqualify the young contender just because he liked this album - but that certainly seems to justify his careful watching. <br /> <br /> Some movies are so bad, they are good: the classic "Plan 9 from Outer Space;" and, in my opinion, the very awful Bruce Jenner / Village People works: "I can not stop the music." <br /> <br /> However, it remains firmly in the category of terrible. <br /> Second / third / fourth "bananas" - even the best of them (Tim Conway, Don Knotts, all of whom have Seinfeld) have a lot of trouble making a series later (or, like here, a movie). And they were excellent support characters in their original situations. <br /> <br /> The character "Eddie", about at the level of the 5th or 6th bananas in Griswald's previous films, has never added much, in my opinion. Randy Quaid is a capable actor who has performed well. His contribution to the previous photo "Vacation" was at best average. He and the other cast members, many of whom have done a good job in the past, have done nothing for their efforts here, other than getting a few years of house payments or IRA contributions. <br /> <br /> This entire presentation --- story, performance (from lead to support) could not be worse.
