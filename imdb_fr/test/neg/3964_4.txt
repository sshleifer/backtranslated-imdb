Beloved story of the hero "Benji" ("Higgins" the dog) that represents many different things for different people. During his busy day, "Benji" takes breakfast in the home of two young children, chats with an officer, chases an old lady's cat and reminds an elderly coffee owner to start special of the day. Help to some, fun to others, he accompanies all. <br /> <br /> Problems arise when his young friends are kidnapped and taken to the abandoned mansion he calls home. From now on, we know that only "Benji" can save the situation. <br /> <br /> The plot is a routine of writer / producer / director Joe Camp, and he tends to forget the effects of slow motion. The public will find it hard to resist this adorable little dog and children of all ages will surely love it. The actors will never have anything to do with the background of "Benji". <br /> <br /> This is not what you call an inspiration, but a fun family kitchen. Oscar winner for the theme "Benji", "I feel love". <br /> <br /> Saturday, July 13, 1996 - Video
