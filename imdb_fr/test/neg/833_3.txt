This is a classic example of what happens when a sit com is on television for far too long. Everything is tired and the jokes begin to be repeated again and again. OK, from the beginning, the first two series were pretty good. Her deputy was played by Ruth Madoc, a housekeeper who wanted to become a yellow cloak, an alcoholic man who hated children, Punch and Judy, a bent Jockey and a comedian. As said earlier, it started well but went on too long. Once Simon Cadel left the situation, the situation deteriorated quickly, you had a terrible story and a new entertainment manager to whom Ruth Madoc (once again) launched. When a comedy is filmed in the same place, there is a limit to the number of jokes that can be cracked. Unfortunately, it lasted so long that each joke was repeated 3 or 4 times. If this comedy had been stopped after 2 series, it would have been considered as a classic of all time. In this case, we will remember much of these terrible last series.
