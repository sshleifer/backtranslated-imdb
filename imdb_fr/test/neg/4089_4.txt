Well, I watched this movie waiting for me to roll down the aisles ... how wrong I was. At best, the film was rather amusing and rather irritating (zany comedy style of building an ark with archaic tools, laughing ... no, I did not do it). I am very disappointed because Steve Carrel was in the lead. I looked religiously at the US office, pissed me off, I thought the 40 year old maid was good ... but Evan 'us, why did he accept this scenario? And, as for Morgan Freeman, he's old enough to know more. <br /> <br /> The idea seemed reasonable, the actors I trusted, but the execution was not something to write and in the end, well, it seemed like they ran out of money or ideas. For me, it was one of the most artificial endings I could have imagined. They took a Bible story and reduced it to an edifying account of localized environmental problems, not even global, but on a local bill - yawning! <br /> <br /> In summary, a reasonable beginning, gradually became me, everything was swept by the time the credit was transferred.
