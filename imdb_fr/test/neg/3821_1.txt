I read the recent reviews and was looking forward to seeing the movie. However, after spending 80 minutes of predictable "surprises" that did not even startle me and an unrealistic villain, I was extremely disappointed. I thought cartoons were the only movies that were still 80 minutes long. I thought maybe it was because of the changes made to make it "R", but the original only contained an extra ten minutes of "Kill Bill" blood. When blood spurts like a pipe, reality loses its appeal. Add to that the killer who is supposed to be a "ghost" but who can snatch someone who escapes the jaw (ala King Kong with the T-Rex), lives everything and has a similar end to that of the final sopranos and it is quite possible that you have the most over-shot movie in the last year. After watching the movie, I felt like I had seen countless movies with the same plot and method and felt largely unsatisfied. I do not know what everyone has seen, but if you want a good horror movie this weekend, go see Halloween, it's really worth it to pay 10 dollars. Regarding Hatchet, let's hope that the next IS will be based on the book.
