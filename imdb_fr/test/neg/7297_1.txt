Looking for a movie for your film festival in Turkey? THE ROLLER BLADE SEVEN is on my list of the ten worst movies of all time. The plot, which tells the story of a post-apocalyptic rollerblade samurai warrior, is a complicated mishmash of cinematic references ranging from STAR WARS to THE SEVEN SAMAURI. The actors play goes from soft to abysmal. The scene where the villain tempts the old master is embarrassing enough to make fun of laughter. Frank Stalone's Black Knight is reminiscent of John Cleese's Black Knight in MONTY PYTHON and THE HOLY GRAIL. (Tips: Frank: your career is over.) You were lucky enough to stumble upon that little stink bomb on a low-end cable channel and I could not stop looking. It's like watching a train crash, you can not look away.
