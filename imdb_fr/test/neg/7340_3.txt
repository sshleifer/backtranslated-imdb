I lived in Barstow, California. in 1968, when The Killers Three came to the local theater. The trailer was enough to make me pay the hard-earned money to watch this movie. I was really expecting a Bonnie And Clyde film and I had Dick Clark played by a timid and shy man while Robert Walker and Diane Varsi played a bad attempt to reactivate Bonnie and Clyde. Needless to say, it never went well. Maybe that's why the video was never taken. Even when I was a kid, I had some debris left as I left the theater. After all the best parts were in the movie trailer. The film was dull and almost useless. By the way, Dick Clark is killed, so it's not totally disappointing.
