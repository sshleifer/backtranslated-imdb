When a film claims fame, it's because Martin Sheen's youngest and lesser-known brother plays there, you know it will not be really good. "Soultaker" is a stupid, low-budget movie about a group of 20-year-olds being chased by an angel of death. It's a silly movie, but it's rather entertaining, and even slightly idyllic for its stupidity. <br /> <br /> The plot in the movie is very small and it stretches as far as possible. Joe Estevez is not really an actor. Fortunately for the public, he has very few aftershocks and his role is mainly to walk. This film really feels like a horror / fantasy franchise, as it has the same staging as a slasher. 4 characters, each dies one at a time ... will there be any? Who really cares. Although it sounds like hate, I did not do it. I just did not like that, but it interested me a lot, so I guess it counts for something. <br /> <br /> My note: * 1/2 on ****. 90 minutes PG-13 for language, violence and nudity.
