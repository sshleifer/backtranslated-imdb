I saw this movie when it was released for the first time in 1986. At the time, I was young and I liked all the normal comedy available, that is to say. Monty Python, Jim Belushi and SNL, Steve Martin, Cheech and Chong, so I believe that my judgment represents the most "healthy" individuals. <br /> <br /> The absolute best part of this movie was the movie trailer at the beginning of the movie for the new movie "My Little Pony" coming out. <br /> <br /> This film was so atrocious that it was removed from most theaters before the end of the first week. <br /> <br /> I am surprised that anyone wastes business money to duplicate this pile of human waste. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time and money renting or watching this "movie".
