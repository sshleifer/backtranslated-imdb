Island of Death is not really a good movie, in every way, but it's a curious movie. Imagine if Natural Born Killers was made 20 years too early, as a Eurotrash Greek porn movie. That's what you get here: the picturesque story of a young British couple, sociopath, cutting a deadly arm across the population of a pretty little Greek island. <br /> <br /> I spare you a detailed analysis of the plot; it does not really matter if it is to set up scenes of sex more and more perverse or violent, followed by murders of a disturbing brutality, often photographed with love for posterity by our charming young couple. It could have been great, in its sick and nasty way, but instead ... <br /> <br /> Instead, I found myself anxiously checking the run time and index of chapters to see how long the parade would last last. A slow rhythm and a dull and bland game act the vilest perverts even in pablum, and connect the scenes in an eternity of dull toil. Well. You can not win them all.
