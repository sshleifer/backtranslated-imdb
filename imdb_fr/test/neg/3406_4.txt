Let me start by saying that I have lived all my life in Louisville, Kentucky. I grew up about Â½ mile from Waverly. In winter we sleighed our sleds along Maryman Road and crossed the Dixie Highway to sledge at Waverly Hill. Several times during the winter of 76-77, we went up in the tunnel to warm ourselves up. The place was still managed as a "geriatric center" at the time. We went to the end of the tunnel at the top of the hill to hit what we thought was the "door of the morgue". I must be honest. The only feeling we felt was that we were leaving with something we should not do. I must say that we have borrowed this tunnel more than 50 times this winter. Nothing strange that teenage boys acting stupidly never happened. I like the fact that it catches the eye after all these years. One night when I was young, we looked out our porch and it appeared that the whole hill was on fire. There was an old hospital on the hill that burned. He burned for hours while the whole neighborhood was sitting outside and watching. What is lost with Waverly is that many people have survived TB. Let's face it. At the time, doctors did everything they thought was right to save people. It took a lot of courage for people to work there, knowing how infectious TB was. Too much is focused on those who have suffered. I also traveled to the building several times in the early 1970s. We were going to visit the closed cells of the retirement home through a group of young people from the church. By the way, the doors were not in prison like steel doors with chains and padlocks as shown in the movie. They were wooden and open - sometimes too open. It smelled like urine and feces and you sometimes saw the open smock associated with dementia patients. It was true that the state closed it in the early 1980s. This may be due in large part to the age of the building or the type that was not paid. It's after all Kentucky. The part of the documentary that upset me the most was stacking corpses in a cart. If I'm not mistaken, there seems to have been pictures of the Holocaust. This has been added for a dramatic effect. This left me with a bitter taste in the mouth for the filmmaker. I am skeptical when it comes to "Ghosts". I think a lot of people here really think this place is haunted. Waverly for me however symbolized a fun adventure place for a boy with a sled.
