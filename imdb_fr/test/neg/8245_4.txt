I dig my head, but I can not think of another film quite like The Valley of the Gwangi. A western with dinosaurs? What could be more natural? You have to wonder why John Ford and / or John Wayne have never tried! <br /> <br /> The plot ?? TJ Breckenridge (Gila Golan), Tuck Kirby (James Franciscus) and the rest of the actors / characters enter a strange valley lost in search of a mythical miniature horse for his circus. They find there not only the miniature horse, but also other more formidable creatures. Dinosaurs dominate this place. Would not it be an attraction at TJ's circus? a cage T-Rex? <br /> <br /> It's not that I think the Gwangi Valley is a bad movie, I do not seem to have enjoyed it as much as many others who have posted comments on the film. In fact, there are places that I find almost unassailable. For the first half of the movie, there does not seem to be much to do. I was not necessarily bored, but I wanted something to happen. Plodding would be an adjective that I would use. To top it off, the film presents a very complex love story. One feels forced as if the writers had decided that the main roles male and female had to be reunited. But the Gwangi Valley is not a total waste. There are times that I really appreciated. Who does not like the scenes of cowboys on horseback trying to throw a T-Rex to the lasso? You just do not see that kind of thing every day. The creatures of Ray Harryhausen are impressive. There are really interesting clich√©s of Harryhausen miniatures interacting with people and horses. It may not be the best of his job, but the effects are very nice. Yet, at least in my mind, these good times are not enough to overcome the disadvantages. As much as I hate to do it, I have to rate the Gwangi Valley a 4/10.
