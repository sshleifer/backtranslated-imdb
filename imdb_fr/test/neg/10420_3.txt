I'm pretty sure Poe would have considered this a travesty. The first two stories are correct, nothing spectacular. And then there is Toby Dammit. What did Fellini think? It's a boring, random, disjointed piece with little recommendation. One should be frustrated by the lack of background or conclusion, but the relief is over.
