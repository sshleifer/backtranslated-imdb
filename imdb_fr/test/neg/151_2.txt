This movie just did not do it for me. I love horror movies and splashing, but this one has very little to do with horror. The effects are cheap and when they cut one of his feet, he looks so fake. The same goes for other effects such as tongue torture and intestinal sex. They could have spent a few extra dollars for the effects. <br /> <br /> With a lot of sex (with pixilation as in all Japanese movies), this is just a sick fetish porn and there seems to be a market for sick things. like that. Although more bloody, it corresponds to me for titles like Squirmfest / Purge and the Genki series. These movies show girls who eat and play with all the liquids in your body, eat insects and fish roughly and sleep with all sorts of strange animals, like toads, eels and ... A glance at the covers will tell you horror fans to look elsewhere. No horror here, just disgusting and degrading sex scenes. <br /> <br /> Horror fans should avoid this and prefer to take a look at Guinea Pig2: Flesh and Blood Flowers or even August Underground Mordum. Even if they are not great, they offer at least one horror experience and Niku Daruma absolutely fails in this department.
