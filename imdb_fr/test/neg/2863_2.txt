I bought this movie hoping it would be another great killer movie. I'm a big fan of the Child's Play series and I was hoping to see the same thing here. Boy, I was wrong. Most of the film was not at all scary, and the only time we really see Pinocchio "alive" is the last scene of the movie. The little girl in the movie, her acting is so serious that it's almost laughable. Moreover, the end never shows what happened to the puppet or what pushed them to place the girl in an asylum or wherever she was at the end of the film. So, in my opinion, this movie is the worst of the kind "killer toy". If you want a good set of killer toys, stay true to the Child's Play franchise. Pinocchio's revenge is a waste of time and money.
