It turns out that IVAN THE TERRIBLE, PARTS I and II, were both featured in Harry Medved's 50 Worst Movies. Now, I really think that claiming to be one of the worst movies of all time is an exaggeration, even though they are still very bad movies - especially the first one, because it had more "wide-eyed "and" googly eyes "that I have never seen before !! Director Eisenstein and many others think the film is "artistic and profound" - and as I'm legally sane, I must say that I hated this first film !! The second, although it still has a very incomplete aspect, represents a considerable improvement, because it is minimal, but too long and boring scenes are present in this film, just as in the first part! Although Part 2 seems quite incomplete and requires at least an hour more (especially since it never leads to Ivan's insane behavior later in life - like killing his son and heir while 'he was angry). Since Stalin commanded both parties 1 and 2 to excuse and glorify his own murderous reign, it is not surprising that Ivan's life remained very incomplete. Even without all the really horrible behaviors of Ivan, apparently, the very nasty Stalin STILL did not like the film and would not allow it to be released during his lifetime. Maybe he did not allow it because he was more worried that people would not see the huge waste of money and film resources instead of seeing Stalin like crazy, like Ivan! <br /> <br /> By the way, there was a segment of this tedious movie that was so cool that the film deserves a 4 (without it, a 2) - and that's the scene with Prince Vladimir at the banquet ! It's well done and quite funny in a dark way. And the scene was performed in a Russian version of Technicolor 2 colors. It's VERY strange, by the way, because in the mid-1930s, Technicolor had developed a truly improved color process that no longer gave it its orange and greenish-blue appearance. This film, during the color sequences, looks so much like a silent or old color film. Very strange indeed for the 1940s.
