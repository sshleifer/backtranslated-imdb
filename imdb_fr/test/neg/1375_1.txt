Carlos wants to make fun of positive action, racial stereotypes and related topics in his show, which makes him a bit like Judge Thomas of the Supreme Court. There is BECAUSE of his race and then denigrates her. He can supposedly make fun of the Mexicans because he is himself a Mexican, and I would also say that he can make fun of the mental challenge, because any layman can say that he is not the smartest tool ... although it is certainly a tool of some kind. <br /> <br /> This is a comedian who, even with a group of writers, can only muster 3 minutes of really fun content in a 30 minute show. I can not think of a single comedian who regularly plays on television and Carlos can hold a candle, with the possible exception of Larry the Cable Guy (not surprisingly, he also has a show on Comedy Central which address without doubt to the same audience. <br /> <br /> If you ever see the big names, Jerry Seinfeld, Chris Rock, Jon Stewart, etc., talk about comedy, you will really have an idea of ​​the work and the necessary reflection to develop a funny and comical funny voice.This work has been completely ignored by Mencia: his comic voice is partly stolen from other comics and partly hidden by his propensity to shout his racist guts The Mencia show is loved by some of the 'sucks not bad this crowd' which I strongly believe to watch him feel better about his speeches about the assaults of society, unfortunately Carlos and his fans are part of the Oblate not the solution on this subject.
