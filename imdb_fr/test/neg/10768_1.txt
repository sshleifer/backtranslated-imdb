The writers of this mini-series should have been sentenced to the guillotine themselves. They slaughtered a very entertaining story and squandered the talents of Richard E. Grant. The only thing the writers kept in the original books was the name. All the characters have been totally changed and the story has not been the same. I strongly suggest to watch another version of the Pimpernel Scarlet. Any other version is better than this one.
