Of course, all this nonsense raises the question: is such a self-referential genre that teen comedy really needs another parody? The lugubrious 'Scary Movie' (I and II) pushed the formula about as far as possible - 'Not another teen movie' really has nothing clever or excessively excessive to add. <br /> <br /> The plot, essentially based on the teenager "She's All That", is somewhere between parody and tribute ("John Hughes High School"). Everything from "American Beauty" to "Varsity Blues" is used for reference purposes. The result is ultimately an unsatisfactory viewer experience. The disadvantage of giving us a carbon copy of "She's All That" is that we all know where it is going. And if we did not do it, the jokes would make no sense. <br /> <br /> There is not much to recommend here. The macabre scene (a toilet erupting) seems well displaced here among all the references to "well-being". There are moments of humor - the song is quite funny and the good news is to send the audience. It stinks, do not look at it.
