The first review I saw of this on IMDB indicates that Vince Vaughn is a much better actor than Anthony Perkins in this role. I wonder if he saw the original. It is difficult to review Psycho if you do not have the perspective of the revolutionary nature of the film in 1960. You have a heroine who is not very friendly and who is killed not far in the film and a villain who is scary but that makes you crazy. feel for him. Add to that graphic violence and you have a blue imprint for some of the 80s and 90s slasher movies. <br /> <br /> Where did this movie fail? Let's start with the casting. Anne Heche is good like Vivian Crane, but as Norman Bates, Vince Vaughn has it all wrong. On the one hand, he looks far too young. Second, he has no idea how to play the role. His nervous laugh makes me think of Ron Howard trying to play a tough guy at Happy Days. All he's doing is screaming, I did it! The original movie, even for those who know everything about it, still makes you uncomfortable with the mother's influence on Norman and turns her into a real separate character. How about the shower scene. When I finally saw the 1960 film on the big screen, I was surprised to see its ability to scare me. Bernard Herrman's score becomes incredibly high-pitched and noisy and goes further than Danny Elfman's synthesizer interpretations during the scene. This shower scene is simply to show us Anne Heche's naked body and beautiful bloody colors. Which brings us to the choice of filming in color. It did not work. <br /> <br /> There is something in the redesign of classic movies that seems to barely work. Some may consider this a noble experience, but honestly, if Gus Van Sant had nothing to add to this film, he should have left it alone.
