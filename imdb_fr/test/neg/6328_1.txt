I caught this movie on TV late at night. Honestly, I saw most of it and all the time I was sitting in a state of total disbelief. <br /> <br /> Is there a kind of movie more useless than soft-core porn? If there is I do not want to know about it. Softcore porn combines all the horrors of porn (lousy production values, abominable game, shitty scripts) with the timidity of sex scenes in ordinary movies. So, the end result is exciting and entertaining. This film also has the rather strange approach of a sci-fi setting, and it works horribly. All sexual intercourse takes place in a kind of virtual reality where the crew of the future discovers physical love. And yes, it's about as confusing and ridiculous as it sounds. <br /> <br /> But there must be positive points, right? Well, there's one ... Krista Allen is incredibly sexy. That's pretty much the only thing that was not good in this movie. I do not know what it is, but she has incredible sex appeal. However, the rest of the distribution resembles the standard distribution. Women rather unattractive with fake breasts badly done and men who have spent far too much time in the gym to be grotesque. Probably a gym in Germany judging by haircuts and clothes. <br /> <br /> In summary. If you like Krista Allens' presence on screen, watch her during the brief moments when she shows some of her seductive potential (she tries most of the time to articulate lines of poor dialogue). If you do not like Krista Allen, do not let go. <br /> <br /> I rate 10/10 for the sex appeal of Krista Allens, 1/10 for the rest and 2/10 for the entertainment. Since this is a unique science fiction / science fiction hybrid that does not really look like what I've ever seen.
