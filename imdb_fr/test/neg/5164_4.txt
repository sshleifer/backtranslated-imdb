I saw this film today on the big screen and honestly, I can not believe some of the comments made by people here. I really hoped to be touched by this film, but I was not. <br /> <br /> I am a member of the Australian army and very patriotic towards this great country, but I feel that this film does not do us justice and those soldiers who fought in this battle. <br /> <br /> The film is badly filmed. I thought the acting was horrible, they were not credible and they gave me no reason to be interested in them. People say that this movie was graphic, there were some graphic scenes but I found most very weak. The war scenes were very short and only lasted a few minutes. <br /> <br /> Overall, this film is weak and does not do justice to these soldiers.
