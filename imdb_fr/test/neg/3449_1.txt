I'm glad I never watched this show when it was released. <br /> <br /> I just wondered why it had lasted four years. It reminds me of the terrible 80's with fake people, fake clothes and fake music. How did I survive growing up at this time? <br /> <br /> The actors in the majority of the episodes I watched are forced. This makes shows very boring. The lines of the plot are not very interesting as shown in the old Twilight zone. The old show inspired the imagination and aroused the expectation of the next show. <br /> <br /> Stay with the old Twilight Zone shows and do not miss the trash.
