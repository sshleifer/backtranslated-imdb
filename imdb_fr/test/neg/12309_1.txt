I saw bad things in my time. A half-dead cow trying to get out of the mud; a frontal collision between two cars; a thousand plates smashing on the floor of a kitchen; human beings living like animals. <br /> <br /> But never in my life have I seen anything as bad as The cat in the hat. <br /> <br /> This film is worse than 911, worse than Hitler, worse than Vllad the Impaler, worse than those who put kittens in the microwave. <br /> <br /> It's the most disturbing movie of all time, easy. <br /> <br /> I thought it was a joke, an elaborate joke, and Mike Myers may have been a drug junkie snorting cocaine and losing a bet or something . <br /> <br /> I shudder
