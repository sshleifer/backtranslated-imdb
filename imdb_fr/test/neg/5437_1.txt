Let's see: there is a civil war, a lost city, a talking gorilla, regular gorillas, a previously unknown species of killer albino gorilla, the most powerful laser ever known, a lot of diamonds lying in the sand bottom, attack hippopotamuses, an active volcano and a hot air balloon packed in a suitcase in a plane shot down. It's not too much, is it? I had more consistent fever dreams ("... and then the Romanian picked up a pack of diamonds, because it was a lost city he was looking for or something, but then the bad gorillas that we had seen before The gorilla who was talking was back in the regular gorillas and, while a kind of earthquake or volcano began, the industrial woman / doctor built a laser gun and that big diamond that she had just been found in the hand of his dead fianc√© ...

It's an explosion if you're looking for more ammo to counter the pernicious influence of Michael Crichton in American entertainment (and therefore global entertainment), and if you keep in mind how cynical and unprincipled this attempt is failed at the box office. Unfortunately, officials - Crichton, screenwriter John Patrick Shanley, director Frank Marshall - have probably never lost a dime. Shame on them, and I really think so. 1/10
