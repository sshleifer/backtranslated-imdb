This movie just does not have redemptive functionality. The story is incomprehensible and the scenario is rude, sadistic and stupid. Sex scenes are a joke, as is the inevitable car chase. The music is awful. The acting is mainly limited to grunting and smiling. A half-star missed. Too bad for DirecTV to have it on pay-per-view. In a theater, people might have soda on the screen.
