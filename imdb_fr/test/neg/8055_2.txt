This movie has too many things going on. Another critic comments on the episodic and disjointed nature of the film that reflects the director's memories - that's good, if that's how it was written and interpreted. Instead, what we get is a simple story - part of the time - that jumps to the feet, lets us hang in some cases, interrupts the flow with unnecessary digressions in other cases, and just does not work other. <br /> <br /> Some details of the plot just do not work. For example, why drag a body on an urban beach in broad daylight, as opposed to the night? Why leave your sheet flat on the body? Why would an artist who knew Joe's character for a brief moment decide to leave everything to him (even if it was not a lot)? This sub-plot has been poorly developed for this point to work. Besides, why is even the man an invalid or an artist other than to provide money and free nude posing scenes? He might as well have been a photographer or an opera composer? Besides, how to evaluate an apartment in an opera - especially without a clear link with opera? Coincidences are also both too obvious and unclear and unexplained. Why guys take everything in the warehouse and "disappear". If Tim were a 10-year-old schoolmate in a town as small as Bangor, how could Joe lose track of him for 8 years, especially if they knew each other well enough to recommend each other. <br /> <br /> Some of the other subplots (like the mother and her friend (s) and sister wanting to escape felt like stuffing, some good ideas may have created a function in full development or to be interesting short films. As it is finished, this film makes little sense and proposes even less.
