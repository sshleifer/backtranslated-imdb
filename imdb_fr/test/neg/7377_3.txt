This show has been presented live across the country with a wide variety of casting. I saw it for the first time in Provincetown's production the first summer of P-town (2001) - before it was, oddly enough, banned in this extremely gay hotel (the codes that led to its closure were modified since). I saw him later in long-time production in New York, off Broadway. Curiously, P-town production was much better than New York's - fresher, softer, livelier and more fun - but only at the 2001 projection; subsequent attempts to clone production ("Bare Naked Lads" in 2007) were definitely third-rate. This filmed production presents a production casting of Los Angelos and, as other comments suggest, it is not the best. I would rank it somewhere between the 2001 P-town peak production and last summer's Bare Naked Lads show.
