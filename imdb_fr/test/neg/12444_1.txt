Everyone has already pointed out the obvious fact that the first comments were obviously from people with an interest in the film or from relatives / friends who had an interest in the film, and it does not matter - if I had done a movie, all of my family and friends would be there to compliment him too. In all honesty, there are good things besides the bad things in this movie. Unfortunately, the disadvantages far outweigh the benefits. Well, the plot was rather interesting. The music was overall good. Many of the songs (when we could hear them) were pretty cool. The only musical problems that I encountered were: # 1) the first suspense scene with some kind of quiet instrumental (it really seemed to dispel the suspense), # 2) the song played when the main characters went to a party in full swing air at A friend's house and # 3) the songs that were good were too quiet, especially when a heavy metal song was playing in the background while Danny Trejo was hanging a man (it looked like a rather cool song but she should have ripped the scene when Danny Trejo became fiery). Now let's move on to completely bad things: the script was atrocious. I mean, horrible. I saw a more fluid dialogue in a Star Wars movie. Tips from a part-time editor and a full-time film buff: When writing a dialogue, ask yourself, "Is this something people would actually say?" Honestly, the script was laughable. I want to slam the acting, but with this kind of writing, it's hard to know if they have talent or not. The slightly interesting plot has been seriously hampered by shit dialogue. I know it was a small budget, but words do not cost money - if you have a good story, even semi-skilled players can succeed. This film did not seem to have either, but I hope that the director will have a second shot to make a better film.
