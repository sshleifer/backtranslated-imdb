** on **** stars <br /> <br /> Let's see ... 14 divided by 20, the square root of 13 equals 23, my grandmother's favorite figure and the year of her birth , 23 minutes after the 23rd hour. Assign the number as you see fit and be very scared. Be extremely scared when you throw a deadly riddle at 23, and you have Schumacher's last attempt at a dark suspense festival with The Number 23. Oh yeah, 23 is also my record at Cuervo during my favorite dive on 23rd Street in the 23rd state of the union. <br /> <br /> Carrey carries the film about half way, then we lose it, without worrying too much about it. Do not look for any crazy expression from comedian Carrey, as you've seen in The Mask and Me, Myself and Irene. And do not expect an incarnation of a character like he did with Andy Kaufman. This role is a sad and special devolution for Jimbo. Where is the Riddler when you need him! I know, we do not need him. Virginia Madsen, as usual, is underutilized as a supportive, speculative and special wife. Her talent, like Carrey's, is removed and it's almost painful to watch her try to save her underdeveloped character from anonymity. <br /> <br /> To give the credit you deserve, there are some interesting scenes in The Number 23, which present a very clever cinematography. They stop enough themselves without having to feed in the incoherent story of this idiotic story. <br /> <br /> I do not know you (and I realize it's an absolute fiction) but I do not know anyone who often reads his novel in a dark, dark basement or regularly goes to the cemetery as Carrey does in this movie. Schumacher keeps his film dark and blood red and dark and rainy and foggy and dark and rainy and wet and so on from beginning to end. Even Flatliners and The Lost Boys had a little more daylight, and we're talking about medical students obsessed with death and teen vampires! <br /> <br /> If you want to watch this movie, even if it is out of the question. simple curiosity ... be sure to do it while enjoying 23 cat naps, so you can kill 23 birds with a stone.
