This show lasted most of the 1980s, but the scenes were usually very thin and often painfully disunited. <br /> <br /> Terry Scott and June Whitfield were wasted in this sitcom. They deserved better, but that leaves me with good memories and I found myself smiling at certain repeated scenes. June Whitfield's talent for comedy is allowed to show up occasionally (when she's not a leaf for Terry) and she's really smart. <br /> <br /> The 1980s are the last decade where you will find this kind of The middle class, the middle-aged comedy, and many people fondly remember it, but I prefer to remember the decade devoted to alternative comedy and the scathing satire of Spitting Image.
