It was not a good movie !! Why do you keep saying that? There's a nice little story going on, then sexy girls and BAM vampires !!! Why? Why are there vampires? Where do they come from? Besides, what's this mess ?! There are all these "superhuman" vampires but George Clooney and three other random guys dominate them all. Quick too. It's not like there's a long fight scene with a lot of struggle. There were only three guys in the bar who killed these vampires like a big man kills twinks! The next thing you know, Clooney and the stupid girl are saved by Cheech and leave the homeless homeless in the middle of Mexico. End of the story. Literally. Oh, and the strip club was an Aztec temple, which is fun because it would be southern Mexico and not the border. Why do you lie and say it's a good movie? Do not rent, buy or even watch this movie at a friend's house. You wish you had this time of your life.
