Most of the critics wrote about the film Michalkov in a devastating way, but I wanted him to see it for me. And, unfortunately, they are right. The film had the largest budget in the history of Russian cinema, with two international stars and colorful mass scenes, apparently shot close enough to the Kremlin - but in the end, it seems like a pretty, a pretty nothing. You would not believe this director has already made masterpieces like Urga and Burnt By the Sun. The characters in the script are not convincing, neither Jane, nor McCracken, nor Andrej. Only General Radlov deserves mention. He stays on the surface all the time. Politically, it is for me a glorification of the army, and in particular that of Russia, which has values ​​like honor and duty. And having lived for at least six months in Siberia: My Russia is much more than the one described in the film Michalkovs. Regarding "Burnt By The Sun" by the same director, this film is one of the best I have ever seen in my life. I was totally disappointed with this one. Sorry. Nevertheless, Michalkov's unique talent in producing beautiful images is still there.
