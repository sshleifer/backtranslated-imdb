This film was not so bad as the story, but it's the work with the camera that makes it hard to watch. I just do not like what is called the "realist" camera work that is being done today; you know the guy jumping from the center, panning, and so on. What made me particularly angry about this film is the novelty in which they embarked: they shot some black and white images in each scene. I think the film would have been much better if the camera work had been shot in a much more conventional way, because as I could not focus, I found myself analyzing the camera work. Maybe if more people express their dissatisfaction with camera work like this, the filmmakers will finally understand.
