This movie was horrible, it was a bit like accidentally looking at a gay porn that is waiting for girls, but they just do not come ... I waited almost two hours for damned scarecrows .... they do not come all just not .. Instead, it's just a little cunt who wanders through a dead cornfield with a camera, it's a mixture of Blaire witch and bad episode of the twilight zone. And the best part is that from October 23, 2005, they started shooting a sequel, do not be fooled by the box, even if it looks exactly the same as the first dark harvest, it's not the Lion's Gate who bought the corn rights: the movie and had the brilliant idea to publish it as a result of the original dark harvest, which I found funny, but the only thing they had in common was that 'They had both been shot in a cornfield .... The movie will not scare you like the first so stay away !!!!!
