As their entire career was a pale imitation of The Beatles, it's no surprise that shortly after the Beatles' big fiasco "Magical Mystery Tour", the Monkees embark on their own creative debunking called "Head." The two films are not really a true story with a plot (although MMT has tried to define a plot), because they are a hodgepodge of skits and excerpts, interspersed with music, songs and shots . <br /> <br /> "Head" has no plot, except the pre-fab-four who try to break free from the "box" in which they are (ie the casting of "Monkees" and the mercantilism that surrounds it) and yet still find themselves back in the box. Most sketches involve breaks in the "fourth wall" and continue in other seemingly unrelated scenes. Filled with anti-war messages from Vietnam and the group's attempts to show off their other talents, the film bounces at random - and must also be blamed on multiple directors. <br /> <br /> The film, like the Magical Mystery Tour, is now excused by some fans as "a wonderful symbolism and misunderstood artistic statements". Phooey. Like MMT, there are too many guys who have access to too many drugs that are all trying to make art and shit. <br /> <br /> Like MMT, "Head" has some clever moments and offers relatively unknown Monkees songs that are pretty decent. It develops a little more charm than the MMT and is a little easier to handle, but it's not ironic at all that, like everything the Monkees did, it was just a mimic of something that the Beatles did it first ... even when it comes to laying an egg.
