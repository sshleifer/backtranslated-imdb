I do not understand. I just do not understand. "Barney and Friends" has been criticized by millions of people over the years, and I admit, I was one of those lambasters. All children watching this show do not realize that what they watch is just waste. Barney is very boring and very selfish. Add Baby Bop, and it gets even worse. Add B.J., then you have a very scary TV nightmare. Then you get the kids. They are old enough to know what Barney is trying to teach them! What are they doing in the first place? It would be funny if Barney and his friends appeared on Jerry Springer's show. It would certainly be one of the wildest moments in the history of television! More importantly, this program marked the beginning of the end of public television as we knew it, as we saw fewer and fewer more interesting and interesting public television programs being broadcast. in the 1970s and 1980s. What a big difference that a selfish gunman does. When this show leaves PBS, millions of people will feel relieved, but the annals of the history of television will suffer. A message to Barney himself: you may not realize it, but your days are numbered. <br /> <br /> In summary, there are other choices. Better choices.
