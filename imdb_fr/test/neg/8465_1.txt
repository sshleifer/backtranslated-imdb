Five Fingers relies heavily on the barbaric and shocking tactics of Hollywood to apparently provoke a positive reaction from the cinema. This is where this film fails, mainly because it is too graphic to be taken seriously. I was repulsed and disgusted that Five Fingers was even made, and I had to basically force myself to keep looking at it. The torture itself is horrible. Even sounds from a room where someone is tortured are horrible. But obviously, the makers of this shabby movie felt that was not enough. It had to go well beyond what was necessary and, simply and effectively, ruin any chance that this film has to make a valid argument. For this reason, this film is nothing but gratifying of themselves. Five Fingers is almost confined to the status of B-movie only by its indulgence on the manipulation of time. In other words, we are shown the present and then the past is revealed in excerpts. This is a bit of a twist of normal time manipulation in Hollywood. While the viewer normally appears on page 95 in a 100-page script at the beginning of the film, and then the rest of the film essentially explains the end, Five Fingers is dedicated to going back, which becomes quite tiring at the end of the film. movie. movie. Overall, Five Fingers made me feel stupid to have watched the whole movie, because the torture is obviously obscene and it was certainly not necessary to use graphic mutilation to make this point. I am surprised that Dick Cheney did not make a guest appearance at the end as a superhero of torture. This film is a perfect example of what happens when an important subject falls into the hands of greedy and brainless dolts.
