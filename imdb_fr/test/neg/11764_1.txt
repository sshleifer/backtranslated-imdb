If you are looking for a faithful portrait of Che Guevara, the Cuban revolutionary who helped Fidel Castro in his offer of power, you would do well to read about Cuban history or even to type his name on a search engine (you are on the Internet , after all). <br /> <br /> But whatever you do, DO NOT LOOK "CHE!" <br /> <br /> Unless, of course, you want to laugh only one good shot. <br /> <br /> All the critics of the moment (and the moviegoers) gave "Che!" their vote for the worst film of the decade. And no wonder. Have you seen this parody? His facts are at best tenuous, Sharif is not even convincing as a corpse and as for the imitation Fidel Catsro of Palance .... <br /> <br /> As I said, if you want to laugh well. <br /> <br /> It's like watching a co-production between The Learning Channel and Mad Magazine. <br /> <br /> A star. <br /> <br /> I wonder if Palance can do W. C. Fields too?
