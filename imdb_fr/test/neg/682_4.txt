After seeing the film, I feel that the father and the mother are both reasonable people, but not at all perfect. On the contrary, I do not like the author and his two sisters. <br /> <br /> Is a person's diary a true portrait of herself? No. Most of the time people only write problems in their diary because they want to solve the problem. Thus, a newspaper is always a more negative aspect of a person. In this film, the author judges the life of his mother according to his diary. This is not a wise choice. <br /> <br /> The author's older sister is so ugly, external and internal. First, she stated that her father's second marriage was "not fair" for her mother. Then she said that she does not like her mother. So, she does not like both father and mother. I doubt that she loves anyone in the world. His face is so ugly, just a reflection of his heart. Throughout the film, I feel that the author and his sisters lack love and respect towards their parents. However, I have the feeling that fathers are very loving mothers towards their children, even the author tries to portray them as a cold and deceptive person.
