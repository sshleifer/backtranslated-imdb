I went into this movie with medium high expectations after enjoying the cartoon series of my childhood, and that almost destroyed that love for me. Jason Lee, David Seville in the movie, is horrible. I understand that it is not easy to deal with CGI characters who are not there yet, but I really found his performance atrocious, as well as all the other non animated characters. The chipmunks were adorable, but sometimes sometimes blatantly in the progression of the story, and so did not tempt me to stay in the theater more than half an hour after the movie began. If you feel like you have to watch this movie, rent it, at most. It's not worth eight dollars to see it in the theaters, unless you want to laugh at the horrible acting.
