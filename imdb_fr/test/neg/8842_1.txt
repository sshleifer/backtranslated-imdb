I watch all the good reviews about this movie and I start thinking about myself ... Am I going crazy ...? I can not see the beauty of a movie like this ..? Am I just stupid enough to NOT understand the message this movie is trying to bring out? I do not know ... maybe one of those lizards came into my head and also ate all my brain. The idea of ​​the movie was going nowhere ... I was sure it would end in the fog, and of course ... that's it! Nothing special ... not even the scenery (I hoped to be placed in a mountain village at least, the scenery would be good .. but no). Just a lame story about a crazy teacher, and of course his crazy students ... now all grown up, each of them ... with his own ideas stopped. And then, some of these ideas were stupid ... like the story of the lizard for example. At one point, I was thinking of looking at x files .. with the lizard going in the ear and everything. No .. from my point of view, this movie is a waste of time (not to say money if you pay the ticket) The only part I liked was the game of the young "blue" blue eyes "german" ... He played well and convincing for his age ... The rest ... nothing! I read the previous review and I think the writer and director were both under drugs when they came up with these ideas. Well, since a lot of people have enjoyed this movie ... I think about myself again ... Maybe I'm crazy. Advice .. Do not waste your time with that!
