If you are a pretentious person, it would be a good idea to brag about your intellectuality by saying that you really like this movie. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, do not bother and do better to look at something good. <Br /> <br /> This is the stereotyped movie for snobs. The plot would be very stupid if you could see it from beginning to end. It is simply presented as an attempt to make the film difficult to understand and to give it an intellectual aspect. <br /> <br /> Mullholland Drive is not fun to watch. You very rarely understand anything the first time you see it. And if you do, you will probably be disappointed because it does not matter.
