Leslie Nielsen is usually someone whose films I like a lot (even critical movies such as "Dracula: dead and worshiped" and "falsely accused"). So, the fact that I slap "Mr. Magoo" should show it's a junk. He introduces Nielsen as the main character of myopia, something is planted to him and he spoils everything. It seems that the combo of Nielsen and director Stanley Tong (behind two films by Jackie Chan) would make this film hilarious, but it is not the case; it seems that there are only people to do anything, and there is not really any humor here. <br /> <br /> The original drawing with Jim Backus providing the voice deserved to be seen, so avoid this movie. Leslie Nielsen has also done a lot better, so there is no reason to waste your time on that. Also with Kelly Lynch, Stephen Tobolowsky, Ernie Hudson, Malcolm McDowell and Miguel Ferrer; they probably do not want to focus on that piece of junk in their career.
