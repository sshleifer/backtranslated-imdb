OK ... it may contain spoilers ... but who cares? Do not waste your time, if you value the seconds of your life, on this waste pile. There is not a quality that redeems in this movie ... and I say it as a complete fan of the Vacation movie series. I loved Cousin Eddie's character from other holiday movies ... but he only works as a secondary character. Should I blame Randy Quaid for the failure of this movie? Not at all. I think it's an excellent actor ... but this film lacks cohesion ... the rhythm is off ... it's just ridiculous. And the actor who plays the "Third" ... Jake Thomas ... was horrible, more than likely because of a real lack of direction. I do not know why ... but his whole character scared me. <br /> <br /> Some people say it's a horrible movie because Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo are not there ... This has nothing to do with it. The scenario, the staging, the acting ... special effects ... everything is a train wreck. With orphans. And kittens. Oh ... and the train also crushed old people. <br /> <br /> Please, whatever you do ... stay away from this dirt! I call it dirt because it denies the name of the holiday franchise.
