It's a weird, strange movie and does not deserve a better rating than David Lynch's! The special effects are poorly done, the actors are very bad actors and in this film, it is not a race that is the minority of the planet and trying to fight against the rulers, but it seems act of a crazy movie that pays tribute to sect kind of organizations. This is surely not the will of Frank Herbert, the author of the six-part epic! Discover David Lynch's, the perfect tribute to novels!
