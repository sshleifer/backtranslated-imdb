Creakiness and atmosphere that this film has, but unfortunately also the copy I just saw. Raymond Massey offers a casual, almost comical Sherlock Holmes in his early bathrobe scenes, which he exchanges for a worker's garment to investigate Dr. Rylott's terrifying mansion (Lyn Harding). What was not clear to me was why Rylott wanted the death of his daughter-in-law. If, as in the case of Helen (Angela Baddeley), he did not want her to run away from marriage, he would have done the same thing by sending her away. <br /> <br /> Other curiosities also abound. After setting a date for early marriage with Helen, the bride is no longer heard for the rest of the photo. The presence of a band of gypsies at the time of Violet Stoner's death is only entertainment, and what could have been an interesting murder tool, a venomous snake, is diluted by the fact that it does not was not a cobra, the musical interpretations of the song. Despite an Indian servant. <br /> <br /> Athole Stewart skillfully describes Dr. Watson, Holmes's help, though it takes some time to get used to it if Nigel Bruce is no longer your cup of tea. As Rylott, Lyn Harding is sufficiently threatening, a trait that could be used wisely by Professor Moriarty, Holmes' mortal enemy, in two subsequent films - "The Triumph of Sherlock Holmes" of 1935 and "The Murder of the Baskervilles" "From 1935. <br /> With repeated rampage and an unstable camera, it is surprising that the story is not more disturbed than it is. Its integrity is generally maintained, even if one stretches a little to fill the gaps. I guess that would be my main complaint with the movie, because mentally filling some of the sudden cuts in the picture turned out to be a real embarrassment to the asp.
