How better to describe it than criminals on TV? And I'm not talking about the COPS program; here they are actually presented as protagonists. <br /> <br /> I do not see any restorative value in this show, unless you have a perverse penchant for human tragedies. Whitney Houston is a tragic example of the fallen star. a star that Bobby Brown helped pull from the sky. Bobby Brown is a low-life criminal. Why look at it? Why does Whitney support him, as contemptible as he is? This couple should be locked up and it is really a pity they make money and gain a minimum of fame by watching the septic tank that is their life and the human waste that is their character.
