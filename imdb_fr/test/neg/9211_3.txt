Something not so good. "Silence of the Lambs" remains Demme's only good movie, and of course I include all the overpriced left-hand exercises in a big-screen indulgence that I've never seen, and that I'll never do. <br /> <It's a light comedy that makes the thriller turn halfway. The first half is a bit difficult to get through; it's neither funny nor particularly interesting. Daniels plays a stupid and naive idiot who is so gullible and confident that he defies all belief. His animation game is often annoying and barely funny. In fact, he lies to Griffith at the beginning and tells him that he is married, with children, while he is divorced! Throughout the history of humanity and cinema, every married man who meets a woman he loves dives - if he lies - and declares that he is not married. (Later, the uncredible or credible reason behind all this was revealed: he wanted to "protect himself." What a load of shit ...) The fact that his character takes all the bad decisions and all the nonsense of the film. were really looking forward to seeing him fight by Liotta when he met him in the old man's apartment. <br /> <br /> What happens next in Daniels's apartment is the classic end of the movie fighting until death that the good guy - even if the very good guy - wins, as you would expect. Yet at least the last half hour has action, something is happening, and Daniels no longer has the opportunity to be animated. The film lacks credible characters (main or marginal), and the feeling is too 80s, which means that the film looks rather bland; visually ugly. Sayles makes an appearance once again as a policeman. The film is perhaps also a bit too heavy on the side of coincidences. Griffith once again plays a soft-spoken dumb bimbo, but as usual, she is convincing because she is a silent dumb bimbo. It was a previous film, before his surgery to widen the lip and the breast; Compare the natural breasts she exposes in this movie to balloons ready to explode as she flashes briefly years later in "Nobody's Fool". <br /> <br /> If you are interested in reading my "biographies" of Griffith and other Hollywood intellectuals, contact me by email.
