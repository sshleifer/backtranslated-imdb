I spent three months in East London in the second half of 1987, when the program was broadcast for almost two years. It was considered a common joke. <br /> <br /> Why? Because he had an all-white cast. Each additional actor and actor in the first two years was white. <br /> <br /> The street in which I lived was long, with more than 800 houses and, to my knowledge, I was one of the three or four white faces living in this street. We were in the corner of the Indian and Turkish "quarters", and even if you excluded these two races, the Asians and Afro-Caribbean were more numerous than the Whites twenty-one. In addition, of course, of the very few whites who lived in the area, the vast majority of them were Scots like me: no "Cockney" accent was heard. <br /> <br /> Racist speech, just a simple statement of fact. Before writing this drama, the BBC did not want to cross London to do its research, or it had only white actors and decided to bluff the film. <br /> East End of the time, we considered this as a humorous show. :-)
