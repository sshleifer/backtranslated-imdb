This film had potential. If it had been treated differently. What was needed was another director. For sure. And maybe another main woman. I just can not understand the character of Minnie Driver - or at least how she played it. She was completely amazing. I can not believe she would have liked her performance in this movie either. She was probably abandoned by the director or unable to deliver what the director was trying to get her to do. I write this because I always look at it. I think I hated being in his place trying to "play" something I did not understand. Well, we just proceed to the case she starts with the son (I'm still watching). I am now starting to be deeply embarrassed for everyone involved in this endeavor. If you like to watch movies that miss their mark a lot, watch this one.
