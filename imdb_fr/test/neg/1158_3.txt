Michael Feifer writes and directs this fictional story based on the arrest of Edward Gein in Plainfield, Wisconsin. Gein was responsible for a series of horrendous murders that sent a wave of terror into his rural hometown in the late 1950s. It is believed that his evil spirit and twisted world are caused by his zealous and domineering Lutheran mother. Ed received the nickname "The Plainfield Butcher". He would remove corpses in fresh graves of women who looked like his mother and he would have sex with them before "dressing like a deer" in his garage. Heads cut with bodies hanging upside down being his personal mark. After his arrest, many items in human skin were found at home. In this film, a young MP Bobby Mason (Shawn Hoffman) makes the research of Gein (Kane Hodder) a personal affair, when his trading mother (Priscilla Barnes) disappears. The acting is much better than the ridiculously liberal narrative of documented events concerning Gein. Also in the cast: Adrienne Frantz, Timothy Oman, John Burke, Michael Berryman and Amy Lyndon.
