This film had horrible lighting and terrible camera movements. This film is a horror film without interest. The slashes are totally false. It looks like a 17-year-old idiot wrote this movie and a 10-year-old kid shot him. With the worst game you can ever find. People are tired of knives. At least switch to guns or fire. It contains almost exact lines of "When A Stranger Calls". With horrific murders, only fools would enjoy this movie. It is obvious that the writer has no children or even takes care of them. I want to say to the show a little mercy. To summarize, this film is a movie "B" and it sucks. Just for your sake, do not even think about wasting your time watching this shitty movie.
