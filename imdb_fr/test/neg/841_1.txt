OK, so one night, friends and I decided to really fuck and watch a movie. Unfortunately for us, we chose "Ernest goes to Africa". I have never laughed so much in my life. This film is beyond the bad. I literally pooped better films than "Ernest Goes to Africa". (I'm making shit movies) <br /> <br /> The highlight of this movie, at least for me, was the opening sequence, when Ernest made silly grimaces. When they showed him with a head the size of a peanut, I lost it. I may have found it so funny because at that time I was the tallest. Maybe you are right. <br /> <br /> If I had to guess what is George W. Bush's favorite movie, I guess "Ernest is going to Africa". I had never seen a film relying more on 1950s stereotypes about people of color. There were times when words escaped me and I watched with admiration. <br /> <br /> While watching this, I could not help wondering if this movie was for children? Do literate adults really look at this? How could there be a whole franchise of 'Ernest' movies? Is it really my life? Is it real? <br /> <br /> I hated this movie.
