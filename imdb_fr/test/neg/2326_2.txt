I bought the video for Â£ 13 at HMV (we pay more in Britain) because a friend told me he was very well rated and that the reviews on this site were generally impressive. <br /> <br /> I must say that the opening credits were disappointing ... the dance / music not very powerful. <br /> <br /> The car ride and an unexpected accident just when the passenger was going to be injured was a nice touch, something unexpected ... although the way she was moving away from the car with the perfectly styled hair and always wearing a handbag seemed tacky to most managers ... but for Lynch it was something else. <br /> <br /> the shocks were accentuated by a regular noise, similar to that obtained by fingers scraping a blackboard; I thought another touch of Lynch might depict the demons gnawing at his shocked and traumatized consciousness. After a while, this noise became a bit awkward and, after investigation, I discovered the new video that was squealing. <br /> <br /> I do not know if that squeal was a lot of fun, but it was a waste of time. (and money) <br /> <br /> The two female characters were present and the lesbian scenes were fairly accurate, though predictable. There were no male characters of merit and, apart from a few vaguely good scenes (activating the vacuum cleaner on the move), there were far too many dreadful scenes that were simply frivolous and ridiculous. For example, the cafe threatened by the lurking loonie and the ridiculous monster face in the back of the dinner. Oh, and what about painting in women's jewelry .. rocking and naf. <br /> <br /> This whole movie gives you the impression of the failed genie..you know when you listen to the worst piece of Dylan and think my God who was embarrassing .... was it really Bob? <br /> <br /> The whole sensation is that of a failed TV movie, badly mounted with a few (not much) extra bits to give it a 15 Note. <br /> <br /> I let it go during the last 30 minutes. <br /> <br /> Should I give him another chance and look again. If I want to be puzzled and work hard to understand a movie, I'll look at Frank Woods' guide to consolidated accounting. <br /> <br /> Lynch made a classic. Blue Velvet and Straight Story was good. <br /> <Like Wild at Heart, it was disappointing; its strangeness is now predictable and obsolete. Someone wants to buy a second hand video? <br /> <br /> Give way to an original young talent, David. <br /> <br /> Four out of ten (and not more). Sorry.
