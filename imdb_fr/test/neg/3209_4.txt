During my childhood, I saw the first three films of "Critters" and appreciated them. These are fun and entertaining horror comedies, perfect for adventurous and horror-loving kids. I have never seen "Critters 4". So I finally decided to take a look. My verdict: a forgettable film and quite bad with a remarkably low body count. The screenplay of Joseph Lyle and David J. Schow is both predictable and clich√©, the plot tears "Alien" and "Star Wars" and the sets are bland and uneasy. The tone of the film seems terribly serious, making it slow and dull. "Critters 4" was apparently so small that filmmakers could not afford any optical effects; those taken from "Android" look seriously dated.4 out of 10. One to avoid.
