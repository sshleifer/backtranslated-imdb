Do you know what farmers are spraying on the fields? That's right - manure, so when the BBC decided to do a very popular plot thriller about GMOs and agriculture, we got the slimmest manure that the BBC inflicted on its audience <br /> !!!! SPOILERS !!!! <br /> <br /> FIELDS OF GOLD begins with a group of masked scientists in a laboratory where a scientist (according to the right on the BBC branch, all scientists are women) announces "A new variety of wheat that will save the third world of hunger "then the story goes to another equally bland scene. If you want to make a thriller of any type, should not you open with a hook that grabs the audience? The WHO doctor was brilliant at this, as was THE X-FILES, while 28 DAYS LATER opened with a hook that was taking place in a laboratory. I guess someone at the BBC did not think this thriller needed a fix because viewers had built trailers for them weeks in advance <br /> <br /> While the story ( not very exciting) continues, some journalists (One is a drunk man with morals inferior to those of Bill Clinton and Dubya Bush reunited, while the other is a journalist full of virtue investigating patients in a hospital of County that could be crushed by "murders by mercy." It is at this point that things begin to get confused as the journalist is threatened by the ghosts of MI5 and that the first episode ends with the assassination of the main MI5 ghost <br /> <br /> The second episode reveals that patients in the county hospital have died of being infected with a VRSA superbug, and that's when things turn out tota Throughout FIELDS OF GOLD, the public has been led to believe that the intelligence services and society presented in the opening sequence were behind the deaths - but this is not the case . It turns out that the villain is an organic farmer who makes the super VRSA bacteria in his room and the story ends with the MATRIX movie-camcorder where the drunken journalist fires a field devastated by VRSA, spreading the super bacterium all over the country <I find it impossible to say a word about FIELDS OF GOLD. At the time of its release, I was both a member of the Scottish Scottish Party and Greenpeace. Since then, I have given up being part of the environmental movement, but I am still a little shocked by the way environmentalists are portrayed here. It is ridiculous to let a perpetrator spread a deadly virus from genetic engineering to warn of the dangers of genetically modified organisms. It's a bit like a CND member throwing a nuclear bomb in London to warn of the dangers of nuclear war. I was also slightly offended by the way in which male characters were written as bastards when all women were extremely intelligent and morally superior to men. There are also other problems with the script, especially regarding VRSA. If, unlike the writers, you take the time and trouble to search VRSA, you will find that it is totally different from what you see here. Oh, and if you fire diesel, it does not explode like napalm. Perhaps the worst criticism of the scenario is that it resembles the JEEPERS CREEPERS structure in which the last ten minutes are at odds with most of the previous things. Where JEEPERS CREEPERS lasted only about 90 minutes FIELDS OF GOLD doubled its length, so it is doubly irritating and illogical <br /> <br /> As a footnote, environmentalism never makes a good thriller theme (Someone remembers Steven Segal's movies?) and it's time for TV and movie producers to realize that
