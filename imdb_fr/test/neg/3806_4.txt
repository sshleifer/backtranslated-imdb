Dr. O'Brien is a dramatic drama starring Pat O'Brien, a distressed journalist who comes to his ex-boss's home to ask for money to finance his son's operations, but finds him dead on the floor . Since O'Brien knows the identity of the culprit, he proposes to undergo rap in return for the money he needs. A decent premise is wasted in a movie that claims to have surprises, twists, even if it's really not the case. The performances are rotten in all areas, the film is disguised as hard black American, but the mixture of gloomy accents does not work and the story is not exciting. And it may contain the least attractive screen kiss of all time.
