I grew up watching sitcoms like Seinfeld, Roseanne, Simpsons, etc., in other words, traditional television. Over the years, many sitcoms have been aired and of these, a very small percentage is truly intelligent and fun. The War at Home is an excellent example of the majority of modern American comedy. <br /> <br /> I give the series 3 out of 10, because that's what it's supposed to be, a comedy, but it does not do it. seem to go out of his way to be a good comedy. A good comedy should make you lose your head with its big jokes, you should not be able to see them happen and in TWAH, I see almost every joke coming. The characters are probably the simplest and most horrible stereotypes that I have yet seen on the screen, and the acting is not very good except for the father who perfectly describes a stereotypical idiot who loves the sport American, silly, perfectly. <br /> <br /> Poor acting, incredible characters and jokes that do not take you off guard hurt the show and make it unassailable. If you do not have a cable and would like to see a comedy to watch, try Boston Legal. It's worth your time.
