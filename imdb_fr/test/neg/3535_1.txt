One can only guess why a filmmaker with antecedents like Wes Craven would like to lend his name to a tedious collection of clichés like this one. And if he had actually spent money to win - the £ 50 judging by the looks - he should have knocked on the door of the director to get a refund right out of the film. There are a lot of "Alien" scams and this is one of the worst. Even the reliable Lance Henriksen, who has a stupid character to allow his children to walk in a dangerous government laboratory, can not save him. As a treatment for insomnia, this is worth 10+. As a quality film, forget that.
