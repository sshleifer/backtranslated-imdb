Hilarious!! I would have sworn Ed Wood wrote this. Terrible. I liked every picture. Bad movie lover, it's your trophy! I will watch again. Words can not explain how entertaining this movie is. Pare's career must have been low, but I really think he's heading in the direction of Leslie Nielson. He was perfect for that. Terrible, just terrible !! You'll love it!! Get friends, lots of beer, and you'll have the time of your life. It's a MST3000 party, waiting to happen. Enjoy!! This is worth the rental !! You like the "Colombo" type cop and the cartoon coroner. The villain will make you laugh on the floor. He's also in another movie from Par√©, Komodo vs Cobra, and he's just as good there. I do not know what the budget was, but they will get it back because this movie is destined to be the best unexpected comedy of the year.
