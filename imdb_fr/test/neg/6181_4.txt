Okay, so I saw this movie at Sundance this year and I was terribly impressed. It took fifteen minutes of film before there was a montage or line of dialogue that made sense, and it took another 30 minutes before the closed script left room for a plot that was not no contingent of Ryan Gosling's smile or artificial moralization. After the first 45 minutes, however, the scenario has evolved into a supervised activity, even if it is not completely entertaining or challenging. The highlights certainly include the actors of Gosling and Morse, Gosling being a rising star, and Morse being an extremely well-established character actor with a good sense of disparate emotions. As a footnote, after the screening, I was talking a little about the film to some of my friends when David Morse walked right behind me - he looks like the nicest guy in the world, but it is solid and measure exceeds me by 50. I removed my foot from my mouth and quickly changed the subject.
