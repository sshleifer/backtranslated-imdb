I saw this "film" partly because of the impressive number of good reviews of Netflix, and I learned a valuable lesson. Not a lesson on ethnic diversity though ... the lesson I learned is "Do not trust critics". <br /> <br /> Yes, racism is feared and people are complicated, but those who really need to see this movie will be the ones who are the least attracted and the least affected by the problem if they see it. The only reason I can think of the number of good reviews is that it is being reviewed by people who are not used to thinking or who have seen their first thought-provoking film and who think in a way that Haggis invented the concept. In fact, he basically made this film, which should be called "Racism For Dummies", as emotionally heart-rending as possible, apparently to give people who do not spend a lot of time thinking about the impression they've discovered a fundamental truth that is never covered in a movie before. Zen and the art of motorcycle maintenance is not ... A special program for non-thinking masses after school hours, cut into oversized ham fist pieces to facilitate their ingestion without too much introspection. <br /> <br /> It's as if everyone is described as the worst extreme possible, just to make us happy that we're such good people because we do not identify with the characters. Let's face it. NO ONE identifies with these characters because they are all cardboard cut-outs and stereotypes (or predictable reverse stereotypes). It is well played (even if the dialogue is atrocious) and intelligently executed, so much so that one does not think to ask "where is the ox?" until you can say that the movie ends. The scene of the burning car was well executed, like much of the film, but went nowhere at the end. <br /> <br /> The messages are very hard and, from the presentation text "behind the scenes", the producers clearly saw a different film, because there is very little laugh about it in this film, even during the movie. intended for funny parts. I must emphasize that this is not entertainment, but rather a lesson about diversity in high schools ... Call it the "blood on the highway" of racism. They could even show it in high schools if there was not the "naked side" of Jennifer Esposito. <br /> <br /> In this movie, everyone is a fool and everyone learns a lesson (except Michael Pena). who gets the best role, but the most predictable plot). <br /> <br /> It's a bad movie, with bad writing, and good actors .... A nasty cartoon designed by Paul Haggis for people who can 'handle nothing but the daring features of narration .... a painting painted with colored pencils. <br /> <br /> The crash is a depressing thing that provokes emotions, but does not teach you anything if you already know about racism and prejudices. bad things.
