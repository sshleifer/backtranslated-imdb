First of all, this film works in the fact that it is disturbing. I really did not like to see all these scenes where people were cut out alive, etc. The strangely erotic introduction gives a feeling of necrophiliac wonder. It's a bit ... disgusting for me personally. But the movie really works in this respect, and it's supposed to be scary, so I congratulate him. Yes, a few points there for these scalpels and ... well, damn disturbing idea of ​​getting sick alive. <br /> <br /> But what is missing from this film is an interesting plot, a characterization, or real surprises. The entire genre of teen-flick horror usually goes in a very simple and predictable way. Many "tense" moments, scary guys who are crazy, and the big question of all: is the boyfriend the murderer? This movie is part of the "Scream" category and countless others that came out in the 90s. Well, I'm not going to tell you about it, but the killer is not very interesting. We discover who is halfway ... and from there, the film continues, trying to save time ... rather boring to say the least. I was looking at the clock of this movie. <br /> <br /> The lead actress is great, as usual, but the cardboard game box in which she is placed makes her moan with pain ... the college girl who is a detective that everyone thinks crazy, but she's the one who really knows what's going on. And the cops? Ahhh, they laugh and eat donuts. Very predictable, flat, sometimes disturbing, and especially boring and dull ... It's as if an American film company had flown to Germany to shoot a film to make it foreign ..... hmmm ..... or do they have it? <br /> <br />
