Uhhh ... so, did they even have writers for that? Maybe I am difficult, but I like to interact with my films. And, as far as slasher films are concerned, a development of the character will suffice. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, The Prey does not provide anything either. And if you think I'm hyperbolic, you'll just have to see for yourself. Scene after scene, we just have actors standing, looking for despair and clumsiness, abandoned by any sense of the scenario. Apart from calling each other when they are separated in the forest (natch), the only cases where these people say something concrete is when a character explains the Orion constellation (clearly plagiarized from Funk & Wagnalls; slasher, no?) and another tells an old campfire story that has nothing to do with intrigue (wait, what's the plot?) At other times, The Prey has the pellet of filming his characters with the micro boom just far enough so that we can not hear exactly what they say. So we have whole scenes in which actors murmur! Deliberately! Seriously, I saw more dialogue in a silent movie. It's as if the filmmakers sat in a bar somewhere in Rancho Cucamonga at the height of the eighties craze and one of them looked at the other and said, "Hey, I must have a very good idea of ​​a gag of bloody decapitation ... entire functionality around him. "And ... well, they did it. <br /> <br /> To be fair, The Prey probably had some kind of writer on board. I mean, someone had to note the sequence of the scene and label the dailies. However, I am quite convinced that this movie has no such publisher. There are blatant breaks, annoying pictures and zero sense of stimulation. The filmmakers have nothing else in the "scenario" to film, so they complete the time with an exhaustive taxonomy of the flora and fauna that populate the forest in which our wild and crazy teenagers are cut into pieces. These creatures are all filmed in a totally reserved way, in the light of day, at noon, without any attempt at atmospheric photography. If it sounds like a science film, it's because it is. I'm pretty sure these are nature's archive footage - all it takes is the stifling narration of a National Geographic alderman. <br /> <br /> More exciting images that were spared from the floor of the cutting room: a scene in which two men are discussing cucumber and cream cheese sandwiches, and another scene where a support character stumbles on a banjo for a minute and a half! A minute and a half! It's a lot of banjoing to commit to celluloid, and even less to insert in the final editing of the film! Good job guys! The brevity and brevity are the real victims of this carnival. <br /> <br /> Of course, the film took a lot of steam (comparatively) in the last 25 minutes, during which much of the carnage is condensed and the scam of "Music for Strings, Percussion and Celesta "by Béla Bartók intervenes. Jackie Coogan, the great Vaudeville, makes a funny appearance as a ranger, this was his last role, if you can convince yourself. And there are some beautiful bloody moments, including a tear in the neck and a decapitation above. The makeup used for the murderer (Carel Struycken, aka "Lurch" of the Addams family movies) is also very effective and makes him look like a strange hybrid of young Jason Voorhees and Freddy Krueger. Plus, if you like wacky ends, straight out of the left field, you have to check how they wrap this puppy. You will make a catch, promised. <br /> <br /> Usually, I like movies that are so incompetent, but the first three quarters of The Prey are so boring that they are so boring that they ruin the rest. All in all, this is a largely pale and tedious affair and, although not so serious, it should actually be seen only by weaker slasher complements. Why do we do this ourselves, anyway?
