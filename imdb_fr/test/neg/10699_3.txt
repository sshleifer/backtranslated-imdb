For the most part, I considered this film unworthy of a comment, but the last 10 minutes prompted me to write one. You see, at that time, we are learning (SPOILERS ... if they can be so called) that the Devil's Emissary has no chance of properly preparing the mastery of the world by his master, because he is not good at martial arts! "Prosatanos" has been languishing in a hole for centuries, waiting for "human greed" to release him, but defeated in a single head-to-head match against the 54-year-old former karate champion , Chuck Norris! Imagine what would have happened to him if he had attacked Jackie Chan ... (* 1/2)
