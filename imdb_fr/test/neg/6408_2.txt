Not just because of this theme in the movie. Which was one of the lame excuses for something reminiscent of the plot. No. I watched that, knowing that I would not like it. I hate numerology. Whenever someone starts talking about models with numbers, I feel the need to slap them. My own brain begins to suffer from empathy. And well aware that it is a film on this subject, I could not resist the urge to look at it and maybe laugh. But it was not funny. Exactly this kind of nonsense "Is not it totally scary and yet incredibly cool ?! I can turn any shit into 23!" dialogue I feared. As soon as the son started playing, I realized that this movie was a shit, no matter what happened. But I almost never stop watching a movie that I started. I sat through it. I appreciate the pain. <br /> <br /> The film claims to make fun of numerology under the disguise of showing how obsession can end badly. But he rides this wave as much as it is supposed to crush it. I do not see this message. I see only delirious characters on a stupid figure with a small plot to justify. <br /> <br /> Add to that the usual "surprises" - trying to put yourself in a different light, that makes no sense, and you almost believe it because of the quality of the narration so far - and you get a piece of hollow film. This happens to be centered on the subject that I despise. If only he did not try to be serious and was rather a hilarious film with actors I do not care about. But I started to like Carrey ... when it's not his fault, he tries. It's not even good to watch with a group of friends and mst3k hell. <br /> <br /> My expectations were low enough that someone could stumble over them, but this movie managed to live up to the worst I've ever seen.
