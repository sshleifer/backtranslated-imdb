A few days ago, I watched the three Max max movies for the first time and was bitterly disappointed with the third installment. it destroys the beautiful work of the first two films with a foolish and old-fashioned action and a story that turns the Australian apocalyptic wasteland into a comic sandbox that one would expect to see in a children's adventure movie. the character of max is unrecognizable because of his dark and cynical character seen in previous movies and turned into a predictable and uninteresting savior who let me feel betrayed. if you have not seen this movie yet, then do not do it. Let the story end with the warrior of the road and save yourself an hour and a half very painful. (spoiler alert) The other major problem I had with this movie and that really left a bitter taste in my mouth was the flying man. we had already seen him in the warrior of the road where he had helped max and yet, when he reappears in thunder, it seems that the two never met. I do not know if he was supposed to be a different character or relative of the gyroscopic man of the road warriors. However, this has not been explained and constitutes a weak element of this globally weak film. 2 of 10. does not get a 1/10 because of the thunder fight.
