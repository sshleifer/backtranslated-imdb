I just can not understand, the freaks of the planet speak of it as a must event, they even dare to call it a farm, because the girl possessed seduces priests and masturbates all the time. Do not let me laugh. I watched the film, seducing is only the end of the film and does not call it seduce, it's just a bad language she speaks. And the masturbationscene makes laugh too, she tries to seduce her father while masturbating, let me be clear, with his evil clothes there. It's not bloody or bloody at all, everyone throws up on Beyond The Door, well, let me tell you, this one is better for me than this movie. Only the last 5 minutes, the possessed vomit and has strange eyes. If I had known it was so bad, I would never have caught it. If you really do not want to see an explanation about exorcism, look at Angel Above, The Devil Under or others. it's a lapse of time.
