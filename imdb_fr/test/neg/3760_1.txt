"Rocketship XM" is a science-fiction classic due to its release date (1950), its clever ability to capitalize on the "Destination Moon" commercial and the emergence of actors who will later play in television under the pseudonym Sea Hunt's Mike. Nelson, Rockford's dad and Wyatt Earp. <br /> <br /> The film itself is bad enough to be a good feed for MST3K and it's best to watch it with comments from Joel and the robots. This is the type of movie best suited for adding riffs from the MST3K characters; something preached, slow, poorly written and full of painful deeds. Although unintentional funny stuff like "Plan 9 of Outer Space" does not lend itself to satirical commentary (because the movie constantly surprises guests), the really bad and boring movies like "Rocketship XM" are ideals. So add some stars to the rankings if you look at the MST3K version. <br /> <br /> The basic story shows that the crew takes an unforeseen right turn on the Moon and ends on Mars. What they discover on this planet are the remains of a human civilization devastated by an atomic war. Only one Martian is represented in close-up, a woman of normal appearance, blind or at least without pupil. The men are like the "morons" of Popeye's old cartoons, they crawl nimbly around the cliffs and throw rocks at the crew with incredible accuracy, especially if they are supposed to be blind. Of course, none of this is ever explained, as this would require a logical sign of analysis from the scenario writers. <br /> <br /> The scenes on Mars are presented in the form of "Sepia Color" to distinguish them from the rest of the film N & B. If that makes you think of "Wizard of Oz", you will be disappointed because they are only black and white images slightly tinged with brown added to the post-production impression. <br /> <br /> In harmony with the idiotic sexism of the film, the icy scientist messes up his fuel calculations - both back and forth. His inability to be at the height of men brings out its feminine side. She and Mike Nelson curl softly as they face their fate (insert gagging sound here). <br /> <br /> The real stars of the film are the journalists at the command center. So much so that MST3K was inspired to especially greet these unannounced heroes. The intrepid team of "journalists" plays during the first 10 minutes of the film, then takes the stations about 12 inches behind the technicians and monitors the monitoring equipment of the command center. Later, they are asked to ask the mission director the necessary silly questions to expose the already obvious message of the film. <br /> <br /> The DVD has an extremely low audio level, is not subtitled and comes with a trailer. Although you're grateful that it's only 77 minutes, there's still about 60 minutes left, because every 30-minute episode of "The Twilight Zone" has many times more content than this film as a whole. <br /> <br /> Then again, what do I know? I am only a child.
