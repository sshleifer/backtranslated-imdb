The acting was bad, and the plot, well I do not think there was one. <br /> <br /> A fat blond guy who is still wearing a nightgown, takes off some sort of nightclub, I think he then kills a copper. Unnecessary fighting then occurs A kidnapped girl is caged on a boat, why? A trained, uncompromising martial arts cop arrives, speaks English poorly, and does things that make no sense. His absolute guts. But he has a nice car. Christ on a bike, this movie was a loss of 90 minutes.
