Where do I start? First, the story is nil. The acting game is nil, the effects really bad, I guess I'll start with the story. The story of Komodo against Cobra: number one, it does not explain how or when Komodo and cobra even got there. Or by the way, how was it created? The acting game: Terrible! Looks like the director has just pulled some people off the street (which he probably did). And the last and certainly the least, the effects: they are so horrible that the komodo does not even look like a komodo, but a dinosaur, which seems incredibly unrealistic. The water does not even move when the cobra appears. All in all: terrible piece of shit, do not even think about renting it.
