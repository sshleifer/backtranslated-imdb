Now this movie is the worst I have ever seen !! It's just a disaster. I think it's really a sick movie, I just lost my time looking at this cheap shit. I can not believe anyone would produce such a disaster. Such a waste of money and time. Nothing to learn from this movie, it's just an evil and hollow movie. I do not think they could have made matters worse, this movie just earned its title of King of the worst shit. The acting is a disaster, a sense ... well, there is no sense except a pain and sorrow caused by the child who suffered at the end of the film, and the murder of the woman who was once again a stupid blow to this movie. . Do yourself a favor, if you have a little respect for yourself, stay away from this horror !!!
