Idiots go camping and act like idiots before finally dying like idiots, so Camp Blood makes it pretty depressing to watch. And he has all the ingredients to be a perfectly bad movie ... <br /> <br /> Horrible check-actor. Bad script-check. Tacky effects-check no originality whatsoever - double control. <br /> <br /> He does not even try to be different and is riddled with all the predicted clich√©s imaginable. For example, the film opens to a couple who have sex in the woods, so of course they are dead. <br /> <br /> One of the most disturbing things is that this film actually spawned two sequels, how and why just baffles the mind. <br /> <br /> Stay away from this one.
