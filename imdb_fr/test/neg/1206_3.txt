Do not bother to check the logic. There are not any. But, on the other hand, there are LOTS of very good movies that totally lack logic, so why bother? <br /> <br /> I like and do not like this movie. I like that because the action sequences in the air are really great, we can see a lot of dogfights. I also like the F-16, which is a very cool plane. <br /> <br /> But there are too many blunders for me to really appreciate it. I guess it's not fair to want some kind of continuity, because it's hard to make a very good fight movie - but I also think there should be a sense of reason. <br /> <br /> And I have a question: do they fly from California to the Middle East in F-16 without refueling? I would like that to happen.
