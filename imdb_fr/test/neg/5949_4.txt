Anthony Perkins and Sophia Loren are absolutely beautiful in this area. 1840 "Western". That alone, however, does not help a ridiculous story, with innumerable historically incorrect elements. <br /> <br /> Byrl Ives is convincing as a tyrannical patriarch about 70 years old, an egomaniac who swears to see his 100th birthday. His wild dance at a party he gives to his neighbors will make everyone aware (this guy is SEVETY SIX?). Still mumbling Bible verses, he demands respect, while pushing his sons and friends away from his evil talk and emotional cruelty. <br /> <br /> The love affair between Perkins and Loren seems at first sight absurd, but becomes credible near the end. There is a lot of drama, but not enough to feel good. Clearly written for the stage, this story was dated even when it was filmed. Perkins whistled "My Bonnie" in the 1840s, although the song was only composed in 1882. <br /> <br /> Critics who criticize Sophia Lorens for "mastering the English language" are rather mean-spirited. I found his English impeccable and completely audible. As a Neapolitan, Loren speaks a distinct dialect that often has to be dubbed "true Italian". His "accent", however, hardly affects his way of speaking English. As a first generation German American, I can appreciate the efforts of those who learn English as second, third or fourth language. <br /> <br /> "Desire Under The Elms" is a drama (or even a tragedy). ) in the classical sense. For my pleasure, I missed a logical story and a "return on investment" for the time invested. Star fans will not want to miss it, but at your own risk!
