Very dull show. What's worse, it's very racist. Whites are idiots idiots and the only love story is between a black and a white. There's nothing interesting in this love story, it's not exciting, it's not fun, they do not even seem to care at all, it's more like the screenwriters and filmmakers wanted something interracial. Why is this so popular in the media today? It's a social programming that will not work, there's always tension when too many people want the same thing. This show is not worth the 20 dollars of the season, it is a waste of time and a nuisance for society. At least, when they use TV shows to sell products, they are more discreet, and it is obvious that the least agenda here is obvious, and without everyone being clear, some may feel bad about it. to oppose, but some of us know better.
