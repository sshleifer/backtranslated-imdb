Annoying, ridiculous and stupid "overwhelmed" is a waste of time. Shootings were a joke, real people do not stand out, without any cover, hoping to be shot first! So many bad or bad things are not worth listing, except for a major flaw. At 500 mph for 20 minutes = about 166 miles west of L.A. and the water depth is 100 feet ??? Even so, none of the people would have survived the decompression after being subjected to 100-foot water pressure for more than 20 hours when elevated. Just a horrible one.
