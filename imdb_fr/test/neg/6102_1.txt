It is obvious that the director, the writers and all the others do not know anything about their religion or the people who practice it. This film is endless and flawed and globally represents a complete pot. <br /> <br /> For example, there is a scene in which the rabbi enters the ritual bath of the woman while a naked woman bathes and puts his hand on the head of a woman. there and bless her. It is a total mockery of the laws; in this scene only, some of the broken laws include: Modesty, a rabbi would never enter a ritual bath as long as there was a woman inside. would never put his hand on a woman's head, not to mention that this is not how a blessing is given. <br /> <br /> The woman of the ritual bath tempers a naked woman by pushing her head under the water, the laws relating to the ritual baths require that the whole body be in direct contact with the water of the bath; it means that no one should be in contact with the person bathing, and certainly not pushing it under! <br /> <br /> There was nothing left in this scene, like a dive 13 times (where did this concept come from?) mentioning the rest of the movie was a total mistake. It's scary what ignorance can concoct!
