I saw this movie for the first time on NBC on Friday 11-29-02. It was a very good movie, but I do not think it would be the kind of Muppet movie Jim Henson would do. I mean first, Pepe 'using the word "sexy" from time to time, and Pepe saying "it would be bad?" And I know that Jim Henson would not allow Kermit to shout, "I WANT I NEVER WANT TO BE BORN!" thirteen times a minute. This movie just does not look like a classic Muppet movie. I can certainly understand that Nicky Holiday stole the baseball field of "The Great Muppet Caper", but a businesswoman cheating the Muppets under a contract with their theater to make it a nightclub for smoking. If Jim Henson was here today, he would hate this movie!
