When farmers become evangelists, they always exploit in the name of poverty! <br /> <br /> My first reaction after seeing the movie is ?? God bless me that I do not eat fish or non-vegetarian products! <br /> <br /> The documentary is dedicated to Lake Victoria, Tanzania, where many varieties of beautiful fish lived. One day in the 1960s, someone came to inject the mighty pole fish, which became the exportable product of Tanzania to European and European countries. Japanese markets. The consequences were serious ?? first of all, all the big and small local fish have disappeared; second, the plane that came to catch the fish can not travel empty because it has no commercial / commercial / capitalist sense, so it is filled with weapons and ammunition (that's what Europe can give to this world); thirdly, pilots (like all migrants and homeless people such as truck drivers) must survive their sexual needs by flourishing by prostituting themselves locally to cheap local African prostitutes; fourthly, brokers, middlemen and intermediaries in the chain (mainly businessmen of Indian origin) get richer and poverty in Tanzania remains the same; The fifth poverty pushes children to crime, drugs, etc. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​making this documentary was excellent. But did the director Hubert Sauper manage to make a good documentary? It's a big NO. <br /> <br /> I say the reasons: as in India, it takes a superior caste Brahmin to get up and project to the world the poverty and the untouchable Indians; likewise, a European documentary filmmaker born in Austria must tell the world the story of Tanzania, its ruined economy and its poverty. It is the pathetic motive for the unconscious reproduction of this rich class (who has never seen poverty or who is known to be poor), who survives, lives, earns and is famous as a parasite hooked on projecting poverty into poverty. world as soon as she sees it. There is nothing more than scorn among the poor in Africa and India who see such images of theirs. <br /> <br /> The intention and motivations of the Hubert seem totally meaningless. The images, the characters, the places, the interviews are too serious and too dark, dark and disturbing. He uses an exaggerated ignorance as a voice to present his case. What we feel in the end is pity and sadness for Africans. We are also beginning to see the Tanzanian government and people as bandits. Maybe some Westerners sitting in their air-conditioned rooms would find time to debate and debate the pathetic living conditions of Africans, but there would be nothing more than that. <br /> <br /> The director insists on showing himself even more once on the screen? so as not to be identified among the Europeans who exploit this poor country. <br /> <br /> This director, Hubert, can survive only by his own exploiters, like the current giants of the CNN and BCC media. Hubert did not have the courage or the good sense to speak to the Europeans who eat or the companies that import these fish products. A fragile effort totally depressed! But I understand the reasons for the same thing ?? Hubert just wanted to earn his glory, sitting and smiling with rewards in his European comfort. <br /> <br /> No more words for this pathetic effort. I give the documentary a higher rating with 3.5 stars out of 10, simply because the theme was correct; but was pathetically exploited and blown by a poorly designed amateur director designed only for an un-intelligent Western audience! (Stars 3.5 out of 10)
