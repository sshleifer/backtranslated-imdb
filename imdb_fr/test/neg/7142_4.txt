Hey! Grudge 2! What's up? I have a friend that I would like to meet you. The Grudge 2 meets Johnny's Worst of 2006 list. The list of Johnny's Worst 2006 meets The Grudge 2. <br /> <br /> What's going on here? I felt like it was supposed to be a sequel to The Grudge rather than a remake. If that's the case, then why does it just reshape the original? This float does not even feel like a movie. It's just a 90-minute soundtrack of the strange contortionist chick that makes that annoying croaking sound. <br /> <br /> A sound that I recommend you do not try. It was a little scary the first time I heard it, but I've heard it about 12,367 times since 2004, so it's almost done. And it's even more annoying for the 20 people in the audience who thought it would be fun to imitate the sound whenever there was a quiet corner in the movie. Sigh. <br /> <br /> Dear friends, you're not funny, so close! I promise you, EVERY TIME, that a character walks slowly through an empty room (which is about 97% of the movie). Someone from the audience would throw it, "Uhhhhkkkkkkuuuuhhhhhhkkkkkk." Yes, I know it's a horrible way to reproduce sound with letters, but you understand the point. Thus, a guy in the audience would snicker and, not to be outdone, present his own interpretation. I was very close to walking in the audience and hitting random people. <br /> <br /> I told you not to throw me. <br /> <br /> There is absolutely nothing I can do about The Grudge 2 recommend. There is not a single fear or original idea in the whole movie. There is not a memorable actor performance. Are you a fan of Sarah Michelle Gellar? Welp, enjoy its two minutes of screen and a line of dialogue. Are you a fan of Amber Tamblyn? I hope you can handle the fact that she has nothing to do more than walk around and seem to have a pinched nerve. Can you believe that the story (if you can call it that) is even worse than The Grudge's? <br /> <br /> At least the original was quite scary and boasted of some effective jump scenes. I did not jump once during this period of fire (yeah, I invented the word, treat it). It is true. Not even once. "Alarms" are so fabricated and they are telegraphed so blatantly that there is absolutely no shock value once the "obtained" moment has arrived. Watching this movie is like playing a good game of chess: you always have four or five scenes in front of you. <br /> <br /> There are also strange scenes that make no sense. One immediately thinks of a scene in which a girl drinks a gallon of milk and begins to regurgitate it in the pot. Huh? I say HUH?!?! The audience laughed. I shook my head and sighed. There were many during the film. Laughing. Sighs. Shaking his head. I fell asleep (I did it twice). <br /> <br /> The film even tries to try its luck at the 1 / 5th of a plot "twisted". Sensational. It's so bad that I do not think we should even make it worthy by calling it crooked. Did they really think someone would be surprised at the revelation of who was hiding under the sweatshirt? Please. It was as shocking as Elton John coming out of the closet. <br /> <br /> And of course, the end goes the same way: "we may have another sequel". As soon as the credits rolled, the public was booed. Exactly my feelings. If the public had paid money for this turkey hamburger, the situation would probably have become violent and I would gladly have led the charge. <br /> <br /> We learned from The Grudge that there is a Japanese belief that when someone dies in a powerful hold of rage, a curse is left behind. Just like a film by Ben Affleck, it's a "stain" that forever becomes part of the place where death occurred. Well, in The Grudge 2, we learn that when a horror movie covers its budget during its opening weekend, its sequel will be hurriedly launched and, most often, it will be as serious as that and will leave a stain on any theater where film screening. <br /> <br /> THE GIST <br /> <br /> If you are a scoundrel and have never seen The Grudge, it could provide some cheap scares. But I strongly recommend you to save your money, otherwise, there is a good chance that you are the one coming out of the theater with grudge.
