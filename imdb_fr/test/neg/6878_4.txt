I never intended to see Venom, but I caught him by cable. He has good elements. The marshy atmosphere of Louisiana is one, which unfortunately we will not see often in movies because of Hurricane Katrina. It is based on an interesting concept, an ordinary man imbued with the spirits of evil. His confrontation with his son could have been interesting, just like much of the movie. But as in Hollywood, an interesting idea goes in a familiar direction: <br /> <br /> Kill all the characters except the nice girl, starting with the blacks. I'm a fan of Agn√®s Bruckner, but the other characters, the villain's son, CeCe, who is to become a voodoo priestess, are more interesting. And for God's sake, once, I'd like to see the virgin get killed. We all love the easy girl, why can not she live? In this case, it was Bijou Phillips and we loved him. <br /> <br /> The end is meaningless given what has been established regarding the invincibility of the wicked. All the carnage and the atmosphere, and that leads to nothing.
