Thunderball and Never are two of the biggest hits at the box office and Never is a surprise joke by Empire Strikes Back hero Irvin Kershner. Klaus Maria Brandauer seems to steal the limelight, when, in the middle of the plot that is unfolding, Bond's mission turns more towards Hollywood frenzy (sometimes when Basinger enters the scene). How about Klaus Kinski? I still think that Largo's cast does or, as we can see in both movies, break the story. Worst of all is trying to get Connery, the old and very furry, to be known as the sex symbol he was in the 60s. The 80s were a difficult time for James Bond movies, though that For Your Eyes Only is an excellent title. Sometimes, when I need to waste time during the holidays watching this film in Bond's often repeated film series, I think the best attribute of the movie is his score, and I'm not in the soft 'Years' 80 'jazz'.
