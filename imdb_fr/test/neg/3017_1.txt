This is what the station's disclaimer states after the commercials of this show "some scenes may be embarrassing for some viewers". <br /> <br /> It's more than disturbing. The validation of all this display of self-management and chauvinism is in the fact that it is on the COMEDY channel. Yes..a real and true comedy. A JOKE. Seeing these "playas" follow their rigid charade clearly states what is wrong with society. Especially the meat market scene. Both sides, men and women, are just as weak and desperate to mingle in this superficial atmosphere. The club is obviously one of those plastic coke scenes sponsored by the Cigarette Corporation. These people have the choice and that's what makes it even more of a joke. <br /> <br /> These smooth sticks are trying too hard. They twinkle with their own throat grease. Its good. This is a video tape lesson for the new generation on how to NOT focus on a potential heart interest. Hope this facade will collapse with the Bush / Harper administrations. The problem is who is aligned after the disappearance of these characters? The bastards of the night get up?
