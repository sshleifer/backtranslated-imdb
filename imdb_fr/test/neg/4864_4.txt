I have rarely seen such an annoying action / suspense movie. None of the action scenes excites the plot, and apart from a few actors, the acting is bad. Charlie Sheen (Platoon Major League) plays the role of Chief of Staff of the White House, which is at the center of a conspiracy that wants his death and that of more people. Donald Sutherland (A Time to Kill, Fallen) plays a friend to whom he tells all he can and Linda Hamilton (Terminator Linda Hamilton, Dante's Peak) plays a journalist who gets involved in the situation. Charlie Sheen is good as a star, Donald Sutherland is a good actor who gives a good performance. Linda Hamilton gives a bad performance. With a bad film, I can love it if its end is going well, but this film has a very old end with almost laughable stuff.
