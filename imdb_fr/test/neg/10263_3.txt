The movies use blue-black and vibrant skin tones to create a black-ish feel to this movie unfortunately do not work. In fact, it's pretty irritating because it hides the demonic characters and reduces them to one-dimensional beings. <br /> <br /> At least the original had a hysterical energy and the bloody decorations were stunning. Black Gore is hardly scary, any more than the main demon is scary when she tries to growl and grumble on the screen in her best style, the Lugosi style. <br /> <br /> The story is grossly disjointed and if you can imagine it, '' Naked Lunch '' by Russ Meyer will allow you to appreciate your attempt to be William Burroughs-esque. Otherwise, give this film a wide width. The fans of Bava and Argento - again - are bitterly disappointed.
