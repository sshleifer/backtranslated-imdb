It is not uncommon for a celebrity to face the proverbial "wake up call". And, if they survive this event, they understand and appreciate their particular luck. However, in the case of comedians, they are rarely as fun after their epiphany as before. This is the case with Martin Lawrence. Frankly, I pay little attention to celebrities because I have much better things to do in my life than to spend it watching others. " So, I was not aware of most of what Lawrence had experienced before this movie. It was interesting but, unfortunately, everything in common. I felt more general that the stand-up act of this type was just not very funny. Save the big messages of life for a book, just be funny on stage. If you want to see a funny Martin Lawrence, go rent some of the old Def Jams for which he animated. Do not rent Runteldat.
