I usually enjoy watching Laurel and Hardy, but it's obviously one of the movies they did as they were about to become a successful comic team. <br /> <br /> The plot is too simple and relies mainly on a joke; how strange are kilts and scots. And that's all. Okay, there are other jokes, but I did not find them very funny at all. they are obsolete and (I suppose) they were not very fun when the movie was released for the first time. <br /> <br /> Yet the film has two of the most charming faces in history and makes the most of the delicate story (which, I suppose, was filmed without script) and the scenery is nice to watch . <br /> <br /> In my opinion, look at this is only for the fans of Laurel and Hardy, the others must stay away.
