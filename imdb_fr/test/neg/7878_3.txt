I never really understood the controversy and hype caused by this movie. Especially in France and in neighboring countries (in Belgium, where I am located, for example), "Baise-Moi" has been announced as THE most shocking and stimulating social drama you can experience. Yes indeed! Maybe it's a little shocking, maybe (how often do you see someone being shot in the ass?), But the weak and uninteresting plot certainly did not cause me to think much . "Fuck Me" is another one of those films that "blame everything that's wrong with society" and they are generally not very convincing. About 99% of people function perfectly in this society, so why would you blame this same society for the despicable and hopeless acts of two disturbed nymph girls? The two main characters and their miserable lives are presented separately and in flashes. Nadine has just killed her roommate; Manu shot his brother and the two men in an abandoned train station late at night. They decide to travel France together, leaving behind a trail of sex and blood each time they stop. Although we are constantly exposed to pornography and violence, this film is very boring. As girls say all the time, the dialogues are lame and the people they meet (and kill ??) are very uninteresting. If people want to make porn movies, it suits me, but do not pretend it's an artist film. If you omit swearing and photographic work at the hip, all there is to do is to create (and not) pornography. Sounds cool, though!
