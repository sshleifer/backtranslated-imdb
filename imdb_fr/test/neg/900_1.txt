I do not know what the directors of this movie tried to do or say, but they failed, no matter what it was. Unless of course the object was to completely confuse the viewer. I watched this movie just because Drew Barrymore was inside, and it turned out she had a cameo smaller than it was small. It is ridiculous to have this child go on a car trip to win a big prize at a gas station and meet all kinds of crazy people.
