I went to see this film in the cinema because of its potentially interesting subject, the good distribution, of a director who had already shot the very famous film "Once Were Warriors" and my taste for black-ish movies unfolding in Los Angeles in the Forty and Fifty. I would say that I am quite easy to satisfy in this category of films; I enjoy the classics of the genre, but I'm going to sit down and enjoy an effort as decent as derivative. However, I found this film completely unbearable. <br /> <br /> Despite a good situation in which to place the story, no one seems to do or say anything that is interesting or distant for the next two hours, more than this disastrous mess. . Good actors are wasted in scenes of endless dialogue ranging from mundane to embarrassing. The narrative is cowardly and unsustainable, and none of the events he describes are treated well enough to do anything but tire the audience. There is no drama, no atmosphere, no tension, absolutely no entertainment value and in the end, I just laughed at what had happened because I did not believe in the film . <br /> <br /> L.A. Confident was released a year later and, that a version of the story is more faithful to reality, this last film deserves all the congratulations for its excellence in each department. Mulholland Falls, on the other hand, fails in all departments, a fact all the more tragic as the talents are numerous. If they ever show this in an airplane, I'll go out anyway.
