With Matthias Hues on the cover and only $ 3.00, I had to buy it. I enjoyed certain moments, like the irritation of the Hawks with the droids of enjoyment, but I really only watched the scenes of Matthias Hues. I particularly enjoyed the confrontation at the end. It was a cross between "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" by Clint Eastwood and "For a Few Dollars More" (a three-man showdown with a quick draw, with a musical pocket watch used as a count countdown). Apart from that, I can not really add anything more. The actors performed well (with the exception of "Assassin Droid" whose performance was nothing outside the comic), but the film really lacked depth and purpose; It's just not enough to take up to an hour and a half of normal movie time. So we are stuck with the main characters who do not ask any questions for about an hour, until the ball begins to roll. For example, the main character returns to the same strip club about 4 times, occupying two-fifths of the film. <br /> <br /> The set lacked depth and creativity, probably because of the budget of the film. I do not think we've ever seen that "perfect city" in New Angeles that we've always talked about, in fact, when the main characters finally reached New Angeles, in a factory or warehouse filled with pipes and walkways; This is not really the kind of "kingdom" in which the owner / creator of an entire city would live. There was still talk of "high security" in New Angeles, but there were only 15 or 20 security guards, even when the alarm went off; Even if Matthias does not get close to a "hundred men at least". <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of one of the actors / actresses of this movie, then you might want to watch it, just to "add it to the list". However, if you are worth an hour and a half of your time, or $ 3.00 of your money, you may want to miss this one.
