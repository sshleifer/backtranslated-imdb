This film must have worked well at the box office, to give Gator the budget it deserves. This film had no budget, needed a rewrite of the script and a better ending. There are flashes of brilliance in this film. The scene of the boat ride, Burt driving the nasty machine, and his conversation with his parents. You can say that Burt is a Southerner and not an actor. This film shows what Gator, Burt's best film, looks like. Too bad, this movie did not have the same funding and was done on the Rush. 4/10
