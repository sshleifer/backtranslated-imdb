I can enjoy films with subtitles from foreign countries and especially those in which the subtitles are weak and do not really seem to follow the story or make sense, but this movie had too many parts that had not not really meaningful. <All in all, I can admit some scary and weird parts, but they are repetitive, I felt like watching a trailer in a loop; It looks like it's a short film shot with different actors. <br /> <br /> In the veins of RINGU and GRUDGE, but not even the hype ... the excessive length has killed the thrill. <br /> <br /> Unless you're a hardcore fan of these types of movies (which I thought I was), do not waste your time on this one.
