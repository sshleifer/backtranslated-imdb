To summarize, Mind of Mencia is the worst Comedy Central TV series, probably the least funny, and maybe even all TV ... of all time. I love Comedy Central and I watch a lot of shows and movies all the time, but every time the intro of this show starts even after a good comedy, I can not find the remote control fast enough. <br /> <br /> Mencia tells used, used racial jokes in a bad attempt at controversy, then will highlight the ethnicity of which he just spoke in the audience as to say "they loved, so all your race l 'love, and by extension me too'. Give me a Mencia break, I do not know if these people are plants or not, but it's not because you're going to see a black man and top five after one of your ridiculous jokes that he does not find you funny, it just means that you put it on the spot and what else will you do to hit on TV? He gives the impression that his jokes are deep, meaningful and provocative, which is evident in his commercials, but when you watch the show, almost 100% of what he says is common sense. He also claims that only smart people have some of his jokes, but you do not have to be smarter than a monkey to understand what he just said when he says that, maybe you must go finish Carlos, in 3rd year. The guy goes on saying that he says what others think only, but I think you'll find that if anyone thinks what he's saying, he understands that he's ridiculous, and that's why he does not never said. in the first place. <br /> <br /> In total, watch an episode and finish it if you must, because after watching an episode, you've seen them all. Why Comedy Central keeps on renewing this horrible show surpasses me. If you are looking for a good comedy, look elsewhere because you will find very few here.
