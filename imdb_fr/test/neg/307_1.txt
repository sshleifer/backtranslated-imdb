I checked this out at the Vancouver International Film Festival and I was not impressed. <br /> <br /> The only aspect of the film I enjoyed was the commentary on making a movie. For the most part, this film seemed random and somewhat fantastic (I do not say it in a complementary way) and just ridiculous. It was as if he mingled fantasy with everyday life, which may seem intriguing in some movies, but the imagination just seemed uselessly perverse. <br /> <br /> I do not criticize this film, but the story itself. I found it boring and narcissistic. I wanted to get my money back, but since it was a film festival, it was not going to happen.
