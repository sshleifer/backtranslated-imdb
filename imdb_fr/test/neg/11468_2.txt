I was looking forward to this film. Being a former Robert E Howard fan, mainly from Conan's point of view. <br /> <br /> I did not expect a lot and I thought they could not spoil it too much ... Oh my God, what was my problem ... <br /> <br /> > The main flaw was it was pretty dull. You had to go with a lot of supernatural fighting, sword fights and more. <br /> <br /> You have a little gore, but everything else is simply lifeless. The middle part seemed to involve 40 minutes in a muddy forest with horse-drawn chariots, slow dialogues and even slower character development! <br /> <br /> Positive Side = The costumes and effects were good, but not enough to keep your interest. <br /> <br /> I think it would have been better to soften the gore, speed up the tempo, and get a score of 12A. As a ten year old boy, I may have liked this movie. Probably about the same age when I was reading for the first time Conan's funny stories. Maybe that says a lot about my anticipation of the movie? <br /> <br /> Or ....... Go really "Art-House" with tone, direction, etc. But it's pretty risky so far with regard to Box Office. <br /> <br /> Oh well ... Maybe Conan's upcoming movie will compensate for that?
