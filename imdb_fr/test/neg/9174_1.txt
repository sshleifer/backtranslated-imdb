"First Snow" has an intriguing start. An old man tells his fortune to a street vendor, whose predictions are surprisingly correct. From this moment, the film is played as an episode "Twilight Zone" inflated. I am only talking about car trips, phone calls and paranoia. William Fichtner gives his usual interesting performance, but Guy Pierce is anything but a friendly character, disregarding the well-being of others for paranoia reasons. The end is particularly weak, with no benefit for the long-suffering public. Do yourself a great favor and avoid this one. Not recommended. - MERK
