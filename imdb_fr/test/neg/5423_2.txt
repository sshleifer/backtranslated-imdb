Obviously, this soap opera could have been manufactured at any time since the mid-forties. The cardboard games, the kings of the moon with lightning sewn on their aprons, you know the drill. This adventure is a Rocky Jones adventure, featuring the space police's relationship with the unbearable Bitch Queen of the planet Offeecious, a common planet that will not join the United Planets. When the noble messengers of intergalactic reason announce that Offeecious is in conflict with this other vaguely Slavic planet, Bitch Queen decides to blow up the other guys rather than evacuate his lands. This introduces a moral to the following effect: "The greatness of a nation does not lie in its country, but in its people", which is hammered five or six times during the culminating party. BQ's incessant speech about "OffEEeecious" provides relief for some seriously desirous effects of space. Is this a TV show?
