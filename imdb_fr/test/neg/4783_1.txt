I saw this film with very low expectations. I did not know much about it so I was not sure it was worth it. <br /> <br /> The story has managed to make you curious about the ruins to which they are going. The suspense persists when the Maya manifest themselves and force them to stay near the ruins. <br /> <br /> The film then goes from a moment to a suspense that has become useless. The amount of blood found in this film was not balanced against whether it was really necessary or if more was used for shock value. <br /> <br /> The fact that they did not try to fight the hell of the vine. They had fire and did not try to burn it, nor did they try to cut it with a knife to see if they could destroy it or not. They quickly jumped into the role of victim and their helplessness was not real. It reminded me of old horror movies where people screamed and screamed and did not have half a brain to try to defend themselves.
