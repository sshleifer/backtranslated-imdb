Totally unusual "jokes" that fall flat, an amateur acting game (with one or two exceptions), boring characters and a mediocre dialogue at best. After watching this film, you have to wonder how a producer could meet such a project and think: "I MUST do this movie." No wonder he could not go out in the room.
