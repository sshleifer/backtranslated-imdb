I watched this movie based on the comments of some who said it was bad but funny. But you must be warned that this film has the worst special effects ever produced. They make 1950s science fiction movies look like works of art. It's funny sometimes, but annoying for the most part. And to complicate the problem with very pathetic special effects, there is the total lack of logic that characterizes most of the events described. One of my favorites is where three of the characters fall hundreds of meters into a tunnel created by the arachnia and manage to find it completely enlightened. Apparently, arachnies have also managed to cling to the power grid. Very impressive. But this is only an example. And for what it's worth, the music is nil, the game is nil, the two pretty girls are boring, the odious guy is boring, the so-called handsome leading man is a geek, and the black girl who falls for him is a fool. His father is the worst actor I have ever seen. I am not sure that brief moments of humor can possibly compensate for this experience.
