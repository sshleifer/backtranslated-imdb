The director Jeremiah Checheck, who presented us with big budget problems such as "The Avengers" and the remake of "Diabolique", directed this scam of the concept Die Hard on a budget resembling that of Blair Witch. <br /> <br /> A Californian nuclear reactor is overtaken by Arab terrorists. But are you ready? - the terrorists are not Arabs; they are really disgruntled American soldiers who pretend to be Arabs! We discover that they do not really intend to blow up the reactor, but simply to make a statement. We do not know what the statement is, but never mind. So, there is really no threat. But then, one of the terrorists decides to go it alone and blow up the plant because he's a little crazy. So maybe there is a threat after all. But the army comes in and all the bad guys are killed. So, there was no threat. Oh, and a good guy is killed too. May this be a lesson for everyone. <br /> <br /> If all this seems confusing and you waste a little time, then you have the idea of ​​what to watch Meltdown is about. <br /> <br /> The scenario never bothered to present the characters or even to give personal details that could flesh them out or emotionally involve the audience. So we end up with one-dimensional characters: the expert that no one will want to listen to; the sergeant-trigger-happy; sticky politicians; the-dweeby engineers. The story goes from one incident to another in a formula made up of virtually every action movie you've seen. But almost every turn, when we think something is at stake, the script flickers and we discover that there is no worry. <br /> <br /> Like Die Hard, there's a policeman inside, unbeknownst to the bad guys. The big problem is that the cop is here .... A WOMAN! Oh, and she's hurt too. But not so bad, just enough to make her wince a few times. Oh, and instead of Bruce Willis' walkie-talkie, this policeman has a magic cell phone that works everywhere, even underground! When he does not shout at everyone, Bruce Greenwood - his granite jaw - tries to calm her against the walkie-talkie. He even makes a joke once, but we fear that his face will crack. After all, it's a serious business. <br /> <br /> But it's mostly scene after scene that people are arguing: the military expert argues in favor of waiting (his reasoning does not seem particularly strong, but he is supposed to be the smart guy in this movie then okaaaay); people in the White House argue with him; the sergeant of the army also quarrels with him; the nice Pakistani nuclear engineer is arguing with the main terrorist. The dialogue is totally B Movie and lines like "Stop the broadcast! STOP THE BROADCAST !!!" Maybe you want to roll off your couch and wonder if the characters are really referring to this foolishness. <br /> <br /> Perhaps to compensate for the lack of quality of the production, the work of the camera remains nervous in this fake documentary 21 The Grams style is supposed to give immediacy to the scene and to give energy to the stage, but the way it is applied here indiscriminately and amateurishly is downright annoying; even pretentious. Additional attempts to speed up the tempo are made with the addition of absurd black and white sequences randomly interlaced with the main action. But this too is pretentious and annoying, Blair Witch. In short, stylistic attempts seem very amateurish. <br /> <br /> Music is at the height of visual effects - it's a cheap synthesis and sound. A bit like a porn movie but with less melody and a lot more heartbeat. The graphic processing is terribly bad too: cheesy graphics in huge red characters scream "21h28" as if the timer really made a difference. <br /> <br /> Fusion can work as a marketing concept but it is clear that the script was a second thought. FX - which is part of Fox - brought together this cheese production and paid several million dollars on it. That's what I call a collapse!
