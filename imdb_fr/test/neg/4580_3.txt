I just saw the movie tonight in preview and it's a movie for kids. This does not improve or complete the original Disney movie in any way. There is a Scottish pastiche style all along, which is not helped by a weak writing (where the motivations are grouped by the picnic) and by an uneven and often uninviting game (despite what is read like a casting decent). I have no problem with the little dog - although there is some quality "Skippy the Bush Kangaroo" (see below) about his shots. <br /> <br /> * For those who do not know, "Skippy" was an Australian television series for children of the 1960s where the kangaroo would be an essential part of all stories. It is said that for poor old Skippy "to act", they stuck a rubber band in his mouth, which he then tried to pull with his paws - somehow, seeming to communicate with the human actors !!! Bobby has a similar range and you simply do not buy his series of heroic rescues. <br /> <br /> The advice would be to take children aged 8 to 12 years old. Below that, they might be scared. Above, if they or you like it, good luck to you, but it's strictly about making cut-out cardboard films for the less demanding. This is a missed opportunity, because Bobby's story is real and charming and this film can not deliver it.
