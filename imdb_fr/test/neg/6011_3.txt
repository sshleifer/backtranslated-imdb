I managed to avoid reading Hemingway in college. From what I could say, with his reductivist verbiage, he offered reductive narratives. This film-transfiguration of AF2A into a simplistic story, erased, elaborate, does not dispel my suspicions: a guy who can barely see an action on the European battlefield (Hudson) fall with a nurse (Jones), and conspires to spend time together. Hemingway's great contribution to storytelling was the romantic travel story? Who knows what these two lovers have in common? They are so generic. The film never evokes the absolute irresponsibility necessary to abandon the front in favor of a love affair. Both have a season on the Alps, straight from a J. Crew catalog. A number of the best scenes are undermined by a nerdy conventional melodrama elsewhere. The film continues to accumulate on tiny, improbable and unspecific details that fight the epic treatment. The cavernous hospital in which Miss Barkley works is practically empty, so no secondary plot can distract from the fragile story. Complicated, it is not. <br /> <br /> The work of the camera is better than average, with some superb location photographs. Director Charles Vidor (or maybe Huston?) Did some great things in the first hour with a big screen camera on the spot ... There are no cop-outs for the second unit. Vidor shows massive panoramic paintings, panoramas on a line of hundreds of soldiers crossing the mountains; and then, at a 90-degree angle from his camera, catches up with Hudson's ambulance. <br /> <br /> Hudson is superb. It's a better actor than it deserves, but with such an original material, it can become very mechanical. Mercedes McCambridge plays a one-dimensional shrew. Jennifer Jones is bloated and miscast in the dull female lead. The film is better when it is off screen. Love scenes are as important as a coffee advertisement.
