This film is an incredibly complacent character piece that assumes that the mere impression of a story is worth a real story. It was extremely painful to watch and if I had not been seduced by the purchase of the DVD because of John Travolta and positive buzz, I would not have finished watching it. <br /> <br /> This film lacks something that looks like an interesting premise and seems to rest on a heavy (and downright heavy) characterization. There is a scene of altercation between Purslane and Bobby Long in which a destroyed television is incredibly flaccid and untimely when it is broadcast. <br /> <br /> I found myself less and less concerned about the characters. looked. It was probably very amusing for the cinema to do it. But it's terribly boring to watch. A film school project indulgent and pretentious, you should not waste money.
