If Halloween 5 was a cruel joke for fans of the series, then Halloween 6 would be a vicious insult. The scenario was transmitted to all dogs. Michael is used as a helpless pawn in this movie and he is not afraid at all. It makes me think of an overweight boogeyman alcoholic man who had frightened our hearts from the start. There is almost no usable quality in this feature and I am so happy that H20 was released, as it would be an insult for fans to bring it back to mind. <br /> <br /> Halloween 6 had about 2 aspects that I liked. Having an adult Tommy Doyle in the movie was a good idea and tied it to the original. Donald Pleasance is here (in his last performance ... what a bad movie to end a great career). When it's on the screen, it reminds you of the good old days when Halloween was really scary. <br /> <br /> That's about it, my friends. The stem sequences are not original. One of them is a blatant scam of the Laurie / Michael hunt in the original. The other characters are terribly underwritten and are just not friendly. The music, which is one of the highlights of Halloween even when the film is bad, is tortured in this movie. we get a stupid rock version of the Stalk / Chase theme. What were they thinking about when they made this movie? <br /> <br /> * SPOILER * <br /> <br /> Their biggest mistake was to kill the character of Jamie (now played by another actress who did not see this character escape death) In two films, we are rooting for her and when she is killed in this film, you can only complain and realize that filmmakers do not worry when good characters are set in a movie. <br /> <br /> * END SPOILER * <br /> <br /> The less we talk about this embarrassment, the better it will be I wish it did not exist I suggest skipping this movie, and even 5, and d go directly to H20 because if you look at this, you might not want to see another Halloween movie.
