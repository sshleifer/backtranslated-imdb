It's a pretty bad film, but hey, this film is at least not as lame as the third Ghoulies movie. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's a bad movie in terms of writing, staging, playing and reality. everything in between. It has a story so weak, simple and ridiculous, that it also has little to do with the previous films of Ghoulies. He tries to connect the film with the first movie "Ghoulies", from 1985, but on the other hand, if they really wanted to connect this film to his predecessors, what were then the Ghoulies in this film? Instead, we have a few small people, played by Tony Cox and Arturo Gil, disguised as demons. The Ghoulies of the previous films were certainly not classic characters, but they nonetheless constituted the heart and soul of the film and also provided the movies with a certain amount of fun. It's like having a Gremlins movie without the Gremlins. <br /> <br /> The film is not really interesting to watch because it lacks tension, good humor, intriguing characters and basically everything you can imagine because it was assembled by people who, obviously, are not the most talented in their business. As in director Jim Wynorski's CV, with such films as "The Witches of Breastwick" and his sequel, "Alabama Jones and the Great Crusade", "House on Hill Hooter", "Scream Queen Hot Tub Party", "The Bare Wench "Project" and the suites "The Bare Wench Project 2: Frightened" and "The Bare Wench Project 3: The Nymphs of Mystery Mountain" and "The Da Vinci Coed". <br /> <br /> Yes, the movie is pretty silly and camper, but that's not really enough to reinforce this movie and give it extra entertainment value.You know, this is the kind of cheap movie with special effects, costumes, makeup and lame actors that no one has heard of since. <br /> <br /> This is still not the worst film in the series because of the reason why "Ghoulies III: Goulies go to college" is by far an even worse film, since it has had horrible humorous essays.This film at least still makes some attempts to be se good and professional, even if the end result is far from perfect. <br /> <br /> Poor film making and maybe only watchable for those who have seen the previous entries of Ghoulies. <br /> <br /> 3/10
