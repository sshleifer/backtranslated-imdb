It's probably the worst film I've seen in a long time. Independent or not, a solid writing is essential. Ditto to lead and play. I know that these actors can play (I saw them in Sporanos and more ...) but this film is very bad, very bad. Maybe it's the script, maybe it's the director. Probably a bit of both ..... Probably a lot of both! Technically OK, it's just bad, bad, bad ... I have a theory that says the sponsors of this movie are also owners of poker magazines, because I saw a very favorable review in one of the magazines. "Hey, we did it, so it must be good, right?" Not so fast Bucky. I know it takes a lot of work and money to make a film, which is even less sold and distributed, and for that I congratulate those people. But the final product, leave a bad taste in my mouth. <br /> <br /> P.S. I won a free rental and I chose this Blockbuster movie. Tomorrow I will get my money back.
