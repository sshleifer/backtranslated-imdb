This film "horror" lacks neither horror nor even a slight suspense. Even the gore is not good. The plot would have some promise if it was made by someone who cared about what they were writing / filming, but those who made this movie obviously did not know it. Basically, the film unfolds in a series of crises and begins: <br /> <br /> The main character insists that she is not crazy. <br /> <br /> "Milo" lurks in his yellow raincoat or rolls in front. of a car on his bike. <br /> <br /> The main character insists that she is not crazy and continues to talk about her passion as a teacher. <br /> <br /> Someone is killed unsatisfactorily. <br /> <br /> The main character insists that she is not crazy and that she raises some false sobs. <br /> <br /> Do we see a pattern here? If you do not, you can enjoy this movie. If not, watch for something else. The budget is low, low, low AND THAT SHOWS (contrary to what is said, THE EVIL DEAD, which makes you forget about its shitty budget), and the acting is bad, bad, bad (except possible from the concierge). In general, the movie is boring, boring, boring. I can not think of a single scene that is really well done. In fact, I did not like the movie so much that I turned it off ten minutes before the end, which I rarely do ... well, I watched the unmanipulated films MANOS, THE CLONES and WILD WILD West. <br /> <br /> 3/10. Save yourself and watch PHANTASM again.
