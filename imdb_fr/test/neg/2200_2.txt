This is basically just a silly hunting story, almost identical to the zillions of other pursuit stories in terms of interpretation, suspense, conspiracy, dialogue, characterization (or lack of it), and stimulation. . <br /> <br /> "Internet" differs from traditional hunting movies in its subject: computers. Unfortunately, the writers clearly did not understand the differences between a pocket calculator and a Cray! <br /> <br /> Beginners in computer science should not watch this film, it would make them paranoid vis-Ã -vis computers. No matter what Hollywood is trying to tell us, it's not so easy to erase someone's identity by hacking. There is still too much paper documentation in the world, and even more so in 1995. <br /> <br /> Computer professionals should not watch this film either. I mean, a magic virus that can melt your entire PC when you press "Escape"? Please. And all the virus, including the cool multimedia effects of the dissolution of your screen (what is it?) Can fit on a single disk of 1.44 MB? Yeah whatever.
