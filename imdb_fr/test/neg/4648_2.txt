Cameron Mitchell plays an actor who goes out with a young actress who was dating a movie studio director (she is too young for both of them!). At a party, when he lights his cigarette, the head of the studio throws a drink in his face and he catches fire. In the hospital, his face is completely bandaged and he always lights a cigarette! He becomes the resident sculptor of Movieland Wax Museum and Palace, where he also lights cigarettes! gray spackle and ribbon, and an eyepatch. When Mitchell does not smoke, he kills people. Well, he sometimes kills only people, because he prefers to inject something that places them in a sort of waxy coma. If he does not administer it regularly (and he never seems to remember), they start to move a little, although they are in a kind of hypnotic zombie state. However, not all his sculptures are characters. He obviously has talent as a sculptor. <br /> <br /> The end, which seemed to have been struck by a print much poorer than the rest of the film, is really absurd. They seemed not to know what to do and returned to the title for an idea. Aside from the strangely grainy final shots, the rest of the film is in pretty good shape, except for the sound of some scenes that seem to sound like it's been through a speaker. Certainly not one of the best wax museum films.
