Apparently, SHRUNKEN HEADS was the last movie in which Julius Harris played a role. I did not see all his films, but Julius Harris was in many good movies, and I remember best of "Live and Let Die" where he had played Tee-Hee and which was full of voodoo references, common here in South Florida! I always thought that LIVE AND LET DIE was a good movie because it had an atmosphere and a mystique, unlike most 007 movies. In SHRUNKEN HEADS, Julius Harris is back in his voodoo character! He has a great style for mystery and occultism, and his role in this film is excellent. Unfortunately, the rest of the movie is a comedy. SPOILERS: Three children who seem to have been fired from the distribution of THE LITTLE RASCALS are killed by a neighborhood thug who appears to have been fired from the FAME cast! or as a dancer on DICK CLARK'S AMERICAN BANDSTAND. In other words, these children give another dimension to LOW BUDGET. Julius Harris goes to Morgue-Funeral Home, cuts the heads of the three children (nobody notices) and then takes them to his condominium where he has a giant cauldron of boiling liquids. The three heads are mixed with herbs, spices and voodoo objects. At some point, Mr. Harris has the ugly little heads on a table and pours his blood on them, and they become talking heads! They can fly, make jokes, roll their eyes and take revenge on those who do evil. They usually look very funny to steal, but the effects are not bad. For some reason, one of the kids still has a switch in his mouth and he uses it to cut people's necks and drill holes in the tires. This film is strange and funny, but you only see it the first time. Meg Foster is in this movie and she looks bigger than Rosie O'Donnell and Meg plays the role of a male leader of local gangsters. Strange movie.
