"A comedy with biblical proportions! These masters of hyperbole, the writers of film lines, begin again; The sequel to Bruce, the all-powerful of 2003, barely raises a chuckle. The only thing that arouses my interest in this film, above its total indifference, lies in its Christian dogmatic nuances. Sorry, stick to the lyrics. <br /> <br /> Steve Carrel, ignoring Jim Carrey's good sense of refusing retaliation, plays Evan Baxter, Bruce Almighty's news presenter, who has just been elected to the convention. With a new life in Virginia and the stress of settling in a house the size of the Acropolis, the pressure of all changes weighs heavily on her family. His stepbrother (Lauren Graham), obviously flying from Stepford, and his three sons (Jimmy Bennett, Graham Phillips and Johnny Simmons), who look sad with a piano accompaniment, pray for the family to get closer and almost out of guilt, Evan too. <br /> <br /> In what must be the greatest shock of all time, God (Morgan Freeman) shows up, but does all that is annoying to "mysteriously work" the place by saying to Evan to build a Noah-esquire arch in preparation for a big flood instead of just giving it a pool table or X-box or something. And in the true style of mischievous divinity, he also forces Evan to grow beard, his hair long and wear worn and worn dresses. Now, at the time I'm sure razors were hard to come by, beard was inevitable for Noah, but I'm pretty sure it had nothing to do with spirituality. Even with the dresses; Massive construction work is certainly made all the more difficult by such impractical clothes. Could not God have imagined a pair of steel-toed boots and a hard hat for this poor guy? Apparently not. <br /> <br /> To paraphrase Bill Hicks, I find the idea that God is bothering us, and Evan too, fighting him with every step. And who would not? Essentially, God fires him, drives his loved ones away, makes him a laughingstock and threatens him at some point. Of course, God is right, and the father of the family, rational and hardworking, who was doing well alone, is obliged to eat a large portion of humble bittersweet pie. It's almost as if being left alone by God, Evan had to tolerate and please him. What kind of message is this? <br /> <br /> Evan Almighty has a very laudable environmental orientation, the underlying theme being that the federal government does not see the damage done to the world around us. It is also the first film to offset its carbon emissions, which should certainly be considered a historic accomplishment by a Hollywood studio. Without the banal and condescending banner of American Christianity flying above, Evan Almighty could have been a harmless family film, with a commendable environmental record. But with its confused religious dogma and relentless message of "blind faith", it is one of the most disgusting films of all time.
