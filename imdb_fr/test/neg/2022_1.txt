Space is a void, right? Therefore, the space is zero. Vampires are also void. A very bad vampire movie placed in space would double the power to suck, right? <br /> <br /> It started with what could have been a fun premise. Tell the story of Bram Stoker's Dracula in the future. A rescue team is sent to investigate a cargo ship, the Demeter, which was lost in space. Fans of the original novel will unintentionally assume that it will be a new version of Dracula in the future ... unfortunately, unless you share the names of the characters, this one takes the lowbrow route and enters the galaxy of movie B twenty minutes later. when Coolio becomes a vampire. Trust me when I tell you he is the best actor in the movie, and it does not say much. <br /> <br /> Casper Van Dien should peddle his wares on television. Erika Eleniak should have quit after leaving Baywatch and poor Udo Kier had trouble reading the checklists. The guy who plays Dracula in this one is more ridiculous than Frank Langella in the 1970s version. If you manage to sit all the way through the movie, you'll be rewarded with the worst end you can imagine. The end makes one wonder if the actors and the film crew understood what they were doing and left the set. <br /> <br /> Watch out, vampire fans. This one sucks twice as hard.
