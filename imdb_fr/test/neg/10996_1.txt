Poor editing, poor production values, poor continuity, improbable, bad dialogue ... this film is bad, bad, bad. However, if you want a movie to make fun (at the MST3000), it's your movie. I would not suggest spending a lot of money on it, but if you see this movie, make sure it's surrounded by friends full of spirit and wit.
