It's probably the most irritating sight I've ever seen in my life. It's indescribably the most boring and silly show I've ever seen. Everything is bad. <br /> <br /> Synopsis: Each parent is confronted each week with a different situation. <br /> <br /> I did not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several seasons. The script is bad, very bad ?? it contains both cheese jokes and unethical jokes that you normally see in R- or NC-17 rated movies. Especially for the character of a young boy where everything he does is to have fun, is this what is called the family show humor? The cast is also horrible because everything you see is a very bad actor, period. <br /> <br /> Word of the end: This show is a real torture! This show provides an image of how an irresponsible parent can be (use power wrongly rather than understand). He is zillion times of reality. Listen to Kenny G would be a god send compare to that. Watching the spinning washing machine would not hurt the eyes any more than this show. <br /> <br /> Rating: 0/10 (Grade: Z) <br /> <br /> Note: the show is so bad Even the mother of the cast pulls her daughter out of the show.
