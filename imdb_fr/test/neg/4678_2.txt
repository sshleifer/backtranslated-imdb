The name of Bad Company's biggest album is called "10 From 6". You could have edited this album and cut the sound of this movie. Most of the songs played in the movie come from this album. I guess the old people of the 1970s probably had enough of all the vintage pieces made in the 1930s and 1940s. That's how I feel about the movies made in the 1970s. movie sounded like an audition for Danny Terrio. Why should movies exaggerate the 1970s? "Freaks and Geeks" is the only good time I liked. They cut this TV show. It was exactly like high school when I was there, around 1980. I was old enough to remember the 70s and no small town looked like that. It was totally dominated by young people. There were no reactionaries speaking about hippies and downtown Philly. It was more the 70s than I remember when I was a child. This movie was very dull and old-fashioned. Sometimes I fell asleep. I do not know why an actor who played in the 70s appeared in this one. He was probably trying to give him some credibility. Walken did not even show up until the second half. I guess the only real thing about the movie was that the baby boomers were spoiled. All the kids in the movie were spoiled kids. I do not know what they had against their father.
