It's a pitiful film. What makes it even more pitiful is the time, effort and money spent on a super predictable scenario and action. <br /> <br /> This is a kind of monster and insects. Do not expect an explanation of the plot. There are not any. It could work if there were something interesting or characters that might interest us. There's no. Everything that happens to a person is as predictable as other Sci Fi movies. <br /> <br /> Do not try to understand what some characters say. They talk about gibberish, especially the annoying main woman, whose accent is a kind of British thicker than any old British movie you've ever seen. She is unintelligible. <br /> <br /> A lot of money is spent in beautiful scenery and landscapes, and this is the major crime of this movie because it's just not worth it.
