Nowadays, Asian horror films are among the best in the world, known for their atmosphere and their reflection of contemporary society. It's not one of those movies! Instead, "The Record" is a mediocre slasher film heavily derived from American movies such as "I know what you did last summer" and "Scream". The plot is familiar - five teenagers accidentally committed a terrible crime, but cover it up by swearing to keep the secret. A year later, they are harassed by a knife freak (with the disgusting disguise of a sterile hospital mask and an orange jumpsuit). This does not help teens form a generally unlikely group (it's one of those movies where the killer's motives seem pretty reasonable) and there are plenty of stupid scenarios to keep the story going. The direction of the film is subtle, more influenced by MTV than by current Asian horror movies (like "The Ring"). The last third of the film is not so bad though, with some decent suspense scenes, although there is probably a "twist" too much in the end. 4/10
