I think Trash is really bad. I watched it a few weeks ago and I have not seen that kind of film in the cinema since John Waters' Female Trouble and it was even worse. Dialogues, the actors' game; it was really bad, it was so bad that it made me want to leave the cinema and ask for a refund of my money. But in fact, I'm glad I saw it, because I could then give my honest opinion about it. We should see this movie, even if it stinks.
