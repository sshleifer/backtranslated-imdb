It seems that Dee Snyder ran out of ideas in the middle of the screenplay. The second half of the movie is basically a cover of the first, which makes the movie very boring. To summarize: Cop's daughter is taken to a party via a cat where she is sexually assaulted / tortured by a psychopath (played by Snider). The cop saves her, the psychopath is put into therapy / prison. Psychopath is released four years later and all is played again. In all of this, there are many unexplained plot elements: Why was Captain Howdy psychopathic in the first place? What about the punctual personality detour to the bible thumper? How does he remove all adults and how can he sew his mouth without wrestling? And perhaps the biggest unresolved mystery of all ... How does a 6'2 "pink-haired man hide behind a 5'6" average-sized woman? These are just some of the questions I had while watching this movie. <br /> <br /> It seems that Snyder has attempted to comment on a) the "dangers" of online discussions, b) the hypocrisy of Christian sexual mores, and c) the effect of our puritanical society twisted upon us as individuals. If so, he failed. The film is just too bad to entertain, especially not to convey social messages. The scenes of torture are stupid and boring, almost silly (especially when Snyder enters one of his monologues "pain and death"), and all the rest is just silly. The "call tracking" scene is really lame ... when are the cops going to have caller ID and * 69? The young partner of the main character of the police is particularly awful ... he should not be an actor, basically. And the audio in the final confrontation scene is really mediocre. I guess they could not afford two boom microphones? <br /> <br /> The rest of the game is not good, but it's not good either. The policeman is a pretty note and its detached quality is not quite credible. Dee Snyder is not really bad, but he grumbles a lot too much. Robert Englund (who deserves much better) stages a fun performance of a hypocritical redneck. If you are a big fan of Robert Englund, the movie is probably worth seeing, just for him. Everyone is unforgettable. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, we have seen all these elements of the plot made before and better, in films like SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, HELLRAISER and TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE. I suggest you rent one of these instead of watching this turkey. 3/10. <br /> <br />
