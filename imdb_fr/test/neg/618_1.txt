Lance Henriksen is chic to be the top name of a B movie, even in this case alongside Charles Napier, the Master Control program, and Joe Don Baker. As always, he does a great job as a villain, but the plot is just bad (do not even talk to me about the end). And the editing is so horrible that it could actually be a thing of beauty. Is it just me, or does it seem that Joe Don Baker was integrated into the film at the last minute? Moreover, whenever glass is broken in this film, the editing is so anti-phenomenal. Finally, after watching this, I think David Warner is dying for Tron 2.0 to finally get the green light. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately for Felony, it will be the third movie I rate 1/10, Iron Eagle IV and No Mercy.
