I am not sure of the interest of making this film. It seemed that this was done by a historical society to show in your local museum "Pistol Pete". At first, it seems like this could be the beginning of a Mad TV or SNL skit. But then the joke is on you when there is no punchline and you realize that someone was taking it seriously. The story was not bad but the inclusion of SASS members seemed to be a ploy (which worked) to make me see the movie. I swear that the trailer has listed all the characters in the movie until "dead cowboy # 5". The reason westerns are so entertaining is the atmosphere and the characters it brings. I just had the feeling of watching civil war actors disguised as cowboys. Not worth the digital video on which it was recorded.
