This movie really hurts to watch. Not only did I not laugh once, but ended up having a severe headache. Sometimes I felt so sorry for the actors involved. The best way to summarize it is to note that among sexual comedies, it's probably the least funny and the least sexy of all time. I am only sorry I can not give a vote of less than one. Giving a rating of one is an insult to every movie that scores two or better. <br /> <br /> Now, I see they are filming a sequel. To hear that someone really pays these people to make another film convinces me that there is too much money in Hollywood. Increase their taxes !!! To follow up on this film could very well be a crime against humanity; perhaps an international tribunal should be called or sanctions applied to the directors. <br /> <br /> In short, it's a very bad movie. Really really.
