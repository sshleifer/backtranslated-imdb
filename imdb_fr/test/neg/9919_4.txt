Story of a teenager in rebellion against a teenager who rebelled against the church and her minister father in a small Norwegian village. The countryside is picturesque, but the story is rather pretentious and painful, with much of the film dedicated to the scripture quote. It's like watching a religious propaganda film. Theisen, who has shot only one other film, is pretty good as a sensitive young protagonist, just like Sundquist as his strict father and Riise as a woman who fascinates Theisen. The film is fresh and charming but feels tired and stale. Director and co-author Nesheim, who has worked mainly on television, is not up to the task.
