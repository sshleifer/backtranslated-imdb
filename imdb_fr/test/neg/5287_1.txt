The role of actor was very mediocre. Costas Mandalar played the role of Triple H's forestry brother, a Scott McMahon look-alike, who is his representative and who I suppose should interest you, but there is no emotional implication anywhere. You have the stupid lesbian, not that I have something against lesbians, I do not just stupid who run constantly in a bug like a shirt and a grunge like a hat that does not stop to ask if someone one saw his dead lover. <br /> <br /> The villain could be scary and there's a moral story somewhere about fighting age and death, but it's lost in this movie. Costas Hurst Helmsley reports to the victims soon the way back to town, while it is obvious that he has lights of the city behind him. <br /> <br /> A bad pronunciation of Ed Gein, but pronounced it Gine. As a citizen of Wisconsin. We had our share of the monsters Gein, Dahmer and McCarthy, but if you are going to use it, pronounce it correctly. <br /> <br /> God, why am I watching all these terrible movies? Oh yes, I am a punishing greedy and I watch them so you do not have to.
