Remember the worst wooden and non-dramatic literary adaptations of the 1970s? You will see it when you see this piece of adaptation to the chocolate box both widely operated and unintentionally hilarious. The most guilty of all is Catherine Z-J who, while undeniably pleasing to the eye, replaces the fact of grazing a great dress and appearing sensual to actually turn a performance. Played in the face of a poet like a melodrama, or at Cold Comfort Farm without jokes, this effort is not facilitated by a screenwriter who listens to the dialogue that completely misses the sense of irony or tragedy of the novel. Too bad, given the quality of the acting talent proposed - Joan Plowright, Claire Skinner, Steven Macintosh all deserve better than that.
