Six students of a convent do the unthinkable: kill a domineering nun. Eighteen years later, the spirit of the nun is back and takes revenge for her murder. <br /> <br /> Yes, that's all. There is more than that, but I still have no idea what it is. The only really great thing is the effects on the spiritual nun because I was pretty impressed to be a low budget movie. I do not understand it either in English or not. Most of the actors are Italian, and even the title is in Italian, but they spoke English in the movie (I think, or maybe it would have been dubbed, I still can not say). <br /> <br /> Anyway, the real premise of the film is rather silly, and the end does not make sense, it does not make sense.
