I was ready to love "Where's Poppa", which features the group of actors from the Normal Lear sitcom who, when I was growing up, felt like extended members of my broken nuclear family, the size of a RASENETTE . As it would be fun to see Barnard Hughes without censorship, Vincent Gardenia, Ron Liebman, Rob Reiner and Garret Morris prior to SNL. <br /> <br /> But alas, "Where's Poppa" hangs out. Claustrophobic and trampling, he breaks the essential rules of farce, lightness of mood and speed. <br /> <br /> The plot involves the efforts of a lawyer (George Segal) to get rid of his invasive Jewish mother, who lives in her gigantic apartment in New York. Along the way, we are exposed to ridiculous characters and situations: a humorous group of attackers who constantly assault the main character's brother, the rape of a policeman involving a gorilla costume and the subsequent gay love Ruth Gorden pulling down Segal's pants and nibbling her ass as he serves dinner. Why it does not work? Part of the explanation is the unhappiness caused by the dark, narrow interiors and the ancient decorations. I absolutely ate New York's cinematography at that time, but watching it made me feel like I was flipping through the Police Gazette in a dark bus terminal. <br /> <br /> The main reason is slowness. The modern MTV style fast cuts have changed what is seen by moviegoers as a comfortable editing tempo, but, even with this in mind, the shots are kept too long. Field developments are also very slow. It works in a given situation: a strange love song that George Segal sings for Trish Van Devere, softly, very close to his face and for an extremely long time. It reminded me of those long, interesting shots of the British version of "The Office," in which you find yourself mentally begging the camera to cut, and at the same time, you can not stop to watch. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, most of the film is more "in a hurry" than "can not look away". Which made me wonder if it is possible to have a black comedy that is also a joke. The dilemma is that the gravity of the subject in a black comedy tends to weigh down the lightness of the joke. Films such as Robert Altman's "M * A * S * H" and Kubrick's "Dr. Strangelove" prove that this can be accomplished. They do it not only by speed, but also by fun secondary intrigue, which "Where's Poppa" neglects. <br /> <br /> Although the film has many stereotypical characters, they are almost all directly involved in the central drama. how to deal with the recalcitrant mother. The scenes featuring Garret Morris and the Central Park assailants are as close as the viewer gets to a mental break. The attackers seemed almost Shakespearian, following the tradition of the comic ne'er-d0-wells. If the rest of "Where's Poppa" had hung a little closer to the theater tradition, it would have been a better film. Edgier is not always better. It's as if all these talented actors and director Carl Reiner were taking a short film before the creative maelstrom of the 70s. <br /> <br /> Random notes: after stealing Ron Liebman's clothes, the attackers mention the film "The Naked" by Cornel Wilde Prey "(1966), a great action movie that was a stylistic precursor for" The Planet of the Apes "of 1968. <br /> <br /> As politically incorrect as it either, it's disturbing to hear of the death of such a great action hero as Charleton Heston.Linda Harrison, who played "Nova", Taylor's mute companion, said that James Fransicus, in the sequel, seemed to be cute and tiny compared to Heston.
