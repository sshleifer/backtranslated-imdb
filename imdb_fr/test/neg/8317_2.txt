I do not know in which neighborhoods live the people who wrote the rave reviews for this film, but I'm glad I'm not here if they do not comment on the caricature of this thing. Okay, we learn to suspend our disbelief in movies like the "Die Hard" series, but see little Jodie knock down a complete street gang, with a Glock, as NOVICE, it's still ... go . All she needed was a bald head and a torn t-shirt to become Bruce Willis. <br /> <br /> Apparently, Jodie as executive producer has blinded her to the joke and the waste of her money. Or she lived a kind of fantasy where she is the only blonde and all others are a black or Hispanic brunette. Even the dog is black. Little Blondie is the only person who is good and (with the exception of a black policeman), all the other inhabitants of the city are a nasty minority who want to look for her. Has your fear of your acting talent so diminished so far that you think the only way to get noticed is to be the only bright spot (literally) in front of a camera in a neighborhood / movie / dark, gloomy and dark cast? Apparently she thought she was in the wrong movie ... The Dark Knight. <br /> <br /> Ridiculous field holes, chewing furniture game, gratuitous violence ("Look at the girls, now you can do it too!"). .. Spend time with your family instead of watching this drek.
