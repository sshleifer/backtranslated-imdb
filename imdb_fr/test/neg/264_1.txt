Oh, how critics rushed to praise their goldenboy Paul Schrader (author of Taxi Driver) when this movie came out. I never saw the qualities they detected when I watched this movie during the day, so I saw it again to see if I was wrong. Mishima is extremely uninteresting. It is a cold and unusual film about a writer living / working in a cold and abstract culture. Flat reenactments do not catch your attention as they are emotionally drifting and catchy. And the rest is just awful ... with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they engage in, the purity, the admiration of the swords, and so on. <br /> It must be a triumph when you learn that you have landed Philip Glass; but then you have to get something from him. Glasses Score offers no distinction from its other work, nor does it give the film a perceptible value. In 2010, it should be clear to all that Schrader has squandered his career for work without impact or importance (Cat People, AutoFocus, Light Sleeper, Patty Hearst, American Gigolo). It can bother you in pieces and break the momentum of a movie, faster than anyone. Schrader made a resume filled with ugly and amateurish films.
