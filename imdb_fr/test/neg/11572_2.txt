Jim Wynorski had to let the imagination slip when he wrote the screenplay for it. It does not bother me that the animal scenes are almost identical, but that the actors repeat replicas of other films, they go a little too far. I enjoyed seeing Jay Richardson and Glori Ann Gilbert being eaten. Gloria brings nothing to a movie except her breasts (my husband's feelings). Jerri Manthey should stay on the island of survival. Her game is stiff, amazing and she's just a dodo. loved the scene where the cobra comes from the ocean eats the guy then for the extra flavor destroys the filthy. At least we know that the next man with the giant snake eliminates komodo before becoming a dad in an egg nest. Jerri would be great as a Cobra mother. sit down with a 6 pact or a couple of joints. it will relieve the pain.
