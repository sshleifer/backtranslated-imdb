Sometimes funny but generally boring. I recognized Robert Hegyes of Welcome back Carter (aka Epstein) as a former criminal. There is a scene of slamming knees and guts in which the French has reacted badly to American food. S. Baio, S. Kellerman and Tom Arnold are billed but play a minor role. You never know the characters and it's hard to worry about what's happening to them. Not recommended.
