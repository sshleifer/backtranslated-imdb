Wow ... just ... wow. There are already a lot of reviews on this film but I wanted to add some comments from myself. I agree with most of the critics who said that this film had a dramatic role to play, write and direct - whoo boy always does it. However, I think there are other problems here. <br /> <br /> 1. Why are Christian beliefs and extraterrestrial living allowance mutually exclusive? The film acts as if you simply could not be Christian and allow for it? Why? They approach this very briefly in the film (ie "The Bible does not say there are extraterrestrials." "Well, the Bible does not say there are any But the real answer never gets an answer The Bible does not really say that there is not, so why not settle the issue instead of leaving it out or better, recognizing that it is an infinite universe in which we live and if we believe in an infinite God, is it possible that he had another life somewhere and that he has his own projects? <br /> < 2. How is it that the only valid explanations for the kidnappings that are valid are the demons and the hoax - nocturnal terrors related to kidnapping experiments - and if that was something else? Too bad that the filmmakers already have their opinion taken. <br /> <br /> 3. The filmmakers say that all those who have experienced abduction experiences have had links to the occult. This is a pretty big claim to make without any factual proof to present. I'm not necessary to argue that they do not, but if you're going to say something so well, you'd better have facts to confirm it. <br /> <br /> 4. Why does the other reporter (not the blond guy with oily hair, the other) still have his hands in his pockets? It's hard to take someone seriously when he's constantly playing at the pool. <br /> <br /> I wish this to have been an exploration of the Christian faith and UFO phenomena, but unfortunately the filmmakers were too concerned about their "Message of Faith" "to care a lot about making a film that makes As a Christian myself, it saddens me.
