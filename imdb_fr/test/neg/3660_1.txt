I know that if I were a low-budget filmmaker, I would probably check this page to find out what people are saying. So I really hope the creators of the movie read this! I think you should find a way to pay me back for the hour and a half of the life I've just lost looking at this garbage. Stop making movies about something that probably makes you dream. Just stop doing movies together ... you're one of the reasons why it's so difficult for independent filmmakers to succeed. Do the world a favor and get a job like McDonalds or something so that you can do something productive with your life! I want to call blockbuster to complain that they actually carried this movie in their store.
