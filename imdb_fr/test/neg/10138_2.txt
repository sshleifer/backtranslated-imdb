Reba is a very stupid show. You can predict just about anything that will happen. Barbra Jean is too stupid. It's like she's not even a character. A show like this should at least have SOMEONE who looks like a real life person. I imagine Barbra Jean is a retarded person. Keira or whatever his name is, Reba, Brock, they're all stupid! Keira is like the smartest person in the show and she's still stupid. EVERYONE IS STUPID! That's my opinion on Reba. Since I said all I can say on this show, I will simply repeat the following lines of text saying what I'm saying right now and do it up to 10 lines. The. Reba gets 2/10.
