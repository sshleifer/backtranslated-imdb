OK, this movie is the worst show I've seen in years. The actors were not so bad (I thought it was a serial movie, so they played the role of group movie). Anyway, I watched this movie, thinking, OH COOL, a UFO Sci-Fi movie. FALSE. It was just an excuse for radical Christians to send a message to people. The last scene was extremely messed up. It's a horrible thing to do to make someone believe in something. What someone believes is a matter of opinion. This film shows how corrupt religion is, especially Christianity. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a B movie, that's not the case. If you want to watch a movie that tries to wash the brain of the masses. Well it's the choice of litter. go well. If you want to convey a message, do it, do not force it. Ridiculous, that people are abusing the media to such a degree. Especially Christians.
