What? - That was it? The city sheriff (John Agar) detonates the mutant gorilla with a dynamite stick hidden in a manikin? Did I just write this? Have I seen this? <br /> <br /> With Wildcats instrumentals, "Night Fright" is a movie that never deserved to be played as late as 1967. The glorious era of the gorilla was over and anyone other than Ray Corrigan was a monkey. suit is just asking for trouble. Do this again in black and white and set the story about thirty years earlier and you will get at least a rating of 4.0 on the IMDb base. But unfortunately, this one should never have had the chance to see the day. Oops, there's another quirk - you can never tell if it's day or night in the story, as they seem interchangeable with each other. <br /> <br /> I'll give you this though, some of the first scene maltreatments seemed to be able to be aired as Coca-Cola ads. Thinking about it now, it was probably the most beautiful and best-lit scenes in the photo; Coca Cola must have paid for them. Had they seen the movie finished, they might have been better served to prevent it from coming out.
