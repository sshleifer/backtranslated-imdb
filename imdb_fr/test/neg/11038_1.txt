Let me fix the problem before throwing this film: I like the work of Park Chan-Wook as a director. Although I do not agree with the masses claiming he is the best director of our time, I can not deny that he understands how to use a camera very effectively. I really liked one of his other films, Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance. In addition, Min-sik Choi's acting was the only thing that allowed me to take this film seriously. . . <br /> <br /> Now the bad: The plot is simply the oldest cliché used in cinema / literature. I will never understand how critics can denigrate a Hollywood blockbuster for cliché, and hail movies like Oldboy, which are just as insignificant and clichés, if not more. Be that as it may, Oldboy is one of the most generic and original films ever made. * Spoilers * The man is held prisoner, the man seeks revenge, the man discovers that he has had sex with a family member, the life of the man is over. * End spoilers * In simple terms, this plot has been used in everything from Greek plays to modern melodramatic soap operas to countless movies / books. It's so melodramatic and unoriginal that when the major revelation happens, I burst out laughing. Does that mean that I am a desensitized maniac without emotions, as some critics of this film say about people like me? No. What this means, excessive intrigues make people laugh. The Scary Movie franchise proved it, and Oldboy proved it too. Why can not people think of something that is really disturbing instead of just throwing up old-fashioned clichés masked by sophisticated camera work and classical music? This raises the issue of blood / blood. In simple terms, it is not there. The director is too shy to even point the camera at the screen when something "bloody" happens, like we're watching a children's movie or something. Maybe we were. Anyway, I heard Oldboy call "the most brutal movie of all time" and "the most disturbing movie of all time", but when I looked at it, I have nothing seen, even distantly or disturbingly. All the "gore" is off-screen, and even then, the level of violence is not what you've never seen in PG-13 movies like The Dark Knight or Casino Royale. Why did it even have an R-rating confuses me, let alone "the most brutal film of all time". Seriously, I've seen movies that give Oldboy a cute look on all levels of violence / bloody. <br /> <br /> The other flagrant and old-fashioned flaw is the main villain. He spends most of his time on the screen showing his naked buttocks to the public in the comical style of American Pie, but am I supposed to think he's really mean? When he wears clothes, his hair is smoothed back like a bad Asian mix of the craziest James Bond villain, mixed with something from Austin Powers. He talks like a brain-dead teenager who is recovering from an overdose of acid and his dialogue is so painful that it made me laugh again. Seriously, Oldboy made me laugh more than any other comedy this year. . . <br /> <br /> In the end, Oldboy is meant for those who sip a good wine, have no sense of humor and tell how boring your life is at dinner. This is for people who are so stuck in their own ego that they have forgotten how unimaginative they are, and therefore how "boring" movies (never the "movies") they enjoy are boring. <br /> To know more Here is what I can say is that I like "movies" and also "movies". I like thoughtful dramas that really talk about the human condition, and I also like useless action movies that make me vibrate in a coma. But the thing is that for me to like "movies" and "movies", they have to be original. They must be something I have not seen so many times that I have lost count of the number of times the plot has been used. When something is not original, it's consumable. If that's exactly what others are doing, it's forgettable and boring. Before giving Oldboy a new perfect score, because it touched you, maybe you should think of something: would not a movie be so touching, but at the same time original, would it make you think more? I just want someone else to understand that. <br /> <br /> Overall: Oldboy is forgettable and nerdy. <br /> <br /> 1/10
