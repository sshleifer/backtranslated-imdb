Phew! What can be said about this strange and amazing travesty fantasy of Ed Wood? Well, a word that comes to mind is incoherent! Wood uses raw slabs of harmless and accessory footage and builds a "story" around them - and what a story !! Wood himself plays the role of Glen, a Joe regular who just likes to bask in his fianc√©e's lingerie and sweaters. I think what Wood wanted was a plea for tolerance for all the Glens of this world by showing that Glen is like every one of us below, but in angora. Ummm ... ok. But then, we get this very odd montage of a horny devil, a chick in slavery, rude and sharp people, moore archive footage and finally an emaciated Bela Lugusi, playing a kind of Puppetmaster twisted and invalid. Lugosi is a scream that throws garbage such as "Beeevaaare ... the dragon beeeg greeeen who walks to your door: he loves boys, puppy tails and beeeeeg snails!" Uh, ok, Bela ...: = 8 / There's a strange and twisted type of Wood's logic going on here. After all, he reminds us that "7 out of 10 men wear a hat and 7 out of 10 men are bald". Hmmm, it must be this alien / transvestite / clothing cowspiracy-thang !! Glen or Glenda feature a plethora (of whatever ...) of reliable Wood schlock actors, including Lyle Talbot, Delores Fuller and Timothy Farrell, and Wood convinces each of them to say nothing. . Everyone now knows the sad story of Bela: by the time Wood used it for this film, he was probably looking for a solution and needed the moolah, but even for him, this depth is unmatched. One of MooCow's favorite wooden films is accompanied by the buffalo stock scene - he's so mad! The MooCow says "Puuuull of schtriiiiings", and believe hooves on a copy of Glen or Glenda - you will not believe it! : ??
