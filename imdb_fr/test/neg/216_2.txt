How do you take a cast of experienced and well-known actors and do you make such a stupid movie? Nimrod Antel has the answer: armored. Six employees of an armored car company decide to steal a large amount of cash themselves. But when they get to first base with their plans, everything goes quickly. With a plot like this, you would think it could not be too bad, at least for an action movie. However, in the first 40 minutes or so of this movie, we see what appears to be 6 normal types, everyday guys. They joke, laugh, drink a few drinks together, and so on. Then we suddenly learn that they intend to steal their own business. The hero Ty (Columbus Short) is sucked into the scheme because of the cold and cruel world, even if he is a decorated veteran, a nice guy and a reliable employee. Oh my, oh my! Then, during the last 40 minutes of the film, these former ordinary guys almost all turn into psychos crazy money, ready to slaughter for money. In the last scenes, Mike (Matt Dillon) makes a suicidal rampage for no other reason than to kill his old friend. The viewer has no idea before this end that these men are so ruthless and bloodthirsty. It's absolutely amazing and "movie B" is almost too nice for this kind of nerdy plot. I would say: do not waste your time - a pity nobody gave the same advice to Laurence Fishburne, Jean Reno or Fred Ward before taking this picture.
