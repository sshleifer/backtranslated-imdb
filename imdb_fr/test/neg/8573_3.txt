I thought this movie would be totally different from another teen slasher. Well, I was totally wrong. There is a liquid nun coming out of the toilet seat and something very strange. I know that the Spanish culture is a little different and their films too, but I did not expect to see a fake Hollywood movie. They have certainly done very well. Why did they make a film without new aspects? It's just boring and it's totally unimaginative. <br /> <br /> I thought having a nun as a villain in the movie would be something really original. He turned out to be a teenage slasher. If it had been done ten years ago, it would have been something new. <br /> <br /> I can not recommend this film to anyone, but it certainly has a comic value! It's like a parody of horror on certain points.
