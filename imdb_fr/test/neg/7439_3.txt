A useless cash-in with nothing to contribute except wickedness, it is a very specific case of seconds neglected for Robocop. Irvin Kershner, insane, less complicated and less tired, is visible, even slightly entertaining, in a dubious and uncomfortably chaotic way, but he hardly has the flair, the emotion, the intelligence or the excitement of the 'original. Instead, we have just another empty show of a blockbuster whose only reason to exist seems to be to provoke the spectator's nausea with incessant violence, which is much more free than that of the original. Omni Consumer Products, which created the original Robocop cyborg, has become a totalitarian force more than ever, once again, with the suspicious Nazi banners, stormtrooper guards and late-night chariots; As for the anonymous old man (Daniel O'Herlihy), he is less a benevolent protector than the ugly type of Mr. Burns, surrounding himself with stupid lackeys who sincerely believe that it is imminent to place the brain of a murderous psychopath. in the body of the man. the brand new Robocop 2 is a good idea. Oh, and the first Robocop has a glimpse somewhere in the middle of all this bazaar, although you're wondering what a good actor like Peter Weller is in the screenplay. Funny Tom Noonan has nothing to do with the villain, while Nancy Allen is seriously wasted as a partner of Robocop. There are hilarious moments all along; the first "Magnavolt" advertisement, for example, but it is a poor follow-up of the true great original.
