Apparently, in early 2005, SciFi Channel threatened to publish the incriminating photos of John Rhys-Davies and said, "We need you to play in another SciFi Original." The scary thing is that it is really very good in this movie. It's really saying something since it's a stupid creature characteristic of SciFi; you have to put in a little time to be well played. Unfortunately, no one else is doing it. This is your stereotypical movie "moster-run-amok" on a cruise ship. The cryptozoologist wants to keep the creature alive, the Navy SEAL think they have everything under control but do not know what they are dealing with and they all end up dead, a girl jumps in the role of "sexpot" Rhys- The girl Davies and the creature curse about 100 shipmates. What this film aims to do is VERY fast and lively; you never get bored or wait. Apart from that, however, he does nothing to distinguish himself, and it is silly that this thing creeps all over the ceilings and can not be hurt by Navy SEAL machine guns, but that it may be subject to submission by the daughter of Rhys-Davies. . Kinda went and came by giving this bad boy a 5, but for the stupidity above, I give him a 4.
