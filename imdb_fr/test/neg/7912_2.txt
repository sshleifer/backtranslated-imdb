After watching all the episodes of the Star Trek television series several times since the 1960s, most of them being pretty good to great, and very few being mediocre, my opinion is that this one is the worst of all. <br /> <br /> Actually, I think it's so badly executed that the series is embarrassed. It's not that the story is so bad, although it's not particularly remarkable in any way, but the acting is simply catastrophic on the part of the two main characters, that is, other than the regulars in this case. Barbara Anderson had her worst performance as a daughter of a mass murderer and is on a mission. She practically calls the role from a phone and shows no real emotional ability here. Although in most of her film and television roles she has only used pretty faces, usually small pieces, she has done a lot better. <br /> <br /> Arnold Moss, his father giving a new meaning to the term "Ham" and is the only actor to ever play in a 1960s Star Trek episode that surpasses William Shatner in this field and confers on Shatner looks great in comparison, and he has to play a Shakespearean actor no less, which gives him more impetus to overactivate, and he does it. <br /> <br /> Other than these two roles being so weak, the story is such that anyone who has any meaning whatsoever can tell who the killer is in the first 15 minutes.I say this because I told my brother the whole plot that ended at the first advertising break when we watched the original 1966 show as teenagers, her answer was, "Yes, you are right. <br /> <br /> Ignore this one and watch the much higher episodes of Menagerie that were originally televised just before.
