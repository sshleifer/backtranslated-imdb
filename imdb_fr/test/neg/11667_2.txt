Originally, I wrote what was a sarcastic and scathing criticism of this piece of pathetic dung, but every time I submitted the criticism, I got "it contains a very long word that is not allowed," words that are not misspelled are also considered incorrect. <br /> <br /> Now, the word considered too long has never been identified. After many attempts to eliminate the words, I finally had the suspicion that the IMDb website was politically sensitive and ready to reject certain words automatically. Nothing I wrote was obscene or racist in itself. But having eliminated all the words the longest, the same message was repeated over and over, even the words that were not judged misspelled were suddenly considered misspelled! <br /> <br /> are everywhere.
