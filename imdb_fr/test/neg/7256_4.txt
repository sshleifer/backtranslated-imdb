So you're a giant manta and have been dragging in the Arctic for a while, and you've had enough of it that the Eskimos hit you with snowballs. What is a giant mutant insect to do? Direction the big city, of course! See the sights, maybe attend a show on Broadway. But wait! Just when you find a nice, cozy tunnel, pesky humans start to attack you !! Argh! It's time to demolish! <br /> <br /> Anyway, this movie is a step ahead of most other giant bugs, as it offers decent effects for 1957. But that's about all . Avoid unless you really need to see another big bug crush things or see another Perry Mason actor in a B movie. <br /> <br /> 4/10
