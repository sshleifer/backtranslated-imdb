Lina McLaidlaw is a bright and lonely young woman who falls in love with Johnnie Aysgarth, a highly eligible single with a penchant for losing money. They get married, but almost immediately, Lina is dependent on Johnnie to lie, play and get into debt. Despite her flaws, she is unable to resist her charming way, until she begins to suspect that he can feed murderous thoughts towards her ... <br /> <br /> It's a good film, well done, with an attractive cast, a good script and perhaps the ugliest single that ends in the film's story. Ok, maybe it's going too far, but not much. Many movies change the end of a book (Great Expectations, The Shining, etc.), but the last two scenes of this book not only manage to be horribly lame, but also make the whole previous plot totally meaningless . The story tells the story of a woman whose husband is driven by her greed and her lack of morale - and by what she knows about it - to kill her. This should end (as in Francis Iles / Anthony Berkeley's book Before The Fact) while trying to assassinate him. The reason is that the studio forced Hitch to return to the end, one of the first examples of the sacred process of preview audience tests. Hitch was cautious and did what was said to him (it was only his third film in Hollywood), knowing that if he played the game, sooner or later, he would gain creative control of his films, like witness his masterpieces of the fifties. But that always leaves us with a turkey of an end. It's a shame because it's really a very good movie with an intriguing theme - does anyone really know her husband or wife as well? The scenario is excellent, with many moments out of play (such as when Lina's father dies and Johnnie supposes she's crying), a well-judged performance by Grant (who has never played a villain again) and a beautiful photography, culminating in the famous glass of milk. Fontaine won an Oscar for this performance, although personally, I prefer her confusion and vulnerability in her role as Rebecca's victimized wife. I would like to rate this movie higher, but I really can not forgive this ending; This is what happens when movies are made for money, not for love, which is curiously the theme of the film itself. Quickly search for Hitchcock's cameo as a man posting a letter.
