Romantic comedy films are certainly the most fertile genre for "below average" movies and a source of frustration for viewers. This one is a perfect example and got a place in my "Top 10 worst movies". <br /> <br /> The story is far from creative and the jokes are weak. I did not find any reason to laugh at one during the whole movie! The characters are clear and the performance of the actors and just good. The story is developing slowly, it's tedious and predictable. The end is also predictable and covered with sugar. <br /> <br /> It's a film you watch on a rainy Saturday afternoon when you have nothing better to look at IMHO.
