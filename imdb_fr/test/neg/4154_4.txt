An epic story of hope limited by the budget and limited artistic ambitions. Seeing what Terrence Malick was producing, I was expecting something haunting and lyrical. Instead, we get a typical Norwegian co-production ("Revolution" with Al Pacino, do you mind?), Where the good intentions are ruined by a terrible scenario and where many characters are reduced to stereotypes. The English dialogue "me-Tarzan-you-Jane" between non-English speaking protagonists is particularly cringeworthy ?? one might wonder if Nick Nolte and Tim Roth have published their own text because they look almost like real characters. The story is full of implausibility: Binh can be expected to speak a little English after living all his life as a peasant slave (his vocabulary, but unfortunately not the grammatical command, increases impressively in the camp. malay refugees benefit from evening classes). Coincidence is commonplace; I wonder if an hour or two have been changed since the first third: he finds his mother in Ho Chi Minh City almost immediately - after falling on his 30-year-old half-brother, who recognizes him nonchalantly! Mom gives her a gold medallion (or something similar, of great value) when they separate, but this is never mentioned again. His relationship with "Me Dead Inside", Ling, is supposed to provide "the interest of love", but feels as unnatural as Leonardo and Cameron in "Gangs Of New York". <br /> <br /> The journey through the bucket of rust on a boat gives an idea of ​​the appalling conditions involved in human trafficking. Indeed, the only time the film is both exciting and unpredictable, it is the jerky images, filmed by hand, which were filmed from the bridge in bad weather. (Incidentally, a boat cruise from Malaysia to New York through the Cape of Good Hope and the African coast, without stopping for fuel or supplies, is certainly an epic journey). The beautiful picture of the New York skyline echoes Malick's use of the magic hour, but I want to know why the Coast Guard did not show up. Maybe they were watching the Super Bowl or something. Of course, Binh manages to find his old blind father on a remote farm in Texas, with the same style of navigation he posted in Ho Chi Minh City. I was impressed by the way Nick Nolte could wander the fields and dig fields and feed the horses on a large ranch without the help of a guide dog or a white stick. To show how a story about the suffering of refugees can be structured and shot on a budget, take a look at "In This World", a film much better than Michael Winterbottom.
