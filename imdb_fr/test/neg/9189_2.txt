First of all, I'm not a firefighter, but I'm part of a firefighting unit (the guys who are called in the event of an earthquake and the real firefighters need more personnel for the operations of RS). but I have no experience of real life. <br /> <br /> But there are still some points that we notice as being totally incredible. I can understand that they have removed the mouth / nose masks and that there is not enough smoke, otherwise the public would see nothing. But some things defy logic: <br /> <br /> - No second mask attached to oxygen. How do you save people through smoke without one? <br /> <br /> - Remind people. No, it's not done like that. I would also be screaming if someone was pulling me like a rope and hanging on to a building. If I could scream, that is to say, and not faint because of lack of air because the rope tightens my lungs. The second time, when they remember Jack, it's better but still weird. <br /> <br /> - "Go high". No, you do not do it. You always fight the fire as low as possible. You do not fight to spray the flames, you want to put out the fire, and it's under the flames. <br /> <br /> - No discipline. They run like chicken. And they shout all the time, instead of using the radio and keeping discipline. <br /> <br /> - No tactics. Why do not they work in teams of at least two? You can always separate, but it takes a lot more than if everyone walks alone in search of the victims. <br /> <br /> - Do they really enter buildings without bringing water? In Europe, firefighters could never enter a building without fire. <br /> <br /> - Firefighters on the roof. WTF think they go there without safety lines or water? - Explosive chambers. Wood and brick do not explode suddenly. <br /> <br /> The strengths are actually camaraderie and other parts of the film that do not fight fires. It's a lot of kitsch, but it's okay. I will give him a point for that.
