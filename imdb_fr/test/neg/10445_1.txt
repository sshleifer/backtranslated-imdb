a really terrible movie about a shark 30 meters long. bad story bad discussions bad characters bad plot even a confusing end a complete. a little time to my point of view, I thought it was a TV movie, but then I saw that it was not imaginable to have paid to see this crappy load please avoid this movie at all costs. even if you liked the jaws, which I did on average, do not see it even if you have interests in paleontology, do not see it even if you like the nerdy movies with nerdy actors, nerdy intrigues during the Naughty television time, renders service to humanity and do not repeat, I repeat, DO NOT lift your mind from this ridiculous excuse for a sci-fi animal thriller, some people gave it a devil's voice .. I do not know if they were serious or not (but do not expect sincerely)
