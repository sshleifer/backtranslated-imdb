I watched this movie for the first time the other day and I was bored to tears. I guess I was just looking back at the wonderful series I remembered. I watched religiously the TV series Mod Squad during the day and it was fantastic. It was full of action and the relationship the 3 had with Greer was endearing. There was nothing of all that here. When Greer was murdered, you have the idea that these 3 people could have cared less. The actor who portrayed Pete is a very good actor, but they wrote his role as if he were mentally handicapped. Pete in the TV series was calm and serious but also had a fun side. They had this guy acting as if he was either on drugs at the time, drunk or just ignorant. I would not recommend this movie at all. Especially if you were a fan of the TV series. It will be a complete disappointment.
