I did not know at all what this film looked like, it jumps from one plot to another by erratically linking incoherent ideas. it just does not make sense. <br /> <br /> The chopped timeline does not help either. we start today, we go back to the past, then we return to the future only to go back to the past. <br /> <br /> This film is also full of dark lines and horrible clich√©s such as princess and the poor, "you can not even have me in my death", "you do not even love me enough". snapshot up! <br /> <br /> The fighting scenes were horribly old-fashioned, the lights were constantly misplaced, which compensated the CG with the actors (which means that some circles were clearly CG). <br /> <br /> Although di moon's company is very interesting. <br /> <br /> I would not really recommend it to anyone, avoid if possible. <br /> <br /> If you found this comment hard to follow, the movie would be just as bad.
