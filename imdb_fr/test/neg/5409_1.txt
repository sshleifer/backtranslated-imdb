If you want to get a few ephemeral glimpses of cleavage on attractive women, the film may provide you with additional pleasure. If you like to see badly designed and executed "action" scenes, there are plenty of them. If you are both blind and deaf, I advise you not to watch this movie in your presence. It's probably the worst or the closest to the worst film I've ever seen. And it seems like money has been spent on it. Talk about throwing money! As a publisher, I hope that the "publisher (s)" of this "movie" will never again be allowed to edit a movie, a book or even a post-it. As a writer, I hope that the author (s) will never again be allowed to approach a broken colored pencil. You would think that I do not recommend you to watch this movie. Not so. Tape it (so you can stop the pain when you need it) and learn about the gravity of a movie.
