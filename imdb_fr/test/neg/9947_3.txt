Seymour Cassel gives a great performance, a tour de force. Duke Slusarski, his presumed stud on the beach, will always have a place in my heart. The film is centered on a nerd who has just arrived at the beach in hopes of honoring the dreams of his deceased brother. What he has is crazy surfing hijinks Cheating guys, fighting guys and drunk guys are going to watch surfing documentaries with the whole city of Los Angeles on a Friday night. Duke takes the nerd and tries to teach him to play volleyball like touching a woman. The next time my wife responds, I'll pretend to hit the ball. <br /> <br /> Back to Seymour Cassel. The end of the film becomes a good drama, because the first half of the film did not make sense. Duke plays volleyball in an exceptional way, the best he has played in over a decade. The way the scene is shot is beautiful. You can feel this man's heart for the game and love to be at the beach. These five minutes will be one of my favorites of all time. 3/10 Bad to Fair, the rest of the movie was bad.
