This must be the most appalling abuse of the word comedy ever observed. It's just not funny and the writers obviously tried to use the name of the television series to get a little idea at the box office. This film gives a subtle appearance as a result of sexual allusions (which is not a trivial matter), and has all the charisma of a corpse with rigamortis. A complete wash, I'm scared !!
