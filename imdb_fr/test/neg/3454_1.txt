After watching the first scene, I realized that the acting was so serious that it could not be resumed later. Superficial and artificial, with frequent attempts to look professional through references to technology, as a five-year-old tries to give the impression of knowing what he is talking about. <br /> <br /> The story of a second to second is completely unrealistic and just about every decision made by the writer was the type you would expect from a student below average. The overall story was as original and predictable as a pack of sausages. The few attempts to make dialogue smarter were limited to neurotic and apologetic behavior. A ten-year-old might love him. But it would take a child of five to accept the lack of realism; How does an advanced cell function allow someone to bypass a code lock by touching it like a magic wand, select one in 100 voices via a ventilation system (which snatches Superman), and repair a computer at home detecting evil instead of looking for faults? In fact, this scene is a good example: the fault is that one of the cooling pipes (aluminum ribbons) of the CPU was broken, as would have been the case if an exhaust pipe of a V8 engine was ripped off by an explosion. It's something that can not happen, and if it did, it would not stop the computer from working. There is no electric current flowing through this ribbon, but when he (without doing it himself, his arms were running under autopilot because the cells of his body were super efficient) placed a thumbtack in the tear, a desktop with icons appeared on the screen immediately without starting. <br /> <br /> And so goes all the way. Like when he escaped from an interrogation room at the NSA headquarters by lighting a lighter under a fire detector, which resulted in the doors being opened throughout the building. Naturally, the NSA had not predicted this cunning approach to escape, nor put guards outside its room (or anywhere else) to protect a living breakthrough in military nanotechnology. So he went out and took a taxi. Examples like this are not just numerous, there is actually no single scene that makes sense. <br /> <br /> In addition, the so-called great effects have been terrible. He threw a basketball to a child in the park and it was thrown horizontally to a depth of 20 feet in a tree. No acceleration or deceleration, but constant speed and height, like a motorized trolley. I'm sure that if I paused and searched for the cables that held this kid's posture as only the cables can do, they probably did not know how or did not bother to erase them completely. If someone is thrown so far into a tree, he will at least say ouch (or rather will be hospitalized with fractures), but the kid was just confused and amazed. <br /> <br /> Moronic. This is the word for every creative decision taken throughout the production. I'll put the director's name on my personal blacklist, a person as unskilled as he can not get better. I want to demand compensation for losing 45 minutes of my life watching it and the time it took to write it. Although it seemed therapeutic, it was traumatic to realize how difficult it was to get a pilot approved. The only excuse that a slightly intelligent person might have to look at voluntarily would be imprisonment or lobotomy.
