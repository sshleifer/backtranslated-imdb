<br /> <br /> A few years ago, I bought a movie called The Cellar. I had heard it was supposed to be a good movie, but it turned out to be a flop and a movie B. <br /> <br /> The story is good, but the movie is has no positive effect. . (Maybe they did not have enough money for that in the budget ???). <br /> <br /> If you choose to watch this movie, be sure to watch it three times. The first, only and last time !!!
