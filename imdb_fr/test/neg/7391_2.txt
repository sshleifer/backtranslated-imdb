It may be the worst movie I have ever seen. Can someone explain to me please the plot of this movie? Yes, I know the bus ran out of fuel in the middle of the desert, after the driver never noticed that his compass was not working, but what then? And how did it end? I may be too stupid to understand this film, but for me it was a complete waste of time. <br /> <br /> My recommendation? Do not bother, there are much better movies to see. This film ranks with my other low-ups of all time (Go to the sea - Adam Sandler and Fire on the Amazon - Sandra Bullock)
