In his first feature film "Yellow", Chris Chan Lee attempts to illuminate the Hollywood portrait of Asian Americans by moving away from stereotypes generally portrayed in mainstream films. However, in doing so, Lee commits a far more heinous crime: he exaggerates the stereotypes of American Americans to the point of disbelief. The result? Terribly one-dimensional characters and a scandalously superficial script attract the cast into a sur-actor frenzy, eventually leading to a film that is physically painful to watch. <br /> <br /> Do not be fooled by 'Yellow' positive reviews; everyone falls into one of two camps. In one corner (for example, here on imdb.com), you will find Asian Americans so enthusiastic that an Asian character can be portrayed on the screen without thick glasses or a math book, so they neglect somehow the idiocy of Lee's final product. On the other hand, you find film critics who have simply assumed that it would not be cool to give "Yellow" the complete denigration it deserves; After all, it's an enervating American-Asian film directed by an independent American-American filmmaker ... protected territory for the moment. <br /> <br /> Case example: the main character Sin Lee (Michael Chung). Screenwriter / director Lee performs a monumental feat with Sin, editing "Yellow" so that Sin never appears on the screen, unless he is sullen or screaming. See Sin feel the support of his friends. Scowl. See Sin walking along the beach and brooding. Scowl. (Cry ensues.) See Sin shutting his father's shop. Scowl. See the sin urinate. Scowl. See the breath of sin. Scaring. <br /> <br /> Gee, I wonder if Sin is full of American-Asian anguish. Do you think? I am not sure. Scowl. Frightened. <br /> <br /> Just to take stock, Lee introduces Sin's father, Woon Lee (Soon-tek Oh). Throughout the film, while Sin is just watching or screaming, Mr. Lee grimaces and yells. In fact, this is Woon's main role in "Yellow": sullen air and simultaneous screaming. <br /> <br /> Well, I wonder if Woon is an Asian father with complex powers. Do you think? I am not sure. Scowl. Shout. <br /> <br /> If Lee's one-dimensional characters do not bother you, his story will do it. Meet Mina (Mary Chen) and Joey (John Cho), two characters from this film whose only goal is to integrate a tangential love story that is completely irrelevant. You see, Lee learned at film school that any good movie must have some kind of subtext related to love, and that these two characters allow him to fulfill the obligation. Mina and Joey's extremely seductive dialogue consists of one-sided insults that end in a kiss: "Nerd!"; `Stupidhead! '(the eyes intersect); (understand the smile); (Kissing follows.) <br /> <br /> But rest assured, somewhere Sin is scowling while it's all happening. <br /> <br /> That neither Mina nor Joey contribute in any way to The plot of the film leaves me no less puzzled than Lee's insistence on the film's most naughty clich√©s to accomplish his follies. And believe me, the flirtation sequence is just the tip of the iceberg. <br /> <br /> Towards the end of the film, Woon Lee tries to explain his constant expression and cries to Sin's girlfriend, Teri (Mia Suh), in what I'm sure Lee wanted to be a poignant moment. What a surprise! While Woon invokes a metaphorical story about the homeland to illustrate his point, drawn straight from Reader's Digest, his voice vibrates in this extra-special paternal manner. The camera takes a mandatory picture of Teri's shaking hands. We feel compelled to roll our eyes, except that we realize that Woon's explanation makes no sense. But lack of substance did not stop Lee from making the film, so why would he cut this particularly inefficient scene? After all, the world can still use another shot. <br /> <br /> Well, you say, the film can be painful, but at least it has to be a technical masterpiece - say, for example, what dreams could come. ' Sorry, technically, "Yellow" is also disappointing. Lee's editing is awkward and disrupts the bit of rhythm in the film, but I'm sure Lee thought they would look hip. To make matters worse, each image is underexposed or overexposed. Although the light meter was invented in 1932, the new technology did not make its debut on the film set "Yellow". <br /> <br /> Given the total gap in the film, the support of actor Burt Bolos, who plays the best of Sin friend Alex, performs relatively well. Although Bolos exaggerates slightly, you can not really blame him when Lee's scenario consists only of toppling and screaming. The companions of the Bolos distribution, on the other hand, show no restraint in their excessive action. <br /> <br /> I have not seen a movie as bad as "Yellow" for a very long time. And I sincerely pray not to see a film as bad as "Yellow" for a long time, too. Please do not waste it; life is already far too short. Thank you.
