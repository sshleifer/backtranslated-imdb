This film must be one of the lowest in the generally respectable career of Michael J. Fox. I should have known how horrible this movie was when I rented it and found it half-seen and not rewound by the previous tenant. Never a good sign! Fox plays a major player who is now an agent for other children of the show. His character is delusional in that he still believes everyone should love him to be Mikey. His big break comes when he meets Angie Vega, a talented child. Vega is abrasive and not at all friendly. In fact, the only likeable character in the entire movie is Cyndi Lauper as Brooklyn's acclaimed receptionist for the agency. One of those movies that makes me want to stick a post-it in the box to warn others not to waste their time!
