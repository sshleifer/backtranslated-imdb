This film has good intentions, at least in the message "do not be afraid, even if it's hard, fear will kill you in the end" It's a good message, but the container is so bad that is crushed by bad game actions, total lack of credibility in feelings, dialogue established as if read aloud, stereotypes instead of breathing, living people. <br /> <br /> It abuses effects such as slow motion to compensate for a total lack of credibility in acting and therefore, a lack of emotional strength ... <br /> <br /> The suicidal part still reminds me of a low-budget film from the 90s, when lesbians seemed to have (at least on celluloid) a total inability to lead a happy and happy life and a tendency to get caught up in exaggerated dramas often involving separation, death or prison. <br /> <br /> If it had been centered on the rewards of life based on how we feel (not what others think we should live), it would have been less dramatic and more inspiring . But this is not the case, it emphasizes the pain, the loss and leaves the message to a theoretical ideal. <br /> <br /> I do not see how this film can be an inspiration for anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a great movie about overcoming fear and daring to experience what you're feeling, return to the beautiful "Desert Hearts" (even better: read the novel!)
