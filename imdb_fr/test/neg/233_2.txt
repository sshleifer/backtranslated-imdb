What was Bruce Willis thinking when he signed for this one? This one made no sense to me .. I was so confused by this, it was not funny at all .. I do not even know why Disney did this one .. Bruce is a great actor that I love it a long time .. and it disappointed me a lot .. Pass this one on the video shelf ....
