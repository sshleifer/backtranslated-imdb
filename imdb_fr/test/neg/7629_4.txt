This derived erotic thriller remains largely visible, mainly because the viewer is curiously curious about how it will unfold and that director Peter Hall manages to mount a rather hot (and quite daring) sex scene. But the final, although unexpected, is absurd, and the plot (with childhood trauma and multiple personality disorders) turns out to be insupportably clich√©, especially with respect to motivation.
