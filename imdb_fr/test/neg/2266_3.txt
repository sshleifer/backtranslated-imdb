As everyone knows, no one can play Scarlett O'Hara like Vivien Leigh and no one can play Rhett Butler like Clark Gable. All others are mediocre, and Timothy Dalton and Joanne Whalley are no exception. One thing I could not really go over was that Joanne had BROWN eyes. The green eyes were the most rewarding feature of Scarlett's beauty and in that sequel she was stripped of it. <br /> <br /> The film, as well as the book, contained several alarms. The new characters were not so memorable and I found myself forgetting who was who. I felt like she was going to Ireland was doing absolutely nothing. Maybe I'm only 11 years old, but his attitude did not change until the last word, 10 minutes when Rhett announced that she had grown up. If Rhett had not told him that, I would never have guessed that his attitude had changed. She really loved Cat, her baby. She prefers this child because he has had it with Rhett, her only beloved husband. Still, if you've read Gone With The Wind, you'll find that kids make no difference in Scarlett's world. <br /> <br /> Frankly, it seemed like there was way too much work without Rhett. Everyone cares whether Rhett and Scarlett meet or not, and Scarlett has taken far too long to get there. It's virtually nothing compared to Gone With The Wind, but again what's not? If you have read the novel, you will like it better than the movie. <br /> <br /> I'll watch it, just because it's the sequel to Gone With The Wind, whether it's worth it or not. This may not quite satisfy you, but it will get you part of the way.
