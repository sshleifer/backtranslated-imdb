Why is it impossible to write in French? Very Kitch! This trip to the center of the earth is despicable technical possibilities yet current in 1976. These big "Casimir" monsters are completely ridiculous! The film however deserves a "remake", just like "KING KONG" (the last), with a scenario a little more provided. The teacher has similarities with Professor Calcul and is rather funny. David (the character) is rather incoherent but passes to the people from below a good message "you unite and will overcome!" All in all, we would say a film made in the 1940s. Now that I've said all (or almost all) the harm I thought about it, we can say that if we have a tired brain or something to see other, then the thing is even rather amusing. Hugh! This is my opinion! (French translation in English with "Reverso": sorry for any errors!)
