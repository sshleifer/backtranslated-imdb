I enjoyed the beautiful landscape of this film the first time I saw it at the age of 9 years. Dunderklumpen is a bit cute for the kids in a cheesy way. It made me think of HRPUFFINSTUFF on Saturday mornings. His Swedish backgrounds make his eyes soft. Do not expect older children to be interested because the action / activity is late and most older children will get bored. It's really a film under 10 years old and a good memory for those of us who were grandchildren in 1974.
