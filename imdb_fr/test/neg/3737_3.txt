First of all, I think the actors and actors have been excellent. The problem is the story. There is basically no story that is worth telling and therefore, basically, no movie here. Larry McMurtry directed Lonesome Dove and I can not fault the original even though he probably did not need any sequels. He did Hud with Paul Newman, which is one of my favorite movies. Mellencamp is supposed to be a country singer, but the only song I hear him sing is an old Buck Owens song. The film makes all the difference with the breeding of chickens. The character of Mellencamp has a good wife, and it's totally stupid of her to get away from her. The incident of rolling in the slip cage is completely stupid. Maybe people are doing it for fun in some parts of the country, but I have never heard of it.
