Let me start by saying that this re-made version of one of the greatest films ever created, "Psycho" (1960), was only a fine example of a bad director, bad acting and bad casting. The best way to describe this film is to compare it step by step, acting by acting and proceeding process by process to the original. <br /> <br /> Alfred Hitchcock, one of the greatest movie directors in his history, intended to photograph the original in black and white despite the availability of colors at that time. Okay, the people of 1960 may not have been used to bloody or horrifying scenes as much as we are today, but that did not stop people from enjoying it and being nominated at 4 Oscars . Gus Van Sant had absolutely no reason to publish it in color, with the exception of the year 1998. What should have seemed realistic in color was not. After the shower, Norman washes his hands, it is easy to understand that all that was used for the blood was like a kind of red wax. Once he has washed the blood, his hand is red. <br /> <br /> As for the acting, there might not have been a better distribution of Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins in the original. Perkins suited Norman well and he was incredibly natural when he smiled and talked abroad. Hitch wanted a nice and good actor and everything worked fine. In this version, I personally think that Vince Vaughn was perfect, handsome and strong to play Norman. Unfortunately, his acting was nothing short of terrible. In the motel office where Norman and Marion have a long conversation, he had no expression on his face and his voice and face never changed. In the original, in the same scene, when the madhouse is described, one can clearly see the sudden change of expression on Perkins' face. He looks scared, but not aggressive. Vince Vaughn prepares the whole conversation here as if he had just had his aftershocks by heart. Again, the game terrible. Same with Anne Heche. In the opening scene of the original, we can see how tense and nervous Marion (Janet) is when she goes to Phoenix. She was happy to have the money but at the same time she was scared for life. That's what I call playing. In the remake, Heche has no sign of fear and she smiles periodically to get the money. I do not think anyone would be "happy and smiling" if he had just stolen $ 400,000 and all the state police were behind them. In the shower scene, Janet, in the original, grabs the curtain, turns around and dies after being stabbed. In the remake, Heche is stabbed, turns, sways, has a stupid expression on the face and manages to die with a lot of effort. Again, terrible game. <br /> <br /> There are also some changes introduced especially in this movie compared to the original that seem to have nothing to do with the plot and the current situation. In the scene where Arbogast is assassinated, two scenes flash between the stab wounds. One with a naked woman and the other with a sheep. Many people, including myself, do not know exactly if the second scene shows a sheep, a cow, or anything else. What a beast or a naked woman has to do with killing an investigator! The changes were simply inappropriate and useless. There are also some changes in the final scene. <br /> <br /> Let me add a few (and only) positives. I felt that Julianne Moore was doing her job well and playing a good Lila character. And William Macy did well, that's about exactly how the character of Arbogast should have been played. <br /> <br /> The man of knowledge that the purpose and intent of a movie remake is to educate the current generation to a movie that has a good line of classic plot, and to try to make it better than the original. And if something happened here according to what I just said, it's directly the opposite. Unfortunately, many people like me have not been impressed after watching this film, unless we know that there is an original, unforgettable version. <br /> <br /> Please do not watch this movie, it is far from the original and the original will always remain one of the best movies ever created, if not THE best.
