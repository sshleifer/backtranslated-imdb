2001 is one of those films where, if you do not like it, you are told that you do not get it and that you have to examine the deeper meaning and the symbolism. You are told that you clearly have a slow attention ability and that you just want to see sex, explosions and that the plot is presented to you on a set. <br /> <br /> Let's decompose the film, are we going? Three minutes of darkness, with something like a hippopotamus dying. Then we get the opening credits. A minute of fascinating shots of the savannah. Then a group of monkeys find a black rock and start killing things with bones. Cut the first of many 20-minute shots of ships doing things while the "Blue Danube" plays in the background. A group of useless dialogues and a group of lunar scientists discover another monolith. <br /> <br /> Cut to a spacecraft too long for the crew: three people drowsy, two people named Dave and Frank, who have only a little more personality than the steep in hibernation. And then there is HAL, the "perfect" super computer that manages the ship. Predictably, it breaks and begins to break the first law of robotics. Now, it's something that has potential. A devilish and cold ruthless super-mind that controls the environment and can predict each of your movements. And what does he do? He lets a guy float in space and turns off the hibernation machines so that the three sleeping guys die, leaving Dave floating in a basket. He simply uses the airlock, puts on a spacesuit and turns off HAL - with excruciating slowness. Then, apparently, there is a psychedelic "evolution" to Jupiter. <br /> <br /> Here is the movie with the breaks removed: the monkeys see the monolith, kill things. Scientists find moon monolith. HAL kills people. HAL dies; Dave receives a pre-recorded message and evolves at Jupiter. <br /> <br /> It's not me who does not understand it. It is I who bored to tears in front of long stretches of nothing. Of course, it's realistic, but I think I have no reason to worry about it. No matter the message, no movie can be good without being entertaining. Frankly, each character could be replaced by Keanu Reeves and nothing would change.
