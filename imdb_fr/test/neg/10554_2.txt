Wow, Kiss the Bride was not that bad, but it was not so good either. They certainly were not "Latter-day Saints". The film dives in the center ... maybe cutting about 30 minutes would have made the movie more enjoyable. But the film is removed again and again with secondary intrigues and scenes of rejects. The whole sequence of the golden outings comes to mind. <br /> <br /> Even if "Kiss" was designed for a theatrical release, it looks and sounds more like a movie made for TV. Each scene is lit up like a department store. So many characters are to throw. <br /> <br /> And this dear Tori is a pleasant surprise. She steals every scene in which she appears. <br /> <br /> A scene annoyed me. It was the rehearsal dinner in this large room with a multitude of tables, all decorated. But only 5 or 6 people in a room for 250! Where is everyone gone? <br /> <br /> Gay cinema has reached a new low level ... but not as low as the horrendous movies produced and broadcast on Here! Channel.
