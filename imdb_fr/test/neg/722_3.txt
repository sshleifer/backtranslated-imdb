Derek Jarman has shown us many times that dialogue is not his forte. He is a painter and painter. His films are almost always visually stunning, but about as exciting to watch as already dry paint. Watch his movies fast forward, the very fast setting you can only get on DVD. In The Tempest, Jarman does very little with the script or the characters, using them as a simple lattice to hang a very long and well constructed cinematic framework. He even goes so far as to contradict Shakespeare's original script to realize these extremely slow and lifeless scenes. There is no romance, magic, trick or urgency that the script calls, little spontaneity, and the character of Caliban in particular is reduced to a kind of crazy, crazy idiot, similar to Gaveston in Jarman in Edward II. It's a pity that this is pretty much the only movie version of The Tempest available.
