Stars: Hayden Pantierre. <br /> <br /> There have been so many movies that have exactly this same plot, and this one is just a poor story. Populer White Girl goes to ethnic school, does not fit, soon becomes accepted. Originality is nonexistent, any more than laughter. He uses so many old jokes badly executed that it's annoying. I do not know why they think it's a good idea to make video footage dedicated to mediocre films, but that's not the case. That said, the good thing is that all the people who sit on it are actors and actresses quite competent. <br /> <br /> My note: * on ****. PG-13 for language and sexual humor.
