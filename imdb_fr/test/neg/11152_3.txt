I was waiting to welcome the return of Arnold Schwarzeneger after the dark films he had made after "Eraser". "End of Days" can, however, be added to the dark films in which he had the misfortune to appear. <br /> <br /> "End of Days" starts well with a thrilling action sequence, but soon becomes boring, turning a blind eye to action and suspense and instead focusing on investigating the demonic events and the next millennium (read "Doomsday"). <br /> <br /> The performances are bland, the special effects are mediocre and abound. Considering me as a hardcore fan of Schwarzenegger, I could not believe that this film did not please me, but with such a horrible and lame scenario, what could Arnie have done, if not spent on this turkey? <br /> <br /> 3 of 10 <br /> <br />
