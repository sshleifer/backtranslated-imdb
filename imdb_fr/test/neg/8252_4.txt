What about mathematical geniuses that make sense of criticism? In my opinion, a good spirit was not enough (the FELLOWSHIP OF RING deserved the Oscar that year), while GOOD WILL HUNTING was awarded several awards <br /> <br /> All of First, it's the scenario. When I attended a film school, I was told that GOOD WILL HUNTING was a very good example of how not to start a scenario and the tutor was right. This film is devoid of any type of opening hook and is usually very slow. If you had written an unsolicited script like this, the scenario reader would have dropped it on page 15. <br /> <br /> Structure, other than the idea that a member of the American lower class is a kind of intellectual god that does not really sound. true . Ask yourself the following question: If he is the Cleverst character of the film, how come he has gone through his short life without anyone noticing his abilities? Not a single teacher from his childhood noticed his gift? Very improbable because he has read so much expanding literature. And if Will is so smart, why is he so unaware of what happens to the beautiful and well-guarded boys in American jails? <br /> <br /> But it's the cast that has dropped much of the film. Do you want some actors to play tough Irish gang members? Let's go get Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, which is tantamount to convincing Russell Crowe to play a pacifist or Charles Bronson to play a better liberal. Damon and Affleck could not convince me, but they could not help thinking that even though they had written the script, the roles should have been assigned to different actors, after all, Billy Bob Thornton has scripts written for films in which it has not been shot and the same criteria should have been applied here <br /> <br /> The film has some positive points. Robin Williams is excellent as a man who tries to show Will his potential and also very good, it's Stellan Skarsgard who is simply one of the greatest character actors to have walked outside the Europe. Despite my previous criticisms of the screenplay, the film is moving. piece of dialogue at the park as Williams character explains to Will what he saw in life <br /> <br /> But I must repeat that there are fewer positives than negatives in this film and I agree with the people who said that GOOD HUNTING is boring and unconvincing
