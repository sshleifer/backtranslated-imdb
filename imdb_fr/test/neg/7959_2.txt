I'm a big fan of Deepa Mehta's work, especially Fire and Earth 1947. Unfortunately, her film lacks all that is needed for a good movie. <br /> <br /> The film tries to present the fate of widows in India at the beginning of the 20th century and the new wave of ideas of their rehabilitation at the same time. Represented with a child widow as a central character, although the plot is too banal from an Indian point of view, it could have been a very powerful film. Alas! the film lacked both fire sensitivity and emotional intensity on Earth in 1947. <br /> <br /> Even if we assume that history is a given, there are hundreds of things that I would have liked differently Well, the realization of the film is particularly regrettable. Everything is said Everything is shown right. Absence of sensitive implicit sentences. Absence of things left unsaid. I just could not believe it was a Deepa Mehta movie. <br /> <br /> There were very classic Hindi cinema characters - like an old widow with her own interests, or a father who has the highest quality double standard. Can not we write a screenplay without having these traditional Indian movie characters in the old fashioned way? <br /> <br /> Many people applauded Deepa for making a film and proving her point of view against Hindu fundamentalists. Well, I agree that she took a bold step, but should not we worry about the quality of the film, or is it a controversy an end in itself? It is obvious that if you start with a story like in Water, you will end up feeling the widow's pain in consideration --- You do not need an accomplished director to achieve it. And the movie had nothing else than that !! So where is Deepa's contribution to the film? <br /> <br /> And talk about acting, etc. - pathetic !!! Lisa Ray has a pretty face, an extremely pretty face - but that's where it ends. She does not speak Hindi; she can not be emotional. John Abraham is not better. Most widows do not look natural. The saving grace is Seema Biswas and the girl. They are fabulous. <br /> <br /> And it was a vintage film - but the Hindi dialogues are really nil. Even here, the statement is as unnatural as it is. No rustic accents !!! No local slang. No nothing. The only thing on the right was probably the filming locations. I thought the whole vidhwa-ashram was reasonably real. The blue hue throughout the film is also relevant. <br /> <br /> But do not watch this movie. You do not get anything. There is nothing in history or direction. If you have to watch it, look at it for the role of the little girl.
