Lenzi, at least, is able to do better until Spasmo and start with Kiss Me Kill Me <br /> <br /> Hard Gore R2 DVD release can be cut off at 86 minutes, but this movie contains an act Cannibalism and a victim - a scene with an Aboriginal girl brutalized and disemboweled by the cannibal tribe who was warned and then set fire to huts. Criminal Holocaust? Firestarter Fernox, do you like it? <br /> <br /> Certainly not a cannibal film, but has there ever been a decent movie? To avoid.
