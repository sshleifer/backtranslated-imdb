Schieder plays an almost credible role as President of the United States with Maria Conchita Alonzo, politically correct, as Vice President. The film just stinks. with so many holes in the plot, it's a marvel they've managed to stick to the movie on which they were shot. Relegated to the late hours of the HBO channel, this film is not worth seeing. After 10 minutes, you wonder why it was written. 40 minutes later, you wonder why you look at it. Save the effort and watch a cover of Hee Haw or something. Everything is better than this clunker.
