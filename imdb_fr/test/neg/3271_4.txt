Perhaps, like most people who have seen this movie long after its premiere on television, I wanted to see many of my favorite actors in an old and obscure form, which is exactly what "Slow Burn" is. Apart from the nostalgic value, the film itself is not very good. <br /> <br /> Eric Roberts embodies the former reporter Jacob Ash, hired by a rich artist, Gerald McMurty (Raymond J. Barry) the details of his son, Brian, who lived with his mother, Laine (Beverly D 'Angelo) since a few years. In the manner of Phillip Marlowe, Jacob Ash tells what would become more than just an investigation into Brian's whereabouts. But once Jacob found Laine, his discoveries caused him a lot of trouble. Perhaps because the events in the movie are moving too slowly, there is never a lot of suspense in this little thriller, not even in the end with the final routine of revealing the culprits and their motives. <br /> <br /> However, as said before, this movie is probably a movie that will draw attention to the fact that its cast of actors to date relatively unknown includes a very young Eric Roberts and the adorable Johnny Depp , who plays Laine's son-in-law, Donnie. This can be reason enough to try ... if you can find it.
