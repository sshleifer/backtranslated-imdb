Although it was not a complete waste of time, "Eighteen" was not really as cute as he claimed. Neither the ages of the actors they describe ?? 18, my buttocks. McKellen could have appeared in the film telling us that he was 30 years old and asking us to believe him. Even Michael J. Fox was more credible as a teenager in Part II and Part III of 'Back to the Future' (ok, maybe not, they are probably also credible.) If you can overcome the obvious age defect you will either have the complete void of acting, or simply excessive action (Paul Anthony's so-called anguish, the moments of Clarence Sponagle's life, and while I'm supportive of Brendan Fletcher, he is better to watch it, and more, in 'Freddy Vs. Jason,') incomprehensible scenes (a faster marriage than Britney Spears, incest to prove a point and a man who needs help to urinate, but still has a hand I guess it was the fantasy of the writer,) an entire movie of despicable characters (Anthony Maybe someone is playing at 18, but he is 12 years old and a strange "John" is added for that the character of Anthony Pip can save the scene (is there really a sex scene of evant a baby?) and practically every character challenging his own sexuality with strange actions / scenes. On the positive side, I enjoyed Ian McKellen's voiceover, seeing a hetero / gay friendship (rarely portrayed), a puppy's love (of someone who collects stuffed puppies, that is to say) a good score, a decent dialogue (love the separation of homosexuals and pedophilia (I would like more people to realize this) and act on behalf of the woman (as well as Cumming.) I can not really recommend it, because you really need too much stuff - gay tolerance, gay scrambling, homelessness, WWII epic, priesthood, first love, imperfect judges, etc., etc., etc. - on a tight budget .
