This film must be the biggest disappointment I've ever had with a movie. The acting is horrible, the accumulated suspense minimal and the plot as a whole is ridiculous. I found myself wanting the victim to hurry up and become a victim, as she obviously needed to be relieved of her misery. Anyone with a rudimentary knowledge of how the world works will be immediately disgusted with the leaps that we are asked to do logically, and the so-called pending climb would be lucky to slightly disturb a 3-year-old. I am appalled that a follow-up is planned, as this means that they will again ask us to swallow a lower-than-average parcel line. If this is an example of Raw Feed's work, I think I will avoid all future movies.
