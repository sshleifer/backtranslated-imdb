It's a bit slow for a horror movie, but the quality is better than you would expect for the sole effort of a director on IMDb. The work of the camera and the lighting were surprisingly good, and the acting of the actors ?? although variable ?? is better than what is often found in independent genre films. <br /> <br /> Robert Field is rather rigid, which is all the more regrettable since his character, Claude, is both the narrator of the film and the center of the film. his action. However, it is the entry of Christopher (Brandon deSpain) that I considered the turning point of this film ?? And not in a good way. A twist is clumsily introduced, and the slow motion becomes too long and verbose. <br /> <br /> Pete Barker is constantly entertained as Father William. It stands out easily in what is a pretty ordinary offer. While the first half hour caught my eye, I felt quite disappointed with the way things went.
