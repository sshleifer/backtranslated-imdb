** Could be considered a gentle spoilers, but no more than in the criticism of this film by another person. ** <br /> <br /> I knew nothing could match the sheer brilliance of the original "Carrie". It was more of a film about social criticism than about the fire in the gym. Carrie White was the "victim" par excellence, and her story expressed the helplessness felt by the true exploited. <br /> <br /> Anyone who has designed the character of "Rachel" for "The Rage" must have completely missed the intricacies of "Carrie." For the audience to truly share the anger of the victim, he must be a character sympathetic, a real pariah who is more a victim of circumstances than of his own vices. Rachel is totally too uncomfortable to express the emotional depth and connection of Sissy Spacek's "Carrie". And she looks and acts as if she should be next to the "attractive and popular brigade" that she eventually burns down. She has, like the rest of them, a soul as corrupt as Carrie, totally innocent. <br /> <br /> It just does not work. There is no satisfaction in seeing the pretty kids - not even the boy "Home Improvement" - get caught in the culminating scene of this movie. And it's so useless! There was no bloodshed in the burning gym! <br /> <br /> And there is one person in particular for whom this film should not have the audacity to kill ... but I will not say who it is. If you've seen the original "Carrie", it's the kind of character who dies unfairly. <br /> <br /> At least they created the connection with Carrie appropriately; it's explained as it should have been. But that, and the arm tattoo, which was done pretty well, is pretty much the only thing this movie did for. <br /> <br /> Yet another awful "Scream" imitates, and it tarnishes reputation one of the most compelling films ever made. <br /> <br /> Rating: 1 out of 10. I did not expect much, but I was still terribly disappointed. An unfriendly character, a series of references to irritating pop culture thrown for no good reason, and a final scene that pales in comparison to the gravestone of "Carrie".
