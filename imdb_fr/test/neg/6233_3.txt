I had never heard of "The Clearing" until I was bored one day with friends from the local Blockbuster and this caught our attention. The description on the jacket of the DVD aroused our interest, but once we added it to the DVD player, the trouble was just beginning. <br /> <br /> The story has been dragged too long. It seemed to follow the same pattern as other movies that include a kidnapping. The most thrilling parts were at the beginning of the movie, though. After that, the outline was followed to the letter and it made "The Clearing" without originality. The flashbacks were too numerous and the grief of the victim's family did not provide anything of interest or improve the nature of the film. And I also found that I did not like the end, which probably led me to dislike the movie at all. <br /> <br /> The action was not horrible ... but it was not the best. Robert Redford gave much better performances. The tragic character of Willem Dafoe is the only one that I have really seen develop throughout the story and the viewer really sees this change in the last ten minutes or so of the film. The portrait of Helen Mirren in Robert Redford's wife was flat and somehow followed the same generic mold as other films that include a tragic and heartbreaking event. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, "The Clearing" has nothing to do about. Use your movie rental money for something else ... like "Garden State", maybe?
