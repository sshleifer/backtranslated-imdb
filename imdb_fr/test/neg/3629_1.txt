Zeoy101 ?? Really, this must be one of the most stupid attempts to get the attention of people in my age group. This is a young girl named Zeoy and her friends who attend a boarding school. BORING !!! She only complains and behaves like a spoiled idiot. I remember that this show was released in 2005, I was 13, and even at the time, I thought it was useless. The only episode I ever liked was when the boys hid a camera in the girls' dormitory. THAT'S ALL. Anyway, I just do not understand why Nickel-Oh, my bad Nick, feels the need to syndicate this mediocre excuse for "entertainment". this decade becomes a joke each year and there is worse and worse. What is with this generation ?? <br /> <br /> In any case, R.I.P. Nickelodeon 1979-1998? / 2005?
