Here is the spoiler: At the end of the movie, a small piece of you dies. You will spend the rest of your life looking in vain for this missing piece, but it is gone, gone. At night, you will walk through the streets looking at the windows of your neighbors sitting for dinner. Friends and family will try to determine exactly when you became undead. You will answer their questions and concerns with an empty look and a few mumblings about a fugitive testicle. When AMC inevitably makes Tomcats the "movie of the month," a series of mysterious murders will take place in your city. The next morning, you wake up wagging on the kitchen floor with a slight taste of brains in your mouth. Then you will crawl in the living room and on the couch. You will fix the wall, you will get wet a little and you will start laughing maniacally. Because once you're dead inside, Jake Busey in a thong is actually pretty funny.
