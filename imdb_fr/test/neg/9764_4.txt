Since the magus is a puzzling puzzle that really has no solution, you have to sit back and enjoy the scenery. Settled on a "remote Greek island", it is performed by Michael Caine, a tense teacher in a boys' school, who is trapped in thought games with Anthony Winn, a mysterious local man, and his girlfriend Candice Bergen. Quinn, who looks like Pablo Picasso with white hair and a striped sailor's shirt, is actually pretty good but Caine seems ready to explode. Bergen, although beautiful, must NEVER put a British accent. She is not very good at that kind of thing. The direction of Guy Green is fine, but unless you have infinite patience with the circular logic of the film, you will not enjoy it. The role played by Anna Karina in the completely joyless role of Caine's girlfriend is a real sour note. After seeing her in the movie A WOMAN IS A WOMAN and A BAND APART, her presence here is quite shocking.
