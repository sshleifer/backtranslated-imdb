The basics of this film, from a comic talk show host presenting himself as an independent president just to get things moving, are funny, entertaining, brilliant and even a little inspiring. (Think of the debate on the West Wing when Tom Dobbs leaves his podium, think Steven Colbert who announces his candidacy Good time) The first 15 to 20 minutes of this film are very very funny, the debate in particular. When he ends up getting elected, it's a shame because of a computer problem, you'd like him to just win (although it's unrealistic). <br /> <br /> But after that, the film deteriorates completely. I thought we would have an excellent movie like "Dave" (1993) in which we would see what would happen if a comedian ran the country. Instead, the film goes from comedy to a thriller, a romantic comedy and a drama and does no good. The computer problem becomes the main scenario, which is really nil. Boy is it disappointing. I give it 3 stars just for the sake of it and because I managed to watch this movie from start to finish without stopping it, which is usually a good thing for me.
