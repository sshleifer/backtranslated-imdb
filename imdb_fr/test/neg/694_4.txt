Why do the powers that be continue to give Jennifer Lopez incredible roles? She was excellent in Selena and quite good in Money Train, who gave her both roles where she could be herself. However, roles like this just draw the line. I could never see Lopez as an FBI agent (see Out of Sight for this mundane performance), but as a psychotherapist? Give me a break! <br /> <br /> Basically, Lopez plays the aforementioned psychotherapist, who participates in virtual reality experiments in which she inserts into the minds of her patients to help them solve their problems. When she enters the mind of a comatose serial killer to help save one of her victims, she breaks all the rules to try to break the madness of her inner mind. <br /> <br /> Lopez shares are generally below average. I can not overcome the high-pitched sound of a voice she has. It's not Julia Roberts, but she appears on the screen as if she thought she was on the same ground. Well, she's not even in the same stage. Of course, she is a very sexy woman; however, this will not carry a movie, and certainly not this one. The role of this film would have been excellent, even if it had been made with someone who could give more credence to the character. <br /> <br /> That said, the film is breathtaking. . The colors are fabulous and the scenario is not half bad for a movie type B. The sound here is also superb. This film earns points for the story quite original, and important points for its appearance and sound. Unfortunately, acting and bad casting reduce it by a few notches. <br /> <br /> My rating: 6/10
