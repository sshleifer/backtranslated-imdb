Breaking Dawn starts at a California university when Professor Simon (Associate Producer, Joe Morton) explains to his students that they need to do a six-week intensive study of a patient with mental disorders at Cape State Hospital, as that crucial element of their education. become qualified doctors. Eve (Kelly Overton), a brilliant, young, attractive and intelligent student, receives a particularly difficult patient to study. His name is Don Wake (James Haven) and is a convicted murderer. He was found covered in blood next to the corpse of a woman (Diane Verona) and her young daughter (Jenette McCurdy). At first, Don does not even want to look at Eve, let alone talk to him, but, like the soldier she is, Eve persists in trying to find out. Finally, Don begins to speak but what he says scares Eve, he says someone is watching her and mentioning the name of Malachay. Eve then begins to see a dark and shadowy figure at every turn, while Don exposes conspiracy theories and bizarre statements. Eve slowly begins to lose her sense when the border between fantasy and reality becomes more and more blurred. Is there anything else in the supposed nonsense of which Don speaks other than the senseless delusions of a psychiatric patient ...? <br /> <br /> Written and Directed by Mark Edwin Robinson I have only negative feelings about Breaking Dawn. Now we all love a good end of twisting, the kind of ending that surprises us, surprises us, works well with the rest of the film and stays in our memory as the cool endings of The Sixth Sense (1999) & Fight Club (1999) ) to name only two good examples and to a lesser extent the endings of films such as Scream (1996) where the identity of the murderer is a nice surprise and is not so obvious. Then, of course, there are films whose endings ruin everything that has been done before and, as an example, let's take, oh, I do not know, say Breaking Dawn because I've never seen a end as terrible for a movie, ever. Breaking Dawn started as a decent psychological horror thriller, with scary things beginning to happen to Eve, it's not the most action-packed movie of all time, but it's arousing interest, it is not the most absorbing movie either, but it's more than watching and it's not so bad that a movie until the end of the shoot, I have to keep mentioning it because everything else up at this point (which was OK to be fair to that) suddenly becomes out of place. I am sure that there are people who think they have this confused disorder of an end calculated in every detail. All I can say is that no one will be able to explain this to me satisfactorily. as far as I am concerned, it does not make sense and will never do it. Breaking Dawn is a shit and it's a waste of time watching the movie to be rewarded with the darkest end in the film's history, it's as simple as that. <br /> <br /> The director Robinson does not do anything that could have been a decent thriller, maybe he thought that what he shot would run well or maybe he was ruined in the editing room, but I imagined it was more likely to be a baseless scenario since it was trying to tie all the nonsense together in a matter of confusing minutes and give us all a shot more happy than happy. He did quite well during the first 80 minutes of the evening, but nothing was done at the end of the day. <br /> <br /> Technically, Breaking Dawn is good and generally very well done. The acting game is very good, Overton is nice and pleasing to the eyes and offers a decent performance. Is it just me or the character who played Don looks like John Morghen, star of Italian classics such as Cannibal Apocalypse (1980), City of the Living Dead (1980), The House at the Park's Edge (1980), Cannibal Ferox (1981), Stagefright (1987) & The Church (1989)? OK, maybe it was just me ... <br /> <br /> Breaking Dawn is hogwash, I hated everything because of the last few minutes. Do not get me wrong, it did not really excite me, but it was OK. Certainly one to avoid for me although there seems to be a fair share of positive comments on the IMDb ...
