In addition to comments on the technical merits of production, or lack thereof, the acting is absolutely horrible. What's really scary about this movie is that I have a copy of it, of course, it was in a business basket and it was renamed "Dark Harvest 2", and after having it view, I understand why. the basket of bargains - they should have paid me to take it out of their inventory. <br /> <br /> The majority of the film, if you want to call it that, is spent by a frantic father running around a maze cornfield looking for his daughters as he has the premonition that something will happen to them. I suspect that the camera that the girls were playing at the beginning of the movie was probably one of the production cameras for this fiasco. In the labyrinth, he meets the ghost of some children, who are poorly made, and the film goes horribly south. <br /> <br /> I understand why they renamed this movie, otherwise they would never get rid of them. Absolutely one of the worst movies I've ever seen, and it was not worth the $ 2 I spent for that.
