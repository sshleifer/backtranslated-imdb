This film features several famous actors that I like, so I had at least modest expectations when I rented this on DVD. I was very disappointed. In fact, I had some snacks somewhere in the last half hour and ended up in the kitchen instead of going back to the TV. The performances of the actor were rather mediocre and none of the ambiances of the film was really convincing. Virtually all the scenes had this feeling "just a movie", I sat waiting for the director to call "CUT!" followed by the team discussing a little of the scene before moving on to the next. <br /> <br /> Since the movie is about gangsters, most of the characters are tough and gangster-worthy, the problem here is that all this bad The attitude of the boys is so badly played that it looks like a joke. The constant soundtrack of the guitar really tries to highlight this atmosphere, but when the same track is played an 18th time, it only adds to the already strong sensation that everything is wrong. <br /> <br /> Maybe that will be all. It was really a very bad scenario, maybe it was badly executed. I am not a movie critic. In fact, I think it is rare to see something REALLY good, but it was just bad, no matter how objective my goal is and forgive me. NOT recommended, not even rented!
