A Roger Corman scam assembled for what appears to be a virtually zero budget. All the special effects were originally used in "Battle Beyond the Stars", and I guess a lot of the props, costumes and sets were also reused from other sources. The story seems to have been written around these elements, so it's not really a film, but a recycling project. The third-class junk food "Star Wars" was not needed at the time or now.
