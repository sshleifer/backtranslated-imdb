When I read "berlin am meer" for the first time, I did not expect much. but I thought that with the right people, the right places, the good music and the good fashion, you could at least make a trivial movie on the trendy sedan that everyone seems to be talking about. but eissler has failed, it is so ridiculously inauthentic. it is a false representation of what is happening in the so-called Berlin scene. Of course, not everything is a question of hippism, but you should expect more than one movie sold as "the definitive Berlin movie". <br /> <br /> and apart from everything about credibility, it's really a bad movie. mediocre game and rather boring conspiracy. Interestingly, some actors have proven in other movies that they are actually quite talented. you must not be able to control the direction well. <br /> <br /> Do not worry about watching "berlin am meer" unless you're 17, coming from a small town in western Germany and wanting to move to the big city after you. finished school. then you could actually find that nice and totally cool.
