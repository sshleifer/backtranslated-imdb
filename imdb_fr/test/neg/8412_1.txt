I usually look for good movies, even bad ones. Unfortunately, this film fails miserably - and the fact that there is hardly a single positive comment on this forum shows that many critics of IMDb share my pain. /> In general, I do not look at the suites, but I had to see it because I like so much "Rosemary's Baby". What a mistake. This simply reaffirms my belief that most suites are shabby, but fortunately, very few are as bad as that. In fact, in my mind, it's not really a sequel, it's a satire on the severity of a sequel. Film recommended very strongly not to watch-at any time.
