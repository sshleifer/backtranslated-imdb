I just saw this movie for the first time after buying it on DVD <br /> <br /> This is an inexpensive attempt to take advantage of Conan's two films. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this movie did not seem to have the same budget as Conan's movies and as a result, some sets and effects are not as flashy and some scenes seem to be in a hurry. <br /> <br /> Nielsen has the right to watch, but unfortunately she can not act if a gun is put in her head. <br /> <br /> Arnie's supporting role seemed to be favored by director Fleischer, who also directed Conan the Destroyer. Maybe Arnie was not sure she could do one of her movies like Predator, Total Recall, T2, etc. <br /> <br /> Some of the guardians of the talisman at the beginning of the movie seemed to have trouble lifting their swords and the looks on their faces suggested that they were having a lot of fun making this movie. I could not be so cheerful if I fought for my life. <br /> <br /> All that aside, this film required very little concentration and was rather entertaining. I saw a lot worse. Two stars
