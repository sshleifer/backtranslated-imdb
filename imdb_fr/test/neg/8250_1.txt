So many fans, so little to show for that. I know, I know, these words will find me in a big minority. Many people really liked Good Will Hunting. But seriously, good achievement, even close, and place the blame where it should be ... in writing. <br /> <br /> Now, I know they won an Oscar for the movie, and they have a good look on the screen. But Good Will Hunting is a special program after ABC classes, with lots of curses and a slightly higher budget. <br /> <br /> What this movie shows is the genius of Harvey Weinstein and Miramax Pictures. Mr. Weinstein could take manure, feed him, and make you think you're eating good ones. And that's exactly what the studio did with the movie. They created such a buzz of faluttin around, that people believed, and wanted to believe so much - that they saw a brilliant where there was none. <br /> <br /> Now, I know some people think it's a good movie, I do not think it's a horribly bad movie, I like to compare it to more road movies, but also to some great TV movie movies (though, although this is not the case for HBO movies, Good Will Hunting would be a day.) It's just a pretty little movie, with good performances, Robin Williams did not been good, they just gave him the Oscar because they could not wait to do it for a while. And of course, Miramax's public relations machine has assured Ben and Matt their scriptwriting Oscar ... but come on, there are better films than GWH.
