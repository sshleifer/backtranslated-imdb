I do not really remember the details of this film, except that the scenery seemed terribly familiar. I then realized that the film was filmed at the Lazy Lizard Inn in Moab, Utah. It was one of my favorite places to visit when I was younger and I was wandering around the country. The guy who owns / manages the hostel has managed to get into the movie. All I remember about the movie's plot is that it involves jeeps and naked women. It's great to just look for the landscape (I mean the rock formations) ... If you're just looking for soft-core porn, you'll probably be better served elsewhere. I do not even know if this film is available on tape or on DVD.
