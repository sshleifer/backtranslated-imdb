STAR STARTING: ***** Jodie Marsh **** Michelle Marsh *** Kym Marsh ** Rodney Marsh * Hackney Marsh <br /> <br /> Harlan Banks (Steven Seagal) is not as bad as Kevin Costner but ....... aaaaahhhh, you understand it) is a modern Robin Hood (listen well, you can hear Brian Adams music in the background ... no, not really), the kind of guy who steals money from the ill-gotten blood of drug traffickers and uses it to keep open orphanages in ruins. But now, he has been approached to drive a van in a Las Vegas holdup in one of these last things before retirement type jobs. But, of course, everything goes wrong and he completes the game for the big players at the top and in jail. There he meets a guy named (although you do not know if you are watching the movie) Ice Cool (Treach), with whom he befriends and ends up out of prison. Once free, he is ready to prove his innocence, to locate the missing money and, of course, to take revenge on those who have framed him! <br /> <br /> Of all Seagal's recently released movies, Today You Die has this aspect, especially at the movies, even with a rap star co-starring like his previous ones movie films, Half Past Dead and Exit Wounds. Yes, it seems that when he does not make films about the environment, he pretends to be a black guy and co-starred with rappers. But TYD is not a movie and it's a luxury that The Great One will never enjoy until Under Siege 3 materializes (if ever!) <br /> <br /> The film begins with a smooth and polished look that commands attention but everything is going fast down the hill. Once Seagal has entered prison, the plot quickly loses its consistency. Indeed, Treach's character seems to emerge from nowhere without any introduction as his sidekick and from there, he quickly loses interest in him. <br /> <br /> That's all. I know I already said it but I think I really think it this time. I do not think I will give more of these images directly to Seagal video movies at any time. Honestly, I have no enthusiasm to watch Shadow Man at all. In fact, I can honestly say that I have not really enjoyed any of his STV films so far, and Today You Die is certainly no exception, an apathetic and boring effort that is best avoided at all. *
