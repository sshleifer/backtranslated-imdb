I thought I could see something good but ... I'm tired after watching this movie, I do not know what I hated the most: the screenplay, the acting, the special effects or the music. Try to imagine the worst episode of Power Rangers and always be kind. I've seen better FX effects in FPS games (the contact with the bone sword or its breath that makes people disappear in a green smoke is a touch of genius) and the music seems to come from a spaghetti western. I liked the screams of women in the car when the "monster" was walking around the car (even if it looked the wrong way). So give yourself a break and do not look at this thing, at least, call someone to see a horror movie with you, believe me, you will end up playing the monopoly of some shots.
