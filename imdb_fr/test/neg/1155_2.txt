I just saw this at the Madison Horror Film Festival and I was disappointed. Some fun and shocking moments (fisting la Carla digs, a urinating harpy in Dreamland) and two interesting premises competing (similar to New Nightmare with the belief that gives life to a mythical character's head) but had long periods of no movement and a incoherent plot development. The fact that you use the dream frame or mental fugue does not make it Lynchian. You need compelling visuals and terrifying performances. <br /> <br /> Positive points: Dr. Maitland had a very comical timing and all the girls were very cute. Carla's father, Chalmers and Ingrid Pitt seemed to be having fun. And Tom Savini at least seemed to have memorized his aftershocks and we could not know if he was just reading memory cards. <br /> <br /> I have references to Hammer, but it seems that the director has understood that the script was a snoozer and just added some shocks to try to make any sequence laugh that he could to assemble. But they do not work because they are too few and create an incoherent tone. Condense it 30 minutes away from all the fun parts and you could have a surreal short film, but at length, skip it. It's not "so bad it's good" it's just "so bad it's boring".
