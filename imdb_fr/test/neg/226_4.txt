"Fool for Love" is one of the many films Robert Altman made in the 1980s that have been forgotten. This one, an on-screen adaptation of a play by Sam Shepard starring Shepard in the main role, is just not very good. Altman did a lot of not-so-good films during his fascinating career, and the blame was often his fault. But here, I think the fault lies with Shepard for writing such a fragile piece. The management of Altman is assured, the performances are excellent. considering what the actors have to work on, but this inconsequential scenario is not going anywhere, and is taking its time to get there. <br /> <br /> Shepard is Eddie, a stuntman who has a romance / hate relationship with May (Kim Basinger). The two argue relentlessly over an evening spent in a dusty motel in the middle of nowhere, while a mysterious man (Harry Dean Stanton) who may be a figurative or literal father for Eddie and May quietly watches him . Randy Quaid completes the cast of four people as a gentleman. <br /> <br /> The only dramatic hitch in the whole plot is the suggestion that the relationship between Eddie and May is incestuous. However, this hook looks more like a gadget than anything. The script does not explore their relationship in detail and does not use their relationship to explore more universal themes. Shepard and Basigner create eccentric and mannered characters that become irritating in the first five minutes; Stanton and Quaid have little to do besides providing reaction injections. <br /> <br /> The last half hour or so of the film is particularly bad, while the stories of Eddie and May begin to play in flashback on a monotonous and sleepy voice. <br /> <br /> Chalk, this until another of Altman's experiments went wrong. <br /> <br /> Grade: C-
