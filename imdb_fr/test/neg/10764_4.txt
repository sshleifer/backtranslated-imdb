Back in college, I studied marketing and, even though I missed a lot of courses and never really paid attention to anything, I will always remember the essential and most essential principle of marketing, know: it's not what you sell; it's how you sell it! This principle applies fully to the "Devil's Triangle" because it is actually a beautifully packaged and attractive package, but empty. Screenwriter / director Richard Winer knew perfectly well that he had to divert the viewer's attention from major inaccuracies. So he added elements that never fail when it comes to creating a scary atmosphere, like the sinister voice of the narrator Vincent Price and oddball music King Crimson. And I guess Richard Winer's dirty little tricks worked out pretty well, because there was a huge hype in the Bermuda Triangle in the mid-70s and literally every movie production? whether it is an inaccurate documentary or a sleazy exploitation film ?? covering the subject earned a lot of money at the box office. "The Devil's Triangle" overwhelms you with unstructured and often irrelevant data, but the harsh dramatization of the facts and of course the grave and intimidating voice of the almighty Vincent Price generates an atmosphere of dread and goose bumps. The narrative is constantly back and forth and covers a huge amount of "strange events" and "mysterious disappearances" of ships and planes in the Bermuda Triangle for a period of nearly a century, but the reports remain extremely vague at all times. and the eloquent Mr. Price invariably ends each chapter with the ominous words "Another unsolved mystery of the devil's triangle." After a few cases, the whole formula becomes simply laughable and almost pathetic, but I suppose it caused mass hysteria in 1974. The documentary develops a little more about the more notorious mysteries of the Bermuda Triangle, like the five Military Flight 19 aircraft that inexplicably disappeared all at once and the special case of the USS Cyclops ship, but even in these chapters, only a minimum of usable information is given. For example, the cameras never go underwater to explore the depths of the Bermuda region, and the testimonies of alleged real witnesses to the dramas are strangely similar to staging. If you're looking for an informative and objective documentary about the Bermuda Triangle, I certainly would not recommend this film, but if you want to listen to Vincent Price's hypnotizing voice for almost an hour, do not hesitate. !
