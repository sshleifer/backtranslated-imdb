Boyle Heights, Los Angeles: El Chupacabra, a legendary South American vampire who sucks the goat, is on the run, feeding all those who have the misfortune to cross. Animal control officer Navarro (Eric Alegria) and Starlina Divide (Elina Madison), expert and author of the Chupacabra group, try to find the creature, but find their progress hampered by a pair of idiotic policemen, locals eager for money who want to capture the beast for a big reward. , and a couple of evil scientists who want the monster for their experiments. <br /> <br /> Quite stinky higher than a two-week taco, El Chupacabra is an incredibly bad horror movie that even incredibly bad horror movie fans might find it hard to sit on. With his appalling scenario, his horrible direction (not one, but two hacks without talent ?? Brennon Jones and Paul Wynne), his laughable dialogue, and some of the worst actors on this side of a porn movie, I recommend this movie as much as I drink tap water in Mexico. <br /> <br /> While Navarro and Starlina continue their research, viewers are treated with an incredibly weak gore, the worst book jacket in history, the most unimpressive death I've seen since the Dr. Butcher MD flashing corpse, and a high-tech computerized security system consisting of a keyboard nailed to a pole. <br /> <br /> To be honest, for a man wearing a rubber suit, the monster itself is pretty scary (hairy, with big claws and a particularly ugly bat-like face) but his appearances are rare, with more time spent on the screen on the tedious trials and tribulations of whiney. of the creature titular (how often is it necessary to see Navarro h Being in paperwork to his bitch boss?). <br /> <br /> If, like me, you make the mistake of wasting your hard-earned money on this ugly Latin hold (in my case, it was a whole 50p), consider using the disc as a coaster for your tequila rather than actually watching it.
