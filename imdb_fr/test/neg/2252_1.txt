I deliberately did not read any reviews of this movie on IMDb before I watched it, because I really wanted to see it and get an idea. I've been a big fan of QT in the past, I think we can all agree that he has made some great movies, but recently he seems to have been defeated by his own mystique and gone from its foundations. This "film" proves it. It consists of a few scenes of the Basterds at work. Instead, it consists mainly of long and tedious boring discussions between people who, after a while, realize that you are not giving anything. It's been a long time and there is no shortage of the great sparkling dialogues that QT was responsible for in the past. The entire film is anti-climatic. There is no tension - what happens in each scene is telegraphed so clearly in advance that when that happens, you do not care anymore. Honestly, do not believe the hype. This is a very boring movie and you will not miss anything if you do not see it.
