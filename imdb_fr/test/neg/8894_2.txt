Any Russian film lover will have a hard time believing in the mediocre performances of Mashkov and Bodrov Jr., and may be completely confused by Bodrov Sr.'s baffling and confusing scenario, which is associated with unusually weak leadership. Most characters go through the movie as if they had no idea who they were or what they were doing. It's also unfortunate that Jennifer Jason Leigh's acting talents have not grown by one-quarter since FAST TIMES AT RIDGEMONT HIGH and her screen time is thankfully limited. It's a terrible mafia film. so much so that the GODFATHER III looks like a winner of its kind. To see the best Russians at their best, check out Bodrov Sr.'s work on PRISONER OF THE MOUNTAINS (who also presents Jr.), Mashkov's turn in VOR (THE THIEF) and Bodrov Jr.'s new criminal at BRAT .
