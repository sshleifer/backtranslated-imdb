When I went to see that, I thought I liked the first two and thought they were very busy, so this one should be good too. FALSE! There was NO suspense and they did not explain the new dinosaurs! When I finished watching this, I had lost all respect for Steven Spielberg and Michael Crichton, but it turned out that it had not been done by Spielberg or written by Michael Crichton! This film went through "the movements". I thought this movie had absolutely no plot and I thought no one should waste their money to see it.
