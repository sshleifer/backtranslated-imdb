This film was a disappointment. The story is essentially The Shining with a castle (or a very cheap set pretending to be a castle, to be precise) by replacing it with the hotel and a monster instead of ghosts. The budget is the same as that of a Cinemax softcore porn movie, just like the photography, sets, lighting and video on which it was shot. The story is a failed attempt at sincerity: there is no easier way to make your audience friendly to your characters than to show them the experience of emotional trauma. And the trauma in this film is pretty commonplace. Do you want an example? A blind girl listening to a language tape that teaches Italian words for colors begins to cry from what she will never see. <br /> <br /> This movie had some goals, however: the monster is actually pretty cool, pretty scary. And there is a pretty good amount of nudity from Raffaella Offidani, herself a star of Italian "erotic" movies. The gore, however, leaves much to be desired, as does the cast of actors, even from the experienced Jeffrey Combs. <br /> <br /> Other than that, I only saw two other Stuart Gordon films: Re-Animator and From Beyond, both were remarkable. But I will not let this little note of his career stop me from watching much more of his films.
