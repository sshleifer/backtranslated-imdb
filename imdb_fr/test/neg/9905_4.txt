The first two hours of the TV version are full of character shows and intrigues. After a brief sequence at the beginning of which Las Vegas was hit by tornadoes, the action does not really begin until two o'clock. Nevertheless, certain relations of character become clear only in the second part. The actors play competent performances, but nothing special (however, better than those of "Aftershock: Earthquake in New York"). Randy Quaid, whose character is superfluous and incredibly annoying, is an exception. The plot is a fairly standard mix of "Independence Day", "Speed", "The day after tomorrow", "Earthquake", "The Towering Inferno" and several other movies. You can predict what will happen next and approach you to predict the dialogue, word for word. The special effects are incredibly bad. Despite the effects of "Twister", the tornadoes of this movie seem less realistic than those of "The Wizard of Oz" and other effects have obviously been produced for a price lower than the "CSI" and "Cold Case" series "the whole of a single episode. If you have to watch a disaster movie designed for television, see "The day after", "Asteroid" or "Special Bulletin" - you'll get better conspiracies, actors and effects.
