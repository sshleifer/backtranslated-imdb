As a michigan, I got the Michigan jokes. Very funny - make fun of Pontiac, Ann Arbor, all those lame suburbs of Detroit. Yes, yes, I have heard these jokes a million times. I will attribute to them the merit of having accurately described the lameness of Grosse Pointe. It could not become whiter. Have you heard those beautiful Michigan nasal accents? Where do girls talk so fast that you can not understand a word that comes out of their mouth ...? As much as I love Michigan, I hated this movie. <br /> <br /> I have never met a person from Grosse Pointe who I like. Listen to this horrible band and this boring and horrible background music! What is it? A group of your homeboy's Gross Pointe? Probably. Wow, what a beautiful "Detroit scene" you have there. It's funny how the people of Grosse Pointe always say they are from Detroit. They are so white and rich that they would like to have something to complain about. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this movie explodes. From lame jokes about girls in thongs to the terrible development of characters. Oh, wait a minute, you mean the character's base is that he says a lot the word-f? What a deep personality. Great job, Big Pointers! And I love all the sexist jargon, as the narrator calls the first killed girl that we do not even hear about as a "talkative na√Øve". It's really charming. <br /> <br /> And these homemade masks with Marilyn Manson contact lenses are really great. And I really like the sense of why bikers came to kill people. And how did their master narrator have such a clear role in the film ... ?? The main guy was so boring that I fell asleep watching him. The three fools (or was it two or four? How do I know, they all look the same and act the same way!) They tried so desperately to make me laugh, but Beavis and Butthead had already escaped from laughing. 1994 And with gay jokes No wonder this movie is scary - everyone involved must have some minor masculinity issues, eh boys? <br /> <br /> The only thing that saves from this movie is the main girl. Despite what other people have said, she was actually a good actress. Teen girls talk as she spoke. They really act as she did. His game was very natural and credible. I really thought she was a Grosse Pointe convenience store employee. .. maybe she is! And yes, she had big breasts, most women here. Michigan is the biggest state of the union, you know. In all respects. <br /> <br /> So those of you who think this is a representation of Detroit is not. It's the suburbs of Detroit. They are very white and full of endless teenage anxiety. Limp Bizkut, ICP (yes, ICP belongs to one of our suburbs) and khaki pants at $ 75! Rich and poor children who are crazy because they have a lot of money and nothing to complain about. And they also make bad movies. <br /> <br />
