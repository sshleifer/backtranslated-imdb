"Yesterday" as a film is difficult to evaluate. The cinematography is excellent and deserves a 9/10. The story is serious and real and does not compromise. But the translation of the story on the screen by the actors did not correspond to the work of the camera. <br /> <br /> As a native born and raised in Central Africa, I appreciated the authenticity of the film's look and honesty. representation of the daily life of the Zulus. But this and the camera work are not enough to recommend the average viewer should see this movie. It takes an appreciation of true cinema and not just a love of movies to see the purpose and strength of "Yesterday". <br /> <br /> Unlike the 1980 movie "The gods must be crazy", which was a comical look at an African culture confronted with modern technology, "Yesterday" has no intention of pleasing a heterogeneous audience. The film is simply not suited to the common Western mind - and I doubt it is intended for the Western mind. The scenes are long and slow, the editing is not punctuated for a world of instant gratification + 60 mph. Dialogue is not a chopper or spiritual, it is real. The films on health crises do not make the best entertainment and this film is not entertainment, it's an education. <br /> <br /> This film is best seen by those who know, appreciate and love the lifestyle and culture of Sarah Sarah Africa. If you lack a worldview wide enough to understand other cultures, especially African cultures, you should skip this film. Do not waste your time with that. Go see "Talladega Nights" or "Larry the Cable Guy" instead for your intercultural vision. <br /> <br /> I give it a 4 for most people who would like to see the movie but do not understand African cultures well. . For viewers who enjoy movies about the human experience all over the world, I would give them a rating of 7.
