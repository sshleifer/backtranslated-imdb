Bridget Fonda is the sexually satisfied woman of the handsome Hart Bochner. One afternoon, she goes home, calls her "darling" and quietly prepares a drink, only to find that he was sulking. The minutes run out as she stands her gloomy silence. Suddenly, he gets angry, accusing her of unfaithfulness in the complete absence of reason to do so, calls her the word C, strikes her against a piece of furniture, slaps her, and ends up throwing her off the second floor. balcony, breaking his hand and some ribs. <br /> <br /> She wakes up in the hospital where, we learned, she is deaf, although we noticed that she reads the lips perfectly. This avoids all the annoyance associated with an ASL interpreter or that his words resonate in a sham language. <br /> <br /> Very good. Let me just expose the basic elements of the plot. This beautiful and devoted disabled woman is beaten by her husband, misunderstood by his elderly mother, betrayed by his sister, is dumped his bank account by unknown hands, almost raped by a fat man who accosted him in a bar, murdered her husband, now missing, is pursued by two policemen (Kiefer Sutherland and Steven Weber), one of whom is only interested in justice, while the other seems to hate all women and is embarrassed by their presence. The end finds her alone at a deserted bus stop, her hand full of cash - alone, in tears, but brave. <br /> <br /> Now, a quiz pop. There is only one multiple choice question. "This story was written by: (a) a man or (b) a woman." Do not look sexist. One could also easily pose the scenario of a decorated military hero and a trained warrior, captured by his enemies, betrayed by his organization, beaten and tortured, escaped to take his revenge and ending up with the woman he loves, the one he thought he was. d lost for a long time. <br /> <br /> Management is functional and conventional. When Fonda regains consciousness in a hospital bed, we see from her point of view the faces of the worried doctors and nurses watching her - that is, the camera - an echo of every scene in a myriad of movies of second quality the guru is rushed down the hallway and people wearing starched white blouses and festooned with stethoscopes fly over the camera. <br /> <br /> Hart Bochner played a number of diabolical people in interesting ways - some of the characters are dumb ("Die Hard") and some are rather rude ("And The Sea Will Tell"). His virile beauty has a kind of perverse hue. It would be too easy to turn him into a hero. Steven Weber's beautiful, intentionally sweet performance as a silly policeman - perhaps the best of the movie. <br /> <br /> Bridget Fonda is also interesting. Its scope is limited, but its display is complete here. What makes her an object of interest is her almost stereotypical beauty. She is like a queen of high school prom. Very feminine. Of course, she can not help it if she goes to bed or moves her hands so gracefully. She can not do anything with her nose either. It is perfectly normal and attractive over most of its length, but at its end there is a hump that follows the natural thrust of its nostrils. The tip of this nose is full of intrigues. <br /> <br /> Regarding the film - Pfui.
