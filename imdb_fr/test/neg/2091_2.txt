This train wreck begins when Brujo and Alma cross the Mexican border. Alma suffers from a horrible curse that causes the garden snakes and Nickelodeon Gac to vomit every few minutes, as well as clenching her teeth and whispering nonsense. So, apparently, Alma has this uncle in Los Angeles who knows he's healed. They board a train to get there, and luckily one of their friends pays them. Alma and Brujo remain in the luggage cart during the entire movie because they can not afford seats of the upper class. Meanwhile, in the upper class, we see a group of people heading to Los Angeles for some reason. A bald man on a business trip, two girls, one carrying $ 5,000 and a wad of cocaine, three stoners and Mexicans. The Mexicans are arguing with Brujo and trying to take his "weed" which is apparently a sedative for Alma's snakes crawling inside her. They realize that snakes do not attack, they enter your body through your veins! Very crooked and B-Movie. Brujo saves the guy by tearing his heart (Temple Of Doom style) and procuring the snake. For some reason, he can not hurt snakes, otherwise it would hurt Alma. Meanwhile, a narcotics expert tries to break one of the girls and gets a small action (topless) in exchange for not talking about his drug shipment. A mysterious man introduces himself and has a fight with him. In the finale, Alma transforms into a vampire, bites his man and then becomes a giant pathetic excuse for a CG snake the size of a train, eats the train and is projected into a whirlwind of nuclear hurricane and disappears. Everyone then goes to Los Angeles on foot. <br /> <br /> The credits actually indicate at the end "Any similarity with a real person, living or dead, or with a real event is purely fortuitous and very strange.We suggest to move and / or take a plane ". Strange because a bald phrase in the movie is "Yeah, I hate planes!" The credits then say, "No snakes were hurt in the production of this scenario, only a small child, but it's cool." There were actually a LOT of real snakes used in the movie, and all very tame. There is actually no scene of CG snakes attacking anyone unless you count the big one, but then he just eats the train and the other fake snake is just the head and looks like a muppet. Snakes do not really attack anything, they are just ... there. The film is neither funny nor scary (because there is no real snake attack), and is only a "quick cashing" which is the perfect time for a low budget movie company to hear about from a big-budget Hollywood release, then hastily release a similar movie, or even a parody version, for a release just before or simultaneously with the big movie. This has the effect that many people will either confuse each other and go see the quickie rather than the "big" or they will want to see both, for some reason ... like me. Avoid at all costs.
