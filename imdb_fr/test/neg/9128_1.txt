Koyaanisquatsi is simply the best movie I have ever seen. It's a masterpiece where everything is in the right place. Some scenes are neither "beautiful" nor "beautiful", but the camera never glances and never interferes. This is exactly what is happening here. The camera is used to intrude, dishonor and ridicule. There is no magic flow here, no sense of greatness or respect. Instead, some scenes are concocted without purpose or plan. The music is disturbing. Just as I rated Koyaanisquatsi as the best film ever made, this one is the worst. It's also a "pure" film, but it's the negative form, exactly what should not be done.
