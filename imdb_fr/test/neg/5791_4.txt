As a CA resident, I would like to see power holes that shut down power plants to raise prices also have a jail sentence. <br /> <br /> I thought the film was pretty good and it contained very informative pieces. While they were sticking to how Enron had risen and crashed, I found it really interesting. However, when the film focused on its anti-Bush trend, I wondered if they were really accurate. <br /> <br /> It is good to report any Republican relationship to Enron, but the monster was created while Clinton was president. The energy crisis of the CA occurred under the supervision of Davis. Both were stationed during the Enron abuses, but none of them are held responsible in any way. Instead, many minutes passed on how Bush was friends with Lay. So what? Lay played golf with Clinton and spent the night in Lincoln's room. Why do Democrats have such a free pass in this movie? I think most politicians are wasting money on our taxpayers, so I'm not part of the party, but I hate to feel part of someone's political program when I watch a documentary. Yes, politicians deserve a fault, but I really doubt that the only culprits have R after their name. I found no interest in portraying Bush as loving Kay when the Democrats received as much money from the Enron campaign as the Republicans. As I said, this weakens the rest of the film because I'm suspicious of the rest of the facts they describe.
