In this film, everything was impossible and I do not know why I bothered to watch it until the end. It would have been more fun to watch the paint dry. For crying aloud, I even liked D-Tox and it was better than that. Here is the basic plot for you: A redneck is stung by snakes that hold the devil of 13 murderers and becomes a machine to kill the undead, murdering teenagers without personality. During the movie, I lost hope when it did not scare me, when the murders were bad and there was BAD CGI blood and CGI snakes. The situation worsened with the thin cardboard characters who killed their friend by holding her by the legs and preventing her from leaving, she got impaled by a tree and when the villain moved underwater like the Jaws shark. I am always annoyed by the fact that it bothers me. I guess I'm a fan of horror movies.
