Reading most other reviews, I tend to agree with most of the reviews. The only thing I would like to add is the disjointed way in which the film was directed and produced. I think some of these new wave directors think they're smart using unusual camera angles (sometimes jerky) and moving from one scene to another. It's going well with these film festivals and some of those independent-type critics, but it spoils the film. I noticed in the reviews, a comment saying that none of these filmmakers movies have become blockbusters. Maybe that would prove what I meant, because the movie has that feeling of hasty ending that makes you wonder why such a beautiful movie seems to lack fluidity. Regarding the comment that Kiefer Sutherland would be a big name to feature on the poster, I would bet he was scared watching the final cup. It's a story with real potential, wasted trying to be different in its production. It's worth watching, but not many would come back for a second sight.
