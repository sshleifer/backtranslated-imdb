This is without a doubt the worst movie I have ever seen. It's so bad that I plan to rent it again as soon as I can find it. This film makes "Plan 9 of Outer Space" look like an Oscar nominee. Just looking at the actors makes me want to laugh out loud. I can not say enough bad things about this movie. It's a horror that looks like a perfection. <br /> <br /> The plot is based on a terrorist attack with a nuclear weapon in San Francisco (I think). It's as far as I can go ... I laugh too much. I know it should not be funny, but ..... * LOLOLOLOLOLOLOL * <br /> <br /> PASS ON ED WOOD !!! <br /> <br /> Look's * DATo *
