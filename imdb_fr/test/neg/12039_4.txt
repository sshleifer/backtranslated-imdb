They prove that the cops, when they can not find the real perpetrators, always blame the parents and accuse them of sexually abusing their children. These films still portray the press as a group of animals and have parents coming out of court to feed the hunger of the press and humiliate sorrows. Have we ever heard of a courthouse in these films? Here you have a psychic who tells them exactly what happened and where the body can be found, but no one tells the police and no one takes his findings into account. <br /> <br /> The police are portrayed as a fool who does not know it. Know what they are doing and there is always an outside detective, like Ed Asner, who arrives late on the case, believes in his parents and resolves the mystery. <br /> <br /> In addition, once the parents have been laundered, they do not spit on the faces of the idiotic police who put them in prison, took their child and accused them of killing their child. own child. <br /> <br /> Looks like I've seen this film a LOT of times before.
