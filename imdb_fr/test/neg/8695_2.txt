English accents to violence so useless after the violence. Show Moses as a murderer. People who really believe in the Old Testament will sit there and shake their heads. I am not a religious person at all. But even I felt that the writers of this film were trying to turn us all against God and the Jews. When Moses picked up this rock and threw the woman at the first stone to kill her for committing adultery. I wanted to stone the writers. I can not believe at this time that Hallmark and ABC (Disney) are trying to show such garbage. Do not we already have enough problems in this world?
