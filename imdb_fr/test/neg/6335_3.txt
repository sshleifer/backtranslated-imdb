Yet another cookie-cut movie about a hardened adult who meets an adorable, stylish kid (Cop and 1/2, Gloria, etc.). And again, it's neither funny nor interesting, that we look at anyone - children or adults. I'm sure some people may find this movie fun, but I do not know why. Again, I'm sorry for the poor children who were forced to work in this movie, so that everyone else and their parents could make money at the price of a lame movie.
