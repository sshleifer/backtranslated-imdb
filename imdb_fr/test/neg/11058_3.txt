In another case of misleading marketing, this film is included in a set of DVDs titled "Women Who Kick Butt", but even in its original cover, it seems to promise Shannon Tweed to play an active role. In fact, during most of the film, Tweed embodies the typical female character who must be saved by the male lead role. Even when she is drawn to war in the jungle, she must always be dragged by him! There is a rebellious woman who is a stronger character, but she has mostly remained on the sidelines of the film. The first male role is Reb Brown, and he has fun moments (unintentionally, I think) (like when he's electrocuted). The action scenes are poorly directed and misinterpreted: some stuntmen needed some lessons on "how to be shot and die convincingly". I guess if you're in a good mood, you can find things in "Firing Line" that you can laugh at (at one point, you could hear Tweed speak but his lips did not move!), But mostly I was bored . (*)
