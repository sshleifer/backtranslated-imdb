If I heard the male lead say, "It's madness!" Once again, I would have apologized. The film is a big shot, with false attitudes of "mold under the heel". Not a man in this film has a quality that redeems; reminds me of Soviet-era movies with strongly political messages. I could not even understand WHY there was an attraction between tracks, and I could not wait for the end.
