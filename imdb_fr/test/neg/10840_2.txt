There have been decent moments in this movie, and sometimes it was pretty funny. However, that did not make up for the fact that, overall, it was an extremely boring film. There was NO chemistry between Ben Affleck and Sandra Bullock in this film, and I did not understand why he would even consider letting his future wife serve this girl who was stunned. There was better chemistry between him and Liv Tyler at Armageddon. Hell, there was better chemistry between Sly and Sandra in Demolition Man. <br /> <br /> There were several moments in the movie that simply did not need to be there and were extremely slow. <br /> <br /> It was a mediocre remake of "My Best Wedding Friend". Wait for the video to run for a year and a half and rent it in the 49 cents box if you have nothing to do on a rainy Sunday afternoon and you can not think of better movies to rent.
