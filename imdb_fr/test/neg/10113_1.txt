I do not even understand what they tried to accomplish with this movie, I mean really. You have this guy running away from a gang of cats, because he's dead, but to be really dead, this girl has to shoot them down? And they leave a corpse even if normal people can not see them because of their deaths? The screenplay already has a hole the size of Nebraska, then you have the main character played by Susan Paterno. a female terminator robot. It's absolutely horrible and I do not even understand how I managed to see it until the end of the film. The ending being as stupid as the whole movie evokes, and gives absolutely no reward to the viewer. They might as well call this film "the little film that could choo-choo ka-choo".
