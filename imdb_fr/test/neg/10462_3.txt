Construction workers disrupt the Amerindian graveyard with a large, imposing skeleton monster that disintegrates its victims by touch, breath or bone sword! Krantz (Jim Storm), who is responsible for the resort project, tells his construction team not to disclose their skeletal discoveries. This would put a brake on development if the neighboring tribe of Katona took the wind, which detached and disturbed the wind. The aging Bruce Boxleitner, friendly as ever, plays Sheriff Evans, a half-caste, trying to keep the peace between the Katonas and Krantz's crew. The peace was at best tense, but with this common skeletal monster that makes his victims disappear without a trace, Krantz wants to know why the crew members have disappeared ... Evans is also starting to lose citizens. Katona's leader, Storm Cloud (Michael Horse), warns Evans that a former demon, the Bone Eater, has been released and can only be arrested with a sacred battle ax (the ax was removed by a worker who found out he was with the gun thrown in) now in the back seat of his daughter Kelly (Clara Bryant, who wears skinny jeans and a shirt to reveal how daddy's daughter became a woman while beauty) the boyfriend's truck. Evans must somehow defeat the demon if the killing is to stop ... and this must happen before the Eclipse, otherwise his power will become too powerful for anyone to defeat him. <br /> <br /> A solid cast, collapsing into an embarrassing horror outlet. The CGI is not very good, although the monster could have been quite threatening if it was done with a better budget. He rides a horse made of dust chasing his prey, for Petesake! BUCK ROGERS: Gil Gerard as Evan MP, Big Jim, Walter Koenig of STAR TREK as Coroner, and William Katt of HOUSE, as a Field Doctor healing the wounds of the MP for Evan. None of these cameos last more than a minute or more ... really, really. Adoni Maropis, impresses in his underlying role as Katona, Johnny Black Hawk, who wants to use the bone eater to chase the white man out of the country of his tribe. Jennifer Lee Wiggins portrays Kaya, a tasty dish from a Katona woman whose hatred against Black Hawk for White and wants Evans to follow his Indian blood to end the Bone Eating Monster. It might be worth sitting so just to see Boxleitner dressed in war paint and Indian costume. To be honest, I felt for the actor, while Bruce was trying to keep the right face in such a terrible movie. In another tired and tedious snapshot, the Bruce sheriff has a strange relationship with his 17-year-old daughter, who is hot and wants to date the "bad boy" ... although it becomes a subscript underwritten as most of the plot concerns the deadly skeleton and many undeveloped characters.
