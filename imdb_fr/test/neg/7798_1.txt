I saw the preview in Femalien and thought it might be a cool movie. It turns out that it is a terrible trash. There is not a lot of nudity in the movie, not to mention not having a lot of sex either. There were just some silly and tacky dialogues with uninteresting dances that you usually expect to see at an audition. In our case, you can even see it in real movies. Conclusion: I do not have one for that. Leave alone.
