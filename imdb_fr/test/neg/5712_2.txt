It's very brilliant soft-porn; a boring soap opera that focuses on one thing: sex. Unfortunately, they made sex boring, sad to say, because I challenge you to look at it casually and tell me what the story was. What is it, is an excuse for Kim Bassinger to show his big body and for Mickey Rourke to smile a lot. That's all. Rourke's rigor is so horrible that she's disgusting and Bassinger, despite his great figure, looks cheaper than good. <br /> <br /> Congratulations to the photographer for his beautiful close-ups and beautiful colors, but the story is so weak - no character development and no plot - he is unable to compensate. Let's face it: this film was made for one reason - to amaze viewers. At this level, it has probably succeeded. If I remember correctly, that's why I took a look at it as a follower of Bassinger's look, but I was also waiting for a story. <br /> <br /> Those who try to make it look like "arty" and something deeper than sweet porn are just fooling themselves.
