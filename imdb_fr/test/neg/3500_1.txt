Terrible, very artificial writing by a "benefactor" who knows absolutely nothing about race relations in Latin America or the United States today. The rave reviews are a mystery to me - but can only be provided by people who think that someone's "good" intentions should be applauded, no matter how deep, simple ideas and totally unrealistic results. If you want to see a film that realistically addresses the issues of race nowadays - the movie you must see (and probably already seen) is Pulp Fiction. There is more honesty and realism regarding the race within two minutes of this film than in the full four hours (oh forgive me, it seemed like it was like four hours) of this shabby. <br /> <br /> If anyone needs to prove that hell is paved with good intentions, this movie is for you.
