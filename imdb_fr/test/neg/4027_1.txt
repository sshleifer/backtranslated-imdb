This is what my friends and I have continued to ask throughout this film. We could not believe how stupid it was! I think someone filmed this at home with their camcorder and slipped it into the movie store and put it on the shelf as a joke to see if anyone would do it someday. Well, I guess the joke is on us. <br /> <br /> I guess I would have had to go to this website first and read all the reviews he received; everyone says that this movie is HORRIBLE, STUPID, and again and again. And boy are they right! Although it made some very good laughs (my friends and I were pretty drunk) because it's so stupid. We just can not believe someone was stupid enough to make such a shitty movie! I swear it had to be done in the '70s before I had good technology for movies and stuff, because every scene looks really shabby, but when I looked here I was told it had been done in 2001? What? It certainly does not look like a movie that would be made today, but I guess that's what you get when you're using a camcorder and you shoot movies at home using strobe lights and real fake lasers, and that you use real people from your hometown actors or even actors in the making. BTW-some of those chicks (or were they drag-queens, we could not tell!) Were so ugly, even my drunken college buddies did not want to touch them with a 50-foot stick. <br /> <br /> So, this film has absolutely no appeal: bad acting, bad writing, bad staging, bad effects, bad, bad, bad. Do not waste your time and money on this one, you will be completely disappointed!
