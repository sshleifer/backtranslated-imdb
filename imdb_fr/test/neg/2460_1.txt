A group of medical students meet in their spare time to plug the electrical cables and die. Then, they calculate the time that precedes brain death, then start the CPR, the cardiac massages and recover. The fact that Julia Roberts is in this film should tell all. FLATLINERS is like the GHOST group. Everyone wants to see their dead parents and visit their old dead friends. So what better than to do it by a group of medical students who kill you for five minutes before bringing you back to life. The rest of the movie has predictable relationship problems, plus the predictable "GEE MAYBE IF WE KEEP KILLING each other, one of the days will remain dead?" Oh! This film should have been called BRAIN DEAD. The fact that the characters were described as medical students led me to wonder whether they went to a correspondence school abroad to graduate. The only thing that prevented this film from being a total laugh was that they did not just put their fingers in the electrical outlets to "die". This film would have been an excellent comedy in TROIS STOOGES.
