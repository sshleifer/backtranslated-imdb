I watched 40 minutes and could not stand it anymore ?? the television went out and I went back to reading "Lobotomy for Beginners". <br /> <br /> It was difficult to say which aspect of this production was the most unpleasant - a dialogue entirely made up of sounds or actors. in numbers. <br /> <br /> It was difficult to determine the period during which the drama was to unfold. There were disposable references to Lord Nelson and slavery, but Edmund, the future cleric played by Blake Ritson, was the only actor who could be thought to have lived in the early 19th century. The other bright young people had the makeup and costumes more appropriate for a disguised night of the 21st century - blond blonde Fanny, Billie Piper being the least credible character. <br /> <br /> British commercial television obviously believes to be upset breasts, sulky lips and deep, meaningful looks make a good story. Fortunately, Jane Austen had other ideas. <br /> <br /> If you want to discover the history of Mansfield Park, buy the DVD of the 1983 mini-series.
