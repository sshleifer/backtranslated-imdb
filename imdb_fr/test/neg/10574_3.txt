And so, it started with "Shreik", a series of horror movies, and then we got Scary Movie, a truly successful attempt at a new genre genre, the famous one. However .... now we have: Scary Movie * Scary Movie 2 Scary Movie 3 Scary Movie 4 * Movie Date Meet the Spartans not another team movie * plus many more (really funny movies marked with *) <br /> <br /> and ..... The superhero movie .... it seems that the people who make these movies can not yet understand what makes the shipments funny. Using the scams of other movies in a fun way is a good thing if done right, but few producers seem to know how to do it. The horror movie (1) did it well, the following were horrible as we tried to play the franchise, but the movie was bought by Scary Movie 4. No other teen movie was so good because he was using periodontics ... his credit, I'm sick of teen movies. However, this movie plays like a bad version of it all. it is based on a slap that would thrill even the three accomplices, violating the image of Stephen peddling, and then, when people start to get bored (and the producers knew when it would be), we receive Pamela Anderson in a tight suit. to conclude, the parodies should consist in making a model of an original film with an original scenario, in the manner of a tribute, without plastering randomly taken from a legitimate film on the scenario of a real film. <br /> <br /> ... I shudder at the idea of ​​"SCI-FI MOVIE" and prepare my seppuku knife
