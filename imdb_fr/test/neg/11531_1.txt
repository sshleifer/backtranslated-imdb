I had fun for the first 45 minutes. or so, but suddenly everything was down the hill. The suspense began to fade a little and the jokes pretty much the same. It was the good actors who made things happen. <br /> <br /> But the problem with this film is that it tries to be cleverly funny, like Tarantino and god, it's an obsolete thing. Tarantino is sometimes a little overestimated, this film arrives ten years too late. At best, it's for teens, and I'm sure many of them find Johann's character fun, which is for the first 30 minutes. The other problem I have with it is that the story fades more and more towards the end, I tried to find a recovery point. Maybe he did not recover because the lack of passion comes from the effort to be cleverly funny. In addition, as in many films, good actors who can afford it do not seem to demand a better dialogue, or simply refuse the script.
