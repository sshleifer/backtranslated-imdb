Normally, I would not waste my time criticizing a useless movie like this. However, I do not work this week and so I have plenty of time to wallow in meaningless banalities. For starters, let me say that I really like non-commercial, non-mainstream and non-American cinema. (Feel free to click on my user profile to get a support filmography.) That said, many bad movies have been released in countries other than the United States. Trust me, hundreds of them tortured me. "Lost In Beijing" is a particularly bad movie. <br /> <br /> The half-hour opening is an impressive, uninterrupted exhibition of moral degeneracy. This film presents classic mores of the same level as "Bad Guy" by Kim Ki-duk (2001). <br /> <br /> 1. women like to be raped; 2. rape must be glorified, praised and respected; 3. Do not be afraid to rape any woman you love, because if you "do" she will eventually love her and reach orgasm; 4. If your wife gets raped, be sure to blackmail her rapist for a lot of money, but if he does not pay, hit her woman slut several times in compensation; 5. If your wife gets raped, make sure to fuck her and degrade her the next day by playing the role of the rapist, provoking her with phrases like "Did you like it like that?" ? "; 6. If your husband is a rapist, accept it; 7. Once you have been personally raped, become friends with your rapist and spend time with him whenever possible. <br /> <br /> How can a sensible person be interested in one of these characters? They are nothing more than a group of degenerates who not only live their lives carelessly, but revel in their lack of meaning and support each other. Do not understand me wrong though. I am very capable of watching movies that describe lifestyles and manners contradictory with mine. "Ichi the Killer" (2001) and "Moonlight Whispers" (1999) are very interesting representations of sadomasochism. "Strange Circus" (2005) is an extremely evil game about sexual abuse of children. "Marriage is a crazy thing" (2002) is a scathing indictment on traditional marriage. Even religious films like "Running On Karma" (2003) and "Samsara" (2001) entertained me occasionally. The difference is that these films actually have interesting psychological content and character development, while "Lost In Beijing" has almost none. <br /> <br /> It is well known that people with unorthodox mentalities exist on this planet, but without some kind of character development or psychology behind the acts themselves, you end up with a superficial exposure of despicable behavior. Why, exactly, does Bing Bing end up being a friend and taking care of her rapist? Why does a rapist's wife accept his unconditional behavior? Filmmakers have never bothered to tell us. Even the obvious juxtaposition of the rich and the poor was conceived of unnecessarily and ultimately served as a ploy. All this seems too bland and forgettable after the end of the dirty half-hour opening. <br /> <br /> Other critics seem to have confused moral ambiguity and complex characterization. The reason you can not choose the person you are going to rely on is because they have not been developed properly. Do not think this movie has complex characters just because they are not clearly defined. On the contrary, the reason they are not clearly defined is that we do not know anything about them or what they think. This is not a positive attribute of this movie. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, the work of the camera and the acting are pretty good, but everything else gets duller as the movie progresses. You can place it next to trash such as "Turning Gate" (2002), "What time is it" (2001), "Irreversible" (2002) and the "Bad type" above.
