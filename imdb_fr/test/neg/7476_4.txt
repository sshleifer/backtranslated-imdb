Again, we get a mix of themes well covered by so many previous movies. The good and the bad son, courtesy East of Eden. The story of the heroes of the US Navy, who does not consider himself as such because of what he knows. And the woman in mourning may fall in love with another man's story. <br /> <br /> The mere fact that these stories are so ubiquitous does not pose a problem though. Because theoretically, they could always be better presented and treated each time. No luck this time, because these three wires end up falling flat in the same way. <br /> <br /> As the bad son never really talks to his father, the conflict is never solved properly. Apart from the father who begins to appreciate the bad son thanks to the latter who renovates the kitchen of the woman in mourning. Now, how good is it? <br /> <br /> Then, the surprising sailor on the return who suspects his wife of being in conflict of infidelity will never be solved. Because he never really talks to the suspicious man, namely his own brother. So, once again, we have a piece of paper here. <br /> <br /> And finally, the theme of the hypocrisy of American military heroism, where the navy is publicly regarded as a hero when, because of the dirt of the war he has gone through, he should not really be called one of them according to its own standards, this third theme falls flat in the same way. Because the film ends well when, for the first time, he is able to talk to his wife about what he has been through. Where the real story would begin at this point, namely his recovery process, what it would look like and how he would finally face the family, he would have a major guilt to admit. All this, all the really interesting elements are passed and ignored. <br /> <br /> So, although it's a story film, it's a serious movie, and I mean a serious disappointment, I'll still give him points for the impressive one. discard. Although no movie should use Maguire as a voiceover because it belongs to Spiderman. In particular, an adult Gyllenhaal seems to meet all the expectations he had raised as a budding young actor. So much that I would really like to see him entrust a very deep and demanding lead role, with an adequate profile. <br /> <br /> So, if the cast really seems to do what it can, I consider this film totally forgettable otherwise. A pinch of shallow tears and finally pretentious, totally unsatisfactory. Message of the day to writers: we already know the wounds, see the Vietnamese film host. You want to earn credit, show us a credible healing.
