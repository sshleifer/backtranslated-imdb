I went to the movies with a little apprehension, I got angry when I saw the trash (pass for a movie) that I had witnessed. The actors, in particular Travolta, should be ashamed to have participated in this project. Obviously, the only thing in their minds was the paycheck, not to mention the degradation of their talents and ourselves. Travolta must start making more movies "Look who speaks", because it has fallen back to his work before Tarantino. This results in something when the L W Talking suites are better than this one. Travolta is no longer the king of cool but the king of corn. Michael Caine himself admitted to doing bad paycheck movies, Trvolta should do the same if he has self-respect!
