I was surprised to discover that Michael Moore or Bill Maher was not involved in this "film". A laundry list of left American axes to grind, with a small distance from the Democrats in hell. Mao Zedong and Karl Marx did not appear in hell, but is Ronald Reagan in the same room as Hitler? Perhaps we will have to wait for these Californian forensic doctors to charge Paradiso with showing them all the political figures of their favorite ideologue. <br /> <br /> Blow for religion, right-wing politicians, businesses and their lobbyists, Fox News, even the SUVs. All of the radical left-talking points were too completely covered - obviously omitting any reference to wrongdoing on the "other side of the aisle" - for not having been a conscious effort. The singular exception that I noticed during the hours and a half is that JFK must have sex with Marilyn Monroe for all eternity.
