I was extremely disappointed with this one. Having just read the wonderful story of Oscar Wilde, I had hoped that some magic would be translated on the screen. Well, there was none. This version has been interpreted as a condensed and silent film from Reader's Digest. Not only did he feel rushed, he was devalued and rewrote uselessly. The main characters and plot points have been either changed or completely removed I appreciate the difficulties encountered in trying to present a novel on screen, especially with what might very well have been a limited budget (television) but there is nothing to excuse such a story. I highly recommend reading Wilde's tale about depravity that exists even under the most beautiful exteriors. But I can not advise anyone to praise this parody.
