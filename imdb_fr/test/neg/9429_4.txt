If good intentions make a great movie, then this movie could be one of the greatest movies ever made. The film has great actors, a master director, an important theme - at least a potentially significant theme, a nuance of existential weariness of the fifties, aerial scenes that should have moved the senses and the imagination, as well as characters deeply care. It's a question of patriotism and patriotism. <br /> <br /> Ten years after the film, I knew air force officers who had taught my Rt. course at the university. They were intellectuals. They thought deeply about their work. They have a sense of humor. One of them was the first plane to drop a hydrogen bomb. I wondered if any of them died in Vietnam. I imagine they did missions there. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the film failed. The film lacks visual interest, drama, expression of feelings and celebration of the very patriotism that underlies the narrative. No actress was as badly used as June Allison in this film. Susan Holland is a woman we would flee, not kiss. Colonel James Stewart (then Colonel) was able to assume the role of Dutch Lieutenant-Colonel (and later Colonel Dutch). But the most interesting thing he does in the role is to be bitten in a sandwich. I am not joking. Stewart bit into sandwiches as in The Spirit of Saint Louis. <br /> <br /> You might think of Ted Williams, but that's not the case when I look at Mr. Steward in the role. I really think of William Holden as Lieutenant Harry Brubaker in The Bridges at Toko-Ri. The comparison is not good for Mr. Stewart, who seems lost in this film. <br /> <br /> The filmed footage of a B-36 looks like commercials for an airline. Although beautiful, aerial shots are commonplace. For the moment, they might have impressed the viewers. The collision in Greenland involves a seamless modeling. You expect the result to be good. <br /> <br /> The deep nuance - the subtext - of the film expresses the boredom that air force crews must have felt the banality that the Air Force used to do its business - well as all other companies. We imagine how a director of The New Wave could explore this theme, then we begin to think about how an imaginative person could have filmed this film. Small moments are missed. When the crews return from long missions, they receive a scotch and massage before reporting on the mission. Show that it could have helped. <br /> <br /> Banality was the image of the Air Force and Mr. Mann welcomed the brass. Maybe in this sense, the movie works, but not for me. <br /> <br /> I cry when I watch the film, because I think that all of us, directors, actors, team members, spectators and members of the armed forces might have liked to give and get much more than what we get here. <br /> <br /> I do not think this movie was supposed to be from Dr. Strangelove or 2001, which is presumed, but it had potential never realized. Yet, I like to watch. I am thinking of airmen on mission and ground crews in remote areas. A certain sense of honor is celebrated here and I celebrate it. <br /> <br /> I certainly understand why people who rent this movie here and other places like it. If there were no intentional mistake, he would get a 10 from me. <br /> <br />.
