The Francoist films can be divided into 4 categories - the "beginnings" (often in black and white and inventive), the "naughties" (late 1960s / early 1970s often involving Soledad Miranda), the "nudies" (of different periods, but using frontal feminine nudity as intrigue) and "rest". <br /> <br /> It's part of the "rest". It's not really a cannibalistic movie. It's definitely not a party. The few women on the picture do not even lose their loincloth and there are few things completely frontal. The picture quality on the German DVD I watched is mediocre. The film crumbles (to the extent that it still fires). As a fan of Franco, I would tell others not to bother. Do something else with your time ... read a book .... get a copy of "Women in Cellblock 9" ... something really ...
