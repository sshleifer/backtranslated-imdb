In the last 5 years, I rented bad movies ... quite purposely. You see, I aspire to be a film critic and, as we all know, horrible films are aired every year. Anyway, about 3 months ago, I rented this one. I watched it all the way ... and cried a lot. This is one of those movies that is so scary that it makes you want to throw up. In fact, it made me feel sick. I've seen a lot of bad movies (Mystery Science Theater 3000, anyone?), But this one takes the cake. The plot was hard to follow, the lighting was horrible and the sounds almost inaudible. If there was a negative rating on the scale here, this movie would be -11 for me. It may sound strange, but I highly recommend it. It's something you have to see for yourself ... but do not say I did not warn you. I do not think this review could be more specific, so I'm done. <br /> <br />
