Since playing in Lone Wolf McQuade, actor / stuntman Kane Hodder has been busy. His film, Hatchet, got all the publicity last year, but it still produces a few movies each year. He should have skipped this one. <br /> <br /> Hodder seems to be the king of slashers. he plays Jason Voorhees on Friday, January 13, 1988 at Jason X (2001). He is working on a new movie that seems to be a Halloween remake. He is really what I would call the serial killer type with his methodical and inexpressive thirst for blood. <br /> <br /> However, there was not a lot of blood in this movie and very little action occurred in front of the camera. I felt like I was watching an episode of real law enforcement on A & E. <br /> <br /> I'm not going to blame Hodder entirely, because the rest of the actors do not have much contributed no more. Michael Berryman (The hills have their eyes riveted, The rejections of the devil) has just let go until Gein locks him up. Adrienne Frantz ("The Bold and the Beautiful") was cute. A veteran actress ("Three's Company") and Penthouse Pet, Priscilla Barnes did a credible job. I'm sure there are other horror favorites, but they all seemed to go through their roles.
