Frightmare begins with a horror movie icon killing a director and then his servant before he is buried. This icon, which has some qualities of Christopher Lee, continues to haunt those around him when a group of students from the horror film company steal his body in the mausoleum in which he finds himself. <br /> <br /> The first ten minutes are well filmed, good writing and a lot of potential for deadly chaos. But the film hangs in the middle (though, fortunately, not as much as "House of Death") and never really gets this first boost of energy. <br /> <br /> Many deaths are confusing because they seem People are just afraid of falling when they see a floating coffin or other strange things. Twice we see toxic gases used. But the box promises that this horror star will be the embodiment of all the monsters he has played. Damn it, this is fake advertising, unless he spends his career playing boring old men who nap and watch "Matlock". <br /> <br /> The general principle of the film is correct: children of the society of horror stealing a corpse dead icon. A modern equivalent (unearthing Vincent Price or Peter Cushing) would make an excellent movie. Maybe a remake is in order if it would not be too disrespectful. Sometimes the theory does not appear as well in the application, and this film offers this example. <br /> <br /> The only quality that redeems this film (except the beginning) is the brief appearance of a very young Jeffrey Combs. I saw it and I thought "it's Jeffrey Combs", but I was wrong because the box never mentioned it. But of course, Combs was present. (Note to the directors of this film: mention Combs on the cover of the DVD, you will sell more copies if you mislead customers.) If you are a fan of Jeffrey Combs, take a look at this first role. . Otherwise, I can not offer this as an excellent choice for a horror movie marathon. Let me suggest "Intruder" or "Popcorn", both of which are pretty decent and will stand the test of time.
