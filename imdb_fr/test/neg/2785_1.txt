It is an irreparably stupid trash, boring, unimaginative and lazily assembled. When you watch a direct selection of videos, you can expect the film to be a little trashy, but it goes beyond that. It's horrible at every level, with a scenario filled with clich√©s that manages to be both incredibly stupid and incredibly boring, an unnamed cast on actors and some of the worst special effects I've ever seen. Even movie slasher fans will not find anything here that would make this movie a useful one-and-a-half hour movie. <br /> <br /> The plot focuses on your usual group of young people who decide to spend the weekend on a secluded farm in West Virginia that a member of the group recently inherited. Unfortunately for the teenagers, the inherited lands once belonged to a farmer who had made sacrifices to allow his crops to grow, or something stupid in that sense, and some evil scarecrows are now there to kill everyone. I do not know anything about screenwriter Paul Moore, but I guess he's over ten, so he should be able to come up with something more original than deadly scarecrows. Honestly. <br /> <br /> The special effects that give life to scarecrows are ridiculously poor. They often look little more than Haloween costumes on sticks. Special effects such as these would have been considered rather poor twenty years ago, but by today's standards they are nothing short of embarrassing. <br /> <br /> This is a complete waste of time for all viewers, whether or not they are interested in horror movies. If you have to watch a slasher movie, rent one of the "Friday 13" or "Halloween" movies. Most of them are not very good, but are certainly superior to shit like that.
