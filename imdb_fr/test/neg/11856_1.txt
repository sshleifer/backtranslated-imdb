So bad, it's fun, especially at cocktail hour, and believe me, you'll need a beer, a glass or anything to get through this turkey. Where do they get financial support for such "horror" films at the number painting? The pleasure in this film is to predict which characters will be eaten and in what order, and to destroy the so-called "uniforms" worn by "military" jokers. The raptors, by the way, are not the same as we met at "Jurassic Park", but a kind cousin. (Sorry, no spoilers here, you'll have to watch it to find out for yourself) Do not expect the plot to make sense, no matter how simple, just keep going for the ride. You could make a game of it ... have another drink every time you hear a certain sound ... or better yet, whenever someone gets hit by a "raptor". Hopefully, you will not even remember seeing this "C-rated" movie designed for television!
