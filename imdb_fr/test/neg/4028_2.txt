All this movie is so terrible that it's a complete mess. The story is so stupid that I can not believe anyone sat down and wrote about it and thought it would make a good movie! The acting game is probably the worst of all the B-movies ever made. I have already seen a lot of sci-fi movies and some of them are actually quite good. Some of them, like De Venus, should never have been produced. <br /> <br /> Some filmmakers I think that the fact that they have accomplished something is that the fact that they are good and that they are looked at by people is because they set up something and put it on the shelves of a movie store This is not always true and certainly not the case with De Venus. This film is a waste of time for all: horrible acting, stupid plot, very weak special effects, ugliest costumes of all time, unrealistic dialogues, bad direction, etc. it's too much credit there! I urge you to stay away from this movie wreck for your own good!
