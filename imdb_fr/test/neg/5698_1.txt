I'm surprised someone is planning to spend money on a movie like this. Really. Let's forget for a moment that the plot does not even give a hint of originality ... Most of today's movies are based on stories from other movies. A "simple" lack of originality is not a big deal. <br /> <br /> But I can hardly believe that none of the guys involved in the film had ever flown before turning. Because, let's be honest, that would be the only excuse to come up with something so ridiculous. To be honest, I think a 6-year-old with a fake camera could have offered something technically much more believable. Some examples below. <br /> <br /> The scene that really drove me crazy is when the engines go out when they take control of the plane. When they need to turn them back on, the guy on the radio says something like, "OK, push buttons 1 and 2 on the dashboard." Now, these are not buttons. They should not be pushed, they should actually be pulled towards the pilot. It's something that only the addicts of the plane would know, you say? False. The next scene shows their fingers pressing the "buttons" ... And of course, the so-called "buttons" do not move at all! Not even a millimeter! (And note that I did not even mention the fact that the aircraft engines do not look like those of cars, just turn the key and the magic operates ... You must perform a complicated procedure to activate them ...) Come on guys! You could have simulated the movements at least! Not to mention the hilarious final impact, where the plane crashed against everything on the runway. It happened to me too, once ... Except that the plane was made of Lego! What about the flight attendant? In fact, she is so skilled that she knows exactly where the "1" and "2" fuses are, in the middle of the cables behind the cockpit. Should we mention, then, the guy who can drive an ambulance and fly an airplane behind the ambulance using his computer? And how did he turn on the other aircraft engines? <br /> <br /> Really, I could spend hours with this stuff. It's the most stupid movie I've ever come across, and I include trash like Alone In The Dark and other stuff in the list. Do you want to do you a favor? Do not look at him.
