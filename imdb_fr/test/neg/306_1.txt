"Fat Girls" is one of the worst films of the indie gay genre. <br /> <br /> The principle is promising: a medium-sized gay teenager is trapped in a small repressive town in TX. Her only relatives are the other unsuitable villagers: the "fat girl" of the class, a naive immigrant from Cuba and the sensitive theater teacher. So far, interesting. In theory, this plot creates a decent configuration for an attractive adult story with an integrated audience - the thousands of homosexual men who grew up in small towns across America and have experienced this anguish of teenager, dotted with dose of humor self-disparagement. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, rather than a nuanced dramatic comedy, Ash Christian approaches his autobiographical subject with a poorly executed attempt of irony and dark humor. The result is a distribution of characters in two dimensions, derisory and inimitable, that the viewer can not help but leave indifferent. Sabrina (Fink) is an observer of the almost Gothic bitter navel. She is so thorny and unfriendly. there is little doubt about the reason for his friendless state. The chemistry between her and Rodney (Christian) records zero. This may have been a bad casting, but is more likely due to a scenario that is simply unrecoverable. Therefore, one wonders when such a non-existent connection exists, which could justify their almost constant company throughout history. <br /> <br /> Sabrina's new boyfriend, Rudy (de Jesus), and Rodney Judy's mother (Theaker) is one of the most exaggerated characters in classic films wrung from dozens of other films . Rudy is the eccentric and ill-mannered immigrant / nerd, drawn directly from every steamy teenage "comedy" ever made in the field of television or film. Judy is obsessing-obsessed with Jesus - talking and having big hair. Just when you thought the Tammy Faye case had been made to death, Christian inserted a scene where Judy's mascara flows with her tears! Is there anyone in the civilized world who can think that this tired old stereotypical gag is still funny after seeing him nauseated for 20 years? <br /> <br /> In addition to unsuccessful attempts at sardonic humor, there are many mystery inconsistencies in the story. Rodney considers himself a loser "big and ugly". However, he simultaneously manages to participate in occasional and regular impromptu discussions with the ubiquitous jock / school boy, Ted (Miller). Although these bonds are devoid of emotional fulfillment, most homosexual teens (filled with unleashed testosterone, like their hetero brothers) would find this arrangement rather enviable given the more common alternative of involuntary celibacy. <br /> <br /> Rodney finds an object for his affection with Bobby (Bruening), an exotic transplant from England. Against all credible expectations, not only does the boy land in this small hamlet of TX, but he is openly gay. Like Sabrina, Bobby is an intelligent, icy and angry man, and the viewer is exhausted by the magic of his magnetic appeal. <br /> <br /> To his delight, Rodney is invited by his new crush to the city's gay bar, where Bobby claims to be the DJ. Upon his arrival, the next boyfriend quickly leaves Rodney and heads to another place in the bar for a quick meeting with a rather handsome young man. This is another of the ridiculously inexplicable plot elements since Rodney's feelings as an outcast are thought to be largely derived from his lonely existence in a parish city. As small as the city is, do they have openly gay students in high school? A football captain secretly bisexual? Lesbian moms? A gay teacher? and he has a gay bar in downtown (frequented by attractive men, no less)? Apparently, the place is not so crowded after all. <br /> <br /> Ten years ago, Todd Stephens' "Edge of Seventeen" covered much the same subject with a much more creative, honest, touching and humorous film.
