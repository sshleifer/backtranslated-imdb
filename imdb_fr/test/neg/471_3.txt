It could have been a good movie with a lot of educational potential for teachers around the world on Darwin's evolution, biology, creative work in science, research and life, but it's not. <br /> <br /> The scenario is mostly historically inaccurate and turns a true story into a Mexican soup-opera melodrama. While it is true that Darwin has gradually lost his religious beliefs, this is largely due to his discoveries during the Beagle's journey and not only to the loss of his daughter. He was certainly disturbed by his loss, but that did not make him literally crazy, delirious and detached from his friends and family. This representation of Darwin is an invention of the screenwriter. Thus, it can in no way be used to learn a little more about Darwin's life and psyche. According to most historians, Darwin had prepared the theory at the end of the Beagle trip and prevented it from becoming public because he wanted to further develop the consequences and check against more data. In the film, Darwin's imaginary conflict with his religious convictions and the mental illness he developed after his daughter's death prevented him from becoming public. <br /> <br /> The film presents a modern situation, the creationists scientists debate the debate on the life and times of Darwin, so it's anachronistic. He describes Thomas Huxley not as a man trying to develop a deeper understanding of biology but as a person eager to "kill God", in his own words of the film, and to destroy the church, which would accept the theory of evolution for these purposes and not because it was a synthesis of a lot of disconnected data. Huxley is portrayed as a very arrogant and insensitive person, a combination that I interpret as an attempt to ridicule active atheists who oppose religion. In real life, Huxley accepted Darwin's ideas only after publication, but gradually, and before Darwin's work, he thought there was not enough evidence to support evolution. His first support of evolution was published a month after the publication of the Origin of Species. He was agnostic but did not think it was necessary to "kill God", only thought that there was not enough evidence to believe in the supernatural. The creationist vs. scientific debate appears throughout the film, and key phrases such as "It's only a theory" are part of the discussion. Of course, there was no dispute or slogan at the time. In fact, the Anglican Church has published a positive critique of the Original, asserting that it sees the evolving work of God, in a way, in fact at odds with the way the clergy is portrayed in the script. <br /> <br /> Another frightful aspect of this film is that it gives public opinion a false impression that scientific research is being done by a crazy and lonely man who writes a lot. Nothing could be further from the truth. The theory of evolution is the result of extensive observations of living forms by Darwin for five years in HMS Beagle. It has been developed gradually, as can be seen from Darwin's travel notes. Although the Beagle journey was the most important part of Darwin's life up to the conception of "the origin of the species", the trip is mentioned only briefly once at the beginning, and nothing has been tried to show that the book was a complex analysis. observations. To worsen the situation, Darwin performs a single experiment (breeding pigeons) to test his theory and finally leaves it. And I'm not really sure if such an experience actually took place. <br /> <br /> Great disappointment. This is by no means a tribute to Darwin and science.
