I must say it's the worst movie I've ever seen in my life, I can not believe I lost $ 10 in the blockbuster; this film should be burned and anyone who has thought of it has problems. Who ever really spent money making this movie was crazy = D This movie has terrible actors and some scenes make no sense. Well, the whole movie does not make sense. Also the part where these "men" enter the restaurant (department of national values) which turned out to be the worst part of the film. How dare they say the name of Frank Sinatra in vain? Also, what's going on with these glasses? When the guy and the girl are in the car and she "drinks" water, you can tell she does not even drink! Also, what's up with the weird dinner guy. And everyone knows that you do not stab the tires, you cut them.
