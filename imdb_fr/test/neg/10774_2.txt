I tried to watch this movie, but I did not go past the first 15 minutes. This is a terrible disappointment for the casting, but I can not ignore the fact that the dialogue is in English and that some actors claiming to be Indian are not even close (read: Kristin Kreuk). Considering that India alone accounts for 1 / 6th of the world's population and is one of the largest film industries, I do not think it would have been difficult for filmmakers to find an excellent Indian actress to play the role. And I do not say it because of a blind patriotism, but because it is absolutely absurd for a non-Indian to play the role of an Indian / Pakistani. Now, some people say that "as long as she convinces who cares what?" But what I mean is that she is not convincing and can never be - not because of her actress skills, but because of her ethnicity. For example, although actor Tom Hanks is good, he can never play an Australian aboriginal! <br /> <br /> But this remains minor for the biggest faux pas made by the filmmakers: to have dialogue in English. This totally destroys the atmosphere, as well as any semblance of authenticity. If the same film had been made in native languages ​​(Hindi, Urdu, Punjabi) with English subtitles, it could have been an excellent film. Unfortunately, as it stands, I would not recommend anyone to see it, except for film students who want to study "What not to do" in movies.
