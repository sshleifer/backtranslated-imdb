Kazuo Komizu, who did not shoot a film worthy of the name, realized this "notorious" shock and should be ashamed that he had a success on his release in Japan. <br /> <br /> Yes, it contains scenes of rape, gore and dismemberment, but then what? It has the style of a bad American porn film badly photographed by Ed Powers ("Dirty Debutantes") and it is incredibly slow. <br /> <br /> He seems to have gained notoriety thanks to his list of anti social acts. <br /> <br /> There is a huge difference between this and the horror that is well produced. <br /> <br /> Just because someone loves their movies to be wet does not mean they will accept shit like that. On the contrary, this kind of fan (myself, for example) tolerates shit even less than the average bettor, because he has seen so much and has become too insightful. It's a shame that the production companies do not realize that. <br /> <br /> One of the critics (ZombieKilla81) said that the film's "near-obsession with gang rape" was one of the factors that had killed him. I do not agree. The subject is never the question. The question is how is this subject treated? In ENTRAILS OF A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN, he is treated so unimaginatively that he is boring. <br /> <br /> Personally, I like graphical representations of psychopathic behavior (with an intriguing context) if the material is well directed, freshly photographed and aesthetically pleasing. This horror / pink hybrid of Nikkatsu is lamentable.
