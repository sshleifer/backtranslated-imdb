I heard about this film for the first time at Chicago's "Flashback Weekend" 2007 for "Nightmare on Elm Street". Robert Englund really talked about the movie and he was awesome in his role as "Hatchet". The same can be said for Tony Todd. Knowing that this is a first director / screenwriter on a budget, he delivers just as much as the big budget and that the charged cam√©o "Holloween" (2007) remake / re-imagines. <br /> <br /> Technically, he is not up to it. some places. The alligator attack seen was a too dark shot. When that happened, the dark head of the alligator against the marsh clinging to the black pants became almost invisible. The background music in the marsh scenes was too loud and canned, like a bad sitcom. And just like "Holloween" (2007), someone is smart enough to have a gun, but of course, shooting the killer is just a pause for the killer. The end, well, as soon as I saw where it was going, I knew what was coming, not very original. <br /> <br /> The highlights of the film are the characters and their interactions. Unlike "Holloween" (2007), we had the chance to meet people and worry about what happened to them. Ben (Joel Moore, who is also the lead role of "Spiral"), the sulky chef role and Marcus ("Not another teen movie") as the best friend and funny man to look for during the movie. Shapiro (Joel Murry "Dharma and Greg"), Jenna (Joleigh Fioreavanti) and Misty (Mercedes McNab of "Buffy the vampires: the series", "Angel: the series" and "The Addams family") give a convoluted reason for topless women. Mr. and Mrs. Permatteo played by TV regulars (Richard Riehle "Grounded for Life", Patrika Darbo "Footsteps") as an older couple you know, you have no chance, even the tour guide Shawn (Parry Shen) is a well-rounded character. I hope to see more people involved in this film, but I think it will play better on home video than on the theater, sorry.
