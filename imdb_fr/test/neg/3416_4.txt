Sublime love says the title. Another introductory text of the film's promotions talked about inner and outer beauty. Well, in this case, the beauty - whether you decide from the inside or the outside - is provided by Zeenat Aman whom director Raj Kapoor called "a volcano of talent" while the film was shot. Obviously he can not be accused of sarcasm - after all, he was promoting his own movie. <br /> <br /> The paper plot is about a woman with a disfigured face who has a well-proportioned body, a great voice (thanks to Lata Mangeshkar) whose hero Shashi Kapoor falls in love. He does not want his face to be just his voice. The acting game is desperate and even the 4th is due to the music with Lata Mangeshkar giving good numbers. The rest is of course bunkum. Avoid - save your money. Inner beauty vs outdoor beauty. !!! You do not have to be an Einstein to know what the director was focusing on.
