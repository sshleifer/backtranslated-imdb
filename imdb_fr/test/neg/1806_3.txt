If you've ever heard the saying "The book is always better than the movie", Heart of Darkness is no exception. I think it was much easier for me to understand the details of the novel throughout the film because I was reading the book aloud with my English class. We discussed each paragraph in great detail, so I grasped the concept quite quickly. I could not understand the plot either by watching the movie. It may be because there were no class discussions, but I suppose it was also because I could not paint my own images in my mind of the novel's events. If you're the type of person who believes in this well-known saying, then watch the movie Heart of Darkness on your to-do list.
