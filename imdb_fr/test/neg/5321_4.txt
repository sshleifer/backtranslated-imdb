The 1977 hybrid version of Gulliver's Travels (or rather "Travel" because it only reaches Lilliput) did not have much release and it's not too hard to understand why. Michel Legrand offers catchy tunes, but they only inspire the songwriter Don Black: "A simple fact remains / No one here suffers from growth problems." Richard Harris is passionate once again for his passion for excessive makeup, muffling the basics too much for the plotter to hide the fact that he's at least 25 years old too old for the role, but at least he (maybe at wrong)) reduces his larger-than-life tendencies for a performance composed mainly of condescending whispers. Belgian animation looks slightly better than French early childhood television, but Peter Hunt's movie is not as bad as it sounds. The real model sets for animated characters are from the 1939 version of Max and Dave Fleischer, but there are still some moments of Swiftian satire, although it is definitely aimed at the youngest children.
