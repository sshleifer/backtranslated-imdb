Barring a huge, ironic conspiracy, my jaw dropped when I read the positive reviews of this movie; I can not believe that this movie was even released, it's so serious. <br /> <br /> I admit it's not my kind of movie, but I tried to look at it objectively anyway, you know, it's so funny, and was always offended by his horror. <br /> <br /> The acting is atrocious, they can not watch the rushes and I guess there was one shot per scene, it's really terrible. It's the worst film I've seen in years. In fact, I would not even say it's a movie, it's a tragedy. The black gay friend that nobody really calls "gay" is just because he's so crazy? Homophobic. This is not good, in fact, it is downright inducing vomiting. Jokes die in their pathetic asses, the music is so bad that it defies belief. The person who composed the soundtrack basically chose the most heartbreaking songs they had ever heard and put them in that mess of film. Oh, my God, I can not believe that the 80s produced such garbage, I grew up through them, and I do not find anything remarkable to note here, it had to be dark to be a moviegoer . <BR/> <br /> If you even plan to watch this movie, go see a psychiatrist, he will slap you accordingly, you are sick, sick.
