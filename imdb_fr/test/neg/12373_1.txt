It's a horror movie of horror science and horror really terrible 1957. In fact, despite Ed Wood, Jr. and his dreadful movies talking a lot about him, this turkey is just as bad as the worst of Wood. Now, the acting is a bit better than Wood's epics (like PLAN 9 and BRIDE OF THE MONSTER), but the special effects have been much worse than Wood! However, the bad movie fans will be happy to hear that it's so terrible that the viewing remains excellent. Like a Wood movie, it's good to watch this shit party and have fun with your friends. <br /> <br /> The film starts with a scientist who tries to do tests in his jet. However, emerging from nowhere, a UFO passes and his report on the radio triggers a panic on the part of the Air Force. However, later, they realized that the UFO did not appear on the radio and they thought the scientist was crazy! But soon after these planes begin to disappear, they realize that there must be something to see. <br /> <br /> For now, the film is not great, but it is watchable. However, at the moment the horrible flying monster appears, you know you are watching a turkey. First, thanks to the horrible use of archival footage and lousy mock-ups, planes keep changing in midair. Some may not be bothered by this, but the fact that aircraft enthusiasts like me see an F-80 turn into an F-86 fighter F-102 drove me crazy, especially as the planes are not alike. Secondly, through a "smart" cinematography, all you really see of the monster is a fuzz ball for half of the movie! It's frustrating and you hope it will be worth the wait when you finally see it. Well, no luck !! The "monster" looks less realistic or scary than the duck on Groucho's TV show "You Bet Your Life" !! In fact, it's much less realistic than any giant Japanese monster !! In fact, Big Bird of "Sesame Street" is still a little more scary and realistic !!! It's just awful in all respects and could be the most stupid monster in movie history - about as bad (or worse) than ROBOT MONSTER monsters or outdoor teenagers !!! The bottom line is that it's an absolutely dreadful movie that healthy people will not like. Bad movie fans like me (who are a crazy band) will probably love it! All the others ... be afraid, .... be VERY scared !! <br /> <br /> FYI - You may notice that some clips from this movie are from other sci-fi movies !! I'm sure the Washington Monument scene crashed at EARTH VS. Flying saucers, but I also saw some other scenes that I swear are those of other movies. What a hack job!
