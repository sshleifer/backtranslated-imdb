Ladies and gentlemen, let us introduce you ?? The Toltecs! This ancient Latin American tribe, even before the Aztecs, would have had the most wicked and bloodthirsty wizards. Yet they are knocked out by two college floozies and a lawyer aged one hundred and seven years with a whip! But before you see that, however, you have to deal with over 40 minutes of pure boredom, infantile pranks and sordid sequences that contain no sleaze. In case I'm not quite clear yet: "The Dark Power" is an 80s indescribably awkward and ridiculous piece of horror shit that always manages to be fun because of its pure and rather charming stupidity factor. . The intentions of screenwriter / director Phil Smoot were obviously admirable, but he ?? as well as the rest of the cast and the team? lacked the talent and the financial means to achieve something, even half-decent. Smoot watched "The Evil Dead" and other similar demonic-themed movies carefully, and had to think he might succeed that too. The film begins with an old dying Indian in his secluded country house; barely speak his last word above a whisper ?? Toltecs. Her grandson quickly rents a house to a group of college girls, including a typical 80s aerobics girl, a pretty black girl, and a racist goat girl. Soon, they will discover why the old Indian lived exactly like a hermit since he was actually the guardian of an old Toltec graveyard. The Toltec wizards buried themselves alive, only to emerge thousands of years later and feed on the flesh of the living. And honestly, is there a better flesh to taste than bimbos? As already mentioned, the first half of "The Dark Power" is terribly lame and causes sleep. The joke pranks, the delayed dialogues and the ridiculously long sequence of Lash LaRue swaying around his whip seem to endure forever. Then, the film loses its credibility when the Toltec wizards emerge from the ground. Instead of being threatening, they look like hard rock stars drugged with foolish masks and drunken gestures. Just mention ONE bloody moment when a guy's lips are stretched all over his skull, but overall, even the carnage aspect of this movie is disappointing. The only moments worth living are totally foolish, like when a nine-year-old (named Cletus!) Goes on a ride with his uncle's truck or a naked and vulgar chick sips beer in the tub after a workout. Seriously, unless you're upset by the sight of a 1940s Western veteran swinging his whip without the slightest hesitation, I'd advise you to skip this film.
