When they announced this film for TNT, I was excited. Donald Westlake's "Traough" "Enough" was one of my favorite stories of all time. After watching her, I was not so happy. Recently, I had the chance to watch it a second time with my aunt and once again I was disappointed (she did not like that much either and she had never read the book). In this film, they managed to undermine the book's charm and turn it into a mashed mash. William H. Macy was a big part of the problem. I like it in other movies, but he played (Terry / Carey) Thorpe as a stammering and incompetent yutz. In the book, Thorpe takes a lot of valium for his nerves, but remains collected externally almost all the time, which is fun. The SPOILERS follow: They have also left out much of the story (other than a 2-second glimpse at the embassy), where Thorpe resolves not 1 but 4 homicides for the police. It's important, not just because it's funny, but because it helps to build the relationship between Fred and Thorpe. In the movie, Fred's betrayal in the end is not so serious because they do not seem so close. In the book, they become very good friends, especially on Fred's side, which makes him all the more ironic as he is the one who organizes the fall of Thorpe. Fred also suffered a little from the cast, I love Adam Arkin but he was not gay, happy to be alive, detective-like, the character traits that the book that Fred has, which makes him more obvious to him to spoil evidence and so more shocking. Patricia and Edgarson were pretty close to the book and James Cromwell was great although he does not look much like Martin Balsam. The whole annoying scene of the boat house that was fully added to the movie was much less interesting than the police discovering Edgarson's body after Thorpe sent him to Seattle and blaming the crowd for death. Kit was fine, even though it was largely rewritten, and it would have been good to see her die because she was getting a little annoying. It does not bother me that changes are made to the books to make films, I know they are necessary because of their length and their difficulties, but it would have been nice if some of the changes in this movie were more funny or smarter instead of being duller.
