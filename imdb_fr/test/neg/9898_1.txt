I wish I had read the comments on IMDb before seeing this movie. The first hour was good, even though it made me wonder why everything was centered in Chicago and why nobody reported an outside weather anomaly in the United States. Isolated acts of nature (of this magnitude) are unthinkable. But beyond the first 60 minutes, the film drags on like an endless story. The scenario is horrible. As for the actors, very bad choice. Only those hired for panic stick to their roles. But I must admit that this film has good "special effects". If you rented it on a DVD and want to watch the movie, despite the criticism, then play at the maximum speed allowed by your player!
