This film spends a lot of time preaching marijuana. However, the plot and the graphics are so crazy that it looks more like the child of the LSD poster. <br /> <br /> Intrigue: Michael's heroic struggle as he battles his drug addiction while being subjected to the humiliation of Winnie the Pooh and Papa Smurf. <br /> <br /> Yes, yes, the message is good, but it is masked by the fact that the writers were inspired by a rather obsolete idea of ​​the PSA and tried to extend it to 30 minutes. This includes a sequence of songs where it says there are a million rational ways to say "No!" like "I can not smoke marijuana, I have homework!" <br /> <br /> Writers can not decide what to do with the characters they have imported free of rights. At first we see that they all have to hide from the human characters, but after five minutes we see them all running in plain sight without anyone noticing. Soon, they begin to interact with the human cast, and the only one who is slightly disturbed by this fact is not the addicts, it's the little sister who talks to his teddy bear (Pooh, by the way.) Demon of drug floating around. Because you know, pushers do not give drugs to kids. He, too, is ambiguous - although he may symbolize Michael's dependence and so he is not supposed to be seen by other people, he then leaves and haunts little Corey to let him take drugs. So, I guess he's ... uhhh ... we move on! <br /> <br /> The whole plot eventually leads to a senseless sequence in which Michael is in what appears to be the carnival of Saturday morning souls, aka a theme park of hell where the different Cartoon characters have beaten him and ignore him and things. For example, Miss Piggy eats it in a sandwich and spits it out. If writers were not strong in writing this, I must recommend that they try to get high because they can not go wild anymore. Of course, the film ignores the fact that Michael has had highs for two years at this point, so why this triggering sequence would scare him-he surpasses me? <br /> <br /> I realize that I'm whaling all over with this film, but in fact I just saw it again because I had the trouble to find it on eBay because of its sheer infamy of to be a bad cartoon. The level of unintentional humor is brilliant. Take this scene, for example: Michael's father searches the fridge for a beer. He notices a lot and talks to his wife. The attentive mother said to her, "Do not worry, you probably just drank them last night watching football." While we are obviously supposed to learn that Michael drinks beer (in addition to pot and crack), we read further and we realize: "Hey children, there is no problem of chemical dependence as long as you are an adult. up! Scenes like this are worth the price of this movie. Oh yes, and the fact that you hear Simon the Chipmunk say "Marijuana".
