In The Ring, it was a video tape; a website was the problem at Feardotcom; the danger in Pulse came from computers; and Phone and One Missed Call, you guessed, deadly phones. In Stay Alive, the technology that causes all sorts of problems is an online game: those who play there are dead soon after. What intelligence! <br /> <br /> Directed by William Brent Bell (who?), And featuring an unimpressive twenty-three-year-old cast that you may have already seen, but you probably can not remember where and how on earth their names are, this is an extremely derivative film from the making of a movie that directly targets the horror setting of the PG-13; Experienced scary spectators will undoubtedly find Stay Alive extremely tedious, very predictable and not at all scary. <br /> <br /> The undeveloped plot follows a group of players with extremely idiotic names (October, Loomis, Phineus, Hutch and Swink!?!) who try to unravel the mystery behind the deadly game before to be victims too. They finally discover that it is the evil spirit of the legendary Countess Elizabeth Bathory that kills all those who dare to play and that their only hope of survival is to continue to play until the end. <br /> <br /> With such an idiotic story, viewers must expect a movie with a lot of things in suspense, and not an iota of logic (who created the game, how and why do not they?) never explains), with very little fear and gore, and stupid closing scene to leave the door open for "God preserve us" a sequel.
