This love story between an American journalist and a female Eurasian doctor does not contain much conflict, since it is largely Westernized (after studying in London), nor fireworks, because it behaves rather soberly. The little interest that the story manages to arouse is overthrown further by their wooden dialogues. They are supposed to be two cosmopolitan intellectuals, but speak as if the words were put in their mouths by a Hollywood hijacker who is not really one. The film also suffers from a surprising lack of realism - a completely deserted beach in the small crowded Hong Kong, invaded by a million Chinese refugees? And an American journalist probably accomplished in his forties who does not know what a hysterectomy is? Hollywood ideas. Finally "the song". After listening to it about twenty times throughout the movie, starting with the credits, he tends to lose some of his emotional impact, sorry to say so.
