SPOILER PERFECT !! well, I saw it at the Cologne Film Festival and I have to say it's ridiculous ... sorry author and writer and ... whatever, but it's the worst essay to make a good movie that I've never seen ... if you have 5000 times the chance to escape from your enemy and you do not ... it gets boring ... there are szenes in the movie that give you the impression that they are forgotten, for example a szene in front of a security camera, they ask for help and a person sees it and calls the police ... that there is a break and .... NOTHING ?? !!! ... the killer has a shot in the head and 50 seconds later, he behaves as if nothing had happened ... no, it's not a zombie movie ... and finally the final. .. the big end that we were promised ... hmmmm, say a little guy who always wanted to give the world one of the best end of history so bad that everything goes wrong ... I'm not going vote "1" because the actress is beautiful ...;)
