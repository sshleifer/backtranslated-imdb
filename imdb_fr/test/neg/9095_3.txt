He is a candidate for the worst films I have ever seen. He wanted to be as shocking as "Silence of the Lambs", but has neither the style nor the spirit of the above. The makeup is excellent, the acting is pretty good, but the story seems to drag on and the murders are so horrible that they are more disturbing than entertaining.
