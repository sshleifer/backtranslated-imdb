Do not watch this movie, go see something else ... I was very disappointed, I can not rate it better than 3. The acting was pretty good and I really liked William Dafoe as a villain , but I do not see why this movie is on the big screen. The story was old and has been shown in more than 100 other movies and over 1000 TV series / movies. The main problem was essentially: nothing happens. Make a kidnapping, let the villain have the money delivered to the kidnapped man's wife, give the police a stupid and boring look and extend it to 95 minutes, you get your movie "Clearing". The only two reasons why I did not write this to 1 were a) Dafoe and b) the "plan-B-ending". There are not many purposes you can give to a movie about kidnappers ... 75% of them end in A, 20% in B and 1% end in something unpredictable. Boring, boring, boring.
