A thinly veiled attempt to push Hulkamania to the film becoming a non-fan of struggle. What could be worse than Hogan in the movies? Bad actors in the wrestling ring, and this film produced both, while Tiny Lester went to WWE this summer under the sign of all promotional gaffes. See the dictionary under Oops. As a member of the stupid children of the world who paid to see this in theaters, I immediately checked with H.A. - Hulkamaniacs boring. I'm proud to say that I've been out of the Hulk for 17 years and have never wanted to smoke since. Since it's been done to bring more fans into the WWE at Hogans, we have to wonder if there were not more fans like me who have turned to past tenses that do not did not poison the mind like this offense to celluloid made, like gas or Russian roulette.
