Low-budget tank top on bloodthirsty cultists in Greece led by Peter Cushing. It's up to priest Donald Pleasance to stop them. Crown International released this shit in 1978, and it was one of the episodes of Sneak Previews with Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert. I forget which of the two persevered, but I see the goal. The crappy movie has the worst performances of Peter Cushing and Donald Pleasance I've ever seen. There is a monster on the video box. Such a beast does not exist in the film. Instead, you get a statue, but at least its atonomically correct. (Woo hoo!) <br /> <br /> Cultists are like Klu Klux Klowns ... if a band could exist. Jump.
