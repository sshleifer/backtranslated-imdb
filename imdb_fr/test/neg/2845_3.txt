Low rental version of Ashley Judd's Double Jeopardy. Sutherland is too professional to be mean, but what did Brigit Fonda think?!? The curse of Penelope Ann Miller continues (think about it: when was she ever in a good movie other than other people's money?) And I'm not saying that she's bad, but all her movies fail in a certain way).
