What a meli-melo without interest. It could have been something more but no imagination seems to have penetrated the script or direction. A man is accused of murder by his wife and lover. The conspirators do a pretty thorough job of making him look guilty. But the man (Richard Thomas), whose psychiatric history reveals him "stable" and "unimaginative", manages to escape the prison, goes to the pavilion of the conspirator and secretly records a conversation in which they reveal their guilt. Then he accidentally drops the tape recorder with all the evidence in the seawater but manages to recover it. He shows a lot of creativity and improvised skill for a guy without imagination, if you ask me. <br /> <br /> The cassette is now a damaged one, but it is enough to break the lover of the woman and he sobs in his confession. The wrong people are punished. The good people are saved. <br /> <br /> The outdoor shot is impressive. The house on the beach is nothing but a wooden exterior thrown on the grounds of Fort Fisher Battlefield on the Cape Fear Peninsula. The house was demolished immediately after the end of production. <br /> <br /> It's a beautiful place. Unfortunately, it's a bit difficult to see because someone seems to have filmed each scene through a pair of pantyhose stretched over the lens of the camera. It's very vague. And despite all the natural splendor of the place, the viewer never gets a real sense of the place, the feeling of sand, the texture of the gray bark on stunted evergreen trees. <br /> <br /> but the interpreters do not have much to work on. As is often the case, Dick Olsen has the best performance as a shady but not unfriendly defense lawyer. Virginia Madsen radiates infidelity with each beat of her eyelashes. Ted McGinley is at his fingertips as an immoral faint. <br /> <br /> The musical score perfectly combines the sinister with the mysterious and is effective. If you want to listen to the original, shred Hitchcock's "Vertigo" and listen to Bernard Hermann's shattering theme. <br /> <br /> I do not see any particular reason to capture him, except total boredom.
