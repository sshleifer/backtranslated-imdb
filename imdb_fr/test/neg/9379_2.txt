I'll be honest and say that I gave up looking at it somewhere halfway, and then I move on quickly with a few pauses. so I came back here and read a lot of reviews already made .... <br /> <br /> maybe just me, and I can not help it, but this comic to the North American company American seems to have a purpose of "save them from themselves" and Iraq immediately comes to mind. it seems to me that this is a justification, or part of it, for another invasion with "good intentions". <br /> <br /> the lady seems to me a person who takes pleasure in herself and I was really bored in front of her portrait trying to raise pity and "feel" for her. well in this case it could never happen because, just as a history teacher has already mentioned here, I NEED to know why his family was so rich above the average, managed to keep it (played- they on both sides perhaps?) in Paris !? now, if it had been done after the biography of a poor girl, I saw myself having certain emotions. but in the current state of things + the moment of its release, it is only a pure propaganda film; Worse, since his caricature, he superimposes too much the "soft" side of things for his good, in order to be taken seriously. <br /> <br /> In addition, there are clich√©s about gays. Well, a woman struggling to earn her rights should not have at least some compassion for the underdogs of society, just like her ??? the message is obviously indulgent on the part of a member of the ruling class. <br /> <br /> I only give him 2 stars because his production and related items. a propaganda film obviously has an interest in convincing-manipulating my thoughts and is therefore generally well done by appealing to certain visual emotions that I can not deny I might as well have.
