Why is this film not on the last 100? Raptor is without a doubt the worst film I've seen in my fifteen years of life. I have never witnessed a disaster as catastrophic as this one. Absolutely, everything is awkward and cheap. <br /> <br /> Nobody in the cast gives a somewhat decent performance. The dialogue is totally incoherent and the humor is anything but humorous. Corbin Bernsen was the most painful part of everything. I can not help cringe when I remember some of his lines, like, "Inside or outside, you're worse than a cat!" and "Your friend is not a very good poker player, she just revealed her hand." <br /> <br /> The raptors are a joke. Even me, I could create more realistic dinosaur effects than those that these filmmakers have done shamelessly. It's an insult to velociraptors, or all dinosaurs. Not only that, but the scenes of killing are too horrible, even for me. I do not seriously think that these animals would rip their victim and throw it on the ground just so that everything is more beautiful. In addition, blood and guts are useless when you can see the dead for miles and miles away. <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of Jurassic Park movies and dinosaurs. Maybe the filmmakers did not expect anyone with a hint of intelligence or wit to put aside a bad director to stumble on this movie on HBO late at night, as I thought. If I could tell anyone who's involved in this film, I'd have to quote Dr. Alan Grant from the first Jurassic Park ... <br /> <br /> "Just try to show a little bit of respect."
