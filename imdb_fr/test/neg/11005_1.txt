I entered this movie with an open mind. I had been too lazy to go to the video store to pick a movie, and my friend came back with that. I promised not to laugh at his choice, but in the first five minutes I told him I had to keep my promise. We kept looking, just hoping it would be better, but no; mental rape continued to occur. <br /> <br /> This "movie" was probably one of the worst of its kind, and certainly deserves a place on the IMDb Bottom 100. I really do not know how it went. distributed. The lighting was weak. I saw better play in plays in primary school. There is really nothing positive to say about it.
