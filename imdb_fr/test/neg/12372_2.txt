This terrible film is fun on many levels - the most obvious is the fake-looking bird puppet that floats around cheap trays without ever flapping its wings (as if it were on a string?) cars. "Science" is asinine - a masonic atomic gun ?? And what's going on with the huge amounts of Brylcream in everyone's hair? I guess the 50's was the decade of Slimeball! Well, this bird puppet apparently comes from an "anti-matter universe abandoned by God" and she is here to build a nest and lay in New York. Seriously. It's almost a shame that they manage to kill the puppet. I give him 1 shoe on 4 - it's stupid and stupid, but more fun than Armageddon. : = 8)
