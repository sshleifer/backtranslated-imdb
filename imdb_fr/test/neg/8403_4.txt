A disturbing film, culminating in an intimate meeting between a naked man and his young son, but in its confused structure, it contains a poetically imagined visual exploration of the innocence of an idealized amnesic. <br /> <br /> The plot follows two axes, the weakest being the progressive revelation of the state of Graham / Pablo. Wounded through this, however, is a beautiful description of his condition and his sinuous path to a partial awakening, driven by his affair with Irene. <br /> <br /> The case is the strong thread, while the details of the intrigues are carried by a collection of characters apparently hooked: the best friend of Graham, who can reveal the cause of his condition in one resounding flashback, his manipulative leader and his comic book, a mad psychologist: all have an interest in keeping him lost. and dependent. <br /> <br /> The failure of the film lies in the conflict between the two sons. One is visual, sinuous and sublime, while the other is structured as an inept thriller, revealing dialogue and unresolved patterns of symbolism. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, I enjoyed Novo. He continues to flirt with the abyss of the taboo and faint in something beautiful, as in the career, with the double bassist and the two women, when a montage for a scene of cheap pornography becomes a segment of peace and healing. I still do not have the tooth, though. <br /> <br /> Weird, clumsy and a failure of the narrative, but with almost redemptive beauty.
