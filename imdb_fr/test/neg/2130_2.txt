This low-priced exploitation film is a really tasteless affair, courtesy of Lamberto Bava, land manager for spaghetti, who aptly left his name on this junk. <br /> <br /> The essence of this output concerns the discovery of mutilated people brutally stranded on the shores of the Caribbean. The authorities initially convinced them to be victims of shark attacks, but as the investigation proceeded, it turns out to be something much more sinister. <br /> <br /> All this is ultimately very little, but here we have a poor dubbing. complimented by a similar similar scenario, which often consists of absurd jabber, and is really unimportant for the most part. Acting can only be described as a lower than normal value, which is normal for the price in this case. A really lax leadership does not help things either. <br /> <br /> The special effect mainly concerns many close-ups of various painful bodies, missing limbs, etc. Of course, there is the obligatory creature that emerges periodically at mealtime, which looks like a big monster octopus thing, where its animation consists only of its pointed teeth ascending and descending in a rhythmic articulation. Overall, the end result is not very convincing, certainly, but it is true that it is almost entertaining in a ridiculous way. <br /> <br /> It seems that filmmakers wanted a kind of hybrid at low rent. Jaws and Piranha, but the final product is just a bloody clutter, much like the corpses shown endlessly in this picture. It is difficult for me to think of a redeeming attribute that justifies seeing this, so also strictly reserved for the incurable unconditional monster cinema.
