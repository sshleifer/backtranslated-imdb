Right on Colmyster. I totally share your feelings and add them. I mostly came on my PC to post a comment on this horrible (less) Bgrade movie. I was going to say that, nowadays, I can not understand how anyone could possibly make such a lamentable film - but you beat me. If you're reading this and commenting on Colmyster, trust me, do not waste your time and money. It's an absolute shock. The acting is totally pathetic, the scenario is much worse and the special effects are a joke. Surely no one has really invested money to make this movie? I really can not think of anything else to say about this so-called sci-fi sci-fi product, but I have to complete this comment to make 10 lines of comments to get it accepted.
