This film is a shame. How can you take one of the greatest sci-fi stories of all time and turn it into a kind of half-ass love story. The complete beginning of the film was not in the history of H.G. Wells and did not need to be. Also the Eloi were done completely badly. They built houses or formed any kind of real society. They did not care about each other. It was an important part of the story. The way they had formed a world without difficulties or complex emotions. They were barely aware of the Morlocks. I do not know why this film was designed as is, but some stories must be told as they are or left alone.
