I saw The Greek Tycoon when it came out in 1978. I found it extremely boring. I thought it was no better than a travelogue, except for one thing: for the first time in my life, I understood why it would be good to be rich. Seeing the landscape on Aristotle Onassis's yacht and getting my first glimpse into the lifestyle of the rich and famous has opened my eyes. To paraphrase Martha Stewart: It was a good thing. It's funny, I do not remember the sex scene. I had not seen the movie since it was on the big screen and I found the fucking session with the mistress memorable this time. Maybe because I was younger and single at the time, it did not matter.
