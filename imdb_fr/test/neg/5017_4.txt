Bobcat Goldthwait is to be congratulated for trying to do something different with this surprisingly sincere film, a cautionary tale about the pitfalls of absolute honesty. Melinda Hamilton plays Amy, a girl who has had oral sex with a dog in the past with a lark. She has trouble telling her fiance, John. Of course, the truth raises its ugly and ugly head. The film deals with the fallout of this escapade. The film is well played by everyone, except maybe Jack Plotnick in the role of Dougie, who has never really felt as if he had crushed the photo. And the film, although solid enough, seems to miss its mark a few times. Each person in the film is struggling with massive hypocrisy and a little hard to understand. You have to congratulate Bobcat for doing something different, as I said before, but it's not always different to be good and it's still not so good that it's not the first movie of Goldthwaits, the criminal misunderstanding "Shakes the Clown" <br /> <br /> My note: C-
