I was very excited when I saw this film in competition at the Montreal Film Festival. With Elephant and a few others, I thought that the issue of gun violence and gun culture in the United States would be treated in an intelligent and compelling way for moviegoers. The press release promised (in a few words) a "red fiddle" for the crowd of violent gunmen, which would make us think about our state of mind of shooting in the northern RNA in this country. <br /> <br /> After waiting 9:15 to sit for a projection at 9:00 (what technical difficulties they would have met me), we were finally allowed to see the film in DV (where is the draw announced 35MM?). I think I just answered my first question. <br /> <br /> The result is an abominable mess. We get the "gun", in a vignette with the most unrealistic "biker" I've ever seen (and I know several). The film then falls into an irrelevant "character development" only because the characters are one. stereotyped, b. losers, c. stereotyped losers, and / or d. racial cartoons. It takes another 30 minutes to arrive at the conspiracy movement, and once we are there, we wish the insane conversations between couples and / or bikers and pawnbrokers. <br /> <br /> The film finds its conclusion, but not without leaving an untested clich√©. I mocked the white trash characters who came into contact with the rifle, and the depiction of The Minority Characters should immediately accuse NAACP. All of these people SHOULD run after a gun because they are at the bottom of the company's garbage pile and would look for an opportunity wherever they are found. would have at least provided some introspection on the part of the characters. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem is the broken promise. The plot was great. In the hands of a P.T. Anderson or Gus Van Zandt, it could have been a powerful piece. But because of a bad scenario, a bad direction, or both, it is a total disorder that must be ignored at all costs. <br /> <br /> My biggest question is who at the MFF thought it was competition material. Better to bury it at Showtime at 3am. <br /> <br /> Art Blose
