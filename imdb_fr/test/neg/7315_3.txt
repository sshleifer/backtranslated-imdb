University professor Justin Thorne (Jimmy Smits) prepared everything. A beautiful, sophisticated teacher, with a loving wife and two adorable kids. He plays the saxophone, has an expensive car and his students love and respect him. But when the temptation calls Jennifer Carter (Naomi Watts), one of her bright and sexy students, sexy and willing, he gives in stupidly. The next day, he is accused of rape and his perfect life could be ruined forever. <br /> <br /> When we see an American actor in an Australian film, we know we did not go for a masterpiece. But even with low expectations, "Gross Misconduct" is a huge flop. Based on a rather unimaginative title, then adapted into a reasonably pleasing book, he fails to engage, convince or even interest his audience at a fundamental level. The script is awkward and unconvincing; the acting is, for the most part, not much better. Watts gives an acceptable performance by demonstrating for the first time on the screen its raw emotion, but it is the only good thing about the movie, which almost does not seem to look forward to it. <br /> <br /> The management is by no means horrible or distracting, but it is painfully mediocre. Apart from Naomi Watts, who has already been mentioned, we could forgive him, since it was early in his career, the acting is wood and continues to deteriorate over the course of the film. The very reliable Jimmy Smits does not seem to have tried in this one, and who could really blame him? However, all these small failures only add to the fatal flaw of the movie, namely that the focus is entirely in the wrong place. Any empathy for the characters or any interest in the outcome is lost in a sea of ​​what is basically an adult-type soft-core entertainment. In the end, the audience will probably be bored, tired and wish they had done something else with their 90 minutes. Unless you just want to see Naomi get naked 4 or 5 times, you could certainly afford to miss this movie.
