This film is a cyborg in itself: original film half absurd / half-life. <br /> <br /> As a cyborg, this movie has only one purpose: to make you wish you had the entire movie. in a dark room hitting the testicles. <br /> <br /> Unlike many people, I did not rent this movie because of Angelina Jolie (I'll explain why I rented it soon). I am not a big fan of Mrs. Jolie, although I would say that her performance was excellent! Her empty gaze and her robot game really made me think she was an android prostitute. If someone has an excerpt from her in Inside the Actor's Studio explaining how she prepared for this role, please send it to her. I will make sure to use it when I try James Lipton for crimes against integrity. <br /> <br /> So what drove me to rent this movie? You might think it was the hope of seeing Angelina Jolie's nipples, but that was not the case. No, the reason for this rental was based solely on one of the images on the DVD cover. that of Jack Palance's face! HALF OF HIS FACE WAS ROBOTIC! When I saw this, I imagined legions of "Palances" parading slowly through an incandescent desert, devastating all humans crazy enough to resist. In my mind, every member of this impious army of Palances had a bright red eye. a bright red eye that looked at humans and saw only "meat". They must have been the architects of Forgetting ... a cold, hard Apocalypse ... a nightmare that mankind would never wake up from. It is a beautiful image that I will cherish until the end of my years. <br /> <br /> Like most things in my life, the film itself did not live up to my expectations. No, there was only one Jack Palance, and the only visible cybernetic enhancements he had were on his legs. Unfortunately, these improvements have "really" improved nothing. That is, if you expect to WALK LIKE A POLIO VICTIM as a super power. At least their scene was one in which Jack - smiling as a patient with Alzheimer's disease who is excited about the trigger - managed to pull hell out of some people. I waited for him to shout, "I'm sick of paying too much for prescription drugs!" Unfortunately, geriatric tantrums were rare. <br /> <br /> The film had in abundance an undeveloped love story about a man (Elias Koteas, aka De Niro of the poor) and a cyborg (Angelina Jolie, aka John Voigt's Demon Spawn). Oh man, can the love between a Romeo of flesh and a Silicon Juliet last?!?!?! If you follow the simple advice of Jack Palance, you will do it: "You have to taste the time for each other". <br /> <br /> Yeah, I'm not sure what that means. However, I'm sure I do not want Jack Palance to be the one to explain it to me. I really do not want him to show me! As an experiment, I suggest you ask your loved one if he / she "thinks that we have reached a level in our relationship where we can begin to taste each other's time?"
