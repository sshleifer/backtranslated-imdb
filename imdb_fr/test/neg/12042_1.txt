I thought this movie could be a good parody, or at least a good independent comedy like Friday. Instead, it was something that someone in high school would do with their parents' camcorder. It's not just the low budget that makes this movie bad (many big movies have been made on a small budget), it's just a bad movie and it was not even serious enough to be a good one. Example: during the first ten minutes of the film, nothing happens except that the 3 main characters sit in their room, smoke drugs, put on makeup and answer a phone call. You always wait for something to move a story, but it never comes. The sound was so bad that I had to turn on the TV completely to make it almost understand what they were saying (which was not interesting anyway). If I pay to rent a movie, I will usually suffer even if it's bad, but it was all I could do to sit for 20 minutes. It seems that the person in front of me felt the same, because she did not rewind the tape and stopped at about the same place as me. The only reason I gave this score to 1 is that the rating system does not have negative numbers.
