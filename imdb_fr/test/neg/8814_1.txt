I am a big fan of horror movies, especially sub-genres of the 1980s. Name one ?? I probably saw him. Last year, a new little horror movie that seemed to slide under the usual radar called "Saw" was about to hit theaters. I was moderately excited. Having heard nothing about it, I thought that it seemed quite promising if we judge by the previews and the posters (well, except the backs and the whites with the hands and the feet cut ... those who looked horrible!) I saw the movie at the opening night. It was one of the worst experiences of my life. This movie was literally painful to watch mentally and psychically. Because it was scary? ... NO! Because it was one of the most dreadful movies I had ever had the displeasure to see! First of all, the construction of the screenplay and the editing were completely atrocious, even with respect to the standards of the horror film. Begin a sequence in an interrogation room with a victim (Shawnee Smith) who recently survived the attack of a serial killer, then show a step back from what she survived? NOT scary! It was impossible to feel any tension knowing that the aforementioned victim was perfectly fine. Of course, this spilled bear trap was terrifying ... but WHY should I feel a little scared when CLEARLY, you just showed me that she survived the ordeal? Unfortunately, the whole movie was built that way. It starts with two guys in a cellar. Then they show flashbacks about how they were removed ... NOT SCARY! Why? Because we already know what will happen to them, considering how we just saw the result of the attack. THEY ARE FINE! Go to the story! Even more unfortunately, the story was at best meager. I could not have worried less about those boring and pitiful excuses for "characters" and the acting did not help. Cary Elwes was strong for the most part, then suddenly towards the end, he began to cry like a lost baby while trying to keep his American accent with tact (it did not work - the audience with whom I I saw this was stinging). This led to a rash and silly decision that even the simplest of mind would not try. He had other options. The best. THE MOST INTELLIGENT. Even considering his intense emotional state (horribly communicated by horrible acts), it was still irrational. I did not buy it. Bad writing! Moreover, even when certain sequences were played continuously and without flashback, they were painfully predictable. I constantly found my foot tapping impatiently until the end of the silent sequence. It happened for the whole film. I saw every "twist" coming. Twenty minutes after the beginning of the film, I had already called the murderer's identity, not to mention his links with his "accomplice (s)" as quickly as they appeared on the screen. Better play might have eclipsed this awful scenario. Instead, the actors would have just as easily been tattooed "RED-HERRING" or "ACCOMPLICE" on their front. <br /> <br /> At the end of the film, I was completely outraged at having lost a single fragment of my life in this film, and all the theater laughed hysterically in front of this horrible finale. Seriously, you might think they were watching a Monty Python movie. I would have laughed too, if I had not been so upset by the total and absolute failure of the film as to the accomplishment of what it had been decided to do. When we left, there was (no joke) a line to talk to the director of the theater to get his money back (this was not the case). I was absolutely convinced that the film would be a box office bomb. The next week, you could not imagine how shocked I was to learn that "Saw" had hit the number one box office and that EVERYONE was talking about it (mostly people who thought "Napoleon Dynamite" was an epic tale and stimulant thought "satire" was a kind of rubber). I'm so sick of hearing people praise this film that I often feel like I'm throwing up. It is an entertainment for the weakest and the simplest of minds of the human race. Those who discover a strange puppet Jigsaw clown riding on a tricycle menacing (it's a doll, spill it and leave it, what makes you so scared?). <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, I own every "Fridays 13", I love my splashed movies, I thought "Napoleon Dynamite" was hilarious, I can not get tired of Freddy, Michael , Pinhead or Leatherface, I have a police appreciation for unknown horror gems and rank "Sleepaway Camp II: Unfortunate Campers" among my top 10 favorite slashers. However, I realize that these films are not the most sophisticated films that American cinema can offer. I appreciate them for what they are ?? fast and easy fun. "Saw" is a cinematographic waste. The film tries to be a frivolous and semi-sophisticated frivolous merry-go-round, resulting in annoying and annoying waste of time, money, energy and celluloid. Atrocious in every respect. Every copy must be cremated, as well as his weak-minded fans. Shame on you all. <br /> <br /> Will I see "Saw II"? Maybe after taking a double-tap of Liquid Drano before tearing my eyes out and printing impure, white shish-kabob skewers in my ears and colon. My rating: 0/10. Avoid at all costs.
