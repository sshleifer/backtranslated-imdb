OK, please, believe me when I say it's a scary science fiction movie. His film is so badly done that much of the film is presented as an involuntary surrealism and an absolute waste of time. Horrible, but in a way as profoundly non-funny. I looked at this as a duplicate with "Recon 2020: The Caprini Massacre" and although "Battlespace" was an incredibly superior movie, it does not say much. The plot of "Battlespace" is so complicated that it's impossible to follow. The narration is cryptic, often absurd, seemingly endless and exhausting. Half of the film is literally a duplication of scenes from the female lead, which resembles Brian Bosworth, walking in the desert. The film actually starts pretty cool, but then falls into sanding and continues to deteriorate, minute after minute. Absolutely horrible and really an Absurdist endurance test. Zero stars. --- | --- Comments by Flak Magnet
