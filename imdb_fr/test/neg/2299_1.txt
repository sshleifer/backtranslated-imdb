When my mother came down to the video store to rent a movie for the night, my sister and I learned a lesson, always accompany my mother to the video store! In fact, the only reason she chose this choice was because Colin Firth was there and she * coughed * thinks he's a good actor! <br /> <br /> It starts with some magnificent views of Africa, then continues. AND DOWN, AND DOWN. After this film, I was very surprised that Colin Firth was so far removed from this useless project that could annihilate any acting career. <br /> <br /> The story tells the story of a divorced woman whose son tries to make her look like a man named Matthew Fields he met while he impressed his friends because from his big house. <br /> <br /> Nimi's divorce does not like Matthew at all and goes out with the local vicar who does not like his son John. ... and the same with him! <br /> <br /> I'm sorry if you do not agree with me and I hope I did not offend you, but to all who have not seen this movie, I leave you with a word of warning, DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM !!!!!
