I will not talk much about this film because there is not much to say because there is not much to tell. The only good thing about this movie is that our favorite characters from "Atlantis: The Lost Empire" are back. Many of the drawbacks of this film are that it has horrible characters, a dreadful comedy, a horrible animation, and James Arnold Taylor trying to copy the wonderful, unique and unique Michael J. Fox under the name of Milo James Thatch. The reasons for my criticisms are that all the characters are transformed into something that they have never been and should never be, an animation that has been demoted to a minimum, and finally, why someone who would have done wonderful voiceover would he work for Obi -Wan Kenobi in "Clone Wars" wants to copy Michael J. Fox? I have an answer to that. Because it's the same person who thought he had to copy Eddie Murphy from Mulan to Mulan II. Yes, unfortunately, it's true. <br /> <br />.
