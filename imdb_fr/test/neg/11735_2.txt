Okay, so Gus Van Sant wanted to redo Psycho in color in order to integrate him with the modern public, who would probably go into cardiac arrest if he was forced to see a black and white movie, forgetting that "" Clerks "and" Schindler's List "were shot in black and white and are excellent films. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the same people with narrow ideas who would not want to see a good movie just because it is in black and white Whites are the same who would not want "Psycho" anyway, because there is no murder or sex scene every two minutes and the murders are not the bloody murders / guts / blood / blood / bones that people are used to after seeing "Halloween", "Friday 13" and "Nightmare on Elm Street", so the "Psycho" redesign almost exactly as it is it was originally destined to fail because it only concerns fans of origina 1. Everyone is watching the video to update them until the next "Scream" sequel, and for that reason, they will be disappointed. "Psycho" is based on suspense and mystery, not on blood and guts. (And so that no one thinks I must be an elderly citizen if I like older movies, let me make it clear by saying that I'm 21 years old.) <br /> <br /> So if making the film in color was all that Van Sant wanted to change, why not just colorize the film and put it on sale? I mean, what's the point of re-making a movie if you do not want to change anything *? The least he could have done was to give his own director the tone he wanted, rather than simply copying Hitchcock's - or better still, using a new author to adapt a new script from the original book. "Psycho". But it seems that Van Sant could not decide if he wanted to redo "Psycho" * exactly * or not. It should have been an all-or-nothing project - redoing the film exactly or doing it differently - but in the current state, this movie is about 95% identical, but with some minor tweaks that do not seem to have any reason to 'be. . It's like Norman masturbating while spying on Marion undressing. It does not serve the plot at all, and the only reason he included it is that he * could *. He meant: "Hitch could not show people masturbating in 1960 so I'll do it." Whoopee, big deal, as if I was so shocked to see someone masturbating. And what was the point of showing images of a single image of clouds and farm animals merged into murder scenes? And then, he leaves * outside * an important scene, where Lila and Sam meet the sheriff outside the church. <br /> <br /> Moreover, using the same almost exact scenario, the whole film seems a bit anachronistic. The opening credits indicate 1998. So, what about Marion's 60-year-old dress or the umbrella she wears? Why should Marion and Sam have their appointments in a hotel room, when no one would be shocked by what they do? Why are there no air conditioners in Marion's office? Why does not the Bates Motel have a TV in the rooms and apparently no automatic lock on the doors? Why should the sheriff ask the operator to connect him to the Bates Motel? That's why using exactly the same script is a mistake - just change a few words here and there was not enough money to modernize it. <br /> <br /> While Vince Vaughn was performing well as Norman, he just did not look good for the role. Part of what made the original "Psycho" so frightening is that Norman had that innocent, boy-like quality, so no one could believe he was capable of such horrible crimes. With Vince Vaughn playing the role, is anyone really surprised that Norman is a psychopathic killer? <br /> <br /> That said, I can understand that Gus Van Sant was obviously a fan of the original "Psycho" movie and wanted this to be a tribute. This is not a bad movie, but the problem is that it may be the only exposure of some people to "Psycho". I really think you should only see this movie if you have seen the original. Since I'm a fan of everything related to "Psycho", I bought a used copy of the remake, which I can watch occasionally. The original movie was a filet mignon, while the remake is a hamburger. But even the filet mignon would get boring if you had it every day, so it's nice to eat a hamburger every once in a while, to change.
