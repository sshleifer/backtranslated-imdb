When my friend and I went to see this movie, we did not know what to expect, but she assured me that he had good reviews. So I went with her. We went to the cinema and bought tickets and went on screen. After sitting for a while waiting for the movie to start, no one else has gone through the door. I was very suspicious because there are usually at least two more people in a movie screening. The film finally started and we sat there. After a moment of very little dialogue and bad moods, I began to understand why we were the only people present. It was disjointed with random cuts of the main story to children in a skate park, the story itself made no sense. The kid was supposed to have committed a crime while he did not do it and if he did, writing a letter to no one is not an answer and you should not feel guilty just because you wrote this letter, it should have been punished. This film did not make sense. I do not know why we did not get our money back partly in the movie. I tried to give him a chance I guess. There was little concept in this film, and the performance was shameful. The writer, the director and just about everyone who made this film should have realized what they were doing and stopping. It's another hour that I will never come back. I'm sorry for all who liked this movie, but ... it's so horrible, I mean really, really bad. Oh well, at least I do not have to suffer anymore.
