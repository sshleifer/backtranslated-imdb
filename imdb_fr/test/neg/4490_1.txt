The film begins in the spring of 2001. A soldier named John Tyree (Channing Tatum) falls in love with a student, Savannah Cutis (Amanda Seyfried) during a break. In the space of two weeks, they fall head over heels in love (!). But he has to go to war and she has to go to university. They only keep in touch by writing to each other. Then September 11th arrives. He wants to re-register - she wants him to stay home. What will they do? <br /> <br /> Romantic drama hysterically bad. The slopes are attractive - Tatum is certainly a handsome man with beautiful green eyes and a warm body (he was introduced to the water without his torso after the surf) ... but he can not act. Seyfried is a beautiful woman and she tries ... but the dialogue here is horrible. When I saw him, one of my friends and I fought hard to NOT laugh at the "romantic" dialogue from the beginning. It was just horrible. During the first hour or so, I was bored by the drama ridiculously predictable or amused by the horrible "novel". Then, after that first hour, the tragedy began and, I must admit, made me cry. However, filmmakers do everything possible to make you cry death, burials and meetings with people who cry. How can you not cry? It would have worked if the acting was better. Tatum's face never changes expression - not once! He always had a blank look on his face. Seyfried was a little better but not a lot. To make matters worse, Tatum and Seyfried had no sexual chemistry on screen! They hardly seemed to love each other, let alone love each other. There were some beautiful pictures of the Carolinas but it is a boring and stupid romantic "drama". A 1 all the way ... and I usually like silly romantic dramas like this!
