While watching "End of Days", I felt that filmmakers might be trying to make this unique to the average Hollywood action film. They failed, of course, but you must give them credit for trying. Peter Hyams actually tried to stage this time instead of shooting another action movie. He tried to inject an atmosphere into the film by darkening the lights and adding tons of blood. This method can work if used correctly (see "Se7en"), but here it sounds like a cheap trick to scare us. Hyams is a decent action director and offers nothing more than shootouts and basic combat scenes, with the exception of the terrifying f / x end "battle". As a photographer, Hyams demonstrates his current abilities by displaying a good work of framing and movement, but it's nothing more than a solid job. <br /> <br /> Writer Andrew Marlowe is the movie's biggest enemy. At times, the script actually shows the ingredients of a good religious thriller and sometimes even an almost intellectual thought (the scene of the Temptation between Arnold and Gabriel Byrne), but these little extras are smothered by a river of negatives. Generic dialogs / characters, parcel holes and convenient plot points that direct all characters in the right direction are just some of the standard Hollywood black holes in which Marlowe. The shadow of the good movie could have disappeared very quickly. <br /> <br /> The film has a surprisingly good distribution. Arnold, who still has this larger-than-life attitude, tries to play a depressed cop, at the limit, with no more than the average. Stand to be the invincible hero Arnie, that's what you're good at. Gabriel Byrne is the strong point of the whole, bringing a beautiful air of cynicism to the role of Satan. In a naughty role ripe to exaggerate, Byrne restricts himself and adds a little more threat to the character. Kevin Pollak, as usual, is able to bring at least some laughs to the film, but he did better. Also look for a small stellar role of Rod Steiger. <br /> <br /> Hyams seemed to want to separate this film from the faceless mass of Hollywood action films. He was heading in the right direction, but he had neither the script nor the originality to follow him. <br /> <br /> 4/10
