It took longer to write this review than to watch this movie. It's just bad. The plot is terrible compared to TV shows. It's flat, not funny and boring. <br /> <br /> It is clear that the LoG was running out of ideas long before this film was lit in green. Spectators should read this as an example for not knowing when to stop. <br /> <br /> Bad editing, bad music, bad game actions. Zero dynamism, zilch chemistry. <br /> <br /> A movie that does not know what it is, realized without any love for a mysterious ending that leaves you depressed and you feel a little upset to have lost so much money. The LoG obviously received an offer she could not refuse, or maybe her ego simply won out. It's a dark marketing campaign that may have been better when the LoG was cooler and more inspired. <br /> <br /> However, I knew when to stop, and I knew it. <br /> <br /> Please! Someone tries to convince me of the finesse of this film!
