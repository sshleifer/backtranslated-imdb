Is not it depressing to see how Cartoon Network's most violent cartoon is for girls? Although I do not watch the soldiers being shot and blown up to save Private Ryan or Band of Brothers, it would be nice if there was a cartoon or at least something I could watch to satisfy my desires violent. And something I would not laugh at for watching. I saw some episodes (I should really be filmed for that) and I had to go through the movie (now, where can I find a gun?), And it's clear that it has lost its spark after the first episodes . If you like to see monsters capable of destroying huge cities in seconds and being slaughtered by toddlers about a foot, this is a must. But after a while, it becomes very boring, and with a show like this, even the original ideas become mostly boring. The movie looked like a single episode (I do not remember anything), and the villain should have been much more intimidating than a green monkey. This show is a laughing stock. It produces the same basic episode, episode after episode, and although it can sometimes have mystery and intrigue, the end will always be the same: "Powerpuff girls save the day!" Everything is good and nice, but everything is very repetitive ... I give it 3 out of 10 as CN's only outstanding cartoon to revolve around violence, although it's for girls, so I'm not going to not be listening. in forever. I established myself as a fan of movies about war and violence and I will not lose this reputation ...
