Disclaimer: During my adventures in foreign cinema, I became interested in a wide variety of films that cover different genres, including horror, action, drama, comedy and romance, to name a few only a few. So, I appreciated the serious and serious tone of the dramas, as well as the fun blindness of popcorn action movies. With a wide range of Chinese, Japanese and Korean films to my credit, I am confident in my ability to recognize the bright spots in the movies to enjoy and complement them. Unfortunately, Ashes of Time has nothing to recognize. It's one of the worst Chinese movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> For starters, this powerful epic of swordplay features the infamous action sequence "slideshow", which is nothing more than an ultra-economical and pathetic movie. action form choreography. It suffices to show a series of close-ups of grimacing faces, swords, legs and / or arms, then a corpse. Bravissimo! You now have an action sequence for Ashes of Time. The problem lies not only in its poor quality, but also in the fact that the scenes are so chaotic and so disjointed that the viewer has no idea what is going on. <br /> <br /> The dramatic element of this film is non-existent, as it relies on the fact that the characters tell the viewer that they like or dislike someone instead of developing and showing such elements to the screen, which makes all the characters generic and colorless, leaving the viewer completely indifferent to their actions. In fact, the scenario itself is an absolute disaster, introducing far too many characters, far too quickly, and far too many plot features. The intricacies of the plot in the movies can be used very favorably (eg, A tale of two sisters), but Ashes of Time becomes an exploitation trash when it does nothing more than complicate a very intriguing plot. simple for no apparent reason. <br /> <br /> In fact, all this film acts as a series of smoke screens to hide its deficiencies. The horrific action choreography is covered with "slideshows" and chaotic camera movements. The development of the non-existent character is covered by characters who openly say what they feel. And a story without thought is hidden by the confusion that reigns in the viewer and convolution. <br /> <br /> As if that was not enough, this movie was extremely boring, looking more like 150 minutes than 95 minutes. <Br /> <br /> Rating = Rarely given 0/5 stars.
