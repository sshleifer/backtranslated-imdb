I would prefer that someone cut my eyes with a razor blade rather than watching this movie again. I watched it from start to finish thinking that it could not be worse ... BUT IT IS DONE. Authors and producers should be slapped for putting this kind of shit on television. The actors are all terrible. Get out of Hollywood, you are fools and go work at McDonalds by sweeping the floors and emptying garbage. Anyone who thinks this movie is even decent should be suspended. They are an embarrassment for humanity. To think that soldiers are putting their lives at risk for anyone who will produce this kind of insane trash. It makes me feel uncomfortable to say that I am an American.
