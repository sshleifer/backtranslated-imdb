When this program airs for the first time, I will admit to being intrigued by the premise and the framework. With an open mind, I watched the first two episodes and I naturally said it was meant to run at most half a season. I was watching A / E recently and I saw an advertisement for this trash and I could barely contain my surprise. I really hope people watch this for fun and do not take it seriously. The characters are really one of the most ridiculous and laughable characters on television, whether scripted or not. It is obvious that it generates ratings, so I have to give credit to the creators for creating and maintaining a fan base, but I seriously hope that no one will monitor it under a serious pretext.
