Maybe the target audience for this Disney Channel TV movie will be delighted, but if parents are watching with the kids, they'll see clearly that "bent" is written throughout the production. Of course, no one dreamed of making this film, but it was concocted somewhere in a conference room, then produced with cold efficiency. There is talent among the actors, but actors like Dabney Coleman and Jay Thomas do not really have the opportunity to show their talent. Elisabeth Harnois, an incredibly cute girl, plays like a first girl, but Will Friedle still plays a role in another idiot character, although he is not as stupid and annoying as in his role of "Boy Meets World". The scenery of this film is Washington, DC and the White House, but there is not really a "presidential" sensation in the film and the secret services are supposed to be a little better than the Keystone Kops when it comes to making their duty. Disney Channel presents many original TV movies and most of them are better than that.
