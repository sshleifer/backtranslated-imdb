This film is a final 5. I finally got him on HBO the other night. I remember the theatrical release telling a friend that it would never be a success, because the Americans did not want history films, especially movies that were more ideas than action. I do not know if this is why FMLB did not work well, but now, having finally seen it, I can add some personal observations. <br /> <br /> First of all, while Dwight Schultz was very good in Star Trek and The A-Team, as a leader in this movie, he's off-putting. I was still expecting him to shout like Jon Lovitz: "I'm ACT-ING!" His phrasing and the tone of his voice sounded like he was trying to be an ACT-OR, on a stage where he had to strangely emphasize very different words and phrases. <br /> <br /> Secondly, I appreciated the devious positioning of Paul Newman's character as a manipulator who, every turn, strives to gather these cats (scientists) to achieve his goal. <br /> <br /> Third, there has been discussion of the moral implications of the creation of the A-bomb and whether the United States should use it. Probably not enough, or as deep as necessary. <br /> <br /> Finally, there seemed to be a lot of twists producing a dramatic effect. I do not know to what extent the events of this film are true to reality, but things like the bomb test slipping in its chains or a laboratory accident is caused by a cup of coffee spilled (and a scientist killed as a result) were: to extend the limits of credibility. Maybe these things, or similar events, really happened, but it seems that different scenes were added only for a dramatic effect, which undermined the tone and purpose of the film. <br /> <br /> The FMLB was OK. I need to know more about actual events to find out if it was excessive or just right.
