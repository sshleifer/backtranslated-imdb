In fact it was awful. The main chick who was topless was obviously sleeping with the director at that time. He was shot in a warehouse probably owned by family or friends. In addition, they chose not to bother to tell a story. Of course, these are ways to reduce costs, but are they smart ways to reduce costs? No they are not. At the very least, they could have found a college student in a course of "creative writing". These children may have at least had a lesson on the structure of the story. At the very least, they could have read about the structure of the 3 laws, but obviously acting was not a priority either. Seeing these jerks running with fun clothes that were stupid by 1980s standards was an embarrassment. The fact that none of these actors committed suicide by humiliation probably reflects the limited diffusion of this film. If the actors had actually seen the end result of their hard work, there would have been a line of people waiting to jump off the Brooklyn Bridge. <br /> <br /> I would give this movie 10/10 stars but only deserve 1 to be released at all. This film should be shown to all students. It's better than 90% of student movies I've seen and wow, it's a shiiiit movie.
