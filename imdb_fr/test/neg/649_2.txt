If you like bad movies, it's a real treat. Kaufman & Peters stumble in robot costumes, escape slavery to wander aimlessly and rediscover the true love of robots. I think it was the first film that made me think of going out. I should note that I was 12 years old and that I could be entertained by shiny objects.
