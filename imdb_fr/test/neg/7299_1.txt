My roommate and I stupidly bought the video of "The Roller Blade Seven" in our local second-hand video store hoping to find a bad movie to laugh about. This film is not even laughable, it is pathetically poor, even worse than Jack Frost 2 - and it says something. The scenario, the acting, the production, the waterfalls, the sound, the sets, everything is absolutely terrible. In some areas, the actors did not even learn their aftershocks and are downright foolish or, in one case, read and rehearsed. Located in the post-apocalyptic "Wheels Zone", the film is obviously about 45 minutes of film, many of which are badly mounted or repeated ad nauseum from different camera angles to lengthen the film. It becomes tedious very quickly. The plot does not make sense (it's apparently an amalgam of two books written by Scott Shaw), there are not even seven, most of them are not on the blades, they wear Roller boots, and it seems like I think that most of the time, the film was sold because it contains about 3 minutes of semi-nude female. Writer and star Scott Shaw visibly imagines himself as a samurai and throughout the film performs very bad stunts and invents sword fighting moves that have a massively amateurish air. Despite everything, his website says the film should never be compared to a traditional film because it really pushes the limits of modern filmmaking. My roommate and I were speechless in front of this whole ordeal and, despite my frequent attempts to burn the videotape, she decided it could be a kind of video curse of Ring-Esquire to be transmitted. . If you see the video in the stores, take it to me! Leave yourself alone!
