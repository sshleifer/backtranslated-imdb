Ladies and gentlemen .. Be sad (or be happy!) .. We are in the T.V Series-ERA disgusting forensic laboratory !! Now, count with me and anathema our luck: <br /> <br /> "CSI: Crime Scene Investigation", "CSI: Miami", "CSI: NY", "NCIS", "Crossing Jordan", "VINCI'S INVESTIGATION" ", EVEN" The mysteries of Cosby "! .. Did not we already have enough ?! <br /> <br /> Since the late 1990s until the late 2000s, we have almost the same sick series on the brilliant criminologist a partner (or a team) who will solve crimes by examining the autopsy ... and what a nauseating mission to do.Therefore, you will surely have many repulsive scenes where we will see clearly, precisely and terribly the most horrific shots in the history of TV <br /> <br /> OH GOD .. Once upon a time the big days, the good policeman (or detective) of the ERA, like Columbo, Kojak , Magnum and Simon & Simon, or the good old sci-fi man, like The Six Million Dollar Man, The Bionic Woman, Knight Rider, and oh, we also have the sexy kind: Look, The Love Boat, Malibu Alert, and even a flop like Thunder in Paradise. <br /> <br /> All these events were unforgettable, original, good. Real good thoughts, action, women .. until the X FILES arrive .. And it was then the beginning of the misfortune or to be exact: the disaster! <br /> <br /> X Files was undoubtedly one of the biggest, but there were some slight disadvantages, we had Agent Dana Scully (doctor and FBI agent) at every episode an autopsy .., and of course his knees (when the series was successful) became part of our living room, so the money-hungry producers loved him with all the physical terror + the hunt for the thrilling truth .. They so have tried to repeat it in another ranking not too far away: The Forensic! <br /> <br /> But it's become so ugly, full of deformation, and very cruddy like BONES. In addition to the sexy gift of Emily Deschanel, and bleeding as David Boreanaz (he was much better in angel), and all these corpses .. To the point that every time I looked at him, I found screaming AAAAHHHHHH !! How awful! !! .. <br /> <br /> Cancel it please .. You have already canceled very good shows such as (The Lone Gunmen) or (A Man Called Hawk). Here is a bad .. So please .. Little Mercy and enough with the Bones-ERA !!! .. or we will drop ourselves from nausea and monotony !!
