A heart-rending baby, T-Rex, is on the run in a small town in the west, prompting Sheriff Eric Roberts and Animal Control Officer Melissa Brasselle (who describes her role very selflessly) to get to the bottom of things. They discover that a mad scientist (Corbin Bernsen), unbeknownst to government sponsorship, is pursuing a long-abandoned American research project called Operation Jurassic Storm (ha!) By creating an army of dinosaurs in an isolated underground laboratory. Soon, our heroes find themselves trapped inside, the marines are called, the current goes out and the dinos are free to prepare a quick lunch for all those on whom they can use their claws and their jaws. <br /> <br /> Despite an often infuriating scenario, full of holes in the plot, inconsistencies of characters and loose ends, this direct video copy of JURASSIC PARK and CARNOSAUR is a trash digestible enough, thanks to good production values, fair pass effects, occasional laughter and lots of action. <br /> <br /> Someone pointed out that an opening scene of this film was stolen from CARNOSAUR, but whoever used to watch productions of Roger Corman knows that it allows the directors of freely reuse excerpts from his first films to save time and money. . <br /> <br /> Score: 3 out of 10
