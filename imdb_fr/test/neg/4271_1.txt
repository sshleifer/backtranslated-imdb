total shit. <br /> <br /> I was a little excited to see this because it's the only movie I've seen from Mansfield Park. I suffered during the first four episodes, but when it came to the scene of the proposal between Henry and Fanny, I cracked and had to turn it off. Anyone who employs this lady of Sylvestra Le Touzel must be both blind and deaf, because this woman is the worst actress I have ever seen in my life. Everything is just bad, bad, bad. I do not know. I just do not know why the writers of Jane Austen's scripts seem unable to give her the respect she deserves.
