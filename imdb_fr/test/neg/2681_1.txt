Taste is a subjective thing. Two people can watch the same movie, one of them loving and the other hating it. As for "Halloween: the curse of Michael Myers", I enter this last category. <br /> <br /> I think John Carpenter made one of the best horror films of the decade in 1978, which, despite its flaws, still stands up well in the 21st century. He reused many old horror movie devices, but used them in an original and effective way. He did not pretend that it was anything other than a movie about an escaped patient who was tracking babysitters on Halloween night. And yet, there were "ideas" in the film but they were introduced in a subtle way and not hammered into your skull. He juxtaposed the myths of the macabre festival with the reality of what was happening in history and did it with a wonderful ambiguity. <br /> <br /> The "filmmakers" of this "film" probably would not even understand the previous paragraph. That's why we ended up with this miserable and inefficient disposable celluloid piece. The direction, the scenario and the acting are among the lowest layers imaginable. This is the type of film that is so dull that a numb mind and nausea make you want to go back to the womb and die. It's also really sad to see veteran British actor Donald Pleasence squander his acting skills with this saliva puddle of a movie. He seems drained of all his energy and resigned to the idea that it is his last film. Maybe that's what killed him.
