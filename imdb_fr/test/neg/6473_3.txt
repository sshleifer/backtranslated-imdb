But I still liked to watch her, so I gave her a 3 instead of a 1. Her expressions are priceless. Some of the other cast members (for example, Michael McKean) are also running out of steam. The cat itself is a little fun. Apart from that, the film is all clich√©, resulting in a car chase much too long. (It's also at this point that the film becomes unnecessarily rude, having been very "familial" until then.)
