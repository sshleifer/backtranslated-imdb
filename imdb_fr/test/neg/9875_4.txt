When HULK was released in 2003, the DVDs of the old TV show Incredible Hulk appeared to try to capitalize on this craze. We attended a similar event the year before when Spider-Man cartoons appeared on DVD to coincide with this hero's big-screen debut. Companies are taking advantage of the financial benefits of a popular brand. <br /> <br /> The fact that this image never appeared on Wal-Mart's shelves when its star heroes were raging at the box office this summer of 2005 speaks volumes. I guess everyone involved would just prefer to forget. To be fair, THE FANTASTIC FOUR is not as bad as everyone says. Let me rephrase that. This is not as insignificant as all his negative criticisms suggest. <br /> <br /> Veteran TV actor Alex Hyde-White (no, you do not remember any of his roles) sets the example, as evidenced by the brilliant scientist Reed Richards who, along with his crew , gets weird powers after an incident of space. He still has the ability to stretch and circumvent his body to outrageous lengths. His future wife, Sue Storm (Rebecca Staab), can suddenly become invisible, while her brother, Johnny (Jay Underwood), can now ignite at will. Then there's poor Ben Grimm (Michael Bailey Smith), the lovable horn whose body turns into a jagged, orange mass of rock. <br /> <br /> At the very moment that friends get used to all this, they are called to save the world from chaos. It seems that the old colleague of Reed, Victor von Doom (Joseph Culp), is aptly named, and that nasty jeweler (Ian Trigger) does not really help the old ladies to cross the street. Our heroes can save the day? Of course they can; As in any superhero movie, the question is just how and when. <br /> <br /> What strikes you in THE FANTASTIC FOUR is how much he is amateurish in every respect. The dialogue is so lame and tired that it seems to have been written by a theater class. The acting is so frosty that it gives the mood for a third-class soap opera to Shakespeare. The special effects are surprisingly good considering the tiny budget, but there are still really annoying moments. When The Human Torch completely ignites his body, for example, the whole movie turns into a cartoon. I can just hear this production meeting. "Oh, nobody will notice, they will be too intrigued by the action!" I mean really, a cartoon? At least, give me a manikin on fire supported by a string! Previously, the scene in which the quartets find themselves on Earth after the failure of their spaceship is a pure delight for teenagers. The crew simply found a field and lit an object vaguely similar to a spacecraft. This is the only vestige of such a disaster? <br /> <br /> Of course, there was not much to work on in the script. There is a fairly consistent story here, but everything is so simplified. When Reed and Ben decide to go into space, they simply go to the Storms and ask if they want to join them. is it really so easy? Does not that kind of thing require, oh, I do not know, years of training and expertise? Not in the world of these writers, who seemed to be inspired by the underrated genius set out in FULL HOUSE's reruns. As serious as it may be, nothing can be compared to Dr. Doom's painful snapshot. He was removed from these horrible cartoons of 1960s superheroes, to the evil laughter and slammed his fist on the table to punctuate his remarks. No cartoon, let alone Fantastic Four, has ever presented a villain as obscurely monodimensional. <br /> <br /> Finally, THE FANTASTIC FOUR is saved from turkey because it is so innocent. You can tell the people involved, as unskilled and less experienced as themselves, really tried. They did not know that the end result would be so embarrassing. They felt it was their big break, that people flocked to the theaters. It's worth repeating that they had virtually no money to work (and I'm sure half of that was devoured by Thing's cool costume). All things considered, they have worked well and, given its many flaws, the finished product is quite fun for comic fans.
