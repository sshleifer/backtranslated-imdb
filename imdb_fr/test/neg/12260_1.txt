I do not understand why this movie is out. It looked like something you show your friends after borrowing your handycam for mom that she bought in 1987. I am Australian and I work for a video store in the UK. I thought that made in our store, it can not be quite bad ... boy was I wrong! <br /> <br /> If someone writes a good comment about this movie, he is lying or the maker of the movie. <br /> <br /> The picture was BAD, the sound was HORRIBLE and the acting, oh the acting, it was the worst game in the HISTORY OF THE MOVIE. <br /> <br /> I am embarrassed and offended to have used the word "Aussie" in the title because I am proud to be Australian and this film is seen in other countries and can give a false idea to people. <br /> <br /> Please, whoever reads this and has seen this movie, take the time to find other Australian films to watch because you can choose any of them and that would be better than this one. <br /> <br /> I could have made a better movie if I took a camera, filmed it, but for an hour, ate the movie, waited for it to pass through my body, then throw what came out on TV ... without wanting to offend you. <Br /> <br /> DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM !!!!!!!!!!
