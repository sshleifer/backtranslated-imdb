Sitting in a large armchair with a huge book on his lap, the one and only Bela Lugosi looks into the camera and, in a terrible vocal narrative that suggests he was making fun of Shakespeare's reading, constant groping unknown things, drawing on the limits of endless time, bring to light many surprising things; (surprising); surprising, because they seem new most are not new, the signs of the ages "(visual signal of lightening, accompanied by the sound of the thunder which continues then to resound during a surprising 86 seconds). <br /> < And so begins what is questionable the worst film ever made.This "film" defies almost any description.Says in a semi-docudramaic style with an invisible narrator explaining the plot ... as it is .. the story revolves around the vicissitudes of a man named Glen (Ed Wood, Jr.) who travels, hence the reference to Glenda The film has no real structure. it is mainly a random assortment of vignettes that may or may not relate to Glen or the motive of disguise.A long sequence includes a stranger who shakes on a couch, followed by a man who whips a woman in what we would call today S & M. <br /> <br /> Then, at times Ã©tra nges, Bela reappears, for no apparent reason. and stammers a more senseless dialogue, like: "When he is wrong because he is right, and when he is right because he is wrong, pull the string, dance on it." Huh? <br /> <br /> About twenty percent of the visual elements of the film consist of archival footage, accompanied by a VO that relates to the story motif, but not to the visual elements. So we see archive footage of: busy city streets, highway traffic, herds of buffalo and thunder, and a playground full of kids. But it's getting worse. In a film about disguise, we have 58 consecutive seconds of archive footage of a hot-steel foundry kiln, and 84 consecutive seconds of World War II battle scenes. <br /> <br /> Even the simplest items are sloppy. In one scene, we see a newspaper headline that reads: "A man dressed as a girl". Under the heading, which has been clearly glued or pasted, the article talks about ... taxes. In one of my favorite scenes, a woman offscreen launches: "Airplanes, why it's against the will of the creator", with a voice that resembles the one she just breathed helium. <br /> <br /> Except for the film Lyle Talbot, the acting is uniformly horrible. The design of the production is inexpensive and dull; (but you must like this sticky wallpaper). The editing is sloppy. Most of the background music is only suitable for 1950s-style elevators. Black-and-white cinematography has far too much contrast. And the costumes look like those of a savings store. <br /> <br /> This film is so bad that it makes "Plan 9 of outer space" look like "Citizen Kane", by comparison. I just do not know how we could make a film worse than Ed Wood's "Glen Or Glenda". But fortunately, it contains Bela Lugosi. Every time he opened his mouth and stared at the camera with his big bulging eyes, I fell to the ground laughing.
