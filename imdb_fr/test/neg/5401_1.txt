I saw this on Sci Fi and, in hindsight, I do not know how I managed to look at it until the end. It's a total trash. It's not a B movie, it's at best a "D movie". <br /> <br /> Basically, this mower looking on a horse (and sometimes not on one) will kill everything on its way somewhere in the Midwest of America. A lot of people are missing (actually murdered) and a group of incompatibles special types of soldiers are looking for them. The best part of this movie, I'll say it now, is that there are really cute girls. Now let me spoil it by telling you that everyone, except the least cute, have their heads cut off, cut in half, or hit so hard with a melee weapon that the head explodes. This is not a spoiler ... The gore in this film is exaggerated and really grotesque. It is useless, either. <br /> <br /> Here is what is good: the sets look good, the actors sometimes act well, the outfits and accessories, some of them, are correct. <br /> <br /> All you can think of is nothing. Much of the harm is in publishing. Sometimes it just goes from a quick action scene to a real silent and sleepy scene. Sometimes the characters do things that are incomprehensible, and they always separate, but not even in a way that the viewer can follow. They seem to be separating without realizing it, but they also seem to know that they are separating all the time and agree, even if they are in a very dangerous situation and there is corpses everywhere. people are dying right and left. Nothing in this film is plausible, most are incoherent and confusing, and I do not really understand how this immortal and indestructible murderer could have been arrested in the end, and frankly, I do not care. . There is too much stupid and hilarious nonsense during this film and I do not really care to list everything here. And they are all so serious throughout the ordeal when it's almost ridiculously bad ... just horrible. <br /> <br /> This film is a total waste of time. There is no excuse to watch this, unless the only channel you receive by chance is SciFi and you are strapped to a chair in front of the television. But if you're not tied, it's better to do crosswords, throw a Frisbee or even just think. You can watch many more B movies that you can watch. <br /> <br /> My high school year, my friend and I, in visual communication and in class, had a long trailer-like contract for our own movie (There was no full movie, just a really long trailer) and we filmed and edited the film with Premiere. It was a better job than this movie. That says a lot about this and I'm puzzled by the reason why Sci Fi would show such a thing when there are so many good low-rate movies they can show. <br /> <br /> The only movie that I "Raptor Island (another brilliant piece of SciFi) was much worse than this one - although it had a smoother flow and easier to follow than this movie - but it's very close and it's definitely the 2nd on my list of the worst movies I've ever seen.
