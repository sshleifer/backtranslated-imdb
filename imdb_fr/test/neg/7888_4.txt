Leon Errol superbly manages his double role of Uncle Matt Lindsay and Lord Basil Epping, but I have a hard time loving the "Mexican Spitfire" series because they are all designed to produce erroneous identities, and these are telegraphed for a long time in advance. Errol is funny like the stifling Lord Epping, but I would have preferred a lot more wit and a lot less repetition. <br /> <br />
