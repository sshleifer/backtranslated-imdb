I would not recommend this movie. Even though it is rated G and clearly intended for children, there are many swear words (including the dreaded "F" and "S" words). This kind of language does not offend me particularly, but in a children's movie? Go. <br /> <br /> There was also a lot of implicit sexual content, between one of the first teenage male characters and any well-disposed adult woman, including a prostitute! <br /> <br /> The acting was up to this kind of movie but the screenplay was very very tacky and even my four year old son noticed it was "stupid". <br /> <br /> Despite Elizabeth Shue, this movie is not worth watching if you have not seen it.
