To be honest, it's been several years since I looked at celluloid bile known as "Here on Earth", so forgive me if my memory of the film is a little rudimentary. I will confine myself to the principal points which afflict the soul of the unfortunate spectator. <br /> <br /> First scene: Chris Klein, after being kicked out of preparatory school (because he looks like a seventeen year old teenager - yes, very believable), gives what I suppose is his valedictorian speech ... to a field. Let me repeat this for you - a field. I think we are supposed to be moved by the combination of shame and eloquence that he can not express. Klein has the delivery and facial expressions of a cardboard cutout. It's a good piece of cardboard, but a little more. <br /> <br /> Second scene: after a joyful ride and teenage fire hijinks, Chris Klein and Josh Hartnett do some damage to the local dinner, which he is forced to rebuild. Of course. Because, who is better placed to help build a random idiot who crushed / burned him in the first place. Better still, let's say fools mingle randomly with Josh Hartnett's daughter, Miss Sobeski, the girl for whom he wants ... to deliver her online too? <br /> <br /> Scene 3: Chris Klein's character discusses with Leelee Sobeski and decides to name his different body parts after the east coast states. My soul is crying. Really, how can this scenario unfold? Surely you must alienate several million people if you assume that their home is the equivalent of Miss Sobeski's more feminine spaces. Secondly, naming her breasts after New York and New Jersey suggests some confusion as to whether Miss Sobeski is really disproportionate. <br /> <br /> Fourth scene: Leelee runs. She falls. That gives him ... a knee cancer. "We always knew it could come back," said his father (?). Right. Knee cancer. To stumble. I may have missed something. As I said, it's been a few years. I surely missed something. Is not it? For God's sake, please tell me that the girl did not contract knee cancer after her fall. <br /> <br /> This cry you just heard was the death of my soul.
