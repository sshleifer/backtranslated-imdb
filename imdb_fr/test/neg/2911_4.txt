The 1942 pro-American war propaganda film shows that the East Side Kids are attacking the Japanese they meet in their neighborhood when they learn they are too young to enlist. In the end, they learn that they are mistaken in their mistrust of certain people, but that they also fall on a network of spies that they then decided to bankrupt. The film is quite harmless in its fashion, although some may be offended by the way the innocent Asians really stood out during the Second World War. Overall though, it's a fairly generic effort and Leo Gorcey and Huntz Hall would both have better moments, the best of which tend to come here when they ad-liberate.
