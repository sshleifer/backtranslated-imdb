Spoiler warning !!! <br /> <br /> This is probably my least favorite favorite film of Cary Grant. I spent most of the time thinking: ignore him, leave him, etc. Is he trying to kill her? Should we assume that after the end, when he persuades her to go home with him, he will kill her after all? By checking some books, I notice that some viewers / critics have read this reading. To finish early is, after all, a more reasonable way of filming a book than to change the ending - and it's a more unreasonable end change than, for example, in Altman's The Long Goodbye. Unlike Hitchcock's previous example of killing the murderer not because a star was chosen (when Gosford Park refers to The Lodger, Ivor Novello's deadly habits are not mentioned), the end of the book is not definitively excluded. <br /> <br /> In Hitchcock's Revisited Films by Robin Wood, he writes: "As a mental" swich "from beginning to end, the meaning of each scene changes, the seeming solidity of the narrative dissolves, the illusion from the "reality" of fiction disintegrates, the film becomes a "modernist" text in which the narrative process is put forward. "I like to play games of intellectual interpretation as much as anyone, but unless the movie simply reads, it fails. This one fails. Even after considering the fatal milk glasses that recur in some Hitchcock movies. <br /> <br /> A boring galley. We are in 1941. Nothing in the film indicates that it is in the past. Beaky (Nigel Bruce) keeps his money in a Parisian bank and goes there to do financial business? Does he not know that there is a war? Indeed, were there still flights from Croydon Airport? Is he on good terms with the Nazis? How come it is never suggested that the Germans shot him like a spy or something. <br /> <br /> A curiosity. When Johnnie and Lina dine with Isobel, the mystery writer, and his brother, the pathologist, a fifth person is present. She is never explained or presented - a woman in a tuxedo. The credits say that it is Nondas Metcalf who plays Phyllis Swinghurst. Is not this an example of how lesbians were coded in 1940s movies? Should we take her for Isobel's lover? Hitchcock's (for example, Robin Wood's) books about gays / lesbians, hidden or not, do not include Phyllis Swinghurst.
