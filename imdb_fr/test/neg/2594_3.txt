Guys in the family. When the show aired for the first time, it was fresh, original and rather fun. Now, I stopped watching him. It has become one of the worst shows on television, combining jokes without laughter, rehearsals, close jokes and hope that every joke can become funny with the inclusion of the word "slut". Seth Macfarlane clearly has problems with himself, and it is obvious that he complies with the hearing of 13-year-old boys. <br /> <br /> I just do not understand if something started so funny, so different from devolving everything in this horrible mess of a "comic" show. I seriously heard about a pud-comic film. <br /> <br /> It's really sad to see the big shows fail and keep looking as if nothing had happened. Seth Macfarlane has stopped trying or believes that this show is hilarious. <br /> <br /> In all cases, God helps us. <br /> <br /> I hate this show and I'll hate it dancing an Irish template when it's finally canceled.
