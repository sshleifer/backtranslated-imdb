I mean, come on! This film had such great potential, but it's as if they had no money left to finish the script and telegraph the rest of the film about two-thirds of the end. The characters begin to announce the whole reason for the existence of this film to other characters who did not ask for information in extremely fragile premises. They also fall into stereotypical behavior because it must be what is expected in this kind of film. It's really very sad because this movie could have been a lot more. <br /> <br /> I really hoped it would be a good movie. There was good acting. Mark Hamill did an excellent job until the end of the film, as did Sally Struthers. It was fun to watch them work and succeed in their profession. Majandra Delfino has been pretty good for a while until her lines become just untenable. I felt sad for her to have to say those lines that had just filmed the credibility of the film as a whole for all thinking moviegoers. Brad Hunt does a great job. He really has a surprising range of talents judging by another one of his films I saw recently, Lucky 13. (which was a piece of shit). This guy could be a star if he could pick the right scripts and get lucky with the good director. <br /> <br /> Almost forgotten! The music was so heavy that you might think that this project was entrusted to a small film school to be noted. I call this kind of music "Teller Music" because you can just say what will follow depending on the music. Less is more sometimes. <br /> <br /> Cut half of the music in this movie, get a good movie editor, a little rewrite or two, and it would be a great movie.
