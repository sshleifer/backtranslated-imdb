I just have to say it was the third worst film I saw right after the attack on the 3 soldiers of the murderous tomato and spaceships 2. It was not just dialogues, nor the walls of paper, nor even gunshots that automatically disappeared from holes in the walls. It was the horrible game. No wonder I never saw these actors before they probably all slept with the director (s). I think I'm nice with this movie now but it's only because I'm tired of screaming at the movie (I just saw it). My advice is to buy as many DVDs of this film as possible and burn it so that no one can ever see this waste of time, money and horrible film.
