the film is a complete disaster. I do not know who writes scripts for movies like this, but I'd really like to meet one and talk to him a little bit. perhaps the writers really do not know if the situation in foreign countries is present or recent? or they do not care and write anything that seems interesting to them. <br /> <br /> a great and eternal formula with a crazy dictator + an isolated hero (an American of course) may seem like a good idea, but come on ?! we had such a tyrant in serbia (milosevic) who had done a lot of harm to people, but I just can not imagine him shouting "shoot them, shoot them" with such a barbaric passion, like the medieval era. maybe they wanted to show how bad he was, but it was a stupid idea. the best impression would be if he did it in cold blood, as the real monsters do. <br /> <br /> The list of absurdities is too long, but the funny thing is this: no matter how many national TV channels are there in Russia, the Russian president looks at the US news SNN ( CNN) ?? OMFG! <br /> <br /> give me a break! <br /> <br /> burn this piece of pleats please! <br /> <br /> AWFUL!
