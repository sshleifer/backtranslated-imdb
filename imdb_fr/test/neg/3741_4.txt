Farscape has received a lot of praise, but I do not think that's a good thing. It certainly has a distinctive appearance, but it lacks almost everything: history, purpose, direction, excitement; you call him. I'm a big fan of science fiction and I want to watch every science fiction show I can. I have almost finished the four seasons of Farscape, and for now I am not very satisfied. The series contains some good things - notably Claudia Black (which unfortunately has been missing since the first episodes of Season 4) - but they are very few and far between. Overall, the show is stained with a lot of very stupid things (such as Fantasy elements rather than SF idem), and many episodes, in particular. in season four, are unspeakably messy and very poorly structured. And we just feel that it's not going anywhere. These are mainly non-directional adventures with thin and long intrigues that develop very slowly. It's sometimes a bit tighter, but it only lasts a few episodes at a time. <br /> <br /> As for the effects, there are some impressive things here and there (especially in space, occasionally), but the series seems stuck in the same style of effects, which frankly ages quickly . Fantastic and unconvincing extraterrestrials marry the show a lot, and I have come to prefer (by far) the episodes where normal characters of human aspect are at the center of the preoccupations. <br /> <br /> I think the Keepers of Peace are by far the most elegant and intriguing and interesting figures in the series; they succeed in being a compelling foreign culture, despite their human appearance. There are some really cool episodes with them, in particular. in the first season (IIRC), where Crichton masquerades as a Peacekeeper captain, invades and eventually destroys one of their secret bases. Such episodes can reach a score of 8 out of 10, but I can not attribute to the series as a whole more than a score of "4". <br /> <br /> Aside from the Peacekeepers (who themselves are a bit too determined totalitarian and militaristic to be really nuanced), the series simply does not offer anything important or important that you need to know or want to see. OTOH, it contains some good ideas and is not a total loss. <br /> <br /> That's just my opinion, of course, but as a seasoned science fiction fan, I think it counts for something, and can be helpful to others. There are not many good science fiction shows out there; but Star Trek (all series) and especially the new Battlestar Galactica are much better than Farscape. But if you're a big fan of mediocre sci-fi series, you might also like Farscape. <br /> <br /> My rating: 4 out of 10
