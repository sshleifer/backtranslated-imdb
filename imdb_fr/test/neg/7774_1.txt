I do not know if I should be amused or insulted by stories like this one published by "Lifetime: Television For Women". a pot of tears pot. This film was no exception. You know that a movie is going to be bad when the main star is Tori Spelling, completely a creation of bad plastic surgery and a spoiled privilege without real talent. Everyone compared her in her incredibly bad game and the screenplay was more than stupid, as if anyone could believe anything. If I had not been helpless on the couch stuck watching with the same fascination that you see a bloody car wreck, I would have changed channels.
