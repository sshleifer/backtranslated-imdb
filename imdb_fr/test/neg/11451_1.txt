*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** There is not much to say about this film from the period of the first debates. (I hesitate to call "Cimarron" a "film" because I think the word is too esoteric.) But what about that ... speaks mostly against. <br /> <br /> Take for example, the overuse of the description of the Indians as bad people. In one scene, the small main character of the film - an authoritative and overly ambitious family man who wants to create a news business - just plays outside his father's office. An Indian kneels before the child. "Hello," said the boy to the Indian, in a very polite way. The Indian gives him a feather, gets up and leaves. <br /> <br /> Yancy Cravat, Jr. runs enthusiastically in the office. "Mummy mummy!" he shouts, waving the Indian's gift. "Look what an Indian gave me!" <br /> <br /> "How many times do I have to tell you!" she attacks the boy. "You must never speak to those dirty Indians again!" <br /> <br /> Yancy Yates, father (Richard Dix) appears as a man who speaks with a forked tongue. At the beginning of the story, he seems to have a definite plan to give his family a better life. But we soon discover that he is not a big winner, let alone a man who is totally moral. His slave child, Isaiah (Eugene Jackson), is a telling sign. <br /> <br /> On her family's first trip to a Sunday morning service - a <br /> to which curiously, Cravat has to give the sermon - Isaiah tries to come, dressed like Cravat, long suit tail, holster, pistol and everything. Cravat tells him to go home. "Do not you want me to come with you, church?" Isaiah said with a pout. <br /> <br /> "No!" Cravat corrects him by patting him on the shoulder. "You do not understand, I want you to stay and keep the house, and if someone comes in any way ... you kill him to kill him!" <br /> <br /> The characters - not to mention the actors - in "Cimarron", <br /> <br /> could not get out of the burlap bags, despite their obvious efforts. And nothing in the script was too commendable either. (Certainly, the incomparable Edna May Oliver - known to play the role of the red queen in Alice In Wonderland, also released in 1931 - actually manages to look great, thus succeeding in portraying her portrait of a pompous old woman, which is also best - Known for.) But other than that, well ... <br /> <br /> Yancy Yates is no longer popular in town from her first week, > and one of the outlaws decides to remove the white hat from Cravat while he and his wife (Irene Dunne) wander casually. Despite his anger at the man who shot, Cravat understands it perfectly. <br /> <br /> Not only did this story not "turn for realism", but it was very <br /> <br /> missing in several key areas: for example, the newspaper Cravat is not really seen. (Bulletins and posters, yes - but not just any newspaper.) <br /> <br /> Perhaps the strangest of all, though: this is happening in a small town of <br /> > Kansas. Yet for one reason or another, Yancy Cravat is unmoved to <br /> <br /> call her newspaper "The Wig-Wam of Oklahoma." <br /> <br /> Very good Westerns have always been very rare far from it - the only exceptions being Clint Eastwood's so-called "spaghetti westerns" from the late '60s to the early' 70s. clich√©s, on the other hand, are only tens. <br /> <br /> If you like cliche westerns, "Cimarron" will make you proud, but for me ... embarrassment. <br /> <br />
