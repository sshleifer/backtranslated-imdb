As a continuous, relentless, explosive melodrama, this film is one of the worst action movies ever produced, and it's absolutely amazing in every way. The rhythm is constantly feverish, and all the action and the actors are seized with total hysteria. It's almost unassailable, and a stain - and even a stain - on the careers of everyone involved. <br /> <br /> The enormously exaggerated excitement attempt erodes itself, resulting in a movie where you just go "Go!" all the time. The setting and the events are impossible to take even at a distance. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a good film about asteroids, see Deep Impact, an intense, sensitive and deeply captivating film. All that is Armageddon is not.
