Webs begins in "Chicago: Today" as four electricians, Dean (Richard Grieco), Ray (Richard Yearwood), Sheldon (Jeffrey Douglas) and Junior (Jason Jones) are on the verge of disconnecting electricity from a unused building about to be demolished. When looking for the relevant cables and objects, they encounter a set of doors that, according to the buildings, should not be included, being indiscreet and all that forces the doors to open to take a look and find a room full of computers and scientific machines. While they joke with a few buttons to open a portal to a parallel universe, Dean & Junior "accidentally" falls with Ray & Sheldon soon after in search of their friends. Unfortunately, they all found themselves in an exact parallel Earth, invaded by a mutant spider thing that eats people or turns them into mutant soldiers with whom she uses to protect herself and do everything she really wants. In a desperate attempt at survival, they team up with some of the last humans, including the original portal inventor, Dr. Richard Morelli (Colin Fox), who says that with the help of our electricians, he could (or could perhaps) be able to build another portal to bring them home ... <br /> <br /> Edited and directed by David Wu I thought Webs was a real shit, it's so simple and direct that it really is. The scenario of Grenville Case & Robinson Young is to say the least absurd and has holes in the plot that could lead to a tank, for example, does this movie really try to suggest that some elements of the mutant spider do not are not bigger than a couple of the size has conquered a whole world? How did they do that? If this parallel Earth was the same as ours, where the devil was the army? The police? All our weapons? Some spider objects looking fragile against billions of humans ?! The whole imperfect, stupid and downright stupid concept constantly bothered me throughout the movie. Let us not forget that there is an inter-dimensional portal to a parallel Earth in the basement of most of the buildings that have remained undisturbed for decades and remain in perfect working order. this not? Then there is the case-sized nuclear reactor, the fact that an electrician can make it work perfectly by accident, while he randomly presses a few buttons in a room probably containing hundreds of objects spread over dozens of equipment. A guy who puts an explosive bomb trap in his base without telling anyone. And if one of his friends had triggered and found himself torn to pieces by the bombshell of his companion? You would not be happier, would you? What about food? Do they grow themselves in small parcels of vegetables? I could go on all day saying how much web is flawed, poorly designed and poorly written, but I can not be bothered. The characters are clich√©s and annoying, as well as the film as a whole, which obviously does not help. The only half-decent thing I can say about Webs is that it's short and it's moving at a reasonable pace, but when all is said and done, it's still a shit. <br /> <br /> The director Wu must take a big part of the blame here, for starters, the film looks cheap and the editing that is attributed to it is terrible. There are a lot of boring and inappropriate slow motion shots that come from nowhere, the action scenes are almost identical and get very boring very quickly. He uses this very boring fast cutting technique with a bit of the old jerky motion of the camera. Now, I do not know anyone else, but I hate this style of editing because it looks like a completely incoherent mess. In fact, I do not know a single person who likes this kind of thing and I do not understand why filmmakers think that people like it. Forget all the bloody wounds, just some wounds caused by shotguns to the spider zombie soldier soldiers and they do not have red blood anyway, so that has nothing to do with reality in my mind. <br /> <br /> Webs was designed for. -TV, the American Sci-Fi channel, I think, and it looks as cheap, low-budget and in a hurry as you think. Everything is so bland, forgettable, flat and dull. The special effects are far from special and the spider lacks imagination when it is finally revealed. The acting was OK considering that everything else was so poor and I still can not believe that the sweater that Grieco wore in there. <br /> <br /> Webs is shit, I can not really say anything other than me. I've seen worse movies and that's the only reason I do not give it a star and a quick look at the IMDb user ratings for Webs confirms what I already knew as far as he has more "1" votes than any other and there is a very good reason why ...
