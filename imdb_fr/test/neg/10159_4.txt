Okay, now I know where all these boring TV series from cops / homicides come from. I think we can find them in this film. "Scene Of The Crime" is more like a TV episode or a soap opera episode. Complete with characters and stock situations - the hotshot cop that clashes with his superiors ... the aging cop who does not want a desk job, despite a failing view ... the reckless rookie ... the lady of double pass, etc. <br /> <br /> I like a lot of actors here and they do a good job, but overall, I found this film boring, because I'm not a fan of the genre. I kept listening when they were discussing the case ... something about bookmakers and informants. And oh yes, there was a stripper, played by the previously healthy Gloria DeHaven. What I want to know is: why did she keep calling Van Johnson "Uncle Wiggly"? Was not Uncle Wiggly a rabbit? A character from a children's book? What does it have to do with that? I guess I do not understand the hard tone of the Black Film, it's a bit of a jargon. <br /> <br /> In fact, many dialogues made me mumble "no one speaks like that!" However, I could relate a scene where the police officer's wife (Arlene Dahl), who worries every time he goes to work, realizes that perhaps she should not have made her husband the center of his life. Yes, I know that feeling of loving someone so much, depending on him, and constantly fearing for his safety. There are therefore moments of truth in this film, under the stylized dialogue and the atmosphere that tries so consciously to be realistic and realistic, that it seems to me unreal reality. <br /> <br /> A little background: this The film was shot when Dore Schary took over Louis B. Mayer's MGM and started to end the sound musicals that made MGM so great. Dore Schary was determined to bring more "realism" to the cinema. I hate Dore Schary a little bit. Perhaps we can blame him for all the sober and pretentious films that are filmed today that capture the ugly "truths" about life, with a focus on (and, in my opinion, helping to perpetuate) the worst humanity rather than the best. Do not elevate us as classic movies did - providing needed distraction during the Great Depression and World War II. <br /> <br /> Well, damn it, we still need that kind of distraction today! There is still a lot of depression and war. And where are people turning today when they want to escape? Trashy, the deafening reality TV brain. Thank you very much, Dore!
