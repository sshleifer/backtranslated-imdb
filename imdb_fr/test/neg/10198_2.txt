Unfortunately, I went to see this movie for entertainment purposes based on the limited information I had seen on Fandango. Since I'm a sci-fi buff, I'm interested in the idea of ​​a UFO film. <br /> <br /> Instead, this film quickly became an evangelical Christian propaganda film. Suitable for an audience of like-minded but very unchristian individuals, enjoy the movie theater scene and preach in front of an unsuspecting audience, especially considering the cost of tickets and concessions. Shame on you! At least, the Da Vinci Code did not retain its fiery madness. <br /> <br /> Thus, this category B film production (and I'm kind) will be appreciated in churches with the same convictions, probably shown to youth groups Wednesday and Sunday night. But if you are a Christian or a non-Christian, you will not be comfortable.
