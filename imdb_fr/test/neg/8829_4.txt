I like Japanese movies - having seen at least 100-200. It is obvious that I am not afraid of Japanese films. However, there are sometimes Japanese concepts for the film that simply do not fit Westerners. They may have hits at home, but abroad, they do not seem normal. It's like the live fish that my wife ate at a work meeting or PS2 games such as dating simulators or Katamari Damacy - accepted things that confuse non-Japanese people. This is probably how others view things that Americans take for granted, such as American football, Snicker bars and Paris Hilton! Well, the king of strange Japanese movies that do not seem to be right for Americans might well be ATAMA-YAMA. Now, the animation style is not the problem - it's different but pretty cool. No, it's the story concept itself and the rather bizarre end. That's what makes this movie a really unusual film and it goes like this: There was a stingy man who, for no apparent reason, had grown a tree out of his head. It was little at first and he just cut it off, but again and again he pushed back - so he just decided to give it up. And after a while, people started living on his head in the shade of the tree. Oddly, while they were under the tree, they were tiny but when they left, they were even bigger. Then, after finally getting sick and torn off the tree, the man drowned (!?) In the hole at the top of the head where the tree was! The end. <br /> <br /> See! I told you it was very, very strange - but not in a good way like TAMPOPO or KATAKURIS HAPPINESS - just strange. O-D-D .... strange! And unless you have a great tolerance for this kind of thing, I doubt that you feel bad knowing that this Oscar-nominated film did not win. Frankly, it makes me happy, because I really do not want this film to stimulate similar movies. The only reason he wins a 4 is due to a nice but not spectacular animation. <br /> <br /> This film hurt my brain ... I hope it's not a sign that I have a tree!
