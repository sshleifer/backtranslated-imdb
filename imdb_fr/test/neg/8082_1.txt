Ah, the science fiction channel. How often do you disappoint me? Quite often, I think, do you ever show good movies? OK, you gave me the big "Heroes" and the pretty good "The Lost Room", but they are series, and as for the film, there is really nothing positive to say. Bad acting, bad staging, terrible characters and superficial story, and that's just to start. I checked the director Allan A Goldstien and I was not surprised to find nothing interesting in his CV (in fact, I think half that it is a pseudo). The premises of four bikers crossing the currency in a national park when one of them has an accident that needs a forest ranger to save them before being caught in the fire of a forest are weak and predictable. it happens. Leading man Bryan Genesse, the park's ranger, is so terrible he is terrible. Incarnate as the hero martial arts hero action hero in the footsteps of so many others, this guy makes Seagal and Van Damme look like De Nero. Supporting actors are a little better and well before the end, it was hoped that the fire would engulf them all, then the film crew. Avoid at all costs
