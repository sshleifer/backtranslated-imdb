I know ... I know: it's difficult (if not paradoxical) to have a "credible" fantasy. But, for me, there is also such a condition in which TOO INVISIBILITY interferes with, or distracts from my overall opinion of the film. The latter was the case for me regarding Goliath Awaits. Not only did I have too many unanswered questions about the screenplay, but I also thought that some of the actors were a bit overwhelmed. (Perhaps, however, it was the writing: asking them to recite too much banal, predictable, clich√©d (excessive?) Reactions.) Others have spoken enough about the plot. I just wish it was done - and I think it could have been - more convincingly. P. S .: This is a FRESH comment about this movie - I just watched it a few minutes ago; not a memory of years ago.
