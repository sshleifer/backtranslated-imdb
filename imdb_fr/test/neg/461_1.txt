I am the kind of person who can enjoy a good movie B if it has a redemption value, but Dead Space has nothing to redeem! This is the kind of movie that will make you frustrated, agitated and sick to the stomach. <br /> <br /> Bad acting game. Blade story. Terrible effects. Horrible and atrocious dialogue. Dead Space has it all!
