It's the worst movie I've seen in a long time. It reminded me of a Cirque du Soleil show I saw in Vegas six years ago - without athletics. By this I mean some striking and artistic images, appearing at random, without any framework of maintenance. The tinted sepia film is really sticky. This device is almost never justified and is certainly not in Tuvalu. With my apologies to Abe Lincoln: you can trick some people from time to time.
