It's at best in the middle, when most characters are excited and pick on someone they've never had before. It is around this point that we see Susan Sarandon's majestic breasts (even though through a veil). Oddly, Beverly D'Angelo who is not afraid of nudity shows none, while Aida Turturro ?? everybody ?? Is. At the other end of the spectrum, the less we say Walken is homosexual, the better. The film itself has little plot; the dialogue of the play and the "normal" dialogues often intersect and this is not the kind of thing that I would consider a good idea. Life in the theater: we do not care Sometimes, the dialogue has results, but the film stretches slowly.
