OK, Chuck Norris has appeared in many entertaining films over the years. This is not one of them. I will not even try to intrude on the plot about a biblical expedition that went wrong. The "game" of the main characters is so much wood, Pinocchio would have done a better job! The soundtrack based on the synthesizer is even worse than that of Deathstalker. While phantasmagoric low budget movies often try to catch their audience by adding a lot of graphic violence, this one tries to catch an audience by throwing a religious mambo at the viewer. The plot comes down to different versions of the Bible.
