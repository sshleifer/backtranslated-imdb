As bad as this movie is, I really like it. Poor action, dialogue and action made things so fun. I loved Omega Cop's John Travis and I stayed awake all night to understand how the machines of death registered at the airport if they can not speak and probably had to shake their heads when answering the questions of security. In fact, why can not they talk !? It does not adhere to any kind of cinematographic convention, which makes it strangely interesting to watch. Just a lot of people get killed around a very loose plot surrounding hitmen. the cover and the trailer do not appear! I like the fact that there are no good guys in this movie until half of half and I like the many unnecessary scenes of this plane landing - a lot of people are killed who do not have nothing to do with the "plot" and no explanation is given about anything - do not expect to understand this movie. Admire rather the good old guy who can not even handle a random old man in the bar - who is portrayed as the villain but denounces the bartender's decision to hire a lightly dressed woman to dance badly in a corner for " to be entertained "- All the good guys seem to like that! Why did the old man hit our hero - and why did the random guy decide to help the old man in the fight ?! Why did the hero collapse under a fist from the old man on the bar where a jet of water gushing in the background gives the impression that it comes from his mouth?
