This is by far the most repulsive and atrocious version of The Scarlet Pimpernel ever designed. As a fan of Pimpernel, I was sincerely offended by what they did to the characters - but this atrocity is not worth seeing, even if you are not aware of the story. <br /> <br /> Percy Blakeney, for example, never stab people in the back just to go down a hallway. Chauvelin would never have a group of women in bed. Marguerite never had any business with Chauvelin, nor Armand with Minette, whoever she is. Chauvelin would not shoot Tony in the head at random. Chauvelin's name is not and has never been Paul. They completely removed any reference to Pimpernel's disguises by replacing them with James Bond-esque gadgets and gadgets. <br /> <br /> As for the film itself ... The makeup is horrible. Women look like clowns. Elizabeth McGovern's beauty mark walks randomly across her face. Poor and pitiful actors have no script to work with, so it's not their fault that their characters are as thin as wet tissue paper. The dialogue ... oh, the dialogue. The dialogue is unbearable. And whoever is responsible for all these legends at the bottom of the screen should be forced to watch this film in penance. (I counted 13 legends of place in the first half hour before giving in. As if we could not understand that the stretch of water between England and France is the Channel.) <br /> < The film - if I can bring myself to call it that, since it is actually a video tape with a filter - is absolutely worthless. Do not waste your time and brain cells on this motto rance. Instead, look at the 1982 version of Anthony Andrews / Jane Seymour, or the 1934 film Leslie Howard, or NOTHING, but this one.
