This movie is so bad that it's hilarious. I watched Hell Ride half think it was a comedy, even though I could not really know if they were actually taking the p * s, or if it was really a serious attempt to do something. suitable thing. I notice that this is not listed here as a comedy so they must be serious! It seems like a group of retirees who try their hand on motorcycles and exchange the most hilarious dialogue you can imagine. A scene inexplicably has two characters who crush bottles on top of each other, then show themselves the cards "get out of prison" they created! Also check out Vinnie Jones' accent, where is the hell supposed to be?!? Oh, and there are also a bunch of naked girls who, for some unfathomable reason, seem to want nothing more than to have no one to stop sex with these tough-skinned babes! The guy who wrote and directed it - a Pee Wee Herman look-alike with a 2000'd Greeshan beard and an orange tan - has for whatever reason decided to play the lead role, maybe it's a part of the joke, I do not know. In fact, the more I think about it, the more I'm sure this film is a head shot. It is produced by Quentin Tarantino and it is possible that he publishes it with humor as a laugh. It's a total rip-off of Tarantino's style, but I did it really badly. It's a lot of fun, and I think that anyway, it could be considered a cult classic, that is to say a fun parody of the Tarantino / Rodriguez style, or something very unintentionally funny. To see to be believed.
