If you thought Day after tomorrow was implausible, wait until you see that. <br /> <br /> Okay, the principle of most disaster movies is usually a one in a billion event, compounded by other circumstances. In this case, the same is the junction of two huge storm systems. Fair enough so far. Oh, hold, no, "the event" is the sabotage and the subsequent destruction of the power grid. <br /> <br /> Then throw tons of human interest - in this case, a deceitful husband, a psychotic pistol - brandishing his boyfriend, a rebellious girl, a hacker with a purpose to prove , a senator trying to advance a program, a journalist trying to stand up against "the man" and a pregnant woman stuck in an elevator. <br /> <br /> Finally, add a handful of initiation activities to add excitement. <br /> <br /> If the director tried to fit into a more insignificant plot, there would not have been less time for the disaster, the pitiful state of computer graphics, was almost certainly the intention. <br /> <br /> Good heavens, if you can not even model a truck convincingly, you really should not tackle tornadoes, the explosion of plants, Las Vegas being torn apart or destroying oil stations. <br /> <br /> If you do not yet understand how terrible this movie is, just let me add that all three villains are killed in a distinct way, and in totally unreal and improbable ways that stink. moralisation more than good film making. <br /> <br /> I have no problem with first-month cinema students who write jaded, disparaged, snapshot scripts, but for God's sake, that does not mean that anyone should turn them into movies! <br /> <br /> He manages to give the Apocalypse 10.0, which is absolutely implausible, a less dreadful aspect. Avoid both.
