A totally ridiculous film that makes fun of the college admission process. While it is true that the evaluation of a student's admission to university does not necessarily lead to the SAT, the film speaks of what is most ridiculous and does not deserve to be repeated. neither viewed. <br /> <br /> University admission officials look like stupid people who have an extremely close vision of the whole process. The film is an insult to hard-working, hard-working high school students who have to go through a long process until they receive this letter of acceptance or rejection from the schools for which they have applied. <br /> <br /> This film certainly deserves rejection at all levels.
