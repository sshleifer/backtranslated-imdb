It would be very easy to make this movie fun: a call girl is shot in the forehead by a North Korean spy, but survives. The bullet that is embedded in her brain makes her aspire to knowledge and sex. Unbeknownst to her, she moves away from the shooting with George W. Bush's cloned finger in her purse, a key that can unlock the power to use nuclear weapons. Call it a defeat, and at least some people will come to the theater. I do not know how many people went to see this four-year-old film when it opened in New York last April, but I sincerely hope there will not be many. It looks like a light and mischievous pinku movie, but it has art pretensions and is really boring. In the past, many pinku films have been successful in their artistic aspirations, but the aspirations of this film make the time between sex scenes unbearable. And then the sex scenes are not even good! I have seen some pretty scandalous movies in dirty Japanese movies. I have never seen this country produce anything with such a dull sex. The Spice Channel is more imaginative. The only thing that is worth in this movie is the body of the main actress, Emi Kuroda. Otherwise, it's pure torture.
