A scientific experiment to create a superhuman being went wrong. The creators are trapped in a post far from the desert, pursued relentlessly and without mercy by their own creation. James Stockton, the scientist whose research was used despite his protests to create the monster, is called the outpost to help solve the horror now prevailing somewhere in the dark corridors. James, with his son and daughter, soon find themselves trapped inside with the others, desperately trying to survive. And with the outpost sealed from the inside, there's no way out ... " The Outpost "/" Mind Ripper "is very original.The sets are quite claustrophobic and there is a little gore.However like a horror, it fails miserably at almost every level.The scenario is zero suspense, the script is weak and filled with big holes and the end is extremely predictable.So-called master Wes Craven produces this one -I wonder if he is happy with this junk.Joe Gayton directs without any style.The interpretation is horrible, only Lance H Enriksen can act at all.OK, I am a big fan of horror and I was bitterly disappointed. Avoid it like the plague, it's still the same old boring shit!
