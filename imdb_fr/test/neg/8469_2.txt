I found this film extremely interesting and yet a bit jaded. He talks about violence and what he does. I still do not see the point of becoming terrorists to stop terrorists. Similar people in the United States and other countries justify the use of violence and war tactics because they think they are right. Think of Puritans and Christian crusades against the Islamic people in medieval times. With much blood and death far exceeding today's violence, the Western world has had a negative impact on religion. I do not justify their actions, but Western culture has had in the past a very negative effect on some. But always remember that the majority of the Islamic people is peaceful! People of all nations feel a kind of patriotism, but to start a war on the fact that I am right and that your mistake needs to be rethought. Once again, I repeat that you can not stop terrorists by becoming like them.
