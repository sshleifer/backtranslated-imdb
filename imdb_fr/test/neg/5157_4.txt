The Nest is actually just another horror movie 'Nature Run Amock' that fails because of the low budget. The acting is OK, and the setting is great, but one way or another, the whole movie seemed a little boring. The gore effects are not the best I have seen, but they are fun. Cockroaches themselves are just ordinary cockroaches that sting people. The Nest reminded me of a much better movie called Slugs. If you liked The Nest, then Slugs is a must, as it is ten times better. It's also interesting to note that Lisa Langlois, who plays Elizabeth, was in another movie called 'Nature run amock' called Deadly Eyes (aka The Rats), about killer rats, as you might have guessed . <br /> <br /> If you like these types of horror movies, then you might want to give this watch, but you'd do better to see Slugs, which is even more interesting and bloody.
