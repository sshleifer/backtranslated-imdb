The key scene in Rodrigo Garcia's "Nine Lives" comes when Sissy Spacek, hiding in a hotel room where she has an affair with Aiden Quinn, discovers a documentary about nature on television. Separate footage is edited in a scene, predators and prey are projected together to capture the moment, all to force connections where none exist. The characters in the nine short films that make up this film are sometimes in stories, but none of them ever really seems to connect. A woman preparing for a violent confrontation with her violent father is then seen working in a hospital room where another woman is preparing for a mastectomy. A man who meets an old girlfriend in a supermarket and sees how his life should have been subsequent guests, with his current wife, a dinner for an unhappy couple. Garcia arranges some of his characters facing each other, but none of the following stories are really based on what existed before. <br /> <br /> Garcia's debut film, The Wondrous Neglected Movie "What You Can Say by Just Looking At Her," also had a structure of new and overlapping characters, but they were fewer in number and they had much more space to breathe and grow. The nifty principle of "Nine Lives", in which each of its nine stories is told in a single uninterrupted take in real time, never allows the film to create a real tension or dramatic dynamic. It's also a pretty visually ugly movie. Interior shots are often murky and difficult to watch, while other scenes, such as a girl walking from room to room to talk to her non-communicating parents, are embarrassed by the work of the family. camera. Since this is Garcia's third film and he has a respectable history as a director for television, this film is rather surprisingly amateurish. Like his fellow filmmaker-child of a great writer Rebecca Miller, Garcia (son of Gabriel Garcia Marquez) focuses on the writing and character aspects of his films, often to the detriment of those who turn them. <br /> <br /> The individual scenes are touching and even touching. I loved Jason Issacs kissing Robin Wright Penn's pregnant belly. And Joe Mantegna lovingly whispering to his wife who slides into preoperative sedation. And Sissy Spacek flew some happy moments away from her life with Aiden Quinn before returning with a call from her daughter. But the film (unlike "What you can say by looking at it") is more of an exercise than a real drama. We are just watching people act.
