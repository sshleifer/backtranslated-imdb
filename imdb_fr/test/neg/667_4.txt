Eight teenage convicts are taken to the abandoned Blackwell Hotel for cleaning as a community service. They quickly discover that it is the residence of an imposing psychopath (Kane) who has a weakness to get out and pick up eyeballs. It's useless for the guard watching them (Steven Vidler) to have had a clash with the beast four years ago. <br /> <br /> One of my guilty pleasures are the slasher movies. Most of them are badly directed and acted, but they still have attraction and entertainment value. See No Evil is a good example. There are atrocious scripts and roles, but the death scenes are pretty good and the film is entertaining. The premise sounds like a mix between Friday the 13th, Saw 2 and Halloween: Resurrection. I really liked the idea, but it did not work very well. It was really just a lot of clich√©s and everything was predictable. Screenwriter Dan Madigan focused on the scenes of death and nothing else apparently. The scenes of death themselves are rather good and macabre. Director Gregory Dark did a good job with them and managed to create creative feats. <br /> <br /> The actors' game is rather bland and without particularity. Indeed, all characters have a dimension and we know little about them. It was hard to feel for these people because they were quite unfriendly. Kane is surprisingly mediocre. I was expecting his presence on the screen to be more frightening, but he did not do a good job. A second choice Jason Voorhees, if you want. The rest of the actors are relatively unknown and this film will probably not help their career. <br /> <br /> Although death scenes are bloody, they are not necessarily frightening. There is really no suspense, just some bloody death scenes. For this reason, the movie does not contain much repetition value. Plus, if you do not like slasher movies, do not waste your time with this one. This will not change your opinion. In the end, See No Evil is a decent slasher movie, but generic and forgettable, so it's not interesting to watch it. Rating 6/10
