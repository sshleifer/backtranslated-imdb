This film was told to me by a friend who had seen it late at night during the week. He told me it was so bad that I had to see him! So I went to an auction site and bought the movie. It's probably the worst movie I've ever seen. It makes you laugh when it really should not. Terrible acting and terrible scenario. Plus, it looks nothing like Michael Jackson ?! <br /> <br /> I always recommend buying this movie because it's one of the funniest things you can see. Van Peebles is a joke in this movie. <br /> <br /> Robots can not bluff ... PSYCHE! <br /> <br /> I must say that the special effects are really incredible ... PSYCHE! The movies were probably even released when this movie was released, but if I had what it took, it would be a right to the output in VHS, yes, it's THAT!
