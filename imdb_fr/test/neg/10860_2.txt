Once upon a time Quentin Tarantino was a relatively successful filmmaker. <br /> <br /> From now on, unfortunately, he does not make only terrible films, he ticks his name on names like this one. <br /> <br /> Cool retro flashback on biker movies from the 60s and 70s, this opens up new depths. <br /> <br /> Believe me, I appreciate it when a blouse falls into a movie more than the next man but I felt kind of shady watching that. To use a word that I never thought I could imagine is his msysoginist (you see, I can not even spell it.) The plot (in the vaguest sense of the term) is as incomprehensible as the Vinnie Jones' accent, the fact that he's terrible does not stand up to our will is as severe as one might think. <br /> <br /> It's just terrible. Shocking. It almost made me cry. In horror.
