Sometimes, just having patients to watch the independent horror. If you can just make your way through the first slow-paced scenes, sometimes a real gem will come up ... This (unfortunately) was not the case with "Satan's Whip". <br /> <br /> Written and directed by Jason Maran, "Satan's Whip" attempts to train us into a boring snoring movie, with no real result at the end. I guess black-and-white (and blue) cinematography should have a purpose, but you can never explain why most of the blood is blue, and I found it more and more awkward movie. The story itself is not so bad, and actually had some originality and decent content, but the acting is simply pathetic. This, combined with the slow pace and the absence of a real gore (red), made "Satan's Whip" an object to forget rather quickly. I'm going to give him a score of "4" for a spiritual dialogue that made me laugh, but that unfortunately could not save that annoying waste of time.
