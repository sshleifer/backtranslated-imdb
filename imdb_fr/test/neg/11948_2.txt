There is only one word to define the whole film, it is: terrible. How "especially Martha" was redone is terrible. The title of the film is awful. The actors are awful. And the idea of ​​combining good food and the United States is awful. If you've seen "Bella Martha", then that's the original title and it means "Beautiful Martha", this one is a punch in the belly. Ms.Jones' game is so mediocre and unnatural that even Jessica Alba, considered one of the worst actresses (http://www.razzies.com/history/05nomActr.asp), would have done better. Not to mention the cook, who would play better a different role. And the little girl ... does not deserve to be mentioned. Bella Martha was a very beautiful film, an authentic one ... why was it redone? There was a story ... here they took it. There is no story ... What does it represent? In a way also this film was perfect. Do you know when all the ingredients go together? Well, that's the case here. A perfect shit ....
