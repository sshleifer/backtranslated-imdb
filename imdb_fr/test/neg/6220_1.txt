After watching this movie, I decided it was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I knew it when three teenage girls would scream and get angry when they (OMG!) Would see each other again, then look at the same thing, but only women old enough to be my mother. And it was only the first few minutes. Yeesh. So here are my comments ... <br /> <br /> 1. Mid-aged women + ridiculous dance moves complete with hip reinforcements and stunning costumes = not a good idea. <br /> <br /> 2. Pierce Brosnan could not get out of the paper bag. Similarly, virtually no one else could be in this pile of excrement. <br /> <br /> 3. The songs were so random. It was obvious to me that they were thrown, willy-nilly, into the incredibly artificial plot and STUPID. <br /> <br /> 4. My three-year-old nephew could have written a better script. <br /> <br /> I laughed or laughed mockingly during the movie. And normally, I really like musicals. Of course, they'll be a little tacky ... but that was ridiculous. What a waste of talent. I mean, you have great actors and actresses in this movie ... I'm embarrassed for them that it's now part of their career. I regret losing my money and my time on this shit.
