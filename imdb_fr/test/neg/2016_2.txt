A spaceship crossing the galaxy meets a mysterious freighter seemingly adrift in space. The crew investigates, hoping to claim his cargo and acquire the ship. However, once on board the threatening ship, their own ship mysteriously disengages, leaving them to fend for themselves and fighting only against Count Dracula or Orloff as this creature calls him. <br /> <br /> This is not a bad start. I mean he follows any number of typical sci-fi / horror plots. The genres have been sufficiently present that even the most original story inevitably invokes comparison with another film. But when you start with a fairly typical horror convention, the legend of Dracula and vampires in general, and combine it with a fairly typical sci-fi convention, a crew misses something and gets lost to face all that he is forced to face. Filmmakers must have the intelligence to print their own brand on the classics of the genre. <br /> <br /> Director Darrell Roodt, who also wrote Dracula 3000 with Ivan Milborrow, is primarily responsible for this total failure. So, no, Roodt and Milborrow have nothing in their sleeves except their arms. <br /> <br /> This film begins rather ominously, with a voice very misinterpreted by Caspar Van Dien, who basically provides enough of the crew exposures on his ship are. I should also point out that Van Dien's character is Van Helsing. And, very intelligently, this Orloff character comes from the Transylvanian planet in the Carpathian system. No kidding. I mean, come on guys, we understand. And, again, do not be clumsy and use such names unless you have something special in store. <br /> <br /> Thus, after the crew presentation by Van Helsing, we basically have a film about this crew trapped. in a spaceship with a menacing vampire. <br /> <br /> I am a very tolerant spectator when it comes to low budget movies. From time to time, they can be brilliant, see the first two films of Raimi, Evil Dead. Dracula 3000 had a decent budget, sufficient for decent special effects and for the salaries of the 3rd strings such as Van Dien, Erika Eleniak, Coolio, etc. However, unlike the films of EVIL DEAD, there is no talent behind the camera. In front of the camera, the talent is marginal, but I will give the actors an advantage of the doubt. It really looks like they do not know what to do. The best actress in the squad, Alexandra Kamp-Groenveld, is killed quickly and the always so nice Udo Kier is reduced to being an exhibition vehicle for the spectator as the late captain we hear and see via a video diary. Grant Swandby is also good as a teacher, but it's hard to take a 3000-year-old scientist who wears glasses and wheelchair users seriously. And yes, it is a chair WHEEL, because it is nothing futuristic. As for the rest of the actors, well, I'm sure Coolio really tried to be scary after being turned into a vampire, but hey, I do not think that irritating can be described as scary in the book of most people. Tiny Lister and Erika Eleniak do not provide much either. Lister is never really more than the big muscular black stereotype of the IL. Eleniak seems actually dissatisfied throughout the film and never tries very hard. Eleniak is a pretty girl, even in her thirties, but seems a little exhausted and indifferent to the duration of the film. <br /> <br /> This brings us to Count Dracula / Orloff played by Langley Kirkwood. To be honest, I do not remember who exactly is the vampire. He introduces himself as being Orloff but at one point he also recognizes himself as Count Dracula. Go understand. In any case, you will be absolutely amazed at how lame this vampire is. Have you ever photographed these horrible hosts of nerdy horror series that local networks would have on their time slot? Yes, it's so bad. Langley Kirkwood, the actor who plays Orlock, had to find that it was almost impossible to concentrate in such a ridiculous outfit. I'm sure his friends still harass him. <br /> <br /> The plot is not so complicated. The vampire is the last of its kind and wants to go to Earth, for some reason, and also, there is very little to say that wants to defeat the character of Caspar Van Dien, Van Helsing. Most of the crew are transformed into vampires, including Van Helsing, and they use conventional machine guns and pistols to try to defeat them before understanding the old stakes of the heart's routine. Yes, yes, balls, and yes, the year 3000. Keeping the course in this disconcerting vein, one of the main areas where the team is to fight vampires, or vampire, since There is never anyone who threatens them, is full of old Soviet posters and insignia and others. What are there also references to God / religion being obsolete systems. But these references only baffled me. Has the Soviet Union come back? Do Roodt and Milborrow want to comment on this? It's never really going anywhere, it seems silly and posters, etc. just look cheap. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, the film is shot and edited with skill. Cinematography is not spectacular, but it is clearly done by professionals and I had no problem with special effects. Ships look like ships in space. Although, as I write these lines, I remember how awful the captain's body is when the crew discovers it. What were they thinking? Why did not someone say anything? Do you see how difficult it is to say something positive about this film without resorting to negatives? I guess that's ultimately the thing. Whatever positive aspects you are trying to give to this sci-fi / horror debacle, you are overwhelmed by its lack of quality. <br /> <br /> Poor Udo Kier.
