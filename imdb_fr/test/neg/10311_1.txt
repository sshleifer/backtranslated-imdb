The previous comments are far too generous. This film is a waste of electricity and plastic. On the other hand, I had a lot of fun watching and describing it to friends in advance, describing it as "beyond belief!" "No words can express how I feel about this" "This movie will move you" As expected, friends took these indefinable comments as enthusiastic support. They were wrong. The sadistic pleasure I had in imposing this on people was well worth the $ 5 I paid for the film. On the other hand, a (former) friend says that I owe him 90 minutes of his life. I especially enjoyed the "gun view" of some parts of the film. Really great in his nonsense.
