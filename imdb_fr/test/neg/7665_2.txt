"Airport 4" is basically a mess for Universal Studios trying to turn a new twist - the supersonic airliner Concorde - into a "disaster in the sky" formula. <br /> <br /> unintentional humor, the best of which is when George Kennedy runs his hand through the Concorde window at a supersonic speed to fire a flare on a missile in search of heat following the trajectory of the plane , and the simple fact that these stupid passengers continue to board the same plane to continue their flight despite all the problems in the air. Many stars in this one, including Robert Wagner, Sylvia Kristel, Alain Delon and Martha Raye as a nervous passenger. <br /> <br /> Not really related to other 'Airport' movies.
