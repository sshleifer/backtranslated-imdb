I share the same opinion regarding Underworld as in the previous comment. <br /> <br /> I sat for an hour and a half of this film, wondering what this story was about and, more importantly, why the author and / or director had made some decisions. for the plot. Overall, I found the film unbalanced, consisting of strange subplots that (IMHO) actually had nothing to do with the movie. Moreover, when you write a thriller, I would say that you want your viewers to wonder about the story and not about how the story is filmed ...
