I agree with the other two comments. I waited more than a month to see this great new series that A & E exalted. What a desappointment!!! The show is pretty much everything about Ryan Buell. His voiceover is campy, not scary. It looks like he's talking in a can. From the second episode, which lasts about 30 minutes or so (if you remove the ads), he is chased or followed by something he knows to be demonic. He can not say the name, every time someone has to give that name, he writes it on a piece of paper and gives it to someone else. Not particularly informative, entertaining or credible for the rest of us. Why can not he say the name? ... supposedly, it would give more power to the demon. Funny, I always thought demons wanted to hide their real identities. If you know the exact name of the daemon, does not that make it easy for you? Now, the next episode, which will be released in a short time, is called "exorcism". So, does Ryan ever need an exorcism? Not to say that this could not happen, the series has so far given no proof or proof of anything. I can tell Ryan that if I were a small child, if I was an adult, and someone gave me a little bottle of holy water to chase something that terrified me, I would look for help elsewhere! !! Also, if you do not use holy water, blessings, etc. correctly, do you not risk further exasperating what is already angry with you? I will probably be watching tonight, but if these episodes are as ridiculous as the first, it will probably be the last time I watch it!
