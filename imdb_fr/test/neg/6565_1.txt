I realize there are fans who might like this movie. I am aware that the idea of ​​"looking for a god" may seem interesting to some. However, it's really boring. <br /> <br /> The movie is just boring. When it gets a little interesting, it becomes stupid. Come on ... Kirk is fighting God and winning? How low can we be? The only good side of the film is the camping scene in the first 5 minutes, which is really great, but after that, the movie becomes boring, irritating, with nothing more than good music. <br /> <br /> Thank god we have Star Trek VI. (Oops, Kirk beat him)
