I must say that I was disappointed by this movie. Although it is well interpreted and directed, the underlying story is simply moving too slowly. <br /> <br /> Certainly, I would have liked better, in another state of mind. I laughed a lot, but I rarely laughed hard; and there was really a sense of suspense to find out who won. But unlike another movie that my wife bought the same day (none of us had ever heard of this before), this one pales in comparison. <br /> <br /> If you see a lot of movies, you see, this - it's way better than your average fare. But if you (like me) have little time and want to watch only the best and the most entertaining, keep it for later. <br /> <br /> [Price: 7/10]
