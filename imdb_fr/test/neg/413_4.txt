Recension: Angels and Demons <br /> <br /> The film is directed by Ron Howard. He has also directed famous films like The Da Vinci Code and Cinderella Men. He also directed the famous television series 24. The most famous actors are Tom Hanks (The Da Vinci Code, The Thousand Green, Forrest Gump, ??) and Ewan McGregor (The dream of Cassandra, Moulin Rouge, Star Wars: The Ghost threat, ??). <br /> <br /> At first, I was shocked because they changed the beginning of the movie so big. Because they changed Vittoria Vettra's father (Ayelet Zurer) to someone else, Silvano Bentivoglio (Camren Argenziano). Another change is that Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) never goes to CERN. It was good that they could film on site at CERN. <br /> <br /> Then the film continues, these are spectacular car races in Rome. And I also very much like the role of the Chirstian archives when they destroy Galileo's work, it was funny. It was as funny as they were locked in the archives the second time, Robert Langdon destroyed half of the archives and, when they broke down, electricity worked ?? <br /> <br /> I found it very stupid that Robert Langdon did not get into the helicopter, but that the Camerlengo (Ewan McGregor) gets in alone, another detail is that in the film, the Camerlengo is an adopted son of the pope. In the book, he is the true son of the pope. <br /> <br /> When I should give the best acting performance, I should say Pierfrancesco Favino who plays Inspector Olivetti. The worst actor was the murderer, who was played by Nikolaj Lie Kaas. I think he was underperforming because in Adams Apples he was playing Faboulous. <br /> <br /> I think the whole movie is underperforming because director Ron Howard makes some stupid changes. I would give 4/10 to the film.
