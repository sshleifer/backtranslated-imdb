This film was recommended to me by one of my fellow directors and I was expecting something good. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed by the first half - ah, a movie about a wimp that gets revenge on their leader **, how original - and watched the second half on Fast Forward in the hope of finding something which would justify the -dod minutes that I had already lost. But all I got was the end of the "shock" ... <br /> <br /> The basic problem is that this is a film that seems unable to decide what what he means and whoever says what he says (difficult to understand). tell what it is) badly. A good acting does not save a bad scenario filled with characters I do not care. <br /> <br /> Now, maybe if I was not black in the movie industry, I'd be shocked to discover stupid politics and exploitation going behind the screen, but like this are my feelings are summarized above: "Ho hum". <br /> <br /> 2/10 ... would have been 1/10 if it did not act and cut paper scene.
