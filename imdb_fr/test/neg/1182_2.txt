I stopped watching this movie halfway through. It was just terrible! Subtracts boring and artificial. A total absence of the pathos seen in the representation of Ed Gein by Norman Bates, Buffalo Bill or Steve Railsback. A film does not have to be historically accurate, but the true story of Ed Gein is so much more interesting than this third-order melodrama completely invented without good reason! Ed Gein as described by Kane Hodder is a cartoon sadist. Attempts to show the trauma his mother has inflicted on her are only weak exercises in a recycled style. And this movie wanted to be stylish, but it even ruined everything. Fortunately, there is a better movie in this story. In 2001, Ed Gein, who told the story in an effective way, offered real shivers when we observed a sick man who did not control himself. Steve Railsback, who was playing Ed Gein at the time, was already famous for memorable depiction of another famous serial killer: Charles Manson. His Ed had pathos. His film is the one to see. Avoid this mess.
