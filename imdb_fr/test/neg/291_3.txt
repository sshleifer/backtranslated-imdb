I've heard ravers stories in the movie and it's great, but it's only 1/100 of the movie. The problem with this movie is the cheesiness. I never really understood the plot or why this guy stole girls. It makes no sense but ... why they were in a random club was curious too. Many parts of this movie have no meaning but overall, I was interested. It was confusing on many levels ... maybe I'm not independent enough for this film, but judging by the final scene B, they ran out of money, they just cut things and forgot about the conspiracy. His little budget and so seems. I like the fact that they used few special effects that were bad, but they did not use any of the quality ones. I would say that this film is the worst scenario par excellence, with a correct production. It's certainly not as random as many films I've seen, but the pieces of the puzzle simply do not make sense. In the effects, I would give an exception to the final battle when all the effects went from the 50's on my ass. Sparks of models and others. Watch it if you like an unintentional comedy from an action movie. The mysterious science theater has a candidate.
