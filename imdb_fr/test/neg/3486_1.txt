This film has the language, style and attitude ... plus the great rides of Occy (world champion) and the great Jerry Lopez. John Philbin as a turtle has pidgin surfing, and the surf scenes are always the best. A real classic that we can see many times. Nia Peeples is a girl, and Laird Hamilton shows the first things that made him the number one surfer in the world.
