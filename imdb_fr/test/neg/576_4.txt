This is a mysterious love letter that has upset the love life of 4 people. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​the film is interesting and the film could have been funny. However, this film is simply what a romantic comedy should not be. The characters are not sufficiently introduced at the beginning, so it becomes so confusing. The secondary characters come and go without adequate reason, as if they existed only for a particular scene, then disappeared in the air. The pace is terribly slow, it gives 90 minutes as if it were 180 minutes. <br /> <br /> It could have been romantic and fun, but this movie failed spectacularly.
