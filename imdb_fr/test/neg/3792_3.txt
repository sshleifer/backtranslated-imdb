It's a film with an excellent concept for a story but that has been hijacked, but a lot of subplots clich√©s, descriptions and performances portrayed and unrealistic, and some really improbable points to move the story to its inexorable completion). <br /> <br /> The absence of anything that indicates the really gay thread, other than a few casual references to the Crow Bar or the fact that he is gay, was disturbing. It would not have hurt to show him something, even if it was just meeting a friend for a drink. <br /> <br /> It is worth checking and deserving its price. Only a few years after the release of the film, there is not much to do, unlike movies that feature both a gay or cheerful plot, and that also concerns African Americans. For that, it's worth checking out. I would not look for it too much and I would not waste my time looking for it. This is a rental, not a rental premium at that.
