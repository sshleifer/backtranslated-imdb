Worth the entertainment value of a rental, especially if you like action movies. This shows the usual car chases, fights with Van Damme's great typing style, rifle firing with the 40-shell shooter, and even terrorist bombs. All of this is entertaining and competently managed, but nothing really hurts you if you've ever seen your hand. <br /> <br /> The plot is made interesting by the inclusion of a rabbit, clever but barely deep. Many characters are strongly stereotyped - angry veterans, terrified illegal aliens, crooked cops, indifferent federals, slutty leader, twisted politician, the big federal who seems to have been cataloged as the Mexican in one. Hollywood movie of the 1940s. All pretty much acted but still nothing special. <br /> <br /> I thought the main bad guys were pretty well done and played pretty well. At the end of the movie, you certainly knew who were the good guys and the ones who were not. There was an emotional uplift as the worst received their just desert. Very simplistic, but you did not expect Hamlet, right? The only thing that really displeased me was the repeated cuts to the VD girl during the last fight scene. <br /> <br /> Not bad. Not good. Fair 4.
