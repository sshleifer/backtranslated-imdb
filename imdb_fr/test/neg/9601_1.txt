Anyone who thinks Kool Moe Dee, Carol Alt and Corey Feldman is a good list of actors has to smoke something I would like to try one day. Where to begin: ugly soundtrack, role play, "action" in places. It is the typical hack fodder that has been written and written with passion and that has been thrown on love. I felt embarrassed for the "stars" of this "film". Gary Coleman was the only one who lost his mind. Which, if it had been in the movie, would have made it at least a little too screaming, rather than just bad. <br /> <br /> There was some in the film where Carol Alt shouted, "Do you think I'm an idiot?!?" Yes, Carol, I want it, your agent does it, and please, for the sake of all that is decent and holy ... Go away and stop degrading like that! This film is something Anna Nicole Smith would be involved in. <br /> <br /> I would tell you the plot, but that would be one more sentence fragment for this article, plus my mind drifted several times during the movie anyway, so I barely paid attention .
