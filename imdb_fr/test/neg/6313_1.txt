This film easily falls into the category of laughable, if not beyond insulting. I mean in what alternative universe did the filmmakers and studios think this movie would be played? From beginning to end, we bombarded with Quaids with ridiculous and ridiculous facial expressions, lying on the "im a loose cannon" acting a bit thick. Another point that worried me about the movie was the lack of realistic stories that would make you grow to connect to a character. I mean, in a scene where Lewis plays in a bar before he grows up, there's a completely absurd fight in which every citizen of the city apparently belongs. Then Lewis begins playing his rendition of "Many Tremors" and everyone immediately forgets his differences and begins to dance as if nothing had happened, as if it was the most normal thing in the world. This kind of scenes, which are numerous, associated with the lack of depth of one of the characters, led me to laugh. So, overall, this movie is not worth watching by those who do not want to make fun of a filmmaker and the decisions of his actors for an hour and a half.
