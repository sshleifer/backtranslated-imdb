Amanda Bynes is an extremely talented actress and I really enjoyed all her roles in the past, especially in the fantastic film "She's the Man". For this reason alone, "Sydney White" was a huge disappointment to me. The real reason for my dislike of this movie is the misuse of the characters. In a fun comedy for teenagers, it's great to have a cast of teenage characters based on reality. In "Sydney White", this idea is rejected by the window. <br /> <br /> Amanda Bynes makes a beautiful Sydney, but she really misses a lot of what makes her usually glittering as an actress. I blame him on the screenplay, which makes his character too bland and limited, and the hair / makeup department, which gives it a detestable plastic look and an annoying hairstyle. The seven "dorks" with which Sydney befriends are much worse. They are so void that it is impossible to love them or even to respect them as characters. These are essentially repellent gag feed. As it is the story of "Prince Charming", who is a completely incredible character and who is almost as nerdy as possible. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the biggest star of the film (with the possible exception of Amanda Bynes) is Sara Paxton, who is really very good as a connivance Rachel Witchburn. It's a shame that the writers did not make it a little grayer than black. <br /> <br /> The plot is essentially that of "Snow White". What kills is that it is a reshuffle too obvious and too obvious. The links with "Snow White" are so present in the film that they are finally boring and exaggerated. Prince Charming is irresistibly charming, the "witch" is far too sordid, the seven "dorks" are too stupid, and Sydney is too pure of heart. That does not mean that the movie is bad. Although Bynes is forced by the script, she still has her moments. Just like Sara Paxton, who brings physical comedy to its best in its scenes. Sydney's roommate, named "Dinky", is also a funny character. It is a funny film, but in the end, too clear and too clear to be recommended.
