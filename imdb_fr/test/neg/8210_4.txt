"Harrow Dungeon" had a lot of things that could have made this movie a very good horror movie. A frightening mansion, a torture chamber, a paranoid host, a henchman, a ghoul in the dungeon, etc. an island belonging to a count in a castle, his slave and a mute maid. The count becomes more and more suspicious of the fact that the two shipwrecked are pirates (of all things) and are more and more inclined to turn against them and subject them to the dumb servant who binds them. friendship to torture and imprisonment. It sounds good, is not it? <br /> <br /> Well, not quite. I called it one of the worst films I have ever seen, but now I hesitate. Because he had so much potential, he could not really be called "one of the worst". However, seeing all this wasted potential is a real blow against this film. Overall, it's not a very good movie. <br /> <br /> There is a very gothic suspense scene when our hero is chained in the dungeon and is confronted with the mad and leprous decayed bride, adorned in a wedding dress. It was scary and disturbing the first time I saw the horror unfold in this scene. Man I wish it to be a better movie! <br /> <br /> This movie had all it took to make it a sullen cooler late at night, but finally took all the wrong turns. I suggest someone redo this one.
