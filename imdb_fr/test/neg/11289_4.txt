Ty Cobb is by far the most interesting and crazy athlete of all time. His baseball career was unprecedented in absurd statistics, a brilliant strategy and pure and pure violence. Every game he played was a show of human ability and cruelty. So, of course, the film about him does not deal with any of this, rather focusing on the writing of his biography by author Al Stump. Now, this is not an idea so horrible in theory, since Cobb himself has sunk deeper into paranoid madness over the years and the tales of his crazy attacks, even in his elder, even shock the norms. desensitized today. But instead of focusing on these events, which, I guess, was just too interesting, the movie is a pseudo-fictional road movie with a cliche plot that will drive any Cobb fan warned to cry tears of vinegar. <br /> <br /> Tommy Lee Jones is doing pretty well like Cobb, but still manages to overplay his cartoon. Most stories about Cobb are barely believable, but making it even more crazy seems both impossible and useless. Robert Wuhl, who represents the writer Al Stump, is a dark vortex with no talent. He sucks the life of each scene, trying to make this film his own Nagasaki. There's a reason why we never see him as a prominent man (Arliss does not count, it's hardly a show). Even the inevitable "reversal" and played roles of Cobb and Stump in the end is further compounded by his sheer inability to utter words that do not resemble a poor book on a narrative voice. <br /> <br /> Despite the terrible writing and making of bland movies exposed, there is a sequence that stands out as being so superior to the rest of this failure that accepting the same movie is almost impossible. A super-stylized flashback sequence illustrating Cobb's overwhelming psychology and brutal athleticism while playing baseball is just awesome. The camera moves in a bizarre way and the whole event seems to be a dream because of the unique playing style of the Cobb monster. Each slide, each hit, and each tackle is made even more powerful by improved sound, and Tommy Lee Jones CLEAN to the intensity of the main player. This makes the viewer drool over the possibilities of a true Cobb biopic at its peak with the same actor. It's worth watching the movie for a few minutes, just to see what could have been. <br /> <br /> I may be a little unfair to this film because of my own knowledge of Ty Cobb and my desire to see it become a thing, but to make such a boring and sterilized film about this maniac is not sensible. I'm happy that Ron Shelton's career has slipped since.
