When does a movie get so bad that it's good? Darkhunters is a remarkable example of c ** p cinematography and deserves a reward on its own. <br /> <br /> The plot revolves around the old battle of paradise and hell. for unclaimed souls of the dead recently. In the case of Darkhunters, the representatives of good and evil manifest themselves as a herd of cats, a figure hooded Grim Reaper face flickering flames similar to an electric fire coal effect, a Philip Marlowe similar to a bad manicure and a psychologist who appears to be on Kwik-Save's day off. <br /> <br /> The protagonists are fighting over the soul of a recently deceased teacher, who spends most of the film on hazy ground. and oddly, a kennel boarding to try to escape his pursuers. <br /> <br /> The plot is slimmer than a diet sandwich without developing character or attempting to build suspense. The acting is laughable, comparable to a school play - although it is an insult to many educational institutions. And the dialogue .......... oh, how my side hurt! With the unclaimed souls of the dead described as "unwanted gobs of life" by the flaming devil, you wonder if hell is really a McDonalds. <br /> <br /> But it's strangely convincing, you end up watching to see how serious this can become - just over 80 minutes, it's worth spending time for the unwilling giggles .
