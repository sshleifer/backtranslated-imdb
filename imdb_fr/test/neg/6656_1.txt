I did not see Ishtar, but I had the misfortune to see Kevin Costner's postman. It's worse. Perhaps the worst waste I've ever seen, and if you look at my comment on Moulin Rouge? it's saying something. Bad plot, playing was substandard and even wasted (though, yes, Michael Keaton was in some of the worst movies I've ever seen), and this movie has no redeeming value for anyone with more than half of the brain. DO NOT SEE IF YOU HAVE ESTABLISHED THE GRADE 4 GRADUATION because you will find an insult to your intelligence.
