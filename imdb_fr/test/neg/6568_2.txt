Even if I'm not a fan of "Star Trek" movies or the world of series and books, I always find pleasure in some movies featuring the old cast and in the case of "First Contact", even a little more. . This one was a little sad to watch ... he seemed to want to be so, but in many ways he was one of the worst Star Trek movies. The plot is very far-fetched, seeming to want to combine three or four stories into one ultimate Trek adventure, but it ends up being a little funny when it tries to be, not tense when it wants to be and not action-packed as if it was trying to mess up. inconsistencies. The whole film to take a sentence from Spock is illogical. The effects are nothing special, because I have seen episodes of Next Generation just as good, that is to say that they are suitable for a television show, but they do not represent an important film . The plot is laughable as the gang first tries to stop Spock's brother, then joins him in his quest to find God. Yes, you read correctly. The Klingons make a nailed appearance, which will in fact be the best Undiscovered Country movie. All in all, you know it's bad when the best part of the movie is Kirk, Bones and Spock singing your boat, well, Spock did not really sing, but rather questioned the lyrics.
