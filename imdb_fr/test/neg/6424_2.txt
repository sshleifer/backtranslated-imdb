I know a few people who look like the main actress of this movie (or, at least, the character she plays.) They give me all goosebumps and I would be the last person to lend one to one of between them. even a sharp knife. She has a mean and ugly expression. If you can arouse sympathy for her, please let me know. <br /> <br /> Of course, I could have the same expressions of worry and fear if I had an imaginary friend who had killed my real friends and acquaintances in the past 15 years. <br /> <br /> And for our European friends of the IMDb, I am saddened to say that, yes, some colleges and universities in the United States give courses on paranormal phenomena relying on pathetic defense that it represents "academic freedom" and an open inquiry. <br /> <br /> This movie is not worth it. You will have no sympathy for any of the characters (with the exception of Aunt Lydia, who left early enough) and the plot makes no sense.
