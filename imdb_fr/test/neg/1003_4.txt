This story of the upper middle-class, which stands out and wallows in its misery of the upper class, is like a contemporary Mid-Summerian version of an old film by Joan Crawford in which she suffered from mink. Here, people behave in a terrifyingly civilized way in the face of adversity. A wealthy London lawyer (Tom Wilkinson) discovers that not only does his wife have an affair with the local gentry, but that she has also killed their housekeeper's husband in an accident. He vomits, but otherwise, his rigid upper lip hardly shakes. <br /> <br /> Written and directed by Julian Fellowes, Oscar winner for the writing of "Gosford Park" (excerpt from his first film) a novel by Nigel Balchin, it's pretty comical, though I'm not sure of the intention of the comedy. It's like a return to the British movies of the forties, where characters all behave like characters in books or plays rather than what people might be in real life. However, not everything is bad. Wilkinson is great, even if you never believe in him while Emily Watson (the adulterous wife) and Rupert Everett (the lover of high class) are very good at covering cracks in the material. Tony Pierce-Roberts' cinematography ensures that, even if he is very hard on the ear, he is always good to the eye.
