What should I say? I only saw this film out of curiosity, and it's a shame ... I grew up in Brittany with stories of Celtic legends and I spent 5 years in Rennes, the city where this film is supposed to be unfold ... Too bad no actor or camera of this film has ever arrived in Rennes. They could at least have chosen a city or a forest likely, but nothing seems to be like Britain or Rennes ... And to call it a movie about Celtic legends is really ridiculous. Besides these details, it could have been a good movie, but it's shit. Silly scenario, silly characters and no originality. Certainly to avoid.
