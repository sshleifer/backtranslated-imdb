Okay, if you discount the value of production, ugly outfits and big hair, this adaptation is still much inferior to version 90. First Ann Firbank (playing Anne Elliot), she's literally ten years too old to play this role and its role leaves much to be desired. Amanda Root (playing the same role as in version 90) can express more in her big brown eyes that Firbank can not do it with all her face in a production of four hours. Anne became a sullen, moaning and boring character (and what was the scene during the "long march" when she stopped to burst out of poetry?). Henrietta and Louisa were so alike that the only time I could tell them apart was when they stood side by side (Henrietta was taller). And Louisa! Never before has there been such an odious person! It was ridiculous to think that Wentworth was supposed to be interested in her. She's supposed to be playful, pretty and charming, not stupid and stupid with her ridiculous laugh that looks like nails on a blackboard. When she started singing "Lyme, Lyme, Lyme," I started shouting, "Shut up, shut up, shut up! The best part of the film was when Louisa was falling off those three cobb feet because I knew I should not see her in the movie anymore. Speaking of the fall on the cobb scene; it was the mose scene, badly directed and badly mounted of the whole film. How does a person fall on three feet, land on his feet and stay stunned? <br /> <br /> On plus size, Elizabeth's character was much closer to the book than in version 90. They also put a lot of other scenes with Anne and Frederick at the end. <br /> <br /> I admit, I bought this movie, even though I knew how comparable it was, but I'm a huge Fan of Austen, so I'll buy any film adapted from one of his novels. Watch this gesture if you are curious or want to enjoy the 90 version even more. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, this version can follow the letter of the novel, but version 90 follows the spirit.
