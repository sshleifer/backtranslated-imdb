Last night, I watched this film on television, hoping to have a realistic account of what could happen in the event of an outbreak of a highly transmissible disease. I was disappointed and I think the movie was a garbage can. It did not seem real to me. Some of the actors were awful, especially that of the doctor. She was about the worst I saw. It all looked like CNN's worst case scenario. Even the essential elements of human relations in disaster films did not seem sincere. I've seen disaster movies, especially those on the weather, that are so bad they're fun. This one is almost as bad, but it's not even fun, it's tedious and boring. Do not bother with this one.
