The story is a ticked claim jumper who has bargained with the devil for gold and is forced to protect him forever. A group of friends find the gold and get talked by the old miner and they are forced to explode into a thousand pieces to send him back to hell. <br /> <br /> I mean seriously ... how do you get this movie does not win the film Oscar of the year? What a fascinating story of young people in their late twenties ranging from a straight claiming rider out of the 1800s. I like how in other movies you can not kill the monster, but they can knock him out. .. this movie, they write the monster as completely indestructible. <br /> <br /> The opening of the film clearly tears Nightmare Elm Street, part 4, but damn it, this film was not a classic 5 star. <br /> <br /> One of the highlights of the film is that we meet a girl who has never been to school or gone out. from the city, never learned to read or write ... yet speaks perfect English, smokes hot and wears the latest fashion. How did the Oscar miss CELA? <br /> <br /> OK, I'm done with the bad jokes, this movie is pure shit and only look at it if you have nothing better to do and all the spices on the display are already in alphabetical order. <br /> <br /> 2 of 10
