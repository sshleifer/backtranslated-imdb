Pumpkinhead was in itself a decent horror movie of the 80s. No classic by any means, but a nice piece of down. Why then, we now have a fourth film of this franchise, it's beyond me. As in the previous suites, there is nothing here that really connects the movies except the monster, the witch and Ed Harley (Lance Henriksen). This time we follow the feud between Hatfield and McCoy. Part of the film is a Romeo and Juliet romance as a young McCoy boy and his Hatfield lover decide to run away to be together. Soon, however, they are torn apart and the boy's sister is killed. The boy escapes into the woods and asks the witch to resurrect Pumpkinhead for revenge. The acting is passable at best, amateur at worst. The titular demon does not even present himself for nearly forty minutes, and when he does, he makes only a derisory comparison between him and the original design. Overall, Blood Feud fails to impress. This may be worth a watch once, but certainly not an addition to the collection.
