No blood, no blood, no gratifying death scenes ... dumb dumb mute mute. Dear God sitting in this movie made me sick. Sick Sick Sick. Very annoying ... extremely boring ... <br /> <br /> This film does not even have a humorous aspect! I can not find a good thing to say about it other than the main guy had a nice body ... I guess. Not really worth the fifty cents I paid to rent it.
