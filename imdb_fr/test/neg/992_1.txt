to a Saturday morning in my hometown. I went with an older friend (he was about 12 years old) and my mother let me go because she thought the movie would be OK (rated G). I was assaulted by loud music, strange images, no conspiracy and a stubborn refusal to give any meaning. We left half-way because we were bored, frustrated and hurt our ears. <br /> <br /> I saw him 22 years later in a renaissance theater. My opinion had changed - it's even worse! Basically, all that I hated about it was still there and the film was VERY 60 years old ... and is badly dated. I had all these little jokes ... pity they are not funny. The constant changes of tone have quickly been annoying and there is absolutely nothing to do with it. Some people will love this. I found it frustrating ... at the end of the movie, I wanted to throw something heavy on the screen. <br /> <br /> In addition, all the songs of Monkees of this movie SUCK (and I like them). </ br> For ex-hippies only ... or if you're stoned. I give this a 1.
