Loki, the Nordic god of evil, creates a mask that gives the bearer cartoon powers. On the order of his father, Odin, he spends the rest of the film looking for the mask so that it does not cause any sorrow to humanity. Meanwhile, the owner of the mask conceives a child who inherits the powers of the mask. Etc. etc. If it looks like a pretty thin line, it is. Add to this the fact that the film is treated unnecessarily from beginning to end, and the result is really very bad. You can find worse movies, but you will have to actively search for them. <br /> <br /> For the most part, Son of the Mask is intellectually presented to a preschool child, but in light of scenes such as the masked baby who copiously urinate in six different directions, including understood by his father, this hypothesis seems unlikely. I asked my son who he thought might have been the target audience of the film, and he replied "Convicted criminals", apparently forgetting for the moment that the Constitution prohibits cruel and unusual punishment. <br /> <br /> a bad movie is not a sin, or hell would overflow. What makes it a sin is that $ 72 million has been spent on this waste. To put things in perspective, the day after we watched Son of Mask, my son and I watched "Good Night and Good Luck", a film that won six Academy Award nominations (including the best picture) , and was bought for $ 7. million. It is true. Only a tenth of the money spent on the Son of the Mask. This is the sin: to throw good quality money into the sewers, whereas it could have been better used for making films, to feed hungry children, or even for other purposes. Producers should really be ashamed of themselves.
