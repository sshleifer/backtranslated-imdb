I have never seen the original movie that others have commented on. My point of view is that of the film without comparison. <br /> <br /> I found that the message of the film was: if you worry that for yourself, everything will go well with the world, everything will be put in place, your lovers will love you more, your friends will respect you and love you more, your employers will want you more, you will pay more and even your own children and parents will love you more. <br /> <br /> I find this message reprehensible and totally false. <br /> <br /> Congratulations on the very funny birth scene at the end; There is not a mother out there who will not laugh during this scene. <br /> <br /> Overall, a very disappointing film scenario. I did not find myself rooted in this film. I thought they were all absorbed, pathetic individuals, that I did not care what had happened to them and that it was not a film that people want to see.
