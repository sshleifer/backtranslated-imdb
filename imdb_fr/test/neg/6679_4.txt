EVALUATIONS IN STARS: ***** Saturday night **** Friday night *** Friday morning ** Sunday night * Monday morning <br /> <br /> Child, Mark Goddard (C Thomas Howell) sat helpless his family, including his father, the hero of cops (Jeff Fahey), was brutally murdered by vicious criminals whom he had tried to bring down. With an inner desire to punish the unjust who haunt him as he grows up, Mark uses hard means to bring the suspects he pursues and creates a lot of problems with his superiors because of this. But then he learns that "Justice Incorporated" is a secret group of men and women led by a mysterious man (Ed Lauter), which serves to inflict a sentence that does not correspond to the crime committed in accordance with the law. Going out alive could be harder than he thought. <br /> <br /> The Sweeper has problems with offset, because we've seen this same plot unfold before (and better) in movies like The Star Chamber with Michael Douglas and Magnum Force with Clint Eastwood . The title does not make sense either. But we also have to deal with the ridiculous film, including a scene where a girl's helmet manages to cover the sound of her family's slaughter, a final involving a chase with a villain who starts on the highway and gets ends on a plane Wright Brothers, as well as some of the most ridiculous actors ever staged and a very clich√© and pretentious scenario. But there are cool action sequences here and there, and the film's unintentional laugh factor certainly keeps it alive. **
