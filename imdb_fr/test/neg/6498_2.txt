This film had the biggest advertising campaign ever seen in Russia. "Epic film about Russian culture", "Great saga of the Russian spirit", articles and endless interviews. For me, this film was the biggest disappointment. The main character played by Oleg Menshikov is a stupid immature boy ready to prepare his classmates because of a woman who does not even look like a woman. What is there to admire? In the first part of the film, the story does not develop at all. The festival scenes of people seem to boast of Russian audacity. <br /> <br /> I respect Mr Mikhalkov for his previous work as an actor and director, but this film only demonstrates his ambitions to be considered the "tsar" of Russian cinema. .
