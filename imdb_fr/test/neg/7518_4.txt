The time machine starts in New York in 1899 when Professor Alexander Hartdegen (Guy Pearce) offers it to his dear girlfriend Emma (Sienna Guillory) who accepts it. Unfortunately, just after being attacked by an attacker, Emma is shot and dies in the arms of Alexander. Four years later, Alexander built a time machine that he uses to get to the night Emma was killed in order to save her, but she is still killed, but in a different way this time. Alexander realizes what he's doing, even if he comes back several times. Emma will always end up being dead one way or another and he longs to know why, so he travels into the future to find out the truth. However, after destroying the moon, two new races evolved on the Earth, humans like Eloi and the monstrous Morlock's devouring the Eloi. Alexander decides to stay and save the Eloi. <br /> <br /> Directed by Simon Wells, who is actually the great-grandson of author HG Wells, who wrote the original book The Time Machine on which is written The Time Machine (1960) . the film was based and it's actually the 1960 film on which producer John Logan's script is based here rather than the original Wells source. Although the three share the same story and the same basic ideas, this remake adds the subplot about the murder of Emma, ​​Alexander's fiancée, and that's why he's inventing a machine. go back in time rather than just because he's smart and he can. The screenplay is a mix of science fiction, adventure and drama, none of which really captured or engaged me, of course, there are some pretty special effects, some pretty action scenes and the moment answer Alexander's question why. he can not save Emma is actually quite smart and logical that it never really captured my imagination and it never really moved me either. The Time Machine travel aspects of The Time Machine are very similar to those of Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1992) in that you can not change the past, but at the same time the future is not defined, Only The Time Machine is far from advanced. good movie like Terminator 2: Judgment Day. The character is fine, although I thought Guy Pearce looked too young to be an intelligent scientist who could invent a time machine. There is never a real explanation behind its mechanics, because it's as if for a moment there was no machine to go back in time that he invented and manufactured one and it works perfectly. I think the "Back to the Future" trilogy offers far more thrills, laughter, excitement, and entertainment value in general than The Time Machine never does. I will do everything in my power to qualify this film as a bad movie, because it advances at a reasonable pace and at its moments I would not call it brilliant or even particularly good. There is also a cheeky little reference to the original book and movie that are both verified here. <br /> <br /> The advantage of this modern version compared to the original is the development of special effects and in particular of CGI which leads Scenes of Time quickly browsing Alexander in his machine to go back in time, building huge buildings, building new ridges, canyons and mountains and forming an elaborate panning that ends in space when we see passenger rockets gravitating around the moon. The effects work well, there are one or two moments that seem a little below but the effects are good in general. I saw The Time Machine on TV and the station that was playing the bandage and I scanned it so that the left and right edges of the frame were cut off from the screen, thus cutting off part of the year on the dial of Alexander's time machine, so I did not know it. what year did he go? Apparently, director Gore Verbinski has resumed the last eighteen days of filming, while Wells was suffering from "extreme exhaustion," while IMDb claims that the time machine is the most important accessory and the most expensive ever built for a movie. Believe & Guy Pearce broke a rib during a fight scene but as a soldier pursued him. <br /> <br /> With a supposed budget of about $ 80,000,000, production values ​​are high with a lovingly restored period in New York and good effects work well. Surprisingly, The Time Machine has been nominated for Oscar for best makeup but was defeated by Frida (2002). The acting is mixed, Jermey Irons performs well in an awful makeup job that makes him look like a rejection of the movie Lord of the Rings while singer Samantha Mumba debuts on the big screen here and is just terrible although Guy Pearce is pretty good and quite friendly. <br /> <br /> The Time Machine is neither a particularly bad film nor a particularly good movie, but rather a rather banal movie that is visible and that spends an hour and a half but not much else. Look again Back to the future (1985).
