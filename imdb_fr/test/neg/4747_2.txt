From where the last AVP stopped, an alien "chestburster" emerges from a dead predator on a Predator spacecraft, and causes the Predator spacecraft to crash in modern Colorado Gunnison, where it spawns several other extraterrestrials who start to wreak havoc. The Predator race sends a single highly experienced and armed Predator to "clean up the mess". Our human characters are caught in the middle of the intergalactic battle. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem of this film is stimulation. This film is moving too fast. The opening credits have just rolled and already the Predator ship crashes on the Earth after the Alien has become quite up to it, a hunter and his son are introduced but before we even learn their name, they are both killed, then we see the Predator. home-world and the main Predator fly off to fight the infestation by extraterrestrials, and all this happens in the first five minutes. This artificial rhythm does not abandon the whole film; the National Guard arrives in town but in less than two minutes are all killed without even having a good look at one face, the manager of a pizza shop gets a scene of development of the character to be killed the next time we Once again, without even learning his name, random hobos, a waitress and a chef are killed again without learning their names. A moment when our main characters are at home, the next in town, the next in a gun store, following him in an APC, and this random set jumping repeatedly never lets up the time remaining to the public. leaving them in search of straws. <br /> <br /> Another problem is the settings and timing. The film takes place in modern Colorado, Gunnison. All other Alien and Predator films have been shot in fascinating environments, such as industrial space ships, tropical forests, alien planets and underground labyrinths. Now comes the AVP-R, located in a small modern American city, with a set of "highlights" including a sporting goods store, car parks, pizzerias and a girl's rooms. I mean, did they really try to make the film as drab, dull and as uninteresting as possible ?! It's hard to see these monsters as scary creatures when they stand near a shelf full of Reeboks or hide in the bushes outside the girls' rooms. <br /> <br /> Continuity is a big problem with this movie. The Alien series was set in the future, no human had ever heard of an Alien before the first movie, and the Aliens not only had never been to Earth, but if they ever reached the Earth, the humanity would be destroyed. This film ruins all this concept in the modern world, with Average Joes seeing the aliens everywhere, and at the end of the film, humanity is not destroyed, not even suffering what could be considered as minor losses. It pisses everywhere in this concept of other films. Attempts to maintain continuity are made with Deus Ex Machina's. It turns out that the Predator carries an unlimited unlimited blue liquid bottle that just melts all the bodies in one drop. At the end of the film, the army is content to take excessively drastic measures and drop a nuclear warhead. conveniently erases all evidence of Aliens' existence despite the fact that many survivors of the incident are witnesses and that many other futile attempts were made to fill the hidden holes in the plot. <br /> <br /> "Verses" movie, he has a relentless bias in favor of the Predators. For the majority of the film, a single predator manages to kill dozens if not dozens of aliens, all within melee range scarcely gaining a scratch, while the Aliens are slaughtered right and center, as pigeons are to kill by the predator without making any effort to defend himself. This movie should not be called "Alien vs. Predator", but "Predator Aliens Massacres". I mean, how can you make two species compete with suspense and tension, while one is described as vastly superior to the other? <br /> <br /> The characters in this movie are among the biggest flaws. Not only are they pale compared to the characters in the previous Alien and Predator movies, but even as an independent film, they are bland, sad and sometimes even downgrading. The characters in this movie are: I'm not kidding, excited couples who want to get fucked, pizza delivery boys, blond bimbos, high school fools, kids and a blatant copy / paste job kidnapping Ripley and Newt; the worst and most cliché of possible ideas for the characters. Not only that, but all the above-mentioned characters are interpreted by teenagers. If the teen casting is an obvious attempt to attract a younger audience, its only effect is to give the film the appearance of a pornographic film typical of the teenybopper, with actors too young to have learned to give a convincing performance. , with most of the facial expressions completely blank offering a monotonous dialogue. Not only that, but these characters do some of the most backward things of all time, like using Predator guns, commenting on powers when it's been hours, following foolish plans to get out of town rather than just getting out of the city. city ​​a little quickly, and so many other idiots, that the film made sure that the public of my theater sighs of frustration. <br /> <br /> In the end, this movie is just a horrible B movie, something that deserves direct treatment in DVD Category. The fact that this film is a theatrical release surprises me, because each part of the film counts only amateur work.
