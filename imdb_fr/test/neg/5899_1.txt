I was so disappointed by this movie. The slogan was something like "The story of a girls' awakening". You can only imagine how disappointed I was. I was seventeen at the time and took my girlfriend to see him. I thought we were going to see a sexy movie that would let my girlfriend gag. Unfortunately, this was not the case. I guess we were just not ready for a deep and meaningful movie that required an element of sophistication that we did not have at the time. I'm not sure I own it now and I have long since separated from this girlfriend in particular (a pity really ... my first love). We left the cinema halfway through the movie, my friend, who should have known better, stayed throughout the movie. I always got the desired result with my girlfriend, the movie did not help much. It would be interesting to see him again so that I can make a more informed criticism, even if I feel that the experience left me traces for life.
