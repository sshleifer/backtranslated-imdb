Dear Mr. Ram Gopal Varma, I do not know how I write this letter to you. I am a fan of Amitabh Bachchan, who never said finished, after sitting down during his cock-hunter's number at Jaadugar. I'm also asking for an important designation in The Godfather's fan club, having watched the Coppola Classic more times than you have delivered flops from your factory. And, of course, I've been a big admirer since Nagarjuna wrapped the cycle chain around his joints at Shiva. <br /> <br /> When you announced Sarkar and you call him the godfather All we wanted to know was the date on which the first glance would be launched, the Sunday when the promos would be broadcast Friday on the release of the film. It was a fulfilling wish at work, knowing that you, not someone who hovered between the Amritsar mustard fields and the tulip gardens of Amsterdam, had begun to recreate the pages of Puzo on the big screen of Bollywood. <br /> <br /> Your casting could not have been more than you? working for the first time with the legend, with Abhishek for film on screen, giving Kay Kay a role he has deserved for years, bringing back forgotten faces like Supriya Pathak and Rukhsar, and selecting complete non-actors like Katrina and Tanishaa the list ?? Before July 1, you had made Sarkar the most anticipated movie of all the monsters of Godfather Adoring Bachchan. <br /> <br /> The opening credits fueled the hope that your beautiful sepia-themed specials on TV had been turned on. But now, you've called Sarkar a tribute to the godfather, instead of the word "inspired" that you used from the beginning. You probably do not want the two creations to be compared, but when the medium is the same, a Kaante will be compared to Reservoir Dogs and a Reservoir Dogs to a city on fire. <br /> <br /> your first and last sequences ?? the heart of any scenario treatment? Are all about the establishment and transfer of power, you can not keep the Nagares and Corleones apart, even if you replace the American mafia movements with Maharashtrian political power games. <br /> <br /> But you were wrong Mr. Varma ?? You wanted to show Amitabh in his 70s avatar as crumpled by the feathers of Salim-Javed. You wanted him to roam bigger than life. You wanted it to be its own brand (o). So, how could you steal his voice in the name of the use of silence? How could you keep him rooted in his chair in the hunt for interesting camera angles? How could you leave him stuck without his voice and stature, the two things that made his sound so big? Coppola's cameraman, Gordon Willis, masked Brando's eyes throughout the film, as he did not have the power to match that hoarse voice or sudden snap of his fingers. But you tried to repeat the Malik act of your own company. But Bachchan is not Ajay Devgan ?? his strength does not lie in stagnant gaze and suffocating silence. You make this man look like a patient in a coma, who is reminded from time to time to look at the memory cards and put these predictable one-liners in their mouths. For this, Agneepath is there, every Saturday. <br /> <br /> Which fan of Bachchan would like to see Kay Kay Menon steal the thunder under his nose in the scene where Sarkar asks Vishnu to leave his house? What amateur Amitabh would see him focus on achaars and caramboles, in a film that speaks of power with a capital P in specials? We can not manage so much in the name of restraint and underestimation! You do not even let the camera rest on him for five seconds when he learns that his son wanted to kill him. Give me the old school style for cameras only on Bachchan every Saturday. <br /> <br /> Congratulations to you, of course, for making Abhishek an actor, first in Naach and now in Sarkar. You also allow him to show Mallika Sherawat that he can run as well as his father. Even in the short prison sequence, you really get the Bachchans out of the text, an opportunity missed by Shaad in Bunty Aur Babli. I would have liked the film to be more of a father-son story than a chaotic conflict between caricatures on behalf of characters that appear as pop-ups on the Internet. <br /> <br /> You also leave women more in the scenario than Puzo and Coppola did and again, you deserve all the Brownie points to squeeze them so effectively. Pathak is a welcome return because the mother in the middle, Tanishaa kind as a girl in love, Katrina a revelation as a confused lover of Abhishek and the silence of Rukhsar say a lot. <br /> <br /> But the subplots do not make a classic remake. When your flowing camera tries to make every image look like a hedge and your noisy background annoys you, we continue to remember that we are in a factory. Well, maybe not a Nino Rota score but Sarkar certainly deserved better than those Govinda songs, Govinda and unassuming flute interludes. <br /> <br /> Mr. Varma, some of your factory managers tell me that you are involved in every project, from supervising shooting schedules to supervising assembly sessions. Perhaps, in the middle of all the storyboards, Bhiku Matre's cry is softened by the silence of Subhash Nagare. Maybe we have to lower the shutters of the factory and work on a single home product. Otherwise, your products would remain products to use and throw, not treasures. And film buffs like me, for whom there is no success or flop, only a good cinema, prefer to choose a film without finishing Factory, whatever their Saturday.
