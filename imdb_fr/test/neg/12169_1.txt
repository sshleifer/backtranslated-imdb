I remember when this show came out. It was originally advertised as a mini-series. At the end of the last episode, he was declared "to follow" to the dismay of all who had watched the boring thing beyond words. It ended as planned, so you can blame the series for not finishing. The plan was to create another one if the audience ratings were better, but it was too boring and boring because people were annoyed by not finishing as expected, so they did not do it anymore. Some comments criticize its cancellation and its lack of end on the public, while the truth is that for this program it is not the case, it ended the way it had been planned to end, it is an ugly end.
