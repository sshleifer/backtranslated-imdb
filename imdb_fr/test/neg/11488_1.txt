I would like to say something different about this movie. I have seen comments on how beautiful Russia is and the views of Russia have been great. Hey guys, it's not Russia, it's Bulgaria, more precisely the capital Sofia. So it's not Russia, it's my country. About the movie - good in Bulgaria, maybe except for the gray zone - all American directors' films are in a horrible word like this of course. It's a shame that Patrick Swayze has to play in a low-budget movie. Most of the actors are Bulgarians, but this film has no plot, but what I can say is that a weak and boring film is not a clich√©. People remember that it's not Russia, it's Bulgaria.
