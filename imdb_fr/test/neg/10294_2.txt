I must say that when I saw this film in 6.5 on this site, I thought it was really worth to be seen. I was deeply disappointed. From the beginning of the scene, it is obvious that the two supposed agents of the FBI are, in fact, the killers. Could they have made it more obvious? If this is the "twist" wanted in this film, it's rather sad. Although Pullman and Ormond are excellent actors, even their talent is not big in the face of a really bad scenario. Pullman plays the role of a killer sociopath ... and that's the problem. There is no switch of "I play FBI!" to "I just killed 12 people and my boy, my arms are tired." You can not blame the actors ... the story fails in more ways than one. <br /> <br /> From the beginning of the film, I was sure to be wrong, no director / screenwriter ever be so obvious about a "twist" plot. Ormond and Pullman simply need to act strangely to distract the viewer from the real killers, I thought ... which gave the film producers too much credit. I should have followed my instinct and turned off the movie before it even exceeded 15 minutes. <br /> <br /> To Lynch's credit, she has managed to present many things that make a good movie: sex, violence, humor and well-trained actors. Too bad they had a bad configuration. Let's hope that Pell James can recover from this role ... I found his performance particularly impressive as a stupid drug addict who became a savior. She should have rewritten the role for the "fucking crack" to win. <br /> <br /> The people who compared this film to Natural Born Killers, take note: Tarantino has made the characters of Mickey and Mallory reprehensible, but friendly. The art of this film dominates by far the gore, and this is not seen once in Surveillance. Surveillance only wants Natural Natural Killers ... In fact, she dreams of being only a fraction of what this movie was. People who have not seen Surveillance ... stick to something with a little more intelligence. Like Camp Rock.
