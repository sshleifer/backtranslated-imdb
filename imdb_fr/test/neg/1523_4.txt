The first time I heard about Paridiso Guest House was in the "washroom" after seeing Fight Club. In each urinal there was a small round black circle. When the circle came in contact with moisture (to put it mildly), it caused the formation of a color image, with photographs of the two stars and the slogan "You'll make yourself laugh". Once you have finished washing your hands, the circle is dried up again and blackened, waiting for surprise for the next "victim". <br /> <br /> Okay, maybe the typing line was not terribly sophisticated, but we have to admit it was innovative. In fact, I think I can honestly say that I have never seen anything like this in my life before, and these days of more than a century of film and marketing, it's a real feat. What a shame that the film that accompanies it has not kept its promises. <br /> <br /> I hate to pan about Guest House Paridiso and I'm indebted to Rik Mayall (Richard Twat) and Adrian Edmondson (Eddie Elizabeth Ndingombaba) for many years of laughing through their attractive TV series, which it is the invention of The Young Ones (1982-1984), plays of Bottom (1991-1995), or even of a solo piece, such as Rik in the New Statesman (1988-1993) ). In fact, it would have made a hilarious special 45 minute TV show. Unfortunately, it's a 89-minute film. <br /> <br /> There is definitely some merit to be had, and I laughed continuously throughout the finale, which parodied the exorcist and the adventurers of the lost Ark, and ... well you will have to see this bit by yourself. Yet, often, the rhythm is imposed and the atmosphere is sterile. The two stars (Edmondson taking his usual back seat, this time due to the fact that he runs well) never really get started in first gear, Mayall showing sporadically the rough mania that makes us love him at the small screen. Indeed, the presumption of writers that we already know the characters makes that they are not delivered to the public. The slight touches of depth observed in the series (Richie's effeminate, failure of social climbing for example) are not present here and we end up with parodies of parodies. <br /> <br /> The accusation of Fawlty Towers lets the water pass, complete with the drunken and invisible leader, called-server "Pasquele", who rhymes strangely with Manuel. Some of the ideas, such as a hotel near a nuclear reactor with a children's swing hanging over a cliff, are very entertaining, but finally the frantic pace is stolen, both of them constantly seeking a studio audience that is not not there, and all the areas of "dead laughter" covered with incidental "comedy" music that would have been dated in a Carry On movie two decades ago. <br /> <br /> Paridiso's puerile, sadistic and perverse humor is funny, and I'm sure it will make you laugh ... but not as often as it should.
