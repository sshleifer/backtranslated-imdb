The Women (2008) by Diane English is unfortunately such a waste of talent. With Annette Benning, Candice Bergen, Bette Midler, Cloris Leachman whom I love and enjoy in everything I've seen, and Meg Ryan, Jada Pinkett Smith, Debra Messing and Eva Mendes, who may not be my actors favorite but who's watching, how could the movie be boring, predictable, embarrassing, neglected and just plain bad? The film was directed by Diane English, who is the writer of the hit television series Murphy Brown, and is her first film for which she wrote a screenplay. The film was a work of love for English who tried for many years to realize it and I respect it. I even found the scenes with supporting players, Bergen, Leechaman, Carry Fisher and Bette Middler in short but memorable, funny, intelligent and enjoyable cameos, but in general, the film is a second-hand movie "Sex and the City "months ago. I did not find Sex and the City very good when I saw him, but beside The Women, it was just great. At least Sex and the City spared us the long and tasteless scene in the delivery room of the hospital where one of the characters had a baby and where her friends supported her. Poor Debra Messing, what did she do to deserve this nightmare she suffered and for us, the viewers, with her? Movies like "The Women" give the whole genre, girls' movies, a bad name. There is nothing wrong with the genre, but why is it so difficult to do a very good comedy about friendships and women's events, about how to deal with marriage, motherhood and to be professional? These are very compelling and important topics for any modern woman. Why make films with lines, dialogues and situations so clich√©d, predictable, not amusing and insulting that they will be forgotten as soon as the film is finished? <br /> <br /> After seeing the new movie, I checked the original The Women from my local library and really enjoyed it. The story was told much better 70 years ago and kept all my interest. The old movie had real star power.
