Once again, Bronson's talent is mainly wasted in this thriller of 1984, shocking value, which is (even more disturbing) more disturbing than most of what is still out today. The fact that "the harm that men do" is very disturbing (in its verbal and visual representations of torture) is not the problem. This is the shameless tip in which it is presented. Interestingly, this film seems to symbolize this last part of Bronson's career in which he tortured many of his fans with the same incredibly predictable and non-creative intrigues. We hope that this actor will get up.
