It's Wes Craven at its worst! This is the worst horror; if you can call it horror, you'll never look at it, especially from one of the masters of horror Wes Craven, Poor Direction, Poor Acting, Poor Set, Poor Atmosphere. the villain is totally unconvincing, you could not even be sorry for the guy! the gore and horror involved in the movie are laughable, it's bullshit! Natasha Gregson Wagner, Giovanni Ribisi and Lance Henriksen are the only positives that I can imagine, but even this cast could not prevent this phenomenon from becoming uncontrollable and becoming one of the worst horrors of all time. If you do not look at it yet, do not worry, you'll only hate it.
