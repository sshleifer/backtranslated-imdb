The leaders ask for a huge suspension of disbelief, you grant them in the hope of convincing you that it is possible. Alas, with TV movies, it seems that they have specifically put in mind to make cheap Cosmo quiz films. With a small budget and big demands, you should spend every penny on the details to convince the public. Not here, though. The film gets some points for the good performance that give the two main ladies against all odds, but unfortunately, this is not enough to save the situation. oh, and the least says on the end the better. Good viewing of all!
