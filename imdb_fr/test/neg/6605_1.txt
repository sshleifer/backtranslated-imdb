Yes, it's true. This movie is a horrible piece of ... you know what. Almost every fan of Sapkowski's books in Poland thinks the same thing. The truth is that Polish cinematography can not afford to produce fantastic films. It's a shame when you compare "Wiedzmin" and "Conan the Barbarian" for example. I hope that no one outside Poland will ever see this nightmare.
