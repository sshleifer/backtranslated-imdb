The unpleasant kind of "house invasion" dates back to the beginning of last week, Wes Craven's "The Last House on the Left", with such unpleasant exits as "I spit on your grave", "Wrong Way" and "The visitors "shortly after in the footsteps of this film. Here, in the early 80s, the Italian who offers the same plot is regurgitated once again, with the difference that it is set on a continental train. "The Ragazza Del Vagone Letto" ?? known in English-speaking countries as "Terror Express" ?? start surprisingly well, but it takes about twenty minutes, while the sex scenes start to outweigh the more serious action and suspense. <br /> <br /> David, Phil and Ernie, three young rich wallowing to terrorize and humiliate others, board a transcontinental express in Italy The train is filled with other passengers, including the prostitute Juliet (Silvia Dionisio) who frequently takes the train and has signed an agreement with one of the porters to act as a pimp, persuading male passengers to part with their money. a night of passion in his sleeping compartment. The three morons quickly began to upset the passengers with their aggressive and drunken behavior, but the situation worsens when they take control of an entire car on the express train and barricade themselves in the rest of the train. Soon, they revel in their temporary control. a young wife (Zora Kerova) is raped by two of the young people in a narrow compartment; Juliette herself is the victim of a prolonged sexual assault; and later, the odious trio forces male passengers to roll a dice to decide which will violate a 16-year-old virgin traveling with her parents (a concept made doubly insipid by the fact that her father is one of the men forced to play the Thu). The only passenger who seems ready to fight back is a convict who is escorted to Germany, but what hope does a man have against three armed thugs? <br /> <br /> The Ragazza Del Vagone Letto is off to a good start. Various intriguing characters are presented, and it appears that the three thugs exert a truly destabilizing influence on the travelers. Although the story is clearly a case of exploitation, the first scenes are carefully constructed and the film seems to exceed the usual level of the genre. Things fall apart during a horrible scene in which Kerova is sandwiched by two thugs in the toilet. The scene is filmed with jubilation and the effect does not seem to generate sympathy for the victim or hatred towards the perpetrators ?? instead, we are asked to feel energized. It's sensationalism at its worst. Other humiliating rapes ensue, but the rape sequences involve too much camera work on oral sex and female genitalia. A sequence featuring the 16-year-old girl rocks at the edge of the hard core and feels particularly "wrong". At the end of La Ragazza del Vagone Letto, it's easy to forget that it was a thriller, because the last hour of the film is devoted to pornography rather than suspense. Sleaze lovers will enjoy it; others might want to look elsewhere.
