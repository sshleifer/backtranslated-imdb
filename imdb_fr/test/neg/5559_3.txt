This is a parody. This means that there are no characters as such, they are all clear stereotypes and the film is based entirely on the quality of the jokes. <br /> <br /> Well, there are a lot of good jokes in this movie. Unfortunately, they are hidden in a mass of truly stupid. If you expect all dialogues to be absurd, the pleasure will disappear. <br /> <br /> You see, there is American Pie 2, my favorite teen movie of all time. It contains a lot of real original characters. Maybe the jokes have no taste, but everyone has a life. For example, they feel embarrassed if something embarrassing happens. That's what makes jokes really funny! <br /> <br /> This is not the case of this film: each scene is clearly organized as a pure parody, so there is no character, so there is no place for sympathy. In addition, if you know the original movies, you know in advance whole scenes. Add the fact that a lot of jokes are not funny at all, and you have this movie. <br /> <br /> The only thing that has kept me from getting bored completely is actually the comments of some teenagers at the movies where I was watching the movie. <br /> <br /> Ah, and my highlight of the film was the very brief appearance of Melissa Joan Hart in a scene. Sigh. She is too cool, she can not be real. Hmm, it's worth a movie?
