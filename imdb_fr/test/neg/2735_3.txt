It's a very, very bad movie! <br /> <br /> The plot is weak, the acting is bad and the science is even worse. <br /> <br /> The special effects are not convincing. Dramatic scenes are a joke. You can see each step of the way arrive at a kilometer and a half. The end is disappointing and there is no suspense. The best aspect of the movie is the soundtrack. <br /> <br /> The only reason we should not vote below that voice is because it's a TV movie and I think the budget was low at first. <Br /> <br /> I think young Luke Parry fans will always see this movie, but it worked better. Once again it's terrible. Very very very terrible. If you have a choice, look at something else.
