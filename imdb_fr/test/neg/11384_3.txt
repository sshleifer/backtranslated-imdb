To start this movie was sick. Here your wife is dying and you will walk around town with this chic blonde by your side. Then your wife dies and within 2 months you are together with this chic. Hank (James Brolin) really advances throughout this film. I called it Fast Hank. Fast Hank marries this beautiful lady and even before you know it, she sleeps with her best friends. What annoys me is when she "does" it in the barn with Kevin and gets caught by another friend of Hank. Kevin gets up and leaves, she drops her dress and BAM !! Right in the arms of this other guy and they start to "do it" then and there. I guess he finishes what Kevin started. HOW GROSS !!!! I'm like it's a movie for life ??? This is a typical film of the old man young woman who says that you can have my body if I get your money ...
