Six months after the death of the sprinter Laura during a race, a murderer begins to murder the rest of the athletics team using various sports equipment as weapons: this is the plot of the Graduation Day of the early 80s, a dull addition to the genre. it offers very little style, originality or decent gore. <br /> <br /> What this gives, however, are some surprisingly terrible musical interludes, some familiar faces (including an early appearance of Scream-Queen Linnea Quigley), and some nudity (a prerequisite to any slasher movie!). <br /> <br /> Then forget the death scenes - they are lame and bloodless - and enjoy the film more memorable way shitty elements: the quick edition that can cause migraines and seizures. 'epilepsy; disco on wheels, accompanied by a long heavy rock song entitled "Gangster Rock" performed by the incredible Felony; an impromptu improvisation session by the students of the school; Christopher George did it as Head Coach Michaels; and the nerdy music teacher who drops his students (who, for some reason, finds him irresistible?!?!). <br /> <br /> Towards the end of the film, the action resumes a little, with the discovery of the bodies of children massacred under the bleachers, and a scene quite twisted with the corpse of Laura in his cap and his dress, but it's too late to save this movie from mediocrity.
