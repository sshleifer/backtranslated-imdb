Be warned, the next time you see "Richard Kelly" involved in a production, run away. Quick. <br /> <br /> Kelly proved to the world, after her latest movie, "Southland Tales", that he was a pretentious director. It was indulgent and complicated. In "The Box", little has changed. <br /> <br /> I can imagine what his speech to Warner Bros. had to be, and I bet the studio's leaders ate it well: a full movie based on one of Richard's old stories "Twilight Zone" Matheson. <br /> <br /> Big mistake! Do not read any more if you do not want this movie to be FULLY spoiled for you: <br /> <br /> Norma (Cameron Diaz) presses the button. <br /> <br /> It turns out that the Arlington Steward (Frank Langella) has an Alien who uses his body as a vessel to conduct "experiments" in which the destiny of humanity rests. His face is scarred because he was struck by the Alien Lightning, who killed him, but brought him back to life to test all the red pimples. Of course, since Norma presses the button, knowing full well that someone can die, she must suffer the consequences for not having considered the life of someone else instead of his own. Finally, she and her husband (James Marsden) choose to kill Norma instead of letting their son become deaf and blind. <br /> <br /> Kelly dances around the "message" of her film, trying to make the audience understand. what is the moral of the story. Obviously, anyone with a brain says at the beginning, "What if I was the person who dies?" Richard Kelly does not even let his character have this normal, human conversation. In fact, they avoid all of this together. They both seem educated, working in a prestigious school and also for NASA, so why would not they both be better able to look elsewhere than in the box ??? <br /> <br /> If he had the main characters actually have this conversation, the whole movie could have ended there! Instead, we have to watch the marriages last forever, NASA and NSA being complacent about Arlington Stewart taking charge of these government programs, teleportation to show Marsden's life beyond our world so that it's "easier" to kill his wife and the Steward-controlled drone that can be anywhere and anywhere, anytime. <br /> <br /> The most painful part of this movie is stimulation. Nothing really happens. It's a confused mix of ideas that are laughable. <br /> <br /> It is unbearable to see how this film is marketed. Advertisements give the impression of "Saw" and even use the music of these movies to sell. In reality, what you get is a slow, dull, laughable film (yes, half of the room did not care about acting and visual effects), and a messy movie that is neither imaginative nor interesting, nor coherent. At one point Cameron Diaz and her son are kidnapped, and then suddenly she is back in the NSA's big black car with her husband on her way home. Where has she gone? Why did they take her? Do we really care? No more now, you will not do it anymore. <br /> <br /> In the end, you will not really care what happens to the characters. You will make sure that all die so that the film ends. See what's going on. Do not waste your time or money.
