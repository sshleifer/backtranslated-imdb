If you value your life in any way, you will be courteous and you will pass this seemingly "interesting" movie on DVD. <br /> <br /> I know what you think, "I saw the preview and it looked awesome!" But beware, buyer, I fell into the same trap. One of my friends expressed reluctance to watch this film, but I forced her to sit still. Oh, how I regret this decision. <br /> <br /> Like most horror movies, the film begins happily in a sunny seaside resort in Mexico, where two couples are drawn to an ancient Mayan ruin by a fellow resident. Upon their arrival, they are disturbed by the appearance of two jungle inhabitants who are not aware of their welcome cries. As if it were not disturbing enough, the tour group ignored the growth of large plants and said an unused wildlife trail was a perfect route to get to. I guess it would not really be a movie if they used rational decision making and turned around for the moment, but hey, it was not really a movie. <br /> <br /> After a few hikes, the six (an employee of the club brought a friend) fall on the ruins and their doubts are immediately dispelled by its beauty and history. That is, until frenzied tribes emerge from the jungle, armed with a vengeance without any particular reason, shouting in indecipherable language. Since when brutal verbal attacks are assailed by a calm and condescending language - do not ask me - but nevertheless, the distribution attempts anyway, in vain, obviously. Suddenly, the sixth member of the path, Dimitri, is pierced with several arrowheads from the Mayas and hell breaks loose. A gunshot ends the job and the horrified travelers quickly retire to ruin. <br /> <br /> Now, if there was a plot for this movie, it ended here. The introduction took a maximum of 20 minutes and it was unfortunately the best of the 20 minutes of the film. Above the ruins, the five people now realize that they are blocked by murderous inhabitants and decide to make many good decisions, one of them using a withered rope to bring down one of their limbs in the bowels of ruin. Needless to say, the adventurer is seriously injured and imprisoned in the ruins and the two girlfriends are seriously injured while trying to save him. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film continues without intrigue, without real horror, only bloody and bloody, as we can see when a girl pulls a plant that grows in her, spilling torrents of blood and once more when someone's legs are cut, only for the girl's girl to strangle her later. <br /> <My only satisfactions in this film were watching the very attractive Jonathon Tucker, playing Jeff McIntire, more and more troubled and anxious, and sitting long enough to find that almost all of the actors are dying. a horrible and horrible death. Their simulated pain seems to be an adequate compensation for the lost time that this film represented. <br /> <br /> Supposedly, the story tells that ruin is an old house of dangerous spirits with a diabolical and carnal plant to protect and consume unlucky visitors. Unfortunately, I do not receive any warning of this kind by shouting bloodthirsty plants and the only thing perverse related to this film that makes me really horror is the screenwriter.
