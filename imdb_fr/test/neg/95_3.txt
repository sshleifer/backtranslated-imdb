I'm the kind of guy who loves Bell movies from New Jack City to Baby Boy to Killa Season, from b-class to Hollywood. but this movie was something different. I'm not hateful and this movie was pretty nice. but some songs were just weird. The acting was not very good, compared to the performances of Silkk The Shockers in Hot Boyz (pretty good) and Ice-T in the new Jack and SVU (super). On the stage where Corrupt (Ice-T) kills the Jamaican guy, he says something and lights up. He kills the Jamaican, but Ice-T is unharmed, very much like the other. The movie Urban Menace (which stars these two actors) was Snoops, the character is supernatural, but after that, nothing suggests that Corrupt looks like a demon. When MJ (Silkk) is stabbed at first, he struggles, but after that, he fights normally and is stabbed in the thigh - WITH OUT BLOOD. and when MJ confessed to killing a cop because the cop was hitting his friend Benny, it was weird, Benny is not featured in this movie and the scene is not. it weighs heavily on the fact that Corrupt wants to kill MJ but continues to make you scratch your head. wen Jody writes a letter to Miss Jones to explain what happened to them. The following words are not mentioned, but 2 other main characters, MJ and Lisa. the film showed the horror and poverty of the ghetto - which poison the lives of Latinos and blacks - was an integral part of the film, even if the clip of the projects had been reused thousands of times. and the scene where Miles kills the Latin brother crushing his bike at full speed (not wearing a helmet) and hitting the car of my Latin brother would kill him. the film was similar to the movie Urban Menace and half of the actors were in these two films as well as the production team. it was ok tho. but me, coming from poverty, I love hooded movies, but if you do not like them like me, do not look at it. The only thing that saves me from going out is that it reminded me of the first film I shot, which was made with 100 bucks and my love of the genre. <br /> <br /> Nathaniel Purez
