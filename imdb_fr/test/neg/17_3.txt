It could be the biggest disappointment I'll see in 2009. It seems like I'm the only person who hated Oldboy from Park, but I think his "Lady Vengeance" and "Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance" are some of the best films I saw in the 2000s. Therefore, I was really looking forward to seeing this, especially since it received such positive reviews. Instead, I found the film cliche and did not really innovate in the vampire genre. And although I can enjoy a bit of gallows humor in movies like this, I had the impression that Park had done it at very inappropriate times. <br /> <br /> Others have compared this to "Let the Right One In" and me I must say that "Let the Right One In" was far superior to this one and constituted a new interpretation of the genre. vampire. Unfortunately, Park was tired.
