what a shame that our first film is so bad .............................. hello, what are you doing in this movie: ( .. it's awful! and the director :( .. there is no story in this movie.I slept when I watched this movie .. It's a disappointment, and the majority of the team is not from Saudi Arabia.Sensed to be a comedy film, but it lacks the essentials in comedy, <br /> <br /> I know this is the first experience of cinema in Saudi Arabia, but I expect better from Kaif Al Hal! The only good thing about the movie is the presence of some talented actors who did not help much the text to explode their talents .. Finally .., I would like to know your comment on this movie guys ... is it bad or what?
