We all know that special effects cost money, but it seems they could have used the money saved when writing the script to get better shots. The train is obviously a model for most moving shots, the helicopter is obviously computer generated, the alien looks like the one at the end of Spaceballs, except that it's a decade later and Spaceballs had an excuse . <br /> <br /> The only smart thing to do was scramble all the special effects to make them harder to see. <br /> <br /> Even the actors could not compensate for such a badly written scenario and it is obvious that they did not really try either. . <br /> <br /> Please, do not waste your time. Please.
