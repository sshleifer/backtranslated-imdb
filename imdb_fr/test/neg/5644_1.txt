Enigma as a concept is an interesting idea, but I'm afraid it's a bad idea, Vinnie if the role of the hard man is his element, as in Lock Stock and Snatch. In this film, Vinnie plays the role of a sports writer of newspapers (greyhounds more precisely), who is easily beaten during the film and taken to the balcony by a man of 10 to 15 years. I'm sorry, Vinnie is hard, hard and so must throw it as if it were silly. Trying to investigate the double murder of a friend and addict found near the Thames. He assumes the role of policeman, while the real police is a bit involved, intercepting with flashbacks of Charles Dickens. <br /> <br /> When Vinnie is on the screen, his reputation precedes him, he looks tough, but he does not do it some must act hard, snarling at the camera in the parties. If you look at the average machine, it is perfectly molded, credible and makes a very decent performance. <br /> <br /> To return to the film, what is a bit of a puzzle is the flashback of Charles Dickens, who tells a different story with characters that also appear nowadays, these two stories do not seem related the same actors are used. <br /> <br /> The sound of the film, especially that of Julie Cox, is sometimes inaudible. Her role in the film lacks interest in Vinnies Love, she starts the film as a Detecive, but quickly. becomes the girlfriend. <br /> <br /> The death of the prostitute is somehow answered but not yet. Take off Charles Dickens and you may get a movie worthy of the name. <br /> <br /> Vinnie slowly becomes the British Steven Segal, hold on to the supporting role of the actor, you are very good.
