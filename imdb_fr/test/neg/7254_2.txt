Looking at this movie, I wondered why Universal was producing movies like this? They had a wonderful sequel of movies with all the classic horror movies. The dawn of the atomic era provoked an avalanche of giant creature films. Spiders, ants, praying mantis'. With The Deadly Mantis, a giant praying mantis flies around the Arctic, scares eskimos and is pursued by the armed forces. The virus reaches a tunnel in New York where the soldiers finally destroy it. Of course, all this is made much more visible by viewing it on MST. Who thought it was a good idea to start the movie by showing a giant card?
