I can not believe this movie gets the rating that it's here on IMDb. Of course, I come to the conclusion that IMDb is no good at figuring out whether a movie is good or not, 99% of the movies getting a score of 6 to 7. That's the conclusion and the failure of the appeal to collective supply via the Internet. To this end, an average of most people is taken, and unfortunately, most people are simple-minded and entertained easily. But I go astray. The film. I really do not want to waste my time writing about it. Let's just say that I found it tailored for two groups of people apparently, young teenagers, at the age when violent action movies of all kinds arrive at a point, and Gothic types who just love to stifle any fantasy of Gothic vampire that they can get their hands on. If you are not in these categories, you will find this film absurd. I enjoyed the first Underworld. It was cool at the time and had some sort of edgy quality. The second was a little complicated in the plot, but I enjoyed the staging and cinematography at times. But this whole movie looked like a science fiction channel production or even a TV show. I found the actors over-led. Their body language stiffened into unnatural idealistic poses that seemed artificial. The lines were spit out in the same way that the young actors spewed Shakespeare's lines, rejoicing in their own selfish fame for being in such a role, but doing so, making it brutally brutal. The plot was dry and predictable from the start. I found myself wishing things to simply "advance" because it was so easy to tell what was going to happen. I tried to deal with it at first, but my brain was forced to shut down. At the end of the climax, I actually fell asleep. There were so many inconsistent and inconsistent parts that it was not even worth listing them all. If you are a teenager with a gritty face or a chronic goth, do not be shy. For the rest of us, forget about it, as I am going to do now.
