When I watched this movie for the first time, I thought it would be a good rally, as it featured my favorite actor of all time. He gives a remarkable performance, although it is quite obvious that he did not need more than half a finger to live the job. It's the only good thing to do, unless you like the explosions and trash of American working-class heroes (which I am not). <br /> <br /> I do not understand. How can this film survive so naf? That little with the little boy being saved, I mean, come on! You can not tell me that he would have been saved without the fire guy wearing goggles (I know he would have been black like here and you can not see more than two feet in front of you) and no breathing equipment (it would have been smothered after 2 minutes!). This movie was just bad, OK? <br /> <br /> Why Robert? WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY ???? !!!! <br /> <br /> Sorry if this is your favorite movie.
