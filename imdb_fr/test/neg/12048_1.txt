Who the hell is responsible for this terrible mutilation of one of my favorite books? It's just terrible. terrible game, terrible scenario. The story is not even close to his old self - and what were they thinking? Robin Williams, for Gosh's sake! This really challenges the description. Do not see that. Seriously, no. Not even to laugh. Especially not if you are a fan of the book. This is perhaps the worst film adaptation of all time - everything is disjointed and scrambled - the characters that are important to understand the sequence of events are seriously marginalized, and every potentially interesting place in the book has been changed (example: Vienna - New York) in something deeply uninteresting. <br /> <br /> For those who have not read the book, it is essentially a fictional biography about a writer who grows up, explores his writings, etc. Her mother writes an autobiography that is hailed (despite her protests) as a kind of feminist manifesto. The book is well written, engaging and long. His prose is simply beautiful. <br /> <br /> This film, however, tells the story of Robin Williams, who tells us again to seize the day.
