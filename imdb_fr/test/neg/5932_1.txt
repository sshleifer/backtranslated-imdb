In the third part of "Left Behind", the manufacturers did not care to put NO TYPE OF CONTINUITY in the plot. Although all the weapons on the planet were confiscated by the United Nations, the Third World War begins suddenly. In just a few seconds, the ex-lover of one of the main protagonists goes from seducing him passionately to outright hate and becomes a melancholy confession of love without any trace of direction. <br /> <br /> But this film is above all an area without irony. Once the president of the United States accepted Jesus as his savior, he immediately became a suicide bomber and destroyed a skyscraper in the middle of the city. Osama Bin Laden will be very jealous when he sees this movie!
