this film is so bad that it forced me to create an account with IMDb just to warn others. <br /> <br /> I've been using IMDb for a long time, and a lot of movies make me want to want to register to congratulate or hit them, but none have ever been so worthy of it. Until now! <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of Matt Dillon. All I could ask myself throughout this film is "how did Dillon choose this script"? really. I mean there are bigger holes than Vredefort. <br /> <br /> I mean it's a modern film, not in the seventies. To shout loud, even a child knows that armored trucks have tracked GPS and the genre. you wonder what it takes to get a Hollywood screenplay. <br /> <br /> I could go on for a long time, but I would not do it. believe me when I say that. save time and give a jump. <br /> <br /> Sorry Matt, I'm still a fan, but this movie was bad.
