I see this film as a poor tribute to old slasher films. Because it really does not take into account the horror of the '70s and' 80s, it is of course there that personal tastes come into play. <br /> <br /> This film falls into the category of "News generations. " slashers "in my book, the distribution is that of 18-24 year olds and potential models.I personally, I'm pretty tired of this image in horror movies, old movies had at least some variation in people. or more fat people, and dorks in general, people who look quite simple, of course, it's nice to have always had some good sights, but when the whole cast is just a bunch of beautiful racks and it's going to be ridiculous, I mean, OK yeah, I like to watch hot girls, but not in a horror that's supposed to reflect ordinary people being hunted by a maniac armed with a knife, for example. that the wanted people look like any random person you see in the street, I think, there are of course some movies with just good viewers that go perfectly, but there are not many. "Wrong ride" is one of the best examples ers. <br /> <br /> The next point is the scenes of massacres that slashers should be about. In this poor film, all you see is 2 or 3 images of his high pitched / high pitched scream and crescendo music. And that's all. The little you see is not very graphic, not for those who have seen horrors over the years. The slashers of the old school, compared to that, had many more deaths, blood and blood. Not to mention the killers of these films, which surpassed the ones you will see here. <br /> <br /> For true horror fans, it's more fun and exciting to watch horrors with new approaches because of their originality. in my opinion, the killer of this one adds nothing new and fresh to the genre. I agree with what someone else has said, the CGI is something I hate to watch. Personally, I prefer makeup in the sense that I am conservative (unless the CGI is really well done). But the most important is to set up an atmosphere that allows you to "get started in the film", a good story is a very good thing. Plus, revealing and explaining too much of everything in a movie to viewers removes any mystical meaning that adds a lot to the mood and does not give you much to think about. For example, keeping the bottom of the killers as a complete mystery to the viewer is a good thing in many cases. I mean if everything about the story or its characters needs to be explained or shown in detail, then the viewer will not have much content to think about ... It's like watching a porn movie and hoping for a good story while waiting . <br /> <br /> Why old school cutters still work, at least for some people. This is because they are established cult films from the time they were new, that it is difficult to create new ones. The exception might be for people who are newer to this kind of horror, of course. I noticed that a lot of people like this kind of horror movies, so of course there is not "A good taste" for horror movies. <br /> <br /> But for people who could share my opinion; you have here a frame of reference what to expect from this movie.
