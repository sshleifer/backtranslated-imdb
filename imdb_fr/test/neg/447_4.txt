Honestly, I can not believe it's a sequel or a sequel to John Landis's horror film, a classic 1981 comedy. I guess you can not really describe it as a movie of original werewolf, either, since the essential elements of history steal elements from that of London: an American tourist visits a famous European capital, he survives closely to a werewolf attack that kills a colleague, he embarks (Pardon the pun) in a sexual relationship with a member of the medical profession, he turns into a werewolf, he is visited by the appearances of his deceased victims, etc. and by reading the preceding line, I have just discovered how much the story has in common with the original that it seems very similar. The difference lies in the fun and distraction of the film Landis. <br /> <br /> With this film based in Paris, no scene really stands out. No naked man wakes up in a zoo wondering how he will go home without money or clothes, there is no weird dream stage of Naziwerewolves and there is no spectacular climax. AAWIP is trying to be funny, but is there anything more embarrassing than a failed humor? I think of the scene where Andy McDermott has to convince someone that he has chewing gum in his pocket and not condoms! The biggest difference between the two films is perhaps that there is no poignant character in this questionable follow-up. You really feel sorry for the fate and dilemma of the protagonist in the London film. Here, you just feel that Andy is nothing more than a rag reviewing the literary movements of a script. There are also a large number of visible terrain holes. Is this the first time the Lunar Club has committed a massacre? If not, have a large number of heart-broken corpses been reported in the world press? Why does not the police have leads? <br /> <br /> Everyone mentioned it, and me too - The visual effects are mediocre. Look at the bungee scene at Eifell Tower, it's painfully obvious that it's done through a blue screen projection, while the werewolf transformation is done by a very cartoon CGI. I will not put Anthony Waller in the same category as Stephen Sommers as a director who totally ruins a film because of too much trust in CGI (the major problem of AAWIP is the scenario associated with a great expectation of those who have seen the film, 1981 classic movie) but I would have preferred Rick Baker special effects used for the transformation. To be fair, it is reasonable to think that the budget may not have been so long. But at the end of the day, this is a pretty poor horror movie that does not need to be done and DOG SOLDIERS is a lot better entertainment.
