This stinking movie. There is not much more. The final fight was like Walker's against my grandmother, not a supernatural demon with the strength of ten men. I found the advertisements more interesting. The twists and jokes of the plot could be seen coming a mile away. The only quality that redeems this film is that it ends. Avoid that at all costs ... unless you like the bad Chuck Norris movies.
