This film is awful. This creates characters that are not in the book, and some of them are ethnic or racial stereotypes. Including an odious Jewish boy and a politically correct black girl. Not to mention Yiddish-speaking elves. The book was a simple story about belief, and this movie is a dark, ugly and unnecessarily scary movie about nothing. <br /> <br /> The animation is superb, but the story was ruined by Hollywood. <BR /> <br /> The advantage is that this movie is going to take a kick-off at the box office and maybe the producers will learn not to alter a story that does not require any improvement. Hanks was exaggerated and I do not see why it would have been impossible to use the voices of other actors.
