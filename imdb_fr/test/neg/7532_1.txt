It's a very, very bad movie. This may seem like an oversimplification. An unstable and childish replica comparable to an unfounded insult. The truth is that I can not say enough about the confusing foolish plot, the really ghastly play (I'm talking badly here), or the random images of violence against women that make up the chaotic pastiche of a film drastically horrible- make mistakes that propel this affront to all that is good and decent in the world of cinema, even of human culture. Please, believe me, do not look at her ... ever. I'm serious. Stop. You'll thank me for that later.
