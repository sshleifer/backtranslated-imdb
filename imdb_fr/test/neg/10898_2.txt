I had never done it before, but this movie was literally so bad that I had to talk about it. <br /> <br /> I'm a supporter of independent filmmaking, like last year The worst (in my opinion) Hollywood screenings, the general public just seems to have lost the sense of what is making good movies. That being said, movies like this really give the independent film a bad name. <br /> <br /> The characters are boring and too stupid to show empathy. The management is horrible, the plot is horrible, the plot itself is horrible, stay far, far away. A single brief scene featuring the naked breasts of a woman who did not deserve a second look. <br /> <br /> The most frightening thing about this movie is the idea of ​​having to see it again. I gave it a 2 and not a 1 just because the actors were visible and the sound was audible - it brings a point for each of these traits.
