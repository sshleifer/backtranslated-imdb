This two-and-a-half-hour film was recently screened at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) at 10 pm There was a show scheduled at 1am after that, but I was wondering if anyone would stay awake to see him until 3:30. The opening scene is that of a man walking in a field and lasts four minutes. This is a worrying sign of what will happen: 144 good minutes more, pretty much the same thing. There is a scene of a man and a woman against a wall, standing in the sun. It is repeated 15 times, with very sparse dialogues. Sometimes these long, slow sequences are interrupted by shocking stills, such as a close-up of female genitals, broadcast for a full minute of film (the audience laughing in the last 20 seconds, saying, "what is the message ? "). The story resembles Dostoevsky's novel "The Brothers Karamazov", in which a moron falls in love with a woman of easy morality. In one of the rare moments when the crowd laughed (more desperate to try to justify having been there for two hours without seeing anything), a British tourist said he could not see things clearly since. the Eurostar train was traveling at 180 miles an hour, was translated by the translator with automatic switching units of measurement from the English system to the metric system in "they could not see things clearly since the train was traveling 300 kilometers to the 'hour". What was amazing in this film is that the quality of the cinematography reveals that a lot of money has been spent on the film. It was not an experience in 8mm movie cooking. It was carefully planned, structured, acted, mounted. Yet I have benefited so little. Some comments have called into question unsustainable details, such as the minutae of a dandling-shaped keychain on a newly opened door. Okay, that was noted, but what was the purpose? Some brave people in the audience moved away after the first hour. The rest remained out of curiosity: something must happen in the end. There never was one. And maybe that's what the movie is about. All movies at the theater are packed. This one wants to be different. Nothing happens.
