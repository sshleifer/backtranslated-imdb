Watching this film reminds me of several words: "sophomoric", "ridiculous", "improbable", "complacent", and finally (and inevitably), "boring". Misguided, poorly photographed and badly played, the film is a confusing mess with intrigues (if we can call them that) that turn in all directions. Someone may have used the finger painting of a five-year-old as a model. As a punishment for this childish crime of cinema, this group of "stars" should be spanked healthy and sent to bed without dinner. . All in all, it seems like George needs an excuse to get together with his boyfriends for a paid summer vacation and we're the suckers who pay for them. Bad George! Wrong!
