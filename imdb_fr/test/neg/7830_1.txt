Asia Argento has never shot a film (to my knowledge, especially that of her own father, Dario) where she does not show all her anatomy at a given moment. Indeed, in the most boring opening dialogue scene of all time, poor Madsen brings her to her office and reminds us that even if her hair is combed, she can still stick her fingers at any moment (she done but in such a coincidence "what do I really see? kind of way.) The DVD box, its packaging, gives the impression that this film looks like a femme fatale, so you can not wait for see her turn into a sleek and minimalist slayer.Being no luck.He is verbose, clinging to some aging and even worse, has no credible competence in physical agility other than (surprise!) The fact of remove ALL the clothes when a scene allows it.His accented English would be cool if only she did not try to make him look so affected and tried to talk like a child of 12. How about this parcel? , at a time weak and witty, is suddenly forced to kill while she already has another case going on and she is currently handling a cheap drug deal ... huh? what? Does anyone have a motivation in this movie to do anything other than buy a hamster? The scenario seems to be oriented by letting everyone talk a lot about the same things over and over again (I was expecting to see the worst actor in this movie appear as a producer who threw away money to have a little time to the screen) - there is nothing This is apparent from the obvious flaws of the Asian character who, at any time in the film, gives what promises the jacket of the DVD. She is weak ... but she knows how to kill. she flayed MUCH. She undresses naked, half dressed, even in the clothes of a dead woman ... she is very flexible and unmotivated. In fact, "Floppy" would have been a good name for this film ... and a picture of Asia fainting looking angry on the cover would have been a better representation ... there are actually pictures of her food in the process of eat from the plane !!! What are you talking about? <br /> <br /> The end does not make sense - everyone is just boring in their intention and in achieving all of their goals. Lester's wife does not deliver REAL vengeance (taking someone to karoeke's skin is in danger of death, but not really good) ... and Lester just floats without really proclaiming anything. A key art totally misleading ... Yes, we know that Asia has lost the fat of its firstborn, but in reality, a whole movie trying to pretend that it's quite interesting to shoot a movie on a passive girl -aggressive is not worth it. See Point of No Return instead.
