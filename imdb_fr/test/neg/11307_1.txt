Horrible Horrible film, I still can not believe that my friend convinced me to see that! No plot, bad acting, insignificant scenes and very very stupid dialogue. All I have to say is that this movie is the worst film I have ever seen and it's worse than Halloween III to which I also gave 0 stars. So I give it 0 stars and a 0 out of 10, well here a 1, but you get the point.
