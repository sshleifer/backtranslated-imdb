Very disturbing, but cleverly designed and scripted and directed intelligently with a good eye for color and detail. Mary Beth Hurt, Sandy Dennis and especially Randy Quaid are exceptionally good. The story centers on a young boy (Bryan Madorsky) who wonders where all the leftovers they eat are coming from every night. The strange behavior of his parents (Hurt, Quaid) involves the school's psychiatrist (Dennis). It's a ghoulish macabre movie. But it's not bad. If you like Hannibal, you'll love it. If you do not like parents, stay away from the movie. I'm just giving advice to Cannibal Lover and Haters. <br /> <br /> R-rated for strong adult themes and graphic violence.
