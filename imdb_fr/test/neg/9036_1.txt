I like beach boys and their music. So, being a filmmaker, I thought, wow, a Beach Boys movie, it sounds good. Well, FALSE! In fact, I just disabled HDNET, the channel on which the movie was aired, because it was so bad. Someone above mentioned editing ... well, they should at least have watched the monitors during the shoot. I do not know if anyone else caught the mustache that falls from one of the guys' faces after he kissed his wife, then smoothed it with his hands. Never heard of taking a scene again! To play was terrible. The management was terrible. The makeup was horrible !!! Perhaps the worst makeup job I have ever seen. Brian Wilson's "big" cheek looked like a teenager. <br /> <br /> This is really the first time I comment on IMDb, and I know it does not really make a difference ... but hey, what the heck did the producers think?!?! ?
