This is the situation of the Emperor's new clothes. Someone needs to say "This is not a funny and original movie, (etc., etc.), it's a low quality movie, do not waste your money on it". The movie is trashy, and the people who compose it are trash trash of inferior quality. They are only too realistic themselves. They do not have lines, they do not act. The American dream is not to create poor quality films, anything, poor quality or poor quality; it is to achieve something of quality and therefore of success. Only people who are desperate to rent a movie that has not been shot in Hollywood (that's impossible in Hollywood?) Could try to attribute some quality to this movie. It's worse than "Ed Woods", another film about a filmmaker without standards. These movies should not have been made, and you should not go see "American Movie".
