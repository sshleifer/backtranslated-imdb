Renee Zellweger is radiant, but the rest of this movie simply does not work. It's like a hamburger-jello-mold salad - an interesting idea, but who ever thought it would actually work on film? I like the two previous films by director LaBute - they were ruthlessly honest and fun. This film only succeeds in being ruthless and chilling - with big chunks of cops. (Do you think that Sam Peckinpah, Doris Day-Rock Hudson's film could have done it - now reduce your expectations to match the current state of Hollywood, mass produced.) Actors as talented as Freeman, Kinnear, Eckhart , Vince, and Janney ALMOST make their scenes more vivid testifies to the immensity of their talents to rise above materials that do not coexist. I would have thought (in the manner of Lynchean) funny of Freeman's cheesy speech at the end of the funny film, without the tenacious suspicion that this morality without conviction is supposed to be seriously accepted.
