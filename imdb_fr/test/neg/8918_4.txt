I just saw Today You Die. It's bad, almost very bad. <br /> <br /> 1) The direction and editing are awful, just horrible. I almost got cut the film, Fauntleroy (the director) has no idea what he does, he seems to film things at random and some scenes are meaningless. Also, I hate when the same scene is used again in the same movie, in this movie, some scenes were used 3 or 4 times. Pretty bad. <br /> <br /> 2) The dialogue is sometimes good, sometimes terrible. I like the fact that they wanted to make Seagal's character and Treach's character appear to be in a similar relationship to Lethal Weapon's characters, but it did not work just because some of the dialogues DO NOT SEN SENSE, and I speak very English Well, it's not that I did not understand the words, it was the fact that jokes and lines of dialogue had no meaning. <br /> <br /> 3) The script is pretty bad. Why do they always try to complicate DTV action movies? Seagal's wife in the movie has psychic abilities, why? Is it useful for the film? NO. Seagal eliminates a bunch of people who work for the guy who betrayed him and he knows these people without ever having met them in the movie. STUPID. The story sometimes derogates and jumps backwards for no reason. The story is messy and useless sometimes. They should have kept it simple and it would have worked. <br /> <br /> 4) In some action scenes, it's not Seagal, it's his doubler. You can know it because they only film it from behind and never show his face. He also beats guys with movie martial arts, not the real ones like aikido Steven knows. The double stuntman uses kicks and kicks with cheese. <br /> <br /> 5) Steven is good at the movie. 90-95% of the lines are said with his real voice. The rest is to double but it is not so serious. It was good. In addition, Steven seems to have fun in the movie and is more interested in the action he was in Submerged. He loves Treach as a partner. at least he does not seem to hate him. In addition, he seems to have been in better shape than in some of his recent movies. I hate the fact that he wears clothes to hide his body, but in the clothes he wears on the jacket of the DVD, he looks more than good and he should have been wearing those clothes for most of the day. movie, not the stupid long leather coat. <I really think Seagal was ready to make a good movie. The fact that he arrived late and took off early from Fauntleroy's series ON TWO MOVIES does not seem to me a coincidence. I think he realized that the team members were amateurs or were just making money fast and he did not care anymore. <br /> <br /> In the hands of a better company and a better crew, it might have been a damn good action movie for Seagal. Something like Out for Justice or Above the Law. I honestly believe that. But the people who made the film did not do their job very well or did not have enough money to do the job properly. Too bad because I loved Steven in the movie and that Treach was cool (Ice Cool) too, but the rest was bad. At least that gives me hope for Black Dawn and Shadows of the past. I think Mercenary could be just as badly treated. But hey, Steven seemed to be back in the same mood he was in making his best films and at least that's enough reason to watch the movie. <br /> <br /> I liked that, but it could have been SO much better. 4/10
