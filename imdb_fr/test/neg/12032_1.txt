A small budget can be an excuse for a weak acting talent and a pathetic false gore. However, this is not an excuse for bad writing. It is a talent to be able to write a dialogue without making it forced and mechanical. The dialogue in this film was on par with most educational videos presented to fast food staff. <br /> <br /> I also understand that you have to make some exceptions when it comes to playing with talent when you only have 20 dollars. spend on it. That said, no serious director would have looked at these scenes and said to himself: "It was perfect". I see a better character playing on Canadian television. <br /> <br /> This film had a complicated scenario, a bad acting, a mediocre dialogue and contains no intelligent idea. It just proves that some independent films are for some reason. If you are looking for a quick fear, praise something else. Even the "Cable Guy" was a scary movie. After watching this movie, I think I would have done better to watch a new reading of X files.
