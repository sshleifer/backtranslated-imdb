I do not even know where to start. I did not like that. It did not behave like a story and so much was injected into the film (the pot brownies, the son was gay (?) The murder was justified, what possible reason could there be in the scenario of Linda aka Penelope) never explained. All the liquid was spilled on a table and left drops of water on the counter until everything became a mess on the floor. <br /> <br /> Why did Vanessa Redgrave play for five seconds? Why did Diane Wiest use her character from Bullets over Broadway without having fun at camp? Why did Jane Birkin start in the story? The list is endless. The film ended and we all looked at each other - like - did you understand that? <br /> <br /> I tell you one thing: if I looked at my long-lost father being murdered, I certainly would not do it "do not kiss the murderer." Do you say something else, if "Bob" broke up with "Bob" what is the purpose of hiding the son in the closet, Bob going to sleep with Bob in front of the son, how did the killer contact the son so easily? <br /> < br /> If this opinion seems confused, it's because it was a waste of film, talent and time.What the devil the dead shrinkman had to do with anything !! /> <br /> Jezz, this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen because it should have / could have been better, louder and should have made sense.No meaning, instead we receive a diluted "Diva" (the 70s movie with a murder) and tired performances that read boring lyrics from a completely crazy scenario. <br /> <br /> By the way, folks. Or maybe myself and the other people who watched this movie are too stupid to understand everything. I mean, after all, it's a French film.
