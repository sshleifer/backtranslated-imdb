It was a disappointment in many ways. The location in Ireland, although very beautiful at times, can not save this film without inspiration. Greg Evigan and Alexandra Paul, as a married couple trying to put their marriage back on track and inheriting a haunted mansion, are simply not interesting characters. Paul, near the end of the film, becomes incredibly annoying and we would like to shut our mouths and shut up, because it seems like she's screaming as if she's becoming an Olympic event! The other problems in this film are strange segments that have nothing to do with the heart of the film, such as the opening sequence with two housekeepers and the woman in a bed with a cut hand climbing on her body naked and writhing. Although the woman is completely adequate, it does not matter. It only remains to think that the production team needs a bit of time and adds some T & A. The CGI effects are also caricatural and the producer-co-final producer of his rival, Roger Corman, far superior film The fall of Usher's house in all its low prices ineffective. Any attempt at genuine tension and suspense, and therefore chills, is thrown out of the window in this low-budget recession. If you like pictures from Ireland, you might find something there, but you'd better rent or buy a travel journal. Ignore this unless you discriminate and the plot is secondary. Rent another story about low-budget ghosts (if you can find it) called The Woman In Black and see how good and scary a movie can be. It was a missed opportunity.
