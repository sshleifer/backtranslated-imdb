Ray Bradbury, run and hide! This cinematic version of his new 1950's on time travel and its effect on de-evolution is not well known in the theatrical series (has there been one?) And now exists in the form of DVD on the shelves a slow week. <br /> <br /> What seems to be a sophisticated sci-fi thriller from the very first scenes deceives us quickly because the computer-generated graphics are rebroadcast without alteration in a film supposed to be different 'time journeys where a Big business sells machos in 2055 the opportunity to hunt dinosaurs by paying exorbitant fees to go back in time in the prehistoric jungle. A jump of the foot / butterfly in one of these companies and the course of the evolution are modified with the waves of time which result on the planet, transforming everything in plants and beasts eating of men. Of course, there is a pretty lady who knows how to reverse the process and a beefy man who risks his life to act according to his orders and everything is finally OK. <br /> <br /> Yes, that's the story ... and the most surprising thing about this badly-written and badly-played movie mess is that it has attracted great talent to embody the characters cartoon dishes. Edward Burns is our hero of the day, Ben Kingsley is the bad guy required for business with a ridiculous white wig, Catherine McCormack is the creator of the "know-it-all" and Wilfried Hochholdinger is a villain - all are great actors and should have known better than to line up on this flop. And what is saddest is that, for those who love this kind of sci-fi monster thrillers, the creative department has run out with one of the most secret animations on the screen since a long time. Do not miss. Grady Harp
