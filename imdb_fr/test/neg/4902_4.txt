It is important to keep in mind the true meaning of the phrase "Inspired by a true story" when you look at Pride. It's a bit like "You could save up to 50%", which can literally be translated as "You can not save more than 50%". All of this sounds good until you realize that the bottom part of "up" is "zero". Likewise, "inspired by a true story" means that someone has heard a story and reminded them of it. The only certainty is that the real story and the one you are going to see are not the same thing. <br /> <br /> There is a real Jim Ellis who started coaching the Philadelphia Department of Recreation swim team in the early 1970s, but I feel that the real Jim Ellis did not not have to conceal a feeling of disappointment as to the turn of the film. It is clear that the story of his life takes wild liberties, and I imagine him responding to the strange looks of his friends who wonder why the film is so different from the man they know. <br /> <br /> In any case, one thing he will surely be proud of is that he is played by Terrence Howard, one of our best actors, who played alongside Bernie Mac who, despite the absence of an original and striking story, always gives a touching and touching. performance. <br /> <br /> The film takes place in the 1970s in Philadelphia, a time and place where racism was the norm, no exception, and where Jim Ellis, educated and professional, who is also an accomplished swimmer , struggled to find interesting teaching post, until he was finally relegated to a ruined recreation center, which he was responsible for cleaning up before his demolition. We can certainly understand his feeling of depreciation. <br /> <br /> When we meet Elston for the first time, the maintenance worker (Bernie Mac) is a disappointed bastard who sits in his office surrounded by stacks of junks touching the ceiling and watch daytime TV on an old TV. Needless to say, when Jim arrives to start cleaning the place, Elston is not really friendly with him. He knew that his recreation center was closing and all his anger about it was transferred smoothly to Jim. <br /> <br /> Given his background as a college swimmer, Jim is particularly interested in the pool, which he cleans, fills and puts to the best of his ability. A group of black teenagers playing basketball just outside the recreation center are interested in the pool when their basketball rim is removed and the heat remains stifling. Soon, the group has under arms a developing swimming team that enters an entire city. swim meet. To call them outsiders would be an understatement. They are unorganized, unprofessional, insufficiently trained and have no idea how to behave during a swimming competition. <br /> <br /> It does not matter, of course. The film is the classic sports story for the underdogs. The first sporting event is therefore absolutely irrelevant because nothing but a learning experience, a catalyst to drive their training much harder and much more focused leading to the last sports outing, that questions. Right now, the only thing a sports film can have is that the protagonist (s) should not win at the climax of the film. Just understand the meaning and meaning of their efforts. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the film has all the development of the character of an old movie Seagal. The good ones are good because they are supposed to be, and the bad guys are the naughty white swimmers who laugh and joke and make racist jokes to our team. Oh, and there's a scene where one of the white guys hits one of the black men underwater while he's in the middle of a race. I did not know that it was really possible to hit someone underwater that way, but you have an idea of ​​the depth of the character's development. <br /> <br /> We understand that this is the group of children that Jim Ellis has transformed into children who drag on the street doing nothing and form an organized and competitive swimmers team, but Apart from that, we do not really know who they are. <br /> <br /> But the biggest problem is that the film says that efforts and organization lead to success and that racism is bad. These two things are so obvious that when a movie is done with itself, it ends up feeling empty and useless. Racism was so much more powerful in the United States in the 1970s that the film dealt directly with this issue, but it said nothing about it. It's a bit of a good movie, but when it's over and you realize how much it should have been much bigger than what it says, the feeling of well-being becomes a sad disappointment.
