Terrible terrible movie for television. Once again, Lifetime brings us the predictable triangle; plotting a bitch who seeks to become stupid the wife of another stupid husband who knows nothing and has no idea. <br /> <br /> I'm upset when I see these movies. You can ask, why do I look at them then? I've no idea. Generally by mistake. And the film is so bad that I can not get away with it. I'm waiting for the bitch to get her a penny. And usually, I'm not satisfied with the way she gets her right desserts. <br /> <br /> Now, if you can believe our vixen, she steals embryos from the clinic and how do we do that? Without blood tests, DNA, inquiries and recommendations. She proceeds to the death of the real estate agent, Gabrielle Rose, who is at his side, in broad daylight in the yard of a house for sale and nobody sees it? She kills her mother, Susan Hogan, and you can predict this hypothesis when the mother spontaneously mentions that she is allergic to peanuts and that the pills to combat this allergy are in her wallet. Guess what? I will not continue on this subject. <br /> <br /> Finally, you are left alone at home with the woman and the dog. Well, good triumphs over evil, but far too slowly. Victoria Pratt as an evil girlfriend is adequate in the role, looking a little too disheveled and too obvious. Tori Spelling stays mostly blank. She has those big big eyes of Bette Davis that seem to come out of her head. I liked him better in TRICK. And Tahmoh Penikett incarnates the husband and assures his wife that there is nothing more than him and his ex-girlfriend, although he has seen the whole city as being very boyfriend with her, standing half naked with her at home when he sent the woman home. city ​​to spend the night. Yet he continues to deny romance. <br /> <br /> Her life never disappoints viewers with its ridiculous intrigues and stories about women and their stupid husband. If only I could assign the note "0" to this chestnut.
