A scientist (George Zucco) wants to create wolfmen from American soldiers to fight the Nazis, but he is called crazy. He uses a simple gardener (Glenn Strange) to experiment by mixing his blood with the blood of a wolf. Strange, constantly integrating his dialogue with the tones of Lon Chaney Jr. in "Of Mice and Men", has no idea what is happening, only sleepwalking. The victims begin to pile up (including a little girl that modern viewers might find rather disturbing and two rivals of Zucco). There is a good dialogue about how man should not play with nature (which still prevails today) and play God. Zucco's motives may be honorable, but his methods are highly debatable. And then there is his daughter, Anne Nagel, who is kindly sympathetic to Strange, but still has no idea of ​​her father's actions. Johnny Downs is a journalist who questions the bad side of Zucco, but wins Nagel's heart, creating the usual and always boring secondary intrigue in classic horror movies. With 77 minutes, it takes about 15 minutes more than usual for a horror movie from the early '40s (especially one on PRC, which released this one), so that the romantic story could have been to be reduced for costs and to speed things up a bit. Zucco, fortunately, is never hammered; He left that to Bela Lugosi (who always hammered in a deliciously theatrical way that made it public) and to the Englishman Todd Slaughter. But try not to think of the laboratory of "The Bride of the Monster" by looking at the one in which Zucco works, or part of Lugosi's dialogue in this now classic cult movie. "Mad Monster" lacks more cult because it is not deliciously bad, it just looks dull at more than a few places. For CPM and monogram lovers, I would recommend "The Corpse Vanishes" or "Fog Island" to a higher level.
