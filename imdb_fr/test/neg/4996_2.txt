Do not be misled. This is not a zombie movie. Take a guy who loves zombie movies and who praises them all: the good ones and the horrible ones. Yes, this movie has a long sequence of zombies, but it's an artistic and far-fetched exercise in existentialist terror, which is a long way of saying it's boring. If you've worked hard all day and want to spend a few hours entertaining yourself, rent something else. <br /> <br /> "Rise of the Undead" offers inexpensive special effects, mediocre acting and insipid dialogue. All of this is understandable in a low budget, independent film, and I can forgive such flaws as long as a film has an entertaining story to tell. Unfortunately, "Rise of the Undead" has almost no history. In addition, acting is not ridiculously bad, but non-existent. All the actors seem to have studied Buster Keaton's wooden faces school. Would it have killed them to show an emotion? (And no, shouting does not mean issuing). The only character who actually had a pizazz was killed first. Certainly, there was another character who briefly held my interest. He looked and acted like Kyle McLachlan channeling Norman Bates, but it was too little, too late. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers seemed to have forgotten a little detail: the film is a VISUAL medium. This means that you need to sufficiently illuminate your scenes so that the viewer can actually see what is happening. And all these jumping cups and these big artistic shots might have looked cool at the time, but they only made the film shocking and confusing. There's nothing wrong with telling a story in a simple and clear way - just look at George Romero's "Night of the Living Dead" to see how it's going superbly. And I know these people had a small budget, but if you can not commit the equipment and technicians needed to make the dialogue audible, then go ahead and make a silent movie (Buster Keaton's wooden faces could then work). <br /> <br /> I'll say this for the movie: the zombies were scary. Unlike most zombie movies where the undead are shown in all their decaying glory, the bigger the zombies, the better it was, the zombies were there to stir people to the bleeding face. It actually worked to make them more similar to us, and therefore more scary. That's why I gave 2 stars to this movie instead of 1. <br /> <br /> The sad part of it all is that, despite all its faults, "Rise of the Undead" n do not insult your intelligence. The filmmakers seemed to have really wanted to make an original film, clever and scary, and it's a shame that they failed so badly. If they could just give up on too sophisticated editing, buy some extra light bulbs, start the dialogue and create a story that actually goes somewhere, then I think they have the talent to do something really good. <Br /> <br /> Trust me: do not waste your time on "Rise of the Undead".
