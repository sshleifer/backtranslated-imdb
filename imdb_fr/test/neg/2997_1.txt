It's a good time to say how much I think about this site: it gives me the opportunity to tell all the frustration I've had for two hours, waiting for something to happen, something to be said, shown, insinuated. subtly, for a symbol, an idea, whatever. No, just long endless violins, alternated by a tired piano. Weary voices, tired actors and bored characters and situations. Boring is the long death of the spirit, and this film is, from this point of view, a public enemy. How many thousands of flying hours will still be stolen from thousands of other innocent bystanders. I do not claim for my money, just for my time and the time of the people I invited to watch this thing ... oh my God!
