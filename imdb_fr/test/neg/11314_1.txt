Leslie Nielsen hits the bottom with this absolutely horrible comedy which is the worst mainstream movie I have ever seen. There is nothing magnet about this movie, because it's essentially a movie of a joke, and the joke is not so funny. How often are we supposed to laugh at an almost blind man who ridicules himself? It's not funny, it's just pitiful. Nielsen must seriously start rejecting some of these pathetic scripts, and Stanley Tong must continue shooting movies for Jackie Chan, because it's not worse.
