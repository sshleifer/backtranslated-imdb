In fact, I still doubt that I like this film. As for the story: unrealistic and very exaggerated. The game was too bad in my opinion. It is unlikely that Antonie Kamerling will get the status of Rutger Hauer. Some people will expect it anyway. Let him first work on his English pronunciation. If you look at the "trip" to Paris of these actors (extra DVD), you will most likely want to do it. Advice to Beau Dorens: stop your acting career, you'll never get there ... 2 main actors: grow up, please. Being generous, I would give 4 out of 10. <br /> <br />
