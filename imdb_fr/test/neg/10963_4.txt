The Quick and the Undead is, finally, the first film to really make its own scenario null and void. It's essentially a gigantic plot hole. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, the acting was rather bad, the motivations of the non-existent or incredible characters and no character was worth holding our hat. The most interesting member of the cast (who had great potential to become a dark horse protagonist) was trapped midway through the process. <br /> <br /> What the Quick and the Undead serves as is a great example of how to do well timing colors. It seemed excellent, given the budgetary considerations. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it's as if a guy gets his hands on a hundred thousand dollars and watches some Westerns (including The Good, The Bad and The Laide) and then throws a lot of random items into a movie ... "you know, they have movies where the characters are doing THIS! Does it fit here? No, but whatever, they do it in other movies so I should do it here " <br /> <br /> Maybe a good point of view for thriving cinematographers and colorists (first-year film schoolchildren). Otherwise, do not miss it.
