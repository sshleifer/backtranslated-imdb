it's a horrible film. he passed mute. First, the only thing that matters to twins is their appearance and what boys like. they are in 7th grade. not to say that I'm a prude or anything but it sends the wrong message to girls of all ages. to be pretty and popular is not everything. but that's what the twins say. The plot is even worse. the grandfather of the girl is precisely the ambassador of France. He has a colleague who takes the girls around Paris and they meet two "cute French boys" with motorcycles. they are looking to meet the boys are starting to really like them, etc. They meet a mannequin being treated and go around betting with strangers they find cute. should I say more? this movie can be cute for 8 and 9 years old. twins play losers ditsy who want boyfriends. it sends the bad idea to the girls. the movie itself is not great either. I do not recommend it to anyone. I give the passport to paris 2/10
