Mario Racocevic (Europe) is the only user to have posted a comment to date and addressed the main points of the film. Another tough film to buy in the UK. I had to go through "Midnight Video" which has a Swedish branch. I went to the post office and bought this and a title similar to SKR30 only a title. <br /> <br /> This movie is classified in many "aliases" depending on the time and place of marketing.I had previously purchased "The Bloodsucker leads the dance" (which you will find if you perform a search on Imdb under "people" and enter "Krista Nell"). The actor who plays the count on his private island in this latest film had his words dubbed Italian in English by an actor with the monotonous voice sad and rather tired. I smiled as I heard this same voice doubling on the English soundtrack of the police inspector investigating the murder of the prostitute killed in the abyss of the film. My choice of course was to see another outing by the delicious Krista Nell. <br /> <br /> There are several inconsequential intrigues in the film involving blackmail / extortion, sordid affairs with the mothers of girlfriends, a motorcycle lawsuit resulting in the death of a gang, a gangrape "The motorcyclist's friends ", sneaky photography, transvestites, etc. that give a flavor to this film in a nutshell - SLEAZE, (but artistic sleaze). The aforementioned contributor liked this movie but the low rating suggests of not without explaining their "where is and why" "Personally, I thought there were too many sub-intrigues and not enough in the main story and the relationship of these subordinate characters with the central plot and the development of their characters on the screen.Also a professional film the publisher was badly needed, because some scenes seemed to last much too long, after being well understood, so that the film seemed to be dragging in places, for example, the scene of the dancing transvestite.Krista Nell appears in a fruity scene with a client, but it is also a vignette and I was let expect more from her, from director and script. <br /> <br /> I love the political disadvantage shown in older films (30 years after its creation), for example smoking in offices and the way some characters react to each other at the office! I would suggest a more realistic rating of 4/10 and I will have awarded it as such.
