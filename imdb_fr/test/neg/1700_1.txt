Jason Connery is not an actor; he is the son of an actor. His Macbeth is the worst I have ever seen. Oh yes, he kills King Duncan, but he also kills William Shakespeare. His wife is even worse. Please, give me the version of Polanski on DVD, so that I can forget this monster. Jon Finch, Orson Welles, Laurence Olivier, here are ACTORS!
