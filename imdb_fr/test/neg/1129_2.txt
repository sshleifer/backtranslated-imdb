Obviously, with this film going directly to the DVD, I did not expect much, but this film is so funny that it's amazing. The only part of the film that you will find rather funny will be even before arriving on the island, where Eddie's son is thrown out of the bathroom by a jet of water and voila! Why do they bother at all? The first Christmas holidays with Chevy Chase were brilliant and hilarious. It's not. They rely on jokes about a dog suffering from flatulence and a character called Uncle Nick, about 80 years old and still trying to make his way with beautiful women. When they get close to the island on the boat, the island in the background looks so wrong and Randy Quaid, although funny in the previous movie, is too overrated and seems to give the impression that he makes too much effort to be funny. You were warned!
