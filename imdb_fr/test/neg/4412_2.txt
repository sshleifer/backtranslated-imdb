The aboriginal leader's son is wrongly accused of his father's death. The evil sorcerer orders to execute it. He then returns as a deadly tree (!), Tabanga. Well, what can you say about such a "movie"? If it were to be a horror movie, there was obviously some kind of bad judgment involved. And for a comedy, it's not funny enough yet. I do not know why people make movies like that. I guess you have to be really in a stupid mood to watch it. Or you may want to see the incredible "monstrous" tree that gives a new dimension to "a slow death". Or maybe you want to check out great acting skills by everyone involved. (Mrs. Kilgore!) Or the dialogue and the script, which had been strangely ignored at the Oscars that year. <br /> <br /> "Should not we try psychoanalysis on this tree? Maybe his mother was afraid oaks." 2/10
