This film is a desperate attempt to overcome the failures of the success of Star Wars movies. The film uses recycled images of "Battle Beyond the Sars" which is another Roger Corman Sci-Fi Turd, but at least this one is better than "Battle Beyond the Stars" - there's no real role in this movie (but it's a Roger Corman movie-what were you waiting for) once again, the entire soundtrack was performed on a keyboard / synthesizer, the sound effects are recycled from "Battlestar Galactica" - there There are no special effects, as they were recycled / rearranged space scenes from another movie, the costumes as something of 1981 salvation rescue army release. --ironicaly, the little boy of this movie gives an incredible performance, and he resurfaces to play in the movie "Over the Top" by Sylvester Stallone - I give this film a 3 out of 10 stars
