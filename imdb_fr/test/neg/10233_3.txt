I think my summary says it all. This response from MTV-ish to the classic TV series Candid Camera features a Gen X type (or is it the Gen Y) setting up fake choppers and wearing various hats, wigs and glasses, and putting people into quite strange situations although often not very interesting. Example: Kennedy has a guy who invites his parents to his "wedding". Kennedy is the bride, in a wedding dress and a long wig. The "joke" is that the parents immediately understand that their son is marrying a man who claims to no longer have his "pieces". The problem is that this schtick lasts far too long, obviously to save time. And Kennedy is about as funny as a dead cod in the sun. Candid Camera would have executed three or four scenarios in the time it took Kennedy to get through this one, running, constantly asking, "Do I look big?" I admit that the show was not for me. It was designed for 12-year-old pinheads who think JACKASS is the height of comedy today. So let them laugh. Thank God, the show was short lived.
