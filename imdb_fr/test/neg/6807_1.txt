In a not very successful attempt to take seriously and move on to adult films, Mr. Hughes presents this film about a young married couple. Yes, there are all the clich√©s in the book, stupid and fantastic stuff and all that, but more importantly, it's Elizabeth McGovern. <br /> <br /> Clearly the best actress to ever play in a John Hughes movie, she gives him a weight that elevates the sometimes silly material. Kevin Bacon (and her hair) is very good like her husband, but McGovern steals the movie with his honest, calm moments. The film "teen movie", which worked so well in other Hughes films, falls flat here - like a favorite uncle whose jokes made you laugh when you were 9 years old, but you repeat it at the age of 15 years old and you want him to find new material. But I always come back to McGoverns' performance because it's really moving. Mr. Hughes' most interesting films are of interest to me (Some Kind of Wonderful, Breakfast Club), and when his material comes up against real talent, wonderful things can happen. If only he trusted that, he did not need to get into silly stories.
