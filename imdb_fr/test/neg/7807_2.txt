Yet another recent comedy that shows Hollywood can not even do the basics of making movies that she has been sleeping for decades. If the writer / director had brains, he would have based his film on the character of Stamp, the boss of the tyrant Jack Taylor. When he's in the movie at the beginning, it's not special, but it's slightly promising and sometimes amusing. Once he has left the majority of the film and Kutcher has his "hilarious" adventures with his guest after each boring guest, the film disintegrates completely. <br /> <br /> As a result, what should have been a fair weather becomes an inept stink.
