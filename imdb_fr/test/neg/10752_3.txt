One critic said of those who might not like the film that "it will only be appreciated by the spectators who tire of the film as a diversion". I feel that it is rather unfair to those of us who find it boring. <br /> <br /> I did not get tired or disappointed in the movie or the filmmakers, but I found it tedious and complacent. But then, that's right, I'm not too big in the deep sense. I think that can be of great significance to those who know, you know. <br /> <br /> He is very slow and he spends a lot of time trying to argue his individual arguments, using images, even doing, then. But in such days, it seems possible that a film like this is the kind of thing you encountered in one of those dark and disconcerting stands of modern art galleries, rather than on the screen of a popular movie set.
