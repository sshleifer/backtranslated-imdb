This film was a Mexican horror film from the late '60s. It's not so good, but it's not that bad either. There is a lot of schlock and it is quite heavily stuffed with nudity and violence, but there was a plot and at least tried to stay there (even if the plot was the same damn inspired by Frankenstein, "do not change the God's domain "b movie rate). There was padding mixed with the women's wrestling, but it was made in Mexico and the wrestling seems to be popular in Mexico. <br /> <br /> The plot is that a doctor wants to save his son, who is dying. leukemia. The other doctors gave no hope to the poor guy, but Dad has the idea of ​​transplanting the heart of a gorilla so that his son saves his life (I do not know, I'm a lawyer, not a doctor). The transplant works, but my little boy ends up becoming a monkey-man who terrorizes naked women and kills everyone who gets in his way. There is also a secondary plot involving a policeman and his girlfriend who is a wrestler (this really did not add much, but if they wanted to add masked wrestlers, here is a good reason to do so). <br /> <br /> The film was rather cheap, but not too bad for a movie of the day. The plot was basically just recycled and there were a few things that were not so well connected. However, this movie is quite funny in its own way (I do not know why, maybe because it's a Mexican horror movie and it stands out in my normal bad movie scheme). I guess it may be because it's a mix of very strange things. <br /> <br /> Look at it if you like nerdy foreign films, nudity and struggles.
