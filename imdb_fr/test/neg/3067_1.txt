OUCH, not really need to say anything else. This film actually made me think of suicide. As a big fan of the wonderful genre of zombie movies, I thought it was perhaps the worst attempt I ever made. The film never seemed to go anywhere else! What was the purpose of all this, I feel desperate and lost. Hell was so bad that I can not even justify hitting him. I'm just going to hang myself in the closet. OK now, I tried to submit my comment, but the server only accepts comments of ten lines or more. So here you go ... Bad, horrible, not close enough gore. NO TITS !!!!!! How can you have a Zombie movie without tits? In fact, the main female role was a damn curtain and the only reason I watched the film in its entirety was perhaps by chance to get a glimpse. NOPE! Of course, there was a line that deserves to be mentioned, a line that I can not wait to use myself one day (when I feel the need to be hit on the face) "This pig is not going to smoke alone "This film is bad, too bad.
