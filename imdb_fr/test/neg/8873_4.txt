The actors are so bland that it is almost impossible to distinguish them (Pauline Kael said about this movie: "The actors have names, but they are really anonymous"), and the special effects are really bad. They simulate weightlessness with people hanging from cables and recycling the trick that allowed Fred Astaire to dance to the ceiling in "Royal Wedding" (but none of these guys move enough to make it convincing). <br /> <br /> The weak point of the film is that one of the characters, a tycoon on the plane, is trying to convince another "industry giant" to come with him to a consortium One shows them a caricature of Woody Woodpecker that explains the operation of a 2nd year rocket! (And to say that Robert Heinlein worked on the scenario ...) <br /> <br /> The only advantage is that the production scenery manages to communicate a kind of sensitivity "Amazing Stories", and even that it is did much better in the following film by the producer (George Pal) "When Worlds Collide", which has the same bad acting but is much more fun. However, Pal's best science fiction movie must be "The Time Machine".
