Supposedly, director William Shatner had a much more "dark" film in mind when it came to "Star Trek V: The Last Frontier", but Paramount costumes are looking at the huge box office receipts taken by his predecessor filled humor insisted that the new movie has a lot of laugh too. So, what we're getting is probably the weakest and most wacky of the six Star Trek movies with the original cast. There are a lot of bad ideas, as well as some good ideas, and if you are charitable, you can watch "The Final Frontier" in the same way you would for an episode of the TV series. On the plus side, Laurence Luckenbill is an excellent actor and gives one of Star Trek's best-known "guest star" shows, big or small, ranking high with William Windom's Commodore Decker. His portrayal of Sybok, Spock's half-brother, constantly raises the film when it threatens to sink, which happens too often. Charles Cooper is as good as old old General Klingon Korrd; Too bad his role is not as big as he is. If the story about Shatner's intentions is true, I owe him an apology, because I was ready to blame his idiots incessantly and his action scenes unconvincing. The reason is that I always thought that Shatner was the least listener of all that makes Star Trek work and what makes him special for his fans. After reading his memoirs on Trek, it is very obvious to me that he sees the show as another action and adventure series that has just presented a science fiction framework. He preferred Gene Coon's vision to that of Gene Roddenberry; Coon was known for his work on the popular western series "The Wild Wild West". Shatner also mentioned that one of his favorite episodes of Star Trek was "A Piece of Action," a silly episode of the second season co-written by Coon. Could Shatner not follow his instincts and produce an action-packed film with a lot of ironic humor? Well, someone did it, because that's what "The Final Frontier" ended up being. Shatner himself definitely returns to form The Great Ham and, as Leonard Maltin points out, the film suffers from a bad case of "Cutes". In the opening scene of Yosemite National Park, it's hard to say what's worse, super-nerdy special effects or heartbreaking dialogue. "Wrath of Khan" has been the subject of much malfunctioning of the equipment of the company and the fifth film of Trek has thus thrown to the ground. The same goes for the idea of ​​a "skeleton crew". A new development is an apparent love affair between Scotty and Uhura and suffice it to say that one does not exactly feel the flames of the passion that burns between the two. This is a useless side plot and adds nothing. The culminating scene where "God" is encountered does not add much either; One may wonder if it was a good idea or not, but the scene itself does not make much sense. (The creature's abilities 'God' seem to vary depending on what is needed at the moment.) About half of this is a tired retreat from the climax of 'Spock's Quest'. Leonard Nimoy manages to preserve the integrity of Spock, even by uttering lines as dubious as Spock, such as "Master yourself, Doctor." And DeForest Kelley, as usual, surpasses Shatner and Nimoy; he really became an actor in the latest Trek movies. So this Trek outing is not that great, it just is not very good. Before passing the relay to the "next generation", there had to be an original casting film, and it was much better suited to the task than "Star Trek V: The Ultimate Frontier".
