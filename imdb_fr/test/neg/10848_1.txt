do not buy this movie for the value of comedy as I did, I did not find it a little funny, but if f ****** miserable and lame it's amazing. I gave it to a friend for Christmas, which was pretty funny (on my side). I recently heard that he looked at her and told me how black I am. <br /> <br /> There's nothing more frustrating than I'm watching an over-lit, dramatic and poorly filmed scene, in which the camera sits on a tripod and does not move ... the work of the movie is really pathetic, and I can only say WHAT WATCH THIS MOVIE !!!! !!!!!!!
