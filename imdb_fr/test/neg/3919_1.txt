Square pigs as a way to efficiently use the cargo space are the one and only smart moment of "Space Truckers". Believe it or not, Dennis Hopper has done worse, see "The American Way", but this film is at the top of the scale "cream shit". I think the best way to describe the viewing experience is that "Space Truckers" will not please anyone. Too many cartoons, to be taken seriously, an almost total lack of humor and a poor development of the characters virtually ensure disappointment. The crowd of beer and popcorn could tolerate a single visit, but all others were warned to avoid "Space Truckers" for all the reasons mentioned above. - MERK
