Well, that's the Hollywood standard that you can see happen a mile away. It's nice partly but so predictable. I must admit that I did not really like it, but I'm pretty hard to please and many of my friends loved it. <br /> <br /> It's nice enough and the actors give good performances. It's a beautiful backdrop and the treat for the eyes is pretty good. But the irritating, predictable, unoriginal and really dull scenario holds the film. Personally, I can think of better ways to spend a few hours of my life. <br /> <br /> The kind of chicks 'films have bad press, but there are very good girls' movies; it's not one of them.
