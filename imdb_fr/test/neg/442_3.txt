I was a fan of the movie AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON and so I was curious to know if a 16-year-old sequel could be made with the broadcast in French and local of major, secondary and support characters. Tonight, I watched the "edited for FOX Network" version which was a kind of curious hybrid of several hyperactive suites. Writers and directors pay tribute to some key concepts of the plot: a tourist is bitten by a wolf, the moon is full, a boy meets a girl, a boy becomes a beast, the boy dies of a heroic death after the help of a ghost victim. For me, the strangest aspect of this "formula" of the special effect "teenage horror" has been to stage the love interest of teachers of the TV comedy "ED" as a senseless victim of the werewolf scripted lines they handed him. I have not seen another horror movie that this movie is "sequencing" (a vampire movie called BLADE), but I suppose parts of its plot must explain how ugly werewolves are threatening the "good" pair of werewolves for a long part of the movie. There is also a final conflict in a Paris metro train at SPEED. This 1997 studio product is a strange hybrid of a film since considerable technical effects are displayed for scary purposes, but the original terrors of the original have been completely undermined, in my opinion. A strange rewrite of the legend of the werewolf and the "mythology of the film"!?! My suggestion to those who are considering this in the video store - opt for an "upscale" classic thriller instead: Alfred Hitchcock's PSYCHO!
