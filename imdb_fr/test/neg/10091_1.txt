Maybe it was the fact that I saw Spider-man the day before Duces Wild, but I do not think there can be any excuse for this movie to be as bad as it was. The cast was there to do it, but it seemed that once they ended up with a decent cast, they had to try to get them into the movie. The only problem was that they did not fit. I did not like any of the characters and the story was at best incomplete. I left wondering why I had spent my money on this movie.
