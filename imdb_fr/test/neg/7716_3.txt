If you have not seen the first one, you must at least know someone who did it and you must know that it was painful to sit still. There was nothing good to say about it. So, what's different with the second? Why bother to make a sequel to a movie that was miserable? He does not take himself too seriously. He knows it's done for television and does not try to impress with a big or serious dialogue. There are times when he tries to become "serious" or "intense" but these moments are so cheesy that you have to laugh. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, there are more elements of Uwe Boll and any clue than this video game (other than the title of course). Do not go into this movie while waiting for something interesting to mention to your friends, unless they are in a camp, in lame zombie movies, or are interested in making this movie a fun game. to drink. Take two hits each time Ed Quinn's character mentions his dead brother! Take a shot every time a ball would have been better in the head of a zombie instead of pumping three in the chest! etc.
