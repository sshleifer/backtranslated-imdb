A feminist tract in which the viewer believes that: i) wild animals are rarely tamed by singing but instead of attacking, killing and eating (the line that grizzlies only attack if provoked) unless that "provoked" does not mean that they see flesh) ii) homosexuality is both immoral - and its acceptance is almost always associated, throughout history, with signs of dissolution and degradation. 'a society iii) few women are bisexual (in this, almost all women are presented as having no preference for men or women) iv) divorce is much worse than infidelity v) the land is there so that human beings can use, develop and enjoy vi) it is also the responsibility of the mother of an adult son to stay in touch as to son vii) to a mother to raise her son alone is a regrettable and real tragedy for the child viii) idolization of a parent for valid ideals is a good and healthy thing ix) adults continue to take responsibility for their sexual behavior, regardless of their age, and the duty to indulge in such intimate and generous acts as in most intimate and most sacrificed relationships: marriage - trust me, you will not like this movie! This is basically a type of Howard Stern who is brought by a kind of Jane Fonda's wife (think The Electric Horseman). It's ugly because the values, the ideals and the scenario scenario are so damaging. <br /> <br /> I share the other objections about the strange things in writing: a) why would this man lose all his friends - because he refuses to reveal that the death and funeral of his mother prevented him from holding appointments with her? It's a mystery why he keeps saying "it was personal" to angry and disappointed women. HUH? <br /> <br /> b) there is a huge inconsistency (the scriptwriter wants to have it on both sides) telling us that the mother of the protagonist loved the father with everything she had - and later we are told there was only one great love in his life - his lesbian girlfriend. <br /> <br /> c) The underlying legal assumptions are nonsense. We are never told that the executor has the right to reside in the property, but simply that it determines when the title of the sole heir will be acquired and the right to occupy the property. Yet the film suggests that the executor is the legitimate occupier - which is crazy. (Try to think of any executor who uses the property of the deceased before the will legacies are filled - this does not happen). <br /> <br /> d) The assumption throughout this film is that women are also drawn. for men and women - it's just absurd. Thus, we are told: i) that the character of Penelope Ann Miller goes out with other men towards the end of the film - after spending five years with the deceased - and before that in a satisfactory relationship with the protagonist, ii) that the protagonist's housekeeper after being devoted throughout her adult life to her good husband - now frequenting another woman iii) that a girlfriend upset by the protagonist would henceforth want to "try a woman". <br /> <br /> iv) a male transsexual is anxious to date the protagonist v) that the character of Mary Kay Place has naturally looked at the other women at the university ("and they looked back", says she with a silly reversal of the head). <br /> <br /> It's just ridiculous. <br /> <br /> I agree with others on the sound of the DVD (I had to keep it to the maximum of its volume and come back several times to understand the names, the sentences). <br /> <br /> This is a movie of someone who really despises the traditional heroism of any man, hates the idea that a man is needed to raise a child, hates the idea that he there is a necessary link between marriage and sex. The film is meant to preach - and this kind of propaganda of fake messages does not hold water.
