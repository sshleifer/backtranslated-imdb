This is an example of a movie that can have great potential and runs very badly. I'm a fan of kids, thumb suckers and many other so-called teen angst movies, but this one stopped me. > Why is every white child transformed into a thug who loves rap, it becomes one-dimensional. the acting was awful but simple as it consisted mainly of dropping bomb after bomb just a bad movie if you want to see better movies like this: kids thumbs intimidate all <br /> <br /> think that it's better then I recommend one of those is that you would like to see a good "movie for teens" I hope that my comment will be useful to you and I hope you will hear future comments from me
