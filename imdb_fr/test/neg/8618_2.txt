This movie "Vampires: The Turning" is not even worth the 2 out of 10 that I give it. The movie is very predictable from start to finish when our hero kills the leader of the Vampire Slayers. The use of the music in this movie was even bad, it continued to play as if you were expecting something important to happen at any time, although it never happened. The acting game was at best B-Rank ... and the movie was fair, dull. The only reason I give this film a 2 out of 10 is because the story has potential, although it is finally unable to keep its promises. Oh, and did I mention the wardrobe? The wardrobe of this movie was obviously cheap or nonexistent, because our hero and his girlfriend (whom he tries to save throughout the film) wear the same clothes throughout the film. I would suggest this film only if you are really bored and if you do not have a good wall with fresh paint to look dry. ~ Dave, the horror cowboy
