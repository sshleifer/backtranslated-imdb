It could very well be the worst movie I've seen in my life. Normally, I do not watch movies like this, but I was forced to watch it at school. What torment! <br /> <br /> The story is as average and boring as it may be: a boy meets a girl on the Spanish coast, a boy and a girl fall in love, but the love between the two seems impossible, and everyone is against their love. At the end of the film, the film becomes a kind of strange kung-fu movie where the guys in white fight the guys in black. Terrible! <br /> <br /> The action is so bad that it makes you laugh. The film dances that I think are supposed to be cool are so simple and laughable that even I can do them! And Georgina Verbaan is perhaps the most irritating person I have ever seen on screen. <br /> <br /> Johan Nijenhuis is about to become Dutchman Ed Wood. His films are so bad that they make you laugh. <br /> <br /> However, Victor LÃ¶w gives a surprisingly good performance and Daan Schuurmans also shows his pleasure. <br /> <br /> So, please, do not worry. "Do not watch this movie, but if you like to watch soap operas, it could be worth your time. <br /> <br /> Yuk! <br /> <br /> 2/10
