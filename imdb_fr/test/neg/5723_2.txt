Recap: Since Queen Warrior Gedren raised and slaughtered most of Sonja's family, she trained in the art of saber fighting. Now, Gedren has taken a very powerful talisman, which threatens to destroy the world if it is not destroyed, thus killing Sonja's sister. Now, Sonja wants to take revenge and save the world. On the way, she meets Kalidor, the prince of Tarn children and his bodyguard, Falcon, very similar to Conan (but not Conan, no!). At first, Sonja refuses any help, but is then forced to accept it. Together, they will save the world. <br /> <br /> Comments: When you watch a movie like this, you think it's the story that it's the best part of this movie, the movie has big problems. Because 1) a movie like this should tap into good swordfights and good effects, and 2) the story is really, really bad. It's simple, simple and does not really offer anything in terms of character development or even suspense. It's predictable and boring, and the obvious couple, Sonja and Kalidor, have no chemistry. And the kid is just annoying. And most scenes are so long that they become boring. Although the film is not very long, it does not have enough material to fill its time. And let's go back to point 1). The fights are slow, without history and very difficult. It clearly shows that most fighters clearly blocking their opponents' shots far ahead of their opponents have even begun to hit. In all honesty, I believe that most children, fighting with sticks, create more exciting battles by playing knights than this movie. All in all, this is a very bad spin-off, which should be avoided by anyone who liked Conan movies. <br /> <br /> 2/10
