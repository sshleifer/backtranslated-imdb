This series reminds me of an episode of "The Simpsons", where Smithers had just been fired by Mr. Burns and forced to live a miserable life out of work. He was just drinking and watching Comedy Central. This implied that Comedy Central was a pathetic television channel for miserable people who had nothing left to occupy their time. "Mind of Mencia" is slightly better than most of Comedy Central's programs, but it's still an example of why this channel is a poor quality filling medium for people with no life. <br /> <br /> To tell the truth, Mencia is a competent humorist who throws banal and soft ethnic jokes on bland stereotypes of people according to their race, their economic status or their combination. two out of three of these features. If you've heard any of these jokes from one of your friends in a bar or at work, believe me, you've heard what's called comedy in "Mind of Mencia." Carlos also tries to make fun of the news, but lacks creativity and originality. That does not mean that Carlos is a deluge all the time. I found some of his amusing sketches, like his rap video portrait as an oil sheik. If you find a bland and banal comedy in your alley, you will probably enjoy "Mind of Mencia". For people who are tired of repetitive comedians, pedestrians trotting in the same old jokes, stay away.
