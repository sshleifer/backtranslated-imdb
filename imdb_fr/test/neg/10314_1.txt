The DVD release of this movie hopes you will buy this movie on the name and face of Sandra Bullock. His picture (years after this film) is essentially the cover ... and the back cover ... and the inner sleeve ... the same picture. His name is highlighted on the cover, the 4 edges and the disc itself. She is the first name in the list of stars. His biography is printed inside the case. This film must revolve around his character, right? FALSE! This is her first film and she plays a minor role. After watching the movie, each role seems to be a minor one. The dog character actually displays a certain personality. Less than an hour after watching it, I do not even remember the names of many characters. <br /> <br /> Maybe if I looked at it a few times, I could really understand the plot, but I do not know it I think it would be worth it. <br /> <br /> Oh, wait, I remembered a little funny! Fans of shoot-em-up video games will have a kick from the "cam doom". Looks like a first person shooter. Hands and pistol pointing in front of the camera. <br /> <br /> I'm not usually a film critic, but it's maybe the worst film I've ever seen. I was still expecting silhouettes to cross the screen, sit down and start making fun of it. <br /> <br /> I'm just happy that the money we spent for this (used) went to a charity.
