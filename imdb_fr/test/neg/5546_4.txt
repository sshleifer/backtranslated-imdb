This sequel to "In the heat of the night" will inevitably suffer from comparisons with its infinitely better predecessor. Instead of resembling a theatrical film published for television, "Mister Tibbs" is strangely similar to a telefilm edited for theatrical release, with a grainy photograph, nerdy opening titles and plywood-like decorations. The sequence of the murder has a glaring continuity error: the camera shows two hands that choke the girl, then a hand seeking a statuette, then another shot of the girl strangled with both hands, and finally the downward statuette for the fatal blow. Solving the case should be easy: find the only guy with three hands! But the mediocre production values ​​can not completely overshadow the film's considerable merits: namely Sidney Poitier's performance as a cool detective determined to follow the evidence wherever they could drive, even if they involve a friend. Martin Landau is also convincing as a militant-preacher-activist doubly suspected of having brutally murdered his girlfriend prostitute. In addition to being haunted by the affair, Tibbs is in conflict over his personal life, but race issues and the barely concealed meaning of Tibbs' social indignation are missing here. The same goes for the complex mystery of the murder that made "In the heat of the night" so convincing.
