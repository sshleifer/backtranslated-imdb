I watched the first two nights before coming to IMDb looking for information about the actors. I saw the 9+ rating that surprised me because I was not so impressed by what I had seen. (For reference, I believe Lonesome Dove was the best Western TV of all time, I grew up next to the MGM bands in Culver City in the 1950s and I respect the western genre.) <br /> <I saw the first complimentary review and decided to read "more". I found several reviews with 1 or 2 stars that summarized my feelings about the lack of development of the character, a mediocre edition, the feeling of having been shot on the back Universal (MGM's having disappeared for a long time) and the general impression that this was not the case. I will get closer to changing my feelings about LD. My impression is that the overwhelming vote of those who chose to write was "less than 4.0". <br /> <br /> This led me to wonder about the process that gives a rating of 9+. If people who give the 10 and 9 do not take the time to justify their vote, is the ballot box stuffed by people motivated by money? For a long time, I have been using IMDb as a unique tool for movie projection. Now, I'm not so sure.
