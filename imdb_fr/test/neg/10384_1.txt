While watching BLACKWATER VALLEY EXORCISM, I encountered scenarios and dialogues so incredibly bad that I was convinced that it was supposed to be a comedy. Some dialogue pieces worthy of a belly laugh: "I ate a rabbit." "I told you she was possessed!" "Are you telling me that the devil is in my daughter ?!" <br /> <br /> There are many more, but you have to discover them yourself - if you dare. <br /> <br /> the story unfolds in all sorts of directions and things happen that probably should not and everyone seems to be a pervert or a psychopath (even the priest). And I did not even get to the bad actor. The most remarkable in this area is the guy playing Isabelle's father. The director had to tell him to act as if he had a stick in his @ $$ because that is the general impression that one has. <br /> <br /> I really do not want to remove anyone from BLACKWATER VALLEY EXORCISM because there's a lot of fun to have ... for all the wrong reasons, but if you're looking for a movie of decent horror that makes sense and scares ... well, do not run.
