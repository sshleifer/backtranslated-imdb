I liked Half-Life. I am still his fan. It was scary, intelligent and challenging. I do not tell any news, it's one of the best FPS ever made. Maybe I'm too much fan of Half-Life but the so-called Half-Life 2 is not Half-Life 2. <br /> <br /> And I have a question: this is it the next chapter of Half-Life? Maybe the creators -Valve- think so, but not me. Where are the intelligent enemies? Where is the scary atmosphere? Nowhere. I think they wanted to do a little bit different from Half-Life (instead of another search station story), but they did not just make it a very different one, they created something that was to do with Half-Life, such as with Quake. Condemn. The whole game is so disgraceful and unreal that it is almost abandoned. <br /> <br /> Although the physics is really good and there are some good levels to play, the idea of ​​creating a revolutionary gameplay based on physics has completely failed. When you get the Gravity-gun, which can move objects, you can expect with the right to use it as a weapon - which would upset the schematic FPS game. The truth is that you can not use Gravity-gun as a real weapon. Why? Because the best you can do is throw crates and barrels that do not do a lot of damage. If you want to keep an object in front of you to protect it, it can fall about 3 shots. If you want to launch an explosive cannon at your enemy, it can explode with your own "hand". The gravity gun does not work like a weapon. The best use is to solve physical puzzles. I ask Valve: Why? The truth is that you have to use your schematic and boring FPS weapons all the way through (except for the last level). Weapons are not what made the original half-life a classic. If Gravity-gun was still like the last level - a real weapon - I'd admire what Valve did. But not that. It's disappointing. <br /> <br /> So, if you want Half-Life, you will look in the wrong place. You may like it, but I repeat: everything is there, but not Half-Life and not even a faithful follow-up. This is the biggest disappointment of all time. Valve showed that he could also play hideous games. They did it.
