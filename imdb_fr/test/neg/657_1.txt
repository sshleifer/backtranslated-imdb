According to Hollywood standards, this film was shot and edited like Hollywood movies. So it looked like a movie you could have released from a big production studio in Hollywood. This is where everything close to Hollywood standards ends. It was the worst movie I have ever seen in my life! I'm not kidding. The story was so incredibly stupid and unrealistic that I could not contain my laughter at the movies throughout the viewing of this movie. I know what you're saying, "It's a horror movie, it's not supposed to have a good story, it's supposed to scare you." Well, let me tell you one thing, the movie is not even scary. It's too full of stupid pieces that cancel the little suspense that could have been. The acting was also horrible, as was the fear of the murderer, who you constantly see through flashbacks locked in a cage jerking off. Throughout the film, I feel like watching something that was thought, written, produced and directed by a high school student who watches too much pornography. Please, do not see this movie, spend your â‚¬ 8.50 for something else, like a snow cone, which is worth much more.
