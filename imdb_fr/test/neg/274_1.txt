I did not plan to watch O12 because I did not like it too much. I thought O11 was a nice but slightly boring bank robber film with a sensational arsenal of stars. Anyway, I was led to watch O12 one night and I regretted it a lot. The plot is not only boring but also insane. Honestly, I do not even know what it was. I left the movie after three quarters and had a coffee with another girl who did not like it. I can tell you a lot more pleasure. But even the guys who stayed until the end later told me that the plot continued to be terrible and useless. My advice: do not look. Go watch Team America (hilarious btw ;-)) and forget Ocean's Twelve. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the most boring and insane peace on the screen in years.
