I watched this movie so you do not have to do it! I have a lot of respect for Kris Kristofferson, but what was he thinking about? He did it for the scales? <br /> <br /> At least the title of the film puts into practice the truth in advertising, as people and objects regularly disappear throughout the film, which adds to the confusion. Kristofferson mentions in his commentary that although he was not sure that Genevieve Bujold's character really existed. It does not bode well for the viewer to follow the story! <br /> <br /> The "making of" was much more interesting than the film itself. He explores the difficulty of concocting funds for an independent film, even though the film is being shot. <br /> <br /> Its merit is that this film is nice to watch and does not look like a movie made with slightly more than 1M. Too bad the money was not spent on a better project.
