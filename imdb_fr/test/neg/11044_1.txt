This film was one of the longest experiences of my life watching movies. Although I appreciate how the director, Chan-wook Park, handled the revenge, the move as a whole was terrible. Oldboy only has 1 hour and 55 minutes, but it takes at least 3 1/2 hours to tell this story. I will say that the dubbing in English went very well and that the film was easily understandable. I felt that some scenes were unnecessarily long and much of the dialogue was repeated. Also, if you have an aversion to annoying voices, avoid hearing Hye-jeong Kang (she plays Mi-do). If you are looking for a film that kills time and makes you feel morally superior to others, then look. If you do not want to watch a film full of incest, bad dialogues, useless battle scenes, scenes of gross torture and confusing flashbacks, this movie does not suit you.
