DANGER: Watch out for falling spoilers ... <br /> <br /> My boy, was it a bad movie? I know they were looking for a "true love conquers all," but just about all this conquered film was about 3 hours (which was more like 9) of my afternoon, which I will never find again. The film is about two young lovers, Kai and Gerta, who live in a remote city, in a fantastic world. Kai is the mistreated groom at a hotel owned by Gerta's father. At first, Gerta ignores Kai's advances, but she ends up warming him to the disgust of the father of (you guessed it!). As if this obstacle was not enough to be overcome, a nasty snow queen shoots a burst of glass into Kai's eye and becomes a nasty person who treats Gerta badly. Kai is finally taken to the Frozen Fortress (as in the hotel just covered with ice, because the good people of Hallmark like to do everything) and Gerta's mission is to recover Kai. Along the way, she meets the other 3 seasons that hurt in their own way, but Gerta escapes them with the help of boring and forgettable characters she meets on the way. (All the while, you will want to turn it off, but you will not be able to force it in. This is probably the most devilish and effective spell cast by the Snow Queen). Anyway, I'll save you the end, because all you can think in your head now is probably better than the way they ended it. So, in conclusion, the Snow Queen is an incredibly boring movie, which keeps fancy fans away.
