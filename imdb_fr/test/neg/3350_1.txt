I received a copy of this film from a friend for my 21 years, which he had obviously picked up for 99 cents in a video vat at a reduced price. <br /> <br /> I've never been so frustrated when I watched a movie. tedious, Adam West was wasted (literally) and, in retrospect, I do not remember anything. My lack of joy grew so much that we broke the cassette and suspended the cassette in the living room, once the credits had expired. Just for good measure, we set fire to the blanket.
