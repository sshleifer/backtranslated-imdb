Child's Play is doing a new kind of horror, THE KILLER DOLLS, Some of these movies do not have a lot of money to do it but I think the only movie that is shadowing Chucky is this.Ok c is a direct product on video or directly on TV but Pinocchio is not real and the killer is the little girl.The imagination of children is too big and this movie plays with. The roles are good and Candance Mckenzie is great. >
