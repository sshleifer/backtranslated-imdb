Wow, what exciting visual effects. I also liked the costumes and the works of art, the circus and the ethereal atmosphere of the film were sublime. The viewer just needed to be concerned about the fate of our protagonist. As she is trapped in her imagination, there is never danger, unlike the David Lynch films that haunt each time. It also draws attention to the age group for which this film is intended. Who is he talking to? <br /> <br /> It is obvious that Mirrormask will make comparisons with Labyrinth on the theme of fantasy and fantasy, but unfortunately, he is not close to delivering the same essence of Henson. The theme of the sick mother is never fully explained and certainly not something that is close to your heart while licking your eyes. <br /> <br /> This is not terribly horrible in Cell, nor as attractive as Labyrinth - a well-forgotten fantasy.
