To judge a film only for the landscapes, the sets, the costumes ... it is not correct, it misses the heart: THE STORY <br /> <br /> A film must tell something, tell a story , something that impresses you. Yes, the sea, the cliffs, the clear water and all the rest I liked, but ... There is the plot? <br /> <br /> These are more interesting movies with crazy people, such as: FLIGHT OVER THE CUCKOO "S NEST ... etc ... etc ... This is a crazy woman who is more attached to dogs than her children or her husband, just a clear psychiatric case, nothing extraordinary.But a waste of time, unfortunately, there is all this rage coming from the smell of fish?
