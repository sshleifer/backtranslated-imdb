Given the praise expressed by this film, I must assume again the role of the poop in the punch, as said Lowell Weicker: I scratch my head in front of the number of glowing comments. "The African queen" it is not. The flavor of the period is wonderful, yes. The acting is good, but no actor, no matter how big, can bring to life the seemingly endless stream of perfectly tedious and insignificant conversations at a party or table, and I do not care what point Joyce's text is pulled. Imagine spending an hour and a half like a fly on the wall during a Christmas dinner for a group of uninteresting people (it's hard for me to understand that this is a family, as suggested a person) and you must listen to their mundane chat. and you have the essential experience of this film. Absolutely nothing happens. And nothing important is said, but it is said to an endless length. As I said, the popularity of this film is a mystery to me. Speaking of mysteries, watch them rather than that.
