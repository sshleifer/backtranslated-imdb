***** I reveal two "twists" at the end of the film. Do not read if you want to watch this movie for some reason ***** <br /> <br /> Oh my God, it's bad. And for some reason, Sean Bean, one of the biggest actors today, has sold his soul and appears there. The only consolation is that the writers must have understood that someone as pathetic as Steve Guttenberg could never in his life aspire to kill someone as cool as Sean Bean. Instead, he was killed in what must have seemed like a wonderful turn at the end, by the brave guy who was to be killed by Bean, but who was actually his boss and simulated his own death. Do not worry. I did not ruin anything for you. The acting game itself is spectacularly appalling, with the gaze of the patented hard man of "Guttenberg" "Look-at-me-can-shoot-a-Chuck-Norris-face" dominating most of the two hours of hell on earth. In addition to a plot that I could have written while being tortured and suspended upside down with both hands cut, there is also a completely absurd critical error in the fact that a moment, the virus s will escape if he makes a mistake, While another moment, Steve Guttenberg courageously runs with, throws, catches and hits, generally abusing this "virus" that looks like a collection of those little balls of soap that you put in your bath. My last word? If you're depressed suicidal and want to laugh humanly at something that should be a bad comedy but the worst is not, write it the next time it's on channel 5 at midnight, then burn it when you realize I'm telling the truth.
