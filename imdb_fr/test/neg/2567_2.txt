Dr. Steven Segal saves the world from a deadly virus epidemic. This film seems to me to be a serious crazy that has become an unexpected classic of the camp (the best). Memorable lines include "Knowledge is like a deer, hunt it and it will escape you" and "Drink this, it will make you feel better." It's so sublime: they could not have made things worse by trying. <br /> <br /> Segal tries to convince you that he is 1. sensitive - saving a wounded pony; 2. a good father - by a saccharine cooking scene for his daughter; 3. a scientist - looking at a specter; 4. in tune with nature - using homeopathic remedies; 5. politically correct and multicultural - having Indian friends; 6. an iconoclast - by opening a rural practice after a previous life in a national research laboratory; and 7. an action hero - being really big but still fighting. ROTFL. <br /> <br /> It's nice to see it as a Saturday night movie, with friends, preferably (but not necessarily!) drunk.
