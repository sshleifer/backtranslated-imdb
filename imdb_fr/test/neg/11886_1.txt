This film tells the true story of escaped black slaves who found their own common on top of a mountain as free men in Brazil in the seventeenth century. The story is interesting and uplifting. However, this film - as a film - is terrible. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is not period music or tribal music. It's Afro-Brazilian pop music from the early 1980s. The battle scenes unfold to the sound of pop cheesy rhythms that are best left to disco or drama bad cops. True, the lyrics are folk tales of heroism of slaves. The special effects are absurd. Rather than invoking the mysticism of African religion and atavistic beliefs, they only make the film cheaper. They are completely unbelievable and I do not just talk about likelihood. <br /> <br /> The life in the commune of Palmares could not have been as it is described in the film. As the film shows, this society is made up of a kibbutz and an afro-pop festival. In addition, it is almost embarrassing to see the director playing black clichés as talented singers and dancers who simply want to be happy. He describes everyday life as a series of dance evenings where freed slaves paint bright colors and whirl to the sound of pop music of the 80s. On the other hand, they have an abundance of beautiful food, but the viewer sees virtually no work in progress. The king sighs against private property in a disconcerting and clichéd way. When a man complains that people take the vegetables he has grown over the months, the king says, "What comes from the earth belongs to everyone, as the land belongs to no one. need food, they have the right to take yours. "<br /> <br /> I'm happy to hear about this episode of the story, but I'm relieved to see that a movie with a production, and that exchanges on stereotypes as worn out would probably not be realized today.
