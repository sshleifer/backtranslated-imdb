I do not find this show funny at all. I actually think it's way worse than any other Disney Channel sit-com right now. Charlotte Arnold is an interesting choice to play Sadie because she can not play. The jokes of this series are terribly funny, and it's even worse when the only member of the cast that has a little (and I mean a little) acting talent is Justin Bradley, Sadie's brother, Hal . Jasmine Richards and Michael D'Ascenzo describe Sadie's friends. There are really stupid and just terrible actors. Two words that can really describe this show is terribly corny. It's cheesy humor that only little girls find funny because their brain has not developed yet. Now, I explained my hatred for acting and horrible humor, what's next? The show principle is a stupid idea. She changed again (not so scientific as Ben-loving) and suddenly no one recognizes her? It's stupid. In summary, I hate this series, but little girls who do not have a funny concept will appreciate it, so I guess that's what they're looking for above quality. Although I can say as much as, the first season is clearly better than the second. <br /> <br /> LOWER RESULT: NEVER LOOK AT IT. <br /> <br /> My note: Bad show. TV G. 30 minutes
