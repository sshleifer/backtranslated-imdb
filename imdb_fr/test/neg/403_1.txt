It's one of those movies you watch because it's bad. Such a movie you just watch to see his shitty craft work. Supposedly a horror, I can not imagine how much someone can fear a clay microbe, especially a translucent virus in which we can see the actor's legs behind him. <br /> <br /> Even without a budget, a little attention to detail and even an attempt to make this film credible would have been a distraction, as they should have replaced all the actors and the whole story . If I did not have to laugh while playing, I would have stopped after 10 minutes and I would put a quality program like Spunge Bob Square Pants (HAR HAR HAR). <br /> <br /> I highly recommend it. that Brett Piper gets with Quintin Terrantino and really pumps some excrement. <br /> <br /> :)
