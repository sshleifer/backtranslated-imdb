If you are interested in bad movies to witness bad movies, bad acting, bad production, etc..aka Mystery Science Theater 3000 quality ... you'll love Pacific Inferno. Jim Brown will always be remembered as one of the greatest football players ever to play the game. As an actor, he will always be remembered as one of the greatest football players ever to play. I do not know who Rolf Bayer was ... but I hope he was 15 or 16 years old when he directed that, maybe he was the next Spielberg to be. because if he was an adult man directing that ... at 15 or 15 years old 16 could have done better .... The base or the plot of the film probably had a historical merit and maybe even a true truth ... but the film itself may well be one of the worst movies in the history of American cinema ... I was always waiting for Lee Marvin, William Holden or Charles Bronson to make a jump to save the "face" that remained of this film. I would have loved to be on the red carpet, the gala of the black tie for the opening in Hollywood when this film was watched ... because this film had to please many spectators ... it is in the fire of DVDs now .... look for it for entertainment ... this movie is so bad that it's too good to let it go ...
