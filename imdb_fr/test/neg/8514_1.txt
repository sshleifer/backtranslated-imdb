When a friend and I saw this in the latest versions, we decided to get it despite the fact that none of us had heard about it before. We both like Costas Mandylor and there was James Coburn, so we thought it could not be that bad. We were wrong. It was. It was so bad. No actor or actress could have made this film worthy of being seen. It was like taking Titanic, The Poseidon Adventure and a movie about the nuclear bomb and trying to cut everything and stick together. <br /> <br /> I must admit that there were some small laughs. I laughed when the chef asked Alan (Costas Mandylor) if he is a "cat sailor". The other laughs of this film have nothing to do with writing. I would love to know how the people who make this film thought that a cruise ship could be overturned and remain stable. This is not a tip or anything. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for something to watch for Costas Mandylor, James Coburn or for the rest of the cast, continue. Find something good they did.
