AVP2 is a horrible movie. The dialogue was irrelevant, the acting was pathetic, it had virtually no scenario and you can not really know what the heck is going on half the time because of continuity errors and holes in the plot. ! You will love it anyway. Because it pushes the boundaries of blood, violence, death, destruction and chaos. They even kill children, newborns and unborn children in this movie You'll sit there thinking "Oh my God, it's disgusting". And they will surprise you by killing the "sexy girl who always manages to stay alive" when the predator and the aliens fight in the hospital. <br /> <br /> It's as if the film industry said: "We know that what we did in the first Alien Vs. Predator movie was bad, so we're doing it again but this time, we get the help of psychopaths with an overflowing imagination "stupid and unreasonable, useless, but you'll think about it a moment after seeing it.
