The curse of the wolf begins as the reluctant werewolf Dakota (Renee Porada) manages to escape from her "bag" and goes to the city where, six months later, she works with a veterinarian. The rest of the Dakota group is unhappy and wants to get her back, their leader Michael (Todd Humes) says she will come back to them but the big werewolf Franklin (Brian Heffron) picks up his scent and the group decides to force him and retrieve it. using his affections for his human friends, including his boyfriend Danny (Dennis Carver). Can Dakota save Danny and finally get rid of his Werewolf pursuers? I doubt that you care ... <br /> <br /> Produced by the executive, written and directed by Len Kabasinski who also played a fairly important role in the film. I dreaded watching Curse of the Wolf since Kabasinski was the man behind Swamp Zombies (2005), which is surely one of the worst films ever made. Unfortunately, my worst fears have been confirmed and it must be said that Curse of the Wolf is a really horrible film in every way, both conceptually and technically. Curse of the Wolf is the kind of film where the budget dictates what's happening and the scenario rather than the budget scenario. You have the impression that everything was designed and designed to take advantage of the few sets and actors they had, you can almost imagine that the creators say we have a few actors, basic equipment and a few places, let us so make a horror film around them. The story is awful (Michael finds Dakota's location looking at a big dog that two women are walking around), the characters are awful (a fat werewolf guy who fills a lot), the dialogue is awful (just about all them and there is never any motivation for anything happening (why is the group so desperate to find Dakota?), people do seemingly random things and since the director Kabasinski has a training of martial arts, he insists to insert a lot of random things ... martial arts fighting sequences in the plot.Will not offend you, this is a horror movie and not a martial art, is not it In fact, apart from the presence of a few werewolves, you'd be hard-pressed to describe Curse of the Wolf as anything that looks like a horror movie - after almost two hours, you get the impression that it lasts forever and that it's so slow and so easy that it's just not funny. <br /> <br /> The director Kabasinski obviously worked with a small budget, but to make such a film should be a crime. There is no continuity between shots, the fight scenes are awful and are so poorly organized that it's wrong and sometimes it's impossible to follow what's happening because of jerky editing and shooting angles mediocre or because it is sometimes so dark that you are literally I can not see anything. Seriously, there are moments in Curse of the Wolf where the screen is totally black and you do not see anything, I hate to have to look through it while watching it on a blurred low resolution VHS. The sound is awful too, you can hear the wind and the breeze against the microphone! There are also many other unpleasant and unwanted ambient sounds in each scene. Did the production actually have lighting equipment during manufacture? It is not like that. The special effects consist mainly of werewolf masks that look like the kind of things that Halloween stores sell for kids. Basically, they look awful. <br /> <br /> Technically, the curse of the wolf is as terrible as they come, I 'I'm sorry because I know the budget was low, but it's really awful to sit down and try to entertain. It's a movie quality of a high school student, I'm sorry if it sounds bad, but it's a fact. The role is, well, you can probably guess, so I'll stop here before saying something else negative. I mean, I've done enough already and I'm not really enjoying it. <br /> <br /> The curse of the wolf is terrible, both conceptually and technically, it is a real chore. The curse of the wolf is the kind of film where, even if the time seems to have stopped, it's the kind of film that lasts almost two hours and yet looks like two years. One of the worst movies you or I have the chance to see, certainly a movie to avoid.
