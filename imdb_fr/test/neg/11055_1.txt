THE SCREAMING is a horror film with a very small budget that has been shot on video. It features passable acting, poor lighting, a weak story and some of the worst monster effects I have ever seen. The plot has put a student under pressure to join a cult of its attractive owner. Worship is a parody of Scientology with a book similar to Dianetics. It would have been a funny move for this group without a silly scenario and the low cost of production. The monster effects are awful and the quality of the image gives the impression of watching a home video or a public service announcement. I think anyone who sees this will agree that films must be filmed.
