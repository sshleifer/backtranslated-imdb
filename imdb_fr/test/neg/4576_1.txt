I went to see "Passion of Mind" because I am generally passionate about the genre of romances in alternative reality, that is to say, "Sliding doors", "Me, myself, me", etc. <br /> But this was the worst I've ever seen! I had to force myself to sit across. I did not even stay in the credits, which is unheard of for me. <br /> <br /> The magical realism was completely lacking because Demi Moore was sinister and the lovers she played at two moments were usually the guys who play the bad guys although everyone is a little sexy and attractive. <br /> <br /> There was in fact a psychological explanation provided for the double life, with an unpleasant thrill of the Elektra complex; maybe magic should not be explained for this genre to work. <br /> <br /> (originally written on 28/05/2000)
