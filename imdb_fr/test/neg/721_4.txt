This DVD was lent to me by the director of a movie I play with, in which I play an actor who plays Prospero. Knowing his own style, I did not expect anything that resembles a "classic" interpretation of the text. <br /> <br /> What I found is sometimes striking, sometimes evocative, but often sinuous and tedious. Like most experimental music, I find that in such films, the basic elements of a powerful film are designed, even if they have not found their most useful form in a more coherent format. <br /> <br /> So we have a Caliban who is more of a clown than a threat, and not even Miranda seems to be terribly afraid (which is strange because we know he tried to rape her at less once). A Stefano and Trinculo who are more annoying than funny. A curious young Prospero who looks like Amadeus. And a great loss of character development and conspiracy through creative montages and highly stylized postures. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, I have no problem with the way Ferdanand or Miranda are portrayed. His stunned kidnapping and a little weird innocence are quite appropriate. <br /> <br /> I'm not saying it's a bad film, but an experimental film. One who takes huge risks, but is more geared towards art and film students and not really for those interested in the Tempest itself.
