Dude Where's My Car is perhaps at least a novelty among the few Hollywood movies that seem to have been written, edited, filmed and edited in less than a day. Honestly, I can not believe it was done (or that I allowed my friends to let me sit through it all). The jokes are too stupid and predictable to be "idiotic", and the actors involved do not seem to be able to make any kind of fun if the script had actually provided it. Curiously, unlike most blind and stupid comedies, this movie actually has a plot TOO FALL - every scene seems to present a new, dumb and uninteresting secondary plot. Of course, they were obviously stupid, but it does not work at any level ... There is one aspect of this film that I appreciated: Donkeylips of the old Nickalodean series "Salute Ton Shorts" plays a very small role . This is the role that will make him the next Richard Gere, just look ...
