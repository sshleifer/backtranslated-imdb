This movie is terrible! It starts to disgust and make you laugh, but it fails terribly. The director obviously has no sense of comedy slap stick gore, and the actors do not look like anything I've ever seen - lacking both acting talent and comedy talent. Even their attempt to languish English is really sad, and in fact, the particular Swedish accent on the lower right, in which the incoherent dialogue is spoken, is probably the most amusing and amusing thing in this film. Even the gore is awful and unconvincing. If you fancy a gore comedy, I'd suggest you turn to classic dishes such as the evil dead series or even brain dead if you have to. We all had a good laugh, but it's ridiculous!
