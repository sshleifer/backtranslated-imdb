This is by far the worst film I have ever seen, it has virtually no plot and the plot it has is very scattered. The plot lacks content, suspense and subtitles, because what seems to be a story is in Russian. The set seems to be a room with various effects of light and when you think that something good is about to arrive, you are disappointed by the total lack of acting, theater , suspense, horror, gore, history and mythology. The leadership style was done to death (The Fisheye Camera). It seems that the only action in this film is in the last 10 to 15 minutes and that it is aggravated by the inability of the actors to correctly represent the suspense. The only interesting thing about this movie was that my dog ​​was barking at the surround sound.
