this movie had a lot of potential - it's a beautiful story and can be very scary. but of course, Tim Burton does not really make scary movies, he makes crazy and caricature movies. and I usually like Tim Burton's stuff. but I thought this movie was really weak. the best thing about the movie (and it's worth it to see) was the art direction - the film has an incredible intangible quality. the script was not good. it was boring in some parts and confusing in others, and there was no build of characters. I have never really worried about the fact that people's heads are cut off by a being without a head. I thought johnny depp had something positive about his approach to the character, but since the script was weak, he could not go too far with that - and I was very angry at attempts to slightly accentuate his and that of christina ricci parties. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this is unfortunately not a good movie and is not worth visiting unless the art direction interests you.
