I can imagine why he would like to die after playing in this garbage. The man is incredible, but even Sidney Poitier could not save this morality game boring on racism in the Old West. Joanna Going and he are both fantastic in this film: too bad for the screenplay, the co-stars, the staging and the score could not match those two.
