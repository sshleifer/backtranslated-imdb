My first very disappointing film from BBC / Jane Austen. The tone is off, the costumes are off, the hair is cut, the music comes from outer space, and Robert Hardy, bless him be it, seems really upset to be in such a state. Even part of the cast is off. No, I withdraw that, a good director can make a silk bag with a sow's ear, so to speak. The performances in this film are so exaggerated and melodramatic that it's almost a farce of a Jane Austen story, which is ironic since Northanger Abbey is a kind of homage / sending out the primitive Gothic novel. I wanted to slap the female lead after a while; who made the decision that she should be such a ninny? I had to immediately look at Pride & Prejudice (95) to get rid of my bad taste. Phew!
