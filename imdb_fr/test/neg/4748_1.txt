With this film, I really hoped that the idea was to compensate for the mutual inaptitude of the first AVP, and yet, to my horror: Requiem is much worse than I could have imagined. <br /> <br /> My hopes were at the beginning of the movie inside the Predator ship, and I almost breathed a sigh of relief when we finally saw Predator's home world (a disposable digital matte board, but still nice to see it at last) and of course, humans (if such badly written characters can be designated as such) are introduced ... <br /> <br /> One has to wonder why it seems impossible for Fox to make a good movie from Aliens and Predators. At the very least, the supposed filmmakers could have done their homework. <br /> <br /> The characters are configured in the same way as we expected the worst Friday, December 13th. The pizza delivery scene was grumpy, like all the other character interaction scenes that followed. Bimbos and non-actors do not make a REAL movie, they make a cheap movie, and Alien 1-3 and Predator movies were good because they were produced above the concept (remember that the 1st Alien is a movie "B" The Strause brothers really missed an opportunity that could have been rectified simply by knowing their Alien + Predator roots: in the Alien and Predator movies, we meet characters belonging to a larger group (Alien : Refinery workers, Aliens: Marines, Alien 3: Convicts and in Predator movies, we usually track the main role of a unit: Predator, Arnold - Special Forces, Predator 2: Danny Glover, Police) and it's easy to see where the filmmakers of both groups started to make mistakes: in Alien Resurrection, we have pirates ... or something, AVP, we have ... explorers? ... with guns ?? and of course, in AVP-R, we have s slasher shots for teens. What is there to identify here? In the conceptual idea, the idea of ​​a convict returning to a small town and a veteran returning to the place of war would seem to be a pretext for a hero of the Action genre, but like many things, it would has never been paid. <br /> <br /> The film making is also devoid of rhyme reason. The action makes no sense, but small sequences that build the tiniest levels of tension or arouse the interest to cut just as they become interesting ... driving the audience out of the movie every turn. The action scenes themselves, although they are very crowded in the caravans, are so dark that it is literally impossible to tell what happens during the fight scenes when they finally happen. Basically, the film is hindered on many levels. Bad actors combined with a mediocre direction and an atrocious scenario (which, as a screenwriter, I myself noticed, seemed to hit all the false notes and cliché of the fact that only the least talented writer and no ideas could have scrambled together). , is not even directly focused on video quality nor does it demonstrate a minimum of respect for the established tradition of the previous entries in the series. Why does the Predalien suddenly have the ability to slaughter extraterrestrial embryos in the throat of a pregnant woman to use as an incubator for breasts? More than likely because the brain-dead scenario writer needed a way to have more aliens to fight by the predator (and given the accelerated growth time even more than the first AVP: as quickly as possible. is it necessary to have a small meaningless discussion between the cardboard cutouts on sticks (meaning the supposed characters) to replace the actual development of the character (remember that a character is defined by what he does and not by that he says.) Why does the sheriff bring civilians into a gun cache? (Is not he an officer of the law? Why does the Predalien expect the Predator to REMOVE SLOWLY? his mask before he attacks, why do extraterrestrials always fall into this ugly habit of whistling all after a post-Alien series? 3 How was this series dedicated to a character saying, "People die ... we need weapons! "(the way this writer works even surpasses me and does not reflect the already-fated spell of Fox's artistic reputation. one of the people involved in the making of this film suffered from a mental disability or was really unfit for all levels of the production process. <br /> <br /> The effects are pretty shabby this time around. The aliens look like men in suits and ADI is just starting to laze with the drawing of their creature. The Aliens look like Alien Resurrection's modified remains, with the same voluminous musculature around their arms, as if they had not learned from this film that it was not a good design, or a good one to recycle. Once again, everything is plunged into such a state of darkness, not to create a mystery or an atmosphere, but simply to hide how bad creatures are. And as in AVP, Stan Winston misses us a lot when the false face of Predator is revealed. <br /> <br /> There are too many flaws to list, so I'll just say this: Do not waste your money on this movie. Fox does not care about fans, as clearly shown by this trashy and cheap movie. I felt bad for taking my girlfriend to see him (even if it was free) and apologized after her profusely. He is an unconditional fan who has finished with the franchise. <br /> <br /> Note to Fox: What we really wanted was not an insignificant movie, but a film adaptation of the original Darkhorse Comicbook movie. was better than anything you produced for this franchise after 1993. <br /> <br />
