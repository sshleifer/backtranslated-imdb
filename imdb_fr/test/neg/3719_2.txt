If this film becomes a holiday tradition, I will have to hide for Christmas for the rest of my life. How do you even compare this with "A wonderful life"! It was absolutely horrible! The boy who was singing made me turn my toes. And what was the problem with her hair? Emmy worthy performance ?! Please. Certainly, Lucci did well but an Emmy ????? I think this film is a waste of money. The fact that they stick so close to the original story by pretending to give it a modern and retro touch only makes things worse. He lacked enthusiasm and perseverance in every respect. Lighting, wardrobe, makeup, it seemed like everyone wanted to go home. Just a big NO from me.
