I guess the hearts of the filmmakers were in the right place but, frankly, this movie is really unacceptable. I was offended by the tone and the total end of the cops. You can not take questions like this one so lightly! Without knowing the last warning of the film ... we see a guy get off his pregnant wife of 9 months and his two sons and are supposed to follow him for more than 2 hours while he tries to establish a new life ?? You can not have sympathy for a character who does that. Can not! Not to mention anything, we were not given anything until the last minute, 1/2 hour of this unnecessarily long movie, which explains why this guy suffers so much. No flashbacks, no sudden reactions to noise or movement - everything that real veterinarians are suffering from. All we know is that he is hurting the wife and can not take care of her and her 3 children financially. There does not really seem to be any research on what the veterinarians of Iraq are currently experiencing. <br /> <br /> In addition, the film suffers enormously from a heavy and totally inappropriate score. It's a catastrophe. It really hurts some people who do really well on the part of the male lead and sometimes Joe Morton. This suggests all that you are supposed to feel and sometimes gives you false clues! Again, it was a brutal thing that this guy did, and so seeing him land a new job, meeting a new blonde, struggling behind the counter to make a toast is NOT fitting! And really, the end? What a weird cop! How dare you. <br /> <br /> There are much richer films about the effects of war on returning soldiers. Do not bother with this one.
