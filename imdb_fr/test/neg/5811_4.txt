I totally agree with the previous comment. There is no chemistry between Spencer Tracy and Hedy Lamarr, and the film focuses on their relationships. Hedy Lamarr is not at his best and Spencer Tracy seems to be naive, simple and too optimistic - both in love and in life; an idealistic role that played better in "Boys Town". If you manage to cross the ridiculous crowd scene near the station ... whoa ... it's rather awesome and not worthy of an actor in the cast. Not the best acting on anyone's part. Miscast and inconsistent. The story is empty and the various entries without voting rights are obvious. Hedy Lamarr is absolutely gorgeous herself, which is really the best part of the movie. Spencer Tracy can not compete with the sophistication of his beauty and wardrobe, and the film is not credible for at least that reason.
