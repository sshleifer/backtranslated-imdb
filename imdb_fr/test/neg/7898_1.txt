Hmph. Soul Plane is supposed to be a parody of "black comedy" from a well-known film, Airplane. This film is the black comedy made the worst. Stereotypes can be fun and they often are. But on this picture, it's disgusting. Okay, you have clubs, sex, drugs, everything people associate with "urban" culture today. <br /> <br /> The appearance of Tom Arnold in this film is the grace of this film, if it ever had. DL Hughley should never have accepted the script. Kevin Hart makes a bad figure here ... his appearance in this film will probably become boring for many. The appearance of Method Man and Snoop was by far their worst. <br /> <br /> I'm just glad I did not pay the cost of seeing this movie ...
