I'm just filling out this comment because I could not stand the fact that a positive comment is presented on the "full information" page. I really think it's the worst film ever made in my country. This is not only because of the terrible plot, the English shit and a flat voltage curve as our country. No, it's because it was a serious attempt to make a good action movie, consistent with the Hollywood standard. It must have been the "European Action Film of the Year". To do this, they even hired Fejda van Huet, Oscar-winning photo actor "Karakter", to do the job. I'm not afraid of bad movies, I can even enjoy if they are unpretentious movies. but I can not stand movies that are terrible, but supposed to be type movies.
