It looked so promising in the rental store, the place was great and I could not wait to come home and watch it. It was appalling that the diologist was appalling, that the action was extremely poorly scripted and that the plot had plunged right from the beginning. Gutenberg performs a pathetic performance, Sean Bean does his best but with such a bad script, he could not do much. <br /> <br /> This is not even worth watching, even if you can get it for free (borrow a friend for example) Do not regret it and waste 90 minutes of your life. <br /> <br /> 0/10
