I just bought this movie because I like to make a donation to Operation Smile, the charity on which the movie is based ... but I found the movie very strange. It does not really focus on Operation Smile or similar organizations like The Smile Train and their Herculean efforts to relieve the suffering of children born with facial deformities in third world countries. No, this is a teenage American volunteer, Katie, whose life "too privileged" in Malibu, California, includes a mother who takes her to a doctor for her to have the birth control pill before to sleep with his boyfriend. . What does this nonsense of birth control is supposed to do, tickle the audience? We are in 2005. I would be more surprised if, in 2005, a Malibu teenager did not take birth control, and even if she did, so what and who cares? Katie contrasts with the character of Lin in China, a girl with a facial deformity who missed the opportunity to have surgery last year and who does not want to suffer one. None of the characters are written in such a way that the public can really identify themselves, let alone understand the motivations of any of the girls. On the other hand, the actors do an adequate job trying to play the bad hand that was inflicted on them by the one who wrote this ridiculous scenario. The best performance was performed by the gentleman playing Lin's father, although much of his dialogue is in Chinese and subtitled. Operation Smile deserved to be honored by a much better movie than this one!
