Yes. A real stench. I saw this film on the advice of my "adorable" friends who told me that it was an excellent "psychological" film. This film makes every effort not to be understandable. I knew I had to go crazy after watching the first 20 minutes. I've been waiting since I was expecting to see something precious, and most importantly, that I PAID for this movie. The wait was unbearable. After watching the film, I spoke with my friends and learned that in the intellectual environments (they call themselves under this title), this "film" of Turkey was recognized as a masterpiece. Yes, a masterpiece, but in the stinky category. I think a film has to explain itself. This film is the opposite. Stay away from this thing called a "movie". Burn your money instead of paying for this "phenomenon". Rate: 1 out of 10
