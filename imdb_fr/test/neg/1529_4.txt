First of all, season 1 is intolerably bad. The prison is ridiculously unrealistic, the characters are so two-dimensional that they are almost transparent and the direction is terrible. It looks like a bad video of a college play, characters wandering in front of the camera and uttering extremely punctual and repeated aftershocks, pretending to be a random prison speech. Soon, the show is better, but not much. The return of the commercial break is always accompanied by a ridiculous monologue of Augustus Hill, wheelchair, interpreted in an impressive way by Harold Perrineau. The only time his character is constantly bad is during performance monologues, most of which unfold in an inexplicable rotating glass cube and usually have nothing to do with what's going on in the show. <br /> Unfortunately, Oz's bad ideas could fill an encyclopedia of several volumes. Let us first consider the situation as a whole. Prisoners are able to hang out at sight, get drunk, get drunk, and they not only have a CD player (they can also hand out steak knives), but all the incoming mail is thoroughly scrutinized by the PRISONERS. Christ, the place is like a men's club with guards. Guards who do not do much. <br /> <br /> Near the end of season two, a grandson of an older prisoner is diagnosed with leukemia. All prisoners deposit thick bills of $ 20 and $ 50 bills to help send it to Disneyworld to fulfill his last wish. These must be the richest prisoners in the world. All the prisoners of Oz suddenly became caring and loving, with the exception of Kenny Wangler, an irritating character but one of the few to consistently convince. Even Adibisi wanted to be nice. But it does not matter, because there is no order or meaning in the series, which makes it a minimal distraction. <br /> <br /> Later, it's shocking to see a boxing scene in which an inmate wears a "I like the cops". In prison!! Can you imagine ?? I have a cousin who was in prison a few years ago. I sent him an old picture of us with some friends in high school. In the photo, one of my friends was holding a bumper sticker "I Love Cops" and one of the "woods" (guys who were imprisoned years and years ago) saw the picture but just grabbed it and torn it into shreds. My cousin was lucky. <br /> <br /> Kenny Wangler also constantly scolded the guards and even more experienced officers for not calling him Bricks. One of them even tried to bribe him to go to an English class. You risk losing track of who is responsible, prisoners or guards. For example, more than one investigator goes into the prison illegally and gets killed trying to stop drug trafficking. Personally, I would simply stop letting prisoners inspect incoming mail rather than risk the lives of investigators. <br /> <br /> Come on, what else? Shillinger's son, OD, is lonely and no one thinks of asking the caretaker how he got the drugs. He just got them, I guess. And be sure to pay attention, otherwise you will miss the reason why the prisoners have enough money to be able to afford cellular dermal grafts when they have bad gums. I did not know that clients of maximum security prisons had access to such luxury treatment options. How about that, when Robson asks about Dr. Faraj's schedule so he can ask what breed of gums he's been given, Faraj is so terrified that he goes to the warden and leave his job right away. Do not doctors and dentists have the right to ask not to see some prisoners? After Poet and O'Reilly announce this announcement to the entire prison, Robson asks to see Dr. Faraj. He is then taken to his office, brought without being knocked on the door and the guard goes promptly without a word. They might as well give him a gun. <br /> <br /> I should not continue to talk about stupid ideas in this series, but it's like a flood, I can not stop it. Who thought of Chinese refugees who can not speak Chinese and who disappear en masse unless they are needed? Who thought of the wacky religious wars and all the reverend prisoners? Who thought of Robson's gum transplant? What is the problem with Busmalis and Agamemnon? Agamemnon because he obviously does not belong to prison and Busmalis because of the affair with his grandson. Macbeth, because it was only a ridiculous way to reach a goal, so to speak. <br /> <br /> But what are the worst ideas? Things that go nowhere, that are constant. An Irishman comes to the prison and builds a bomb. He threatens to blow up the entire prison, the bomb turns out to be a failure, and the episode ends with the fact that he was taken by the mine clearance team after the evacuation of the whole prison. We never talk about him again or about the situation as a whole. It's as if it never happened. In one episode, prisoners are given dogs to train. What is going on?? As if that were not enough, during a training session, a guard pulls his weapon inside the prison walls as a training exercise. Nobody seems to care. <br /> <br /> I also like the fact that every time a sort of altercation breaks out, the culprits are dismissed, they say nothing, and the guards or the guardian or the sister Pete or whoever always says, "I hope you do not think I'll let that go !!" And then they leave and let him go. The public will not remember it. <br /> <br /> Maybe I'm spoiled by Prison Break, but Oz is just a crazy prison drama that could be better as a play. A short. At least one low budget movie. There are simply not enough resources to support a multi-season TV show. Again, I watched six seasons on DVD. Sometimes I do not understand myself ...
