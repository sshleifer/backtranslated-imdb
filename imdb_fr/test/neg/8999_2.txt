What a waste of time. After about five minutes, I became * very * anxious, and I quickly made a fast forward, and very quickly, the desire to remove my thumb from the advance button was nonexistent. Actors Mark Redfield and Barry Murphy did a very capable job, I thought, but no one else I saw gave such a good performance. Again, take this criticism with a big grain of salt because the movie was so unbearable that I could not go all the way. Damn, I could not go to the MIDDLE !! <br /> <br /> I find myself unable to submit this criticism because it is not long enough. Maybe this last sentence will put it above.
