"The Bone Snatcher" begins with extremely promising perspectives, with the introduction of an original new type of invisible evil, as well as the use of the extremely isolated location of the African desert. While inspecting pipelines in the desert, three miners are attacked and killed by an apparently unfounded creature who eats their flesh and leaves only a pile of half-eaten bones. The expedition team dispatched to rescue them discovers that the monster is a queen of ants mutated in a superior way. Soon, they are also trapped in the mysterious desert. Director Jason Wulfsohn maintains a respectable level of tension until the nature of the monster is identified. Immediately after, the film quickly turns into an ordinary creature feature with all the characters who abandon the race for survival, one by one. The second half of "The Bone Snatcher" is incredibly boring; with the inevitable clich√©s of love story and the total absence of bloody murderous pieces. The characters are all unbearable stereotypes that act and say exactly what you predict several minutes in advance. There is the rookie who has to prove herself, the female with a cerebral capacity apart from her sexy look, the odious experienced guy who redeems herself in the end by self-sacrifice and ?? finally and especially ?? who could forget the wise black guy who refers to the monster using all kinds of voodoo names. Wulfsohn tries too hard to make his monster look like the space threats of "Alien" and "Predator". The ant creature has an infrared vision and crumbles when you shoot at it, yawn! In fact, the film only benefits from its unique setting and a handful of unpleasant images of decomposed bodies. It could have been a modest jewel, but instead it is less than mediocre. To avoid.
