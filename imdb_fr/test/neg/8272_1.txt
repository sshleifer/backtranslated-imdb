This film tries at all costs to capture this classic sensation of bad Canadian film: <br /> <br /> "weird" and odious characters (some); "weird" city with "weird" folk; a caf√© or restaurant "unusual" (coffee here); lots of pictures of Canadian stuff for postcards (ocean stuff here); we talk a lot about "get out of this city"; totally booooring. <br /> <br /> And he succeeds in every respect. <br /> <br /> Something to note, though. I could not understand if this movie was simply trying to be an "original" post-exposure Northern comedy or something surreal like a psychotic or drug-induced hallucination. The editing of this movie has sneaked from one thing to another without any relation to stimulation or motivation. Not to mention the fact that half the time, we did not even know where we were jumping. Take, for example, the very first images of a teenager shouting in a car. Who are they and what do they have to do? And this sub-euh-plot (use this word vaguely conspiracy) concerns children who seem to span several generations. I do not think that is the case, but the editing gives the impression that they materialize from the flashback, all of a sudden, until now. Huh? What did I miss? <br /> <br /> Avoid. Except for laughing. Or you want to try and stumble on the inept edition.
