Following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor by American forces at Pearl Harbor, "The Eastside Kids": Leo Gorcey (as Muggs), Bobby Jordan (as Danny Connors), Huntz Hall (as Glimpy), David Gorcey (as Peewee), Ernest Morrison (as Scruno) and Bobby Stone (as Skinny) want to serve their country. But the US military and the US Navy reject them as too young. Always wanting "to drop about a million Japs", the "boys" attack an Asian employee, who turns out to be a Chinese. The unfortunate incident, however, led the gang to discover really nasty Japanese and Germans. <br /> <br /> If "too young" is defined as "under 21", only Mr. Jordan and Mr. Stone would be rejected for military service. But it is possible that the recruiters were upset by the office manners posted by Mr. Gorcey and Mr. Hall. "Let's be hard!" was made during what the script accurately describes as "open season on Japs" - for this reason and others, it did not age well. It's a useless effort, but the regulars are doing well, with Tom Brown moving the plot into his role as Jordan's spy brother. <br /> <br /> *** Let's Get Tough! (5/29/42) Wallace Fox ~ Bobby Jordan and Tom Brown, Leo Gorcey
