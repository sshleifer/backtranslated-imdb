Bad bad bad. How are films like this one made? Badly written, badly played; I could go on, but why bother? By the way, note that the first names of the characters are the same as those of the actors: it is a deadly gift, nobody on the set even interested enough in their role to get to know the names of the characters of someone d 'other!
