I had always been suspicious of the efforts of Italian horror master Dario Argento, and these were only confirmed after my recent viewing of the terrible DEMONS by Lamberto Bava (1985); the fact that it was his third installment did not seem promising, but I decided to rent the film, no matter when we are in the heat of Halloween. I took a look at the theatrical trailer on the Anchor Bay DVD before watching the main feature ?? the undeniably striking visuals intrigued me to be sure, but then the film itself (which does not make more sense than what is presented in this frenetic montage of two minutes and, in retrospect, we can see that most of his strengths were compiled with wisdom) turned out to be really disappointing! <br /> <br /> Opening in a rather promising way with a medieval prologue straight out of Alexander NEVSKY (1938), it declines quickly because it relies too much on surrealistic images at the expense of the narration. As a result, several characters occupy a central place at random ?? with the insupportable male lead succumbing early to the forces of darkness, the sinister bishop (Feodor Chaliapin) resulting from a simple red harassment, the mysterious black priest gradually assuming heroic qualities, the main woman is for whatever reason chased by a demon-goat (culminating in a sexual rite directed at the other cultists, obviously raised from ROSEMARY'S BABY [1968]); and Asia Argento, 13 years old and reasonably impressively, as a rebellious but sympathetic daughter of the daughter of the sacristan only surviving in the end). Incidentally, former Argento also co-wrote the film's story and screenplay with director Soavi and (under a pseudonym, after apparently disputing with Dario at the beginning of the production) the original director Lamberto Bava and the prolific genre scribe Dardano Sacchetti (whom met at the 61st Venice Film Festival in 2004.) <br /> <br /> The extremely confused second half of the film then sees a group of people ?? including the inevitable teenagers but also a gloomy English couple (whose incessant quarrels give a naughty punchline fun) ?? likewise locked inside a building under the influence of evil spirits (the church being the burial place of a satanic cult), note that this release of horror is likely to dispel the memories of the sublime surrealist Luis Bunuel, THE EXTERMINATING ANGEL (1962), you see! In the end, the film is all the more disappointing (although the macabre effects of Sergio Stivaletti are remarkable, at least) since I really enjoyed the only other title of Soavi I had seen ?? CEMETERY MAN (1994), which I own via the DVD R2 SE. That said, I would still like to see his first feature film ?? FRAGE STAGE (1987) ?? and the follow-up efforts of THE CHURCH's director, THE SECT (1991) ...
