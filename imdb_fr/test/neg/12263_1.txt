I'm not inclined to blame and my expectations were low at first, but how did it seem like a good idea? It's not because you have a camera, ugly big friends for actors, and talented illusions that you have to go out and make a movie. It should have been the cinematic equivalent of singing in the shower, that is to say, it should never have been born. However, one way or another, this garbage has found a dispenser that would help it escape the limits of a cabin 3 feet by 4. This is worse and worse. Talk about a modest budget, a torture scene is a guy who gets a cup of coffee on him while he is tied to a chair. Obviously, it is very painful because the big baby starts screaming in pain, maybe he ordered decaf! The acting game is worse than wood (I could look at a tree for 30 seconds before becoming completely bored, if you could watch that garbage for so long, you're a better man than me!) And the fight scenes would be at the home a kindergarten playground. Do not touch this film unless you feel pain (in this case, try spilling warm coffee on yourself). I would like to say that it's so bad that it's good, but it's really awful.
