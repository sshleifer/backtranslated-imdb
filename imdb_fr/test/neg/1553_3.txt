I had to watch this one for my Canadian film class and was told it was considered the "Best Canadian Film". When I looked at it, I really do not agree, because I saw a lot better. I understand there were Canadian themes and messages, but the fact that the characters and plot are so out of touch with me (as a viewer) did not matter to me what the movie was trying to tell me. The plot was too dry. The characters did not have many positive personality traits, but to emphasize the messages, not to excite the audience. This film shows a little history of Quebec. This is not a very interesting film. it certainly does not deserve to be placed on a pedestal of such height.
