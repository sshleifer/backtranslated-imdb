Making a film for less than a million people could be a triumph for a hierarchical producer or accountant, but does nothing for the public. The record may have been pretty, but the viewing experience was poor. <br /> <br /> What will be a triumph for Irish cinema is when people will realize that the values ​​of production and the scenario can not be sacrificed. <br /> <br /> I do not understand why people spend the energy needed to make a film when the quality of production is lower than that of a poor television show. <br /> <br /> The deficiencies of the plot have been mentioned in another review on this site and I totally agree with what has been written. What I would add is that the film has touched the surface of several genres without ever settling in one of them. The film would have benefited from direct comedy or social / political commentary. <br /> <br /> My general impression was that the film was rushed, thematically underdeveloped and visually not up to par. On a positive note, the performances and the music were very good.
