Talented screenwriter Alvin Sargent can not, unfortunately, find engaging ideas in this artificial trifle about a lost mother and her ripe teenage daughter trying to make life in Los Angeles despite mom's unstable behavior. Apart from several good sequences, I did not quite consider Susan Sarandon as a snowflake (she is intrinsically too intelligent and concentrated to be called a devil's lady), and her well-entrenched personality is not good for the role. an irresponsible parent. Natalie Portman does much better as a child, and yet her work is frightening (and some of her scenes, such as the one where she asks a boy to undress, are misguided and uncomfortable to watch). Certainly not an incompetent piece, "Anywhere But Here" has moments that work, but it's not a film that can be tilted, nor has it turned out to be an important film. ** from ****
