Mockney comes to Brighton; In spite of a mediocre reception of the British press and the British cinema funded by the State, I rather hoped that we would have a little of the lugubrious and wacky London of Graham Greene. <Br. /> <br /> That does not even aspire to it. The characters straight out of their trailers to replicate reproduce the types of Guy Ritchie. The format is more like a British TV series than a movie (Brighton is a gold mine, spoiled by a plastic studio job). <br /> <br /> I watched this film in search of the good show of Famke Janssen ... it is a little clever for this company, its mark of impertability on big screen more belonging to blockbusters such as Deep Rising. In terms of acting (even a role!), The research continues. The circus is boring. 3/10
