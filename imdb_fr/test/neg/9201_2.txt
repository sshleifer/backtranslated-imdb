I say Ben Johnson and my fellow Canadians say, "Ben Johnson ?!" - he was a fucking guy from MOVIE STAR, a COWBOY, and in 1976, he played the role of a sheriff in stupid movies made for TV movies like this one, taking advantage of the KILLER BEES DARBES that all world seemed to be coming to us at the time. So, there are these bees, and they kill some people by flying in their mouth and pursuing them under water. Finally, these idiots find the swarm and die and this woman is trapped in her car by the entire swarm. The cops are like, what do we do? Uh, bees die when it's cold. So where can we get it cold? I know - the stadium of New Orleans! So they drive this car and its swarm of killer bees through the streets of New Orleans, with a megaphone saying, "GO OUT OF STREETS OR YOU WILL BE DEATHED". And the future home of tens of thousands of flood victims with its broken toilet becomes the narcotic sinking of this bee buncha. I do not know what is the greatest indignity of this big city ... well, yes, but this one is also afraid. Very well seen on a 16mm extremely faded orange print, although Betamax is a good alternative!
