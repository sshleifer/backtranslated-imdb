I find it surprising that so many people (probably Poles) voted for this film with such notes (mostly dozens). OK, the movie was good, funny, but it was not special on the other hand. The only good thing about Kiler is the dialogues, which are not complete for non-Poles. The scenario is primitive, the actor (except for Jerzy Stuhr as Ryba) - awful. That's too much noise for nothing - fortunately, it's not included in the top 250. P.S. The following "Kilerow 2-och" ("2 Kilers") is on the way and it's the same story.
