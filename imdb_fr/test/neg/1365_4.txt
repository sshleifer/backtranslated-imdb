I have to admit that I'm not a big fan of satanic horror movies and that in fact, it seems like I like them less and less every time I see a new one, and it's not really surprising to watch movies like the brotherhood of Satan! Despite its low rating on IMDb, I was surprised to hear good things about this movie and my expectations increased. It turned out to be a big mistake because it's exactly the movie his rating suggests: namely, a very bad movie! The plot is your core satanist group that causes problems, and we focus on a small town where people have been murdered and kidnapped and why they are not clear. Naturally, satanists are behind all this and that's bad news for a mother, a father and a girl on a journey who find themselves trapped in the mysterious city. I had the impression that this film was perhaps in the same direction as the satanist shit movie "The Devil's Rain", and although it's not as stupid as Robert Fuest's latest film, it's not not much better either. The plot seems to be pretty down to earth, but it's also rather boring and I can not say I had fun at all during this movie. The Brotherhood of Satan obviously has his fans, but I'm not part of it. it's a film that I see no reason to recommend ...
