I was still waiting for this film to improve, but alack is the worst kind of escape movie: a confection of spun sugar that plunges under the weight of its heavy importance. The step continues like a legionnaire stuck in the Sahara. The absence of a good dialogue leaves the attractive stars nothing to do, except to look good in white linen. The irons still play another silver charmer who has had a touch of the sun. Kaas is a nice singer but not really an actress. Fortunately, the script does not often ask him to get away from the microphone of the jazz club. All the characters are beautifully relaxed, pretty and useless, in turn, shaping the landscape with a sophisticated air. The whole exercise is an endlessly lengthy announcement by Ralph Lauren. <br /> <br /> If you are over forty and think that francophilia is the key to sophistication, you risk taking this card for a baguette. Well, if you liked this movie, you probably felt clever to have appreciated Godard's praise of love, and you may have even missed out on Divorce without cracking.
