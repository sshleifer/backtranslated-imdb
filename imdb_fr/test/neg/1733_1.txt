Honestly, the only reason I chose this Blockbuster movie was because Aaron Carter was there. Okay, the first thing is the first. Have you noticed how ugly Aaron Carter is? I mean, he was so cute, but now ... with that slender body and that stained skin - EW. I think he should continue singing and the directors of the film could have found a much more beautiful guy who could synchronize the lips. No offense however. I thought this teen movie was very lame - and it comes from me, being a teenager myself. The 'naughty girls' are so predictable, the acting is so amateurish that it sometimes makes you cringe (especially from Aaron) and, overall, I just do not have it appreciated. Although, I give points for the scenario - it was ok, but not at all realistic. Anyway, stay away from this movie by any means unless you have money and you have absolutely nothing better to do with 94 minutes of your time. This is not worth the $ 6.50 !! <br /> <br /> (This criticism may not apply to young children under 13!)
