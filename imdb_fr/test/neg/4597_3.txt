After Matt Dillon's phenomenal performance in CRASH, most will likely rush to take a copy of FACTOTUM to determine if Dillon is real or if he just had a lucky rebound thanks to an excellent storyline. <br /> <br /> Well, Factotum certainly has its moments, but the simplicity of ... everything will probably divert the viewers. However, nothing should be removed from Dillon. His performance is wonderful and bursting with humor, and proves that he is a solid actor with important chops. it's just a shame for the staging and the script. <br /> <br /> The story is about Henry "Hank" Chinaski (Dillon) and his refusal to conform to anything that looks like normalcy. He quits his job or is fired in just a few minutes, but finds himself again in a sullen pub, bringing even sadder women together, while trying to write a nonconformist novel. We never really know what the novel is about, except that it involves "everything" (cancer, movies, you, me). <br /> <br /> Passing from one workplace to another and constantly returning to Jan (Lili Taylor, THE HAUNTING), a losing girlfriend who is as discouraged as himself, Hank tries in vain to discover what his life is supposed to be for him. If he ever learns what it is is interpreted. Some will say that he never does, while others will say that his life is simply a path to darkness. <br /> <br /> Anyway, Factotum does not have much substance, even with the great performance of Matt Dillon. The story winds up in Hank's life without thinking too much about where to take the audience. And that's a shame. Dillon's performance would have been even brighter if given a decent scenario.
