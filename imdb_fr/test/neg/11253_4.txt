First of all, I criticize this film because I really had high hopes and this film was bad. <br /> <br /> * possible spoilers * (if you have not seen the TV series) Where to start ?? ? Well, let's start with quality. The film was barely better than the original television series and the two fight scenes were very well designed. However, the CGI was horrible. <br /> <br /> Then there are the holes of the plot and the questions that remain after the end of the film. This film does not end as a successful conclusion of a very broad universe known as the FMA and only further enlarges the universe before leaving us with nothing but our imagination to decipher what would happen in the future. <br /> <br /> And then there is the biggest defect of the stories. Add World War II and Hitler ... WHY ?? The series was perfect ... and did not need Hitler. He did not even need Germany. <br /> <br /> Overall, the whole film was cruelly elusive in what could have been a real FMA film and if I was the director, I would give up the CdS and do a new "ending", finishing.
