The story tells the story of a psychic woman, Tory, who returns to her hometown and begins to relive her traumatic childhood (the death of her childhood friend and violent father). Tory discovers that her friend was only the first in a series of murders that are still happening. Can his psychic powers help solve crimes and stop the ongoing murders? <br /> <br /> You really do not need to know because, oh my God! It was so so so so bad! I know that all fans of Nora Roberts will attend this movie and give it tons of 10. Then we will see a rating of 6 on IMDb and think that this film is worth watching. But do not be fooled. The end was predictable, the actor Terrible (do not even talk about southern accents * y'all *) and the story was banal. Just remember .... you have been warned!
