The only reason I give a second star is for the first half of the movie. It was a good interpretation of the story. I like to see some added fictional characters to add color to a well-known story. But the second half was horrible !!! Yes, this story had violent aspects. But the writers of this film chose to include only violence and forget the good things God did for the Israelites. Towards the end of the film, Scott seemed to be receiving messages from the big giant head instead of talking and hearing God. This interpretation posed enormous problems of deviation from the scriptures. And big surprise, there are no favorable deviations! Their portrayal of Moses as a crazy and screaming madman who did all this against his will is totally wrong. It showed a Moses who had to shout for God to speak to him. Scripture says that God spoke to Moses all the time and not only after a tantrum. They were right to complain, but they did not demonstrate that God spoke to Moses at Sinai in a voice that the disciples could hear and believe (Chapter 19). They also forgot the pillar of fire and cloud that guided them day and night. <br /> <br /> What was the whole thing about Joshua? The just Jewish peace-loving who would not fight so much that Moses was not threatening him? FALSE (he was known as a great warrior) What about the great speech Moses gave to the army telling them that God had helped them enough and that they were now alone? FALSE (They only won thanks to God's help, as shown by their own scene with Moses raising his staff) And what was this sad arch of pace? Instead of covering it with gold, this film had a tight budget and attached small gold tokens! Oh yes, it was a "melted calf" and not straw with small sticky chips. Someone forgot that they came out of Egypt with a huge amount of gold dependent on the Egyptians. <br /> <br /> By the way, the part on them killing the Israelites after the incident of the golden calf says "men" and does not mention the women and children whose film delighted to show the viewers. Oh yes - Manna was not the only thing sent from the sky - do not forget the birds for the meat. In addition, the Bible mentions that Jethro brought Moses his wife and children, and he says that Jethro returned to his own country. It does not say that Moses abandoned his family. <br /> <br /> Well, if you do not know anything about the real story, read Exodus for yourself. If you know the real story, you'll hate this version.
