There, I sit at home in the morning. Suddenly, my brother switches to what seems to be the most stupid movie I've ever seen. Considering it was the 70s and the special effects were not to be shared, this film was about the definition of shit. The stupid monsters, the stupid plot and the stupid scenery made this movie the worst movie I have ever seen. So badly I did not even finish it, I did it to a certain extent, then I looked for how long I could stay without hanging my neck and hanging myself. (I'm joking haha) AWFUL FILM
