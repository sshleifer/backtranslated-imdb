If you're not old enough to remember Yoram Globus and Menahem Golan, here's the recap: it's a couple of Israeli film producers and filmmakers who created the Cannon film company in the early 1980s. Israeli to have a press worse than these two was Menachim Begin. Begin probably deserved the bad press, but Globus and Golan were a god sent to the filmmakers, because no matter how badly your scenario, they would fund your movie with joy and would normally use directors who could not direct and actors who could not to play. In fact, you often have the impression that people are content to walk to Yoram and Menahem asks them for money and they commit themselves without having seen the resume of the filmmaker. If the producers were so confident nowadays. <br /> <br /> THE YOUNG WARRIORS is not a Cannon movie but Globus and Golan funded it and it bears his signature. It is badly directed, badly acted, badly edited, but it is the script that jumps to the eyes and attacks you with its horror. It all starts with a bunch of high school students indulging in all sorts of crazy jokes. In fact, the first 20 minutes of the film unfold like a sex comedy and it's a shock when THE YOUNG WARRIORS turns into a surveillance film. . But it's not just any type of self-defense film like EXTERMINATOR 2 or DEATH WISH 3 (notice a connection - these are two sequels and two self defense movies made by Cannon films), no witness is a ridiculous self-defense film about jocks high school kids pretty boy and their poodle going on a mission to clear the fools. This film is proof that Globus and Golan were giving money to people, regardless of their filming capabilities. So you have to worry about people who seem to spend all their reserves to make films entirely focused on the vigilante.
