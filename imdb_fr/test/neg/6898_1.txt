BARNYARD sucked! I saw this movie last week and it's horrible. Which bull has the uggs? My 2-year-old son asked me if all the cows had udders and tried to explain to him that this was just not true and seeing the movie only made it more disturbing! <br /> <br /> In addition, the violent theme frightened my 2 year old son. They made the coyotes ferocious, which caused fear of coyotes in my daughter. I know that coyotes are not ferocious and are natural predators. The mother and the son who were sitting in front of us shouted: "Kill him, kill him, yes" in a particular scene of the film where good vs. evil properly speaking <br /> It is a torn Lion King and they should stop using big name actors for a lame movie. Steve Oederek, who also shot movies on the go, such as Thumb Wars, Thumbelina and many others are so bad! <br /> <br /> If a good movie of Steve Oederek comes out of my life, I will turn naked and swallow my diarrhea and post it on Youtube.com ... Enough!
