Sammi Cheng and Andy Lau are once again paired in their third film - YESTERDAY ONCE MORE - directed by HK action film, Johnnie To ... To's action movie fans will be disappointed not to find the least weapon in the film. In addition, fans of Cheng & Lau's previous films, NEEDING YOU & LOVE ON A DIET, will also be disappointed to find that HIER is neither so funny nor so endearing ... <br /> <br /> Mr. & Mrs. To (Lau & Cheng) are a divorced couple ... the two wealthy citizens of HK ... incredibly mischievous ... both turned out to be professional thieves - "two birds of the same feather" .... Some years earlier, they had divorced after being unable to find common ground to separate booty ... Now she remarries ... with the son of a rich heiress - the son of a total mum ( Carl Ng) end-to-end ... The future mother-in-law (Jenny Woo) is wary of Ms. To's past and thinks she only marries his son for the family's jewels - the precious ruby ​​necklace of the heiress ... <br /> <br /> The necklace is stolen ... is it Ms. To's materialistic eye that makes the most of her? ... or is it her ex-husband, the way Mr. To sabotaged the wedding to steal the jewels for himself ?. .. <br /> <br /> This is not a film about two people who fall in love or revive a love ... it is about two people who have always been in love, but who have been insane of the achieve. they let pride and greed overwhelm them ... <br /> <br /> Overall: YESTERDAY is a part of the film caper / heist and a part pays homage to the classic Hollywood glamor of his golden years - it's to say Cary Grant and Grace Kelly of TO CATCH ONE THIEF ... Johnnie To surfs too much on Cheng The chemistry of Lau drawn from their previous films ... hoping that the immense popularity of Cheng / Lau will be enough to justify this third film .... I think Sammi Cheng is one of the most likeable and charming artists working today. . & Lau is the Tom Cruise of Asian cinema ... <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed their first two films and I consider the Cheng / Lau couple as comparable to those classic Hollywood couples of the 40s and 50s ... but HIER is not up to expectations ... terrible writings, ridiculous situations, product placement galore, and all the secondary intrigues and secondary characters were useless ... well to think about it ... this movie was useless ... unless you want to like celebrity watching ...
