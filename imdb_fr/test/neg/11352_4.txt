"You can survive anything". All but a silent horror movie. The director could not even decide if he wanted a demon or just a serial killer from the backcountry. You can not have both. It's as if Michael Moore was trying to get his cake and eat it too (or in his case, 1,500 cakes) by making his own series of quack-quilting docu-comedies: they're supposed to be so funny and weird, We're we are also supposed to treat them as hard-hitting, heart-wrenching and truth-based documentaries. Some genres can not be mixed. <br /> <br /> "Anything can happen to anyone, anytime, anywhere." (Translation: this is the kind of horror, so we can do all sorts of nonsense that we want.) It does not look so much like something "wise" found on the paper of a Chinese biscuit, but rather credo of every horrible horror director. We get very early this idiot declaration, in a way a preparation / justification of the absurd buffoonery to come. <br /> <br /> "My phone does not work!" Of course not. There is much more chance that Sean Penn's brain will begin to function (after decades of catatonic apathy) than a cell phone with a horror movie. The saddest and most predictable horror shot of the last decade. Why even say it? We know that help will never come by a phone call, so you can not say as much. The last 50 horror movies I've seen use this device. It becomes embarrassing. <br /> <br /> "We must always expect the unexpected." The final twist was rather surprising, I will give them a lot ... However, there is a lot of nonsense on the way. <br /> <br /> Discover the elaborate traps that the heroine sets up with the speed of a drug addict. -up laboratory rat - in cold, wet and almost completely dark conditions. I love the realism of horror movies ... <br /> <br /> When a bloodthirsty demon starts to want to be funny (by "dropping" his victims), then you know that the pleasure of watching horrors is uncertain. The less we say about the old geezer "cracking wise", the better ... Another stupid shot served by a director tired, lazy and uninspired. <br /> <br /> What are the chances of being attacked by your husband, then by a hateful demon - the same day? "Expect the unexpected" They might as well have been stuck in an event in which she survives a plane crash, then in another event in which she meets extraterrestrials who have tried to probe her anally ... <br /> <br /> temple or shrine built in his image.
