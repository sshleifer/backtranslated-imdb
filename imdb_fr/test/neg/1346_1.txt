This film is not a comedy. It's not even funny in the department "this film is so bad that it's funny". On the contrary, it's just bad. Other critics mention poor lighting, but beyond that, there is plenty of bad plastic surgery. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, many acting talents have been wasted in a mediocre scenario and uninspired direction. The main characters are one-dimensional and boring. (It is difficult to feel sympathy for any of them). It is also difficult to see the four characters as close friends. It seems to be just a group of women gathered, pretending to be close. <br /> <br /> I will not list all the problems in this movie because it does not deserve anyone's attention. (It's not worth the time it takes to watch it either).
