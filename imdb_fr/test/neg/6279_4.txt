David G. Latt's War of the Worlds by H.G. Wells is a slightly below average film, which is not bad considering the budget he had to work with - only $ 1 million. For this budget, the value of the production was not too bad - the visual effects (with the CGI given the budget I had impressed) and the sound effects. The least stellar parts of this movie are the story that is VERY extended at best (but I think it's still because of their budget - they had to extend some scenes to create the 97-minute feature film) (again once, it's because the actors have no story to tell), very few exceptional shots and music. However, again, I can leave the negative parts for the most part, because this film was made for a small budget and still had good production value. You should still see it to learn how to create a low-budget version of War of the Worlds CAN, even with flaws. 4 out of 10
