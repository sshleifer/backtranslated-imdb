I enjoyed the Masters of Horror series until I came across this pile of infant manure. <br /> <br /> This anti-Bush propaganda posing as a horror film unfolds like an episode of original Batman directed by Michael Moore. Political satire should be smart, but it pulls the ten on the simplet scale with all the style and credibility of a film by L. Ron Hubbard. <br /> <br /> In his cagey and alienated way, he accuses Republicans of stealing elections, going to war for no reason and treating the military like soldiers like cannon fodder. It's even a blow to the second amendment and religion. It only missed CÃ©sar Romero as president, moved in sorrow at the way he had orchestrated 9/11. <br /> <br /> I guess the end was supposed to be the moment "we support our troops", but I think they'd be sure the Hollywood elites are sitting in their Malbu homes caressing each other's backs for this "pithy work" while the misinformed counter-war drones salute him as a genius. <br /> <br /> It's time to equip new children's aluminum hats.
