The funniest thing about Fortunes is that one of the main characters, Lewis (Urbaniak), has the hang of the writer and apparently also the scriptwriter of the movie. It's sad too, and I guess basically it's supposed to be a comedy or a drama, but it's the funniest thing I can remember when I look at that. <br /> <br /> Three friends go out and drink one night. On the way back, two of them decide to be told their fortune by a "gypsy", as they call it. These two lives disintegrate while the third friend stays by. Then nothing happens. <br /> <br /> I hope I did not ruin the movie over there, but really, this very low-budget, low-quality movie had an early idea, but quickly snowballed in the depths of hell. Yes, I am hard. Honestly, it was not that bad, it was blah. <br /> <br /> The aforementioned writer was annoying to watch, although he delivered perhaps one or two of the only two fun lines. The clich√© "man of women", the only one not to have his fortune told was simply annoying. The only positive thing was the remaining friend, the married father who had been told to his fortune that something serious was going to happen to his son and that he had to get ready. He was funny, authentic and clearly the best actor of the film. Unfortunately, that does not say much. <br /> <br /> Maybe I'm too cruel. Heck, they had the ambition to make a film, went for funding and did something. Unfortunately, I absolutely can not recommend the film because hundreds of thousands of other independent films offer hundreds of thousands of better ideas and performances. This one was literally 10 minutes away from an idea that lasted another 81 boring minutes.
