Yesterday, I watched this TV production and was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> I did not have high expectations when it was a television production, but the full movie was painful and did not end. I felt it lasted 3 hours, but it was just me who was bored to death. Every minute was a long fight and I really fought to stay away from the switch off. <br /> <br /> The film is about a doctor (Dr. Verghese) who contracts a lot of AIDS patients. and most die during the movie. It is difficult to live with Verghese, so his family is punished by his frustrations. However, this film has problems to show on both sides, it focuses mainly on his conversations with patients, and sometimes we see movies from home, but we do not receive much. The difficulties of showing more than one part of Verghese's life do not improve with the poor role of Naveen Andrews, a man I (I hope) can not see in any good film of the future. <br /> <br /> I think he got 7.6 because of the subject (taboo?), but I'm sure there are better movies on the subject on the market. Stay away from this movie, it does not deserve more than 3/10. <br /> <br />
