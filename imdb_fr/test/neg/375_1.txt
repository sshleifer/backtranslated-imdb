This time, The Beastmaster (Marc Singer) returns only to face a new enemy, Arklon (Wings Hauser). However, because of an annoying teenager (Kari Wuher), they are transported to the future where they launch into duke. This results in many fish (lame) out of the water. Honestly, you do not get such heart-rotten suites. Beastmaster 2 is a painful film to see. The references and "hipness" date badly of the film (this was done in 1991) and really who wants to see The Beastmaster in the present times? It should also be noted that Wings Hauser, whose embarrassing performance is easily the best asset of the film. The singer looks clumsy, Wuher is irritating and the slang of 1991 makes the film downright unassailable. It's easily one of the worst movies ever made. <br /> <br /> 1/2 * on 4- (Awful)
