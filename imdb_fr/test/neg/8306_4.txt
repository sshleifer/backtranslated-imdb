Mel Welles, as you may remember as Mr. Mushnick in Roger Corman's Small Shop of Horrors, is directing this somewhat interesting but completely distorted story of Dr. Frankenstein's daughter continuing her father's work after his death and creating a creature that does not fit his intellectual abilities or his mind. his probability of being / doing good, but rather of his sex appeal. You see, Tania Frankenstein, although a doctor and a scientist, is looking for nothing more than to satisfy her primary desire for the stable boy and to be a great sex slave using his body with the excellent brain of a man not to love. Here, the story is thin and we get what we would expect: a lot of laudatory and suggestive comments (the most surprising from the female role), special effects that are not so special, a game that lack of depth in the characterization, and not really much action or suspense. And while this film is almost sterile for good stories, Lady Frankenstein has some oddities that make it visible - not very watchable, but nevertheless watchable. The Italian actress Rosalba Neri, aka Sara Bay / Bey, plays the Baron's daughter with a lot of confidence and a lot of sex appeal. She oozes very well desire and seduction. Her performance is rather unidimensional, but she is very pretty and plays a little too much. She is also very open with her performance if you understand my drift. The poor Joseph Cotten, now ruled by European horror movies for money, plays the father in a brief but competent performance. He is the star attraction but left before the film goes into gear. For the rest of the cast, Paul Muller is a little effective as Dr. Charles Marshall, assistant baron and admirer of the girl for quite some time. As the crimes and missing people begin to unfold in the village, the policeman (I do not buy this) Mickey Hargitay starts pumping Tania for answers - despite what you may not think to his satisfaction. The film loses its credibility in the last third of the film, where the suspicious scenario, the poor performances and the dull direction all head further south. The creature is revealed and looks completely ridiculous. The film ends a little abruptly with one of the hasty resolutions prevalent in the 1970s. Although it is not as bad and disgusting as some might wish, Lady Frankenstein is indeed a very flawed film that presents perverse, though intriguing, aspects.
