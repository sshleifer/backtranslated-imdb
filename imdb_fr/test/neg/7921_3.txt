All dogs go to heaven was an original and funny movie; Thanks to their talent, their voices have allowed a cartoon, mainly aimed at children, to become familiar with adult life. It was just interesting enough to be watched by adults outside of something good to watch for kids. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, ADGTH2 is a worthless sequel that tries to make some money on the first game winnings. Charlie Sheen is a passable substitute for Burt Reynolds in this second film and Sheena Easton's voice in some of the songs that are both charming and forgotten makes it an interesting choice as a co-star for that. Add Dom DeLuise from the first movie and you would think it would be a good mix to make this sequel at least relatively decent compared to the first one. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, even with the addition of other good actors. like Bebe Neuwirth in the horrendous role of Anabelle, this film can not be saved from the atrocious production values ​​and animation skills (or lack of skills) present throughout the film. Horrible editing, synchronization of voices and large spaces where the characters' mouths should switch to dialouge but do not combine to make this film an animation project for university trainees instead of the decent sequel it could have been. <br /> Overall, I would say that if you were a big fan of the first movie, I'd give it a very big PASS.
