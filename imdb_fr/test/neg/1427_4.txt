I looked at it like a kid but, not being a fan of Jerry Lewis, I had completely forgotten about it (it's not that it's memorable). The film revolves around identity theft (which seems to be in the program of all comic stars!) - in this case, a German officer - and, although it is not as bad as the says Leonard Maltin (awarding the BOMB rating), it's not quite classic either - certainly miles away from Chaplin's THE THE GRAT DICTATOR (1940), even if he's comparable to a narcissist ! Ironically, the scenes preceding the appearance of the so-called wacky general offer more congratulations than the rather forced humor at the expense of the Nazis! <br /> <br /> The movie was really the last breath of Lewis during his heyday; in fact, it turned out to be his last vehicle out for 10 years (it's painfully obvious here that his particular madness would not have escaped the age of Mel Brooks and Woody Allen)!
