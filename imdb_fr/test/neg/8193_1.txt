^^ contains spoilers ^^ <br /> <br /> This movie is a total shit. Do not look. <br /> <br /> There is no one in this film for anyone, not even to love, with the exception of the woman, who wins by default. Everyone is selfish and many things that do not make sense happen. <br /> <br /> The acting game is at best mediocre and everyone is breathing too much about everything. Nobody can even cry credibly. <br /> <br /> If you leave the room, even for a second, something totally out of the left field will occur, and that will only make NO SENSE WHATEOEVER. <BR /> For example, I left the room for a second, while the character of Jennie Garth slept with her manager. I'm coming back seriously about 4 minutes later (and I'm pretty sure there was an ad somewhere out there) and she's sleeping with this guy from Berko. <br /> <br /> I abandoned this film at the time when Berko had become a donkey for his fiance in the car, because she did not want to cancel the wedding. <br /> <br /> I lost 2 hours of my life. You should not.
