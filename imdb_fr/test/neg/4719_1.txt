this film is what happens when people see as in this particular project witch Blair and say that people run with cameras, acting as a documentary slogan without problem, I can do it and start with a lame idea to create a scenario terrible and heap of actors without talent and start shooting a movie. The plot is that in Africa there is a half-human taste like animals that hunt and kill humans, the inhabitants think it's a demon or an evil spirit, but our wild group is in Africa to obtain proof. No need for more words on the plot, this movie has a 1 out of 10 and I'm trying to find something good to say about this movie, but after long thought nothing would be nothing nada zero.
