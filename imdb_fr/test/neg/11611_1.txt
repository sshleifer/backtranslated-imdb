I'm by no means facetious when I say that this movie was worse than any other movie. Worse than "Batman & Robin". Worse than "Manos, Hands of Fate". Seriously, it's so bad. When people tell me that a movie is terrible, I use the Two Girls scale to understand it. If the film is comparable to "Two Girls", I will not watch it. If it's twice as good, maybe I'll look at it, but only to laugh at the late-comers who paid someone to do it, because a film twice as good as this one would always be a waste.
