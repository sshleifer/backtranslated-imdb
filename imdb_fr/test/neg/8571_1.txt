Balance sheet: non-exploitation films. They have always existed. A few of these come to my mind are the cult film of the Mexican devil Alucarda, The Night of the Demons 2, The Convent and of course Dante Tomasellis Desecration. I can not blame anyone for trying to exploit a religious / holy image and twist it to make it scary. If it's done right, it works. Here is the most recent addition to the sub-genre of the non-exploiting simply titled The Nun. <br /> <br /> The story is about this group of girls who live in a Catholic school. In this school, there is a nun who is particularly cruel to one of the girls. Girls acting in self-defense against the abusive nun accidentally kill her and then decide to bury her and do not tell anyone. Eighteen years later, the nun is back in search of revenge on those who killed her. <br /> <br /> This movie was produced by Brian Yuznas Fantastic Factory. You know, the company that produces horror movies in Spain. Need a reminder of the kind of movies this company produces? Here's a little reminder: Arachnid, Darkness, Romasanta: The werewolf hunt, Rottweiler. You get the picture. Stuart Gordons Dagon is to date the only very good film that this company has produced (in my opinion). That's all. Oh no, wait, I think they also produced Christian Bale's great vehicle, The Machinist. But that's all. So when I deliberately rented this movie, I knew I was not going to watch anything that was terribly good. Despite everything, despite all this mental preparation, I was disappointed. <br /> <br /> One of the only positive things about this film is its smooth appearance. The film has a beautiful cinematography. It does not look like a cheap horror movie. The special effects of the movies were ok, The Nun can travel in the water. Well, it's an image that lends itself to nice FX moments that sometimes slip into a cheese territory, but are sometimes cool enough to watch. I dug this scene with the sister throwing herself on people like a bucket of water. It's not a particularly deadly gesture, but it's a cool visual. There is gore here but not much. A particular scene involving the death of an elevator was cool, but unfortunately, the film reached its peak with this scene. And it was only halfway through. After that, nothing really cool is going on and the film misses the point of annoying boredom. <br /> <br /> The film turns into The Nun that pops up from time to time to scare us, kill someone, then CUT! We go back to the characters who are talking, going through rooms, opening doors, you get the exercise. And I just hate it personally when a horror movie turns into that. People open doors and go to the rooms. Boring! And when the characters speak of his terrible dialogue. In a particularly stupid scene, a character suddenly decides that the nun turns into flesh and blood every time she's in the water, so that's the way to go to try to kill her. And everyone just says OK! And they all work out this plan to kill the nun in a water tank. Now who gave this information to this guy and why did others take it for granted? Who the hell knows, but his scenes like this make the movie stupid. <br /> <br /> And another thing that kept me from enjoying this film is the fact that they used Spanish actors who have a very thick accent. When they try to speak English, it is very difficult to understand what they are trying to say. I would prefer that they be dubbed, then try to understand what they say and become frustrated. The fact that this DVD does not have English subtitles did not help either. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, this is a film that presents smooth graphics, nice sound effects, but a terrible scenario. I guess this proves that you may have the biggest budget or the best special effects, but if your movie has a bad screenplay with awful characters and situations your audience can not connect to, then you always have a bad movie. This was the case of The NUN. <br /> <br /> If you want to really have fun with evil nuns, rent one of the movies I mentioned at the beginning of this article. As for the authors of this film, they should go say ten hail brides and light fifty candles to their holy choice to see if they would be forgiven for making this terribly terrible movie. <br /> <br /> Rating: 2 out of 5
