It's just when a group is spinning, and has only one original member. It's not the same as the classic line-up. All new actors play the leading roles of Rag, Scotty, etc., Ashby being practically the only recurring face of the first film. And it was only a minor note of the first movie, being the only redeemable group of the three guys that Scotty was trying to help meet women. The film is poorly written, with the most stupid dialogue on this side of Armageddon. Even for a movie T & A, this one is a turkey. Even low-budget movie lovers of the 80s would not even miss out on this film, which has no plot and has a lot of bad actors. This film would have been better never to go out. Simply bad.
