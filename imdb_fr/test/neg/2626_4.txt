"Changi" is an Australian comedy / drama set in the Japanese Second World War POW camp bearing this name. The story lies between past events and the present, when older veterans plan a meeting. It's a highly publicized and controversial miniseries here in Australia. The budget has exceeded 6.5 million Australian dollars; historians and veterans have criticized its authenticity; and critics have pillorized the disturbing mixture of comedy and drama (shades of "Pearl Harbor"). The scriptwriter of the series, John Doyle (half of the hit comedy team Roy & H.G.), tried to defend himself with comments on "the characters are composites of real people"; "the troops used comedy to deal with the situation"; "it's only based on real events"; "one of our actors was really there" etc. I have no problem with any of these points. Many fictional and factual dramas came out of the Japanese film P.O.W. Camp experience: "King Rat", "Tenko", "Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence", "Kwai River Bridge", "Paradise Road", "Empire of the Sun", "Blood Oath" and "A Town" Like Alice "Black comedy has often been used successfully in POW's dramas:" Life is Beautiful "," The Great Escape "," Seven Beauties "," Stalag 17 "," The Colditz Story "and even "The Hogan Heroes". So, why is "Changi" a monumental failure? - The game in "Changi" is consistently excellent, the music and cinematography are good - it's the writing and the staging that have let it down. Each scene seemed to give me waves of déjà vu. When Anthony Hayes is forced to stand under a blazing sun, I thought, "Did not I see Alec Guinness doing that in" Bridge on the River Kwai "?" Sudden flashes in surrealist song and dance recalled Dennis Potter's "singing detective", but without the finesse. This borrowing happened so often, it was a kind of lazy writing made of copy-paste, rather than tribute. The constant interconnection between past and present stories has made me unable to focus on one or the other. The front flash and the back flash can be a useful tool - here it has kept me away from the characters where the intensity was needed. The "business" is exaggerated - every conversation seemed to include "the bloody crows stone" and such, that I said "I understood the point, I know they are Australian". Cultural stereotypes extended to the young Japanese officer too sadistic British and Japanese; stuck British officer; Japanese commander wiser; I had fun, I loved the Australians, etc. I thought of watching "Hogan's Heroes on the Kwai River". After 3 episodes, I'm erased.
