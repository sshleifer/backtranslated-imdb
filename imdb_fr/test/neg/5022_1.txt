Do not kill me fans, but I have something to say about it. <br /> <br /> Pros: The most moderately interesting season that I have watched among all seasons of Inuyasha has just been the Shichinintai Bow. Unlike the rest of the seasons, I personally think that this one has more of a real plot and these mercenaries; God, these are such nice characters. Too bad they were killed. Of course, I would write a 15-page essay, one of the reasons I love Shichinintai so much, but it would be boring for some of you. So this series actually has nice characters. I will miss Bankotsu ... poor, poor little psycho boy. <br /> <br /> Disadvantages: Apart from Shichinintai, the series was generally boring, repetitive and some extremely irritating characters. Kagome for example: she reacts excessively to my taste; she acts like Yuka of Elfen Lied. Inuyasha: It's a strong dog demon with a huge sword. What is so unique? He has adorable dog ears! Tch. Sesshomaru is all talk, no action and very arrogant. Naraku must be the naughty villain who has ever existed in the world of cartoons. Miroku and Sango ... they have color but they seem to be too much on the sidelines. But what bothers me the most is the fact that they have absolutely no common sense. Rumiko Takahashi did a lot better than that. I have already seen it. <br /> <br /> If you like the series with a lot of action, without annoying love triangle, without excessive repetition, it is not for you then.
