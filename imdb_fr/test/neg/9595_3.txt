I saw this movie yesterday on a public service channel. They had advertised it as a horrible movie, so I was attracted to it, and I was not disappointed. <br /> <br /> A group of 18 to 19 year olds visit an excavation site in an old Viking castle in Denmark to try to discover the myth of the Berserker Vikings. Strange things happen: something is in the forest and people are starting to disappear. <br /> <br /> What really bothers me about this film is that the story is supposed to take place in Denmark, where I'm lucky enough to live. live. There were so many places in the film where the Hollywood style overlapped the Danish reality. It really made the acting game and the drama to me so ridiculous. <br /> <br /> You never see the characters interact with any of their environments. It feels like a mini-Hollywood in Denmark and it would take away all credibility to the film. When, at some point, you hear someone speak "Old Danish", it sounds exactly like modern Swedish. Really bad research, considering that the director comes from Denmark. <br /> <br /> The characters in the movie used a GPS and maps, which is really fun, because Denmark is about the size of your garden. Nomatter, wherever you are, there is never more than 50 km from the sea and 500 meters from civilization. And if you are in a castle, there will be tourists everywhere. We see a lot of forest overviews in the film, and sometimes we see what appears to be North American vegetation (?) The story did not really attract me, maybe because the game actor was so bad. When the characters see peatland creatures for the first time, they are not even afraid. I guess their acting skills were insufficient to display realistic emotions. In the end, there is an unexpected twist, but that did not impress me, because I did not really care. <br /> <br /> Peatland creatures are cheap, but they have the potential to be scary. Unfortunately, they fail because we see them in the forest when the characters arrive at the castle. In addition, there are no really scary scenes because the creatures of the bog are usually standing up. <br /> <br /> Anyway, conclusion: without considering the facts, the movie is your typical B-horror movie. I guess people in other countries can benefit more. As long as you are not aware of the reality, it does not matter. Just as I think of the United States as a great action movie set, anyone can think of Denmark as a forest with a castle ... and undead in a swamp.
