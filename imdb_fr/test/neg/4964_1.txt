Looking at these critics and seeing all these high notes, I am convinced that large amounts of red corn syrup will please all brain fools. This film is beyond useless. All snapshots of a slasher movie without any substance. I'm sure I could go into the details of the film, but why bother to summarize it? Obviously, everyone wants Mandy Lane and she apparently does not want any of the guys. Throughout the movie you will see this. <br /> <br /> When she stops being friends with the typical boy trapped in a loser from the friends zone, he becomes ballistic and when she goes on a trip in the middle of nowhere (of course) he begins to chase them one by one. That seems right so far, is not it? But what made this movie incredible was when it was discovered that not only is her losing friend the killer, but she is too. The plan was beyond ridicule. Let's kill all our friends together and then kill each other. They give no reason to want to do that and, given the behavior of Mandy Lane's "Goody Too Shoes", you're gratifying your head as to what really motivates these characters to do what they do. It's sad ... this movie had a lot of potential, but the director or writer apparently can not relate to the audience anyway.
