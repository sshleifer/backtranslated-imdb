I do not leave the IMDb comments on the movies but this .... this movie was bad. very bad. I did almost everything in quick advance, stopping where I hoped the acting had improved since the last scene, to continue with the fast advances. Plot of formula - once the obvious murderers were dismissed, there was only one left. And it was in the first five minutes. Scene by scene, I had the impression to have already read the scenario because there were no surprises, no mystery. The character of Tori ... bad, bad actor. A real waste of time on DVD and an option "Let's go to bed early" if it's the only thing on TV. If you watch this movie, you will realize that you will never be able to recover the time you have just lost.
