I'm not sure what it is but there seems to be a curse with regard to movies on the elusive Bigfoot. There is still no film that cleverly addresses the subject, nor film that creates a real suspense. "Legend of Boggy Creek" (1972) and the first film titled "Sasquatch" (1978) became minor classics of worship, but neither were memorable. Both films were intended for a family audience, thus preventing anyone from being scared. "Harry & The Hendersons" (1987) is the first big budget movie to use Bigfoot, with a stunning Rick Baker creature drawing. However, they too have chosen to target a younger audience, but this time as a comedy (as "Bigfoot" in 1995). I have long waited for someone to approach the subject as a thriller, perhaps in the vein of "Jaws" or "Predator". When I saw this in my local video store, I thought my dream had come true. Boy, was I wrong? Lance Henriksen plays the role of a billionaire who leads an expedition to the Pacific Northwest hoping to find his daughter while she was aboard a small plane that crashed into the mountains. The premise is interesting and looks promising. The truth is that it never creates real suspense. I have never been interested in any of the characters, each of them being very two-dimensional and rather bland. Even Henriksen, always trustworthy, seems to have telephoned in his interpretation. Every time he appears on the screen, he just looks bored. It should be like there is no action strictly speaking for the first hour of the film. As for the creature, where should I start? I thought at least we would have a cool monster running in the woods, but instead we would have this bald man (yes, I said "bald!") With black skin and fur stains here and there. Imagine a cross between "Swamp Thing" and Chaka from "Land of the Lost" and you'll get the idea. Nothing like the illustrations on the cover box, I assure you. Sloppy montages and a neglected staging also add to the confusion, as half of the time, everything seemed out of sequence, while the other half of the film was constantly used with those long and slow detachments (which made no sense or would serve no purpose). They even stole the entire P.O.V infrared vision at the "Predator" creature, which seemed too silly and out of place to be effective. All that may prove to be that Hollywood should simply forget to try to make more Bigfoot movies because they have not created a movie yet. So far, each of them has been as scary as an episode of "In Search Of" 3/10
