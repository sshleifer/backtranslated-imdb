This frightening piece of guts was (conveniently) loosely based on a true story involving two members of my family (played by Jack Thompson and Jacqueline Mackenzie). <br /> <br /> This film is shocking; Apart from the fact that it was not a quality film, it does not account for the loss of such a close family member and completely omits those who were really affected by the tragedy. of real life. <br /> <br /> As for the director; he managed to take advantage of the misfortune of a family for the price of a Porsche. <br /> <br /> If I could give a zero, I would have. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie at all costs.
