When I rented this DVD, I knew very well that it could very well be one of the worst movies of my life. But to say that it was one of the worst films I have ever seen would be to put it lightly. I wonder if any legal action can be brought against the people who authorized the production of this film. I mean, the funding had to come from somewhere, someone had to put money to make it happen !! ?? <br /> <br /> I would identify several production values ​​that led to the failure of this film, but this film violated all the production standards of the universe. I could not go through the whole movie because I was getting stunned by the dreadful filming techniques. I can not tell you how many zoning scenes I have just finished because of the inexplicably horrible dialogue. <br /> <br /> I feel I have been permanently marked for life. If you watched this movie before receiving this warning, you should consider creating a support group with me for the poor who have seen this monstrosity.
