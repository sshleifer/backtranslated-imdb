This film was so awful that I do not even know where to start ... The only good thing I can say is that Luke Perry gave a good performance. The whole movie was everywhere, there was no explanation on the cause (only theories) of the eruptions, nor on the reasons for their solutions, nor on the reason why it would work. It was ridiculous! All the characters and the relationship between them were so cheesy, you just want to laugh !! There was no background to any of them. The relationship "love" seemed to have been added to the script, she was so clumsy. There is a man of the army; great black general with a cigar standing in the mouth, with the "AaarrrGH! I am the man!" attitude, such a pathetic villain. The two acolytes, who are supposed to be geniuses, act like two little boys of 16 years old. And then, to create an action, they decide to put a stone on someone's shoulder. For the rest of the film, he coughs as if he's about to die of pneumonia or something ... help the plan to do who knows what ... it's never good sign when you find yourself laughing out loud in the middle of the dramatic scene ... in a word; Do not waste your time!
