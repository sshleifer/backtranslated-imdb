First and foremost, this movie has the most stupid plot of any movie I've ever seen, and unfortunately, I had to see this one. One day, I was flipping through the chains and I came across this ugly excuse for a film, which confirmed what I had been saying for a long time. Carrot Top is not an actor and is NOT funny in the lowest sense of the word. He behaves like a great comedian and thinks he's attracting public attention. Frankly, he has the acting ability of a 10-year-old class clown, thinking that the ability of less than a 10-year-old to compare them to Carrot Top would be a serious insult to their reputations. This movie tries to be funny using matte liners that all seem to come from 50s cartoons. In the end, I would have done anything to erase my memory of this movie, but unfortunately the memories remain with me. The only thing I can do is warn others to never watch this movie. However, this proves that the rumors are true. Carrot Top is worthless.
