MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS. This film was the worst film of all time. I could not even look at everything, it was so bad. This film is actually worse than the scarecrow killer that says a lot. It was worse than the terror terror that at least terror was sometimes funny. Even the gore in the movie was not good. The shootings were wrong and the acting was worse. Please do yourself a favor and skip this one. If you see it at the rental store, run the other way. There is nothing good about this movie. If you want to see a good movie about the scarecrow, watch Night of the Scarecrow or Pumpkin Head. If you want to see a new OK cheese movie, then look at Scarecrow. I rate this movie at 0.2 out of 10. That's just how horrible this movie is. THE WORST FILM NEVER.
