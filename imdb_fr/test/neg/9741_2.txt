Stanley Stupid (Tom Arnold) and his wife Joan like to sleep in bed with their heads under the blankets and feet on the pillows. They have two children also challenged, Buster and Petunia. One day, Mr. Stupid notices that their garbage is gone. There must be someone stealing them from the sidewalk. He goes on rollerblades after the garbage truck. When he finally arrives at the dump, he is surprised to learn not only that "other people have been stolen" was also stolen, but that there is a secret organization meeting at the dump. He is determined to defeat the world's diapers, it seems. Meanwhile, Petunia and Buster go to the police station and a Chinese restaurant in search of their parents, because Joan also disappears. Will they make their way through their problems? This is just a stupid, stupid movie, with the culprit being the terrible scenario. The books of Allard and Marshall are hysterical and only a few situations from these books lead to this film. Arnold is actually quite nice, because Mr. Stupid and the other cast members are very hard at making the film work. The production values ​​are very high, the dog and the cat belonging to the Stupids adding a little punch to the film. But all this is for nothing, because the plot is wandering and weak. Maybe someday, someone will try to translate the fun Allard books on the big screen. Therefore, if you like to laugh, rent something else while you wait for a new production and, above all, go get the books. But avoid being stupid, because anyone watching this movie until the end could hardly be called intelligent.
