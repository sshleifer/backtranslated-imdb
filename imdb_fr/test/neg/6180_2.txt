Here is what is good about "The Slaughter Rule": <br /> <br /> - Ryan Gosling, Clea Duvall and David Morse all give excellent performances. Gosling is, as always, really remarkable. The places are often breathtaking. <br /> <br /> Here is what is serious with "The rule of slaughter:" <br /> <br /> - All the rest. The script is horribly confused. And although I can certainly enjoy a film not "good in his skin", this film is just boring. Good performances do not make it possible to make up a movie with a stupid premise and a scenario filled with throw lines that often do not even make sense. The transition to the first hour had become a chore. <br /> <br /> I got hooked because of Gosling, but I finally got a job and changed channels. The spoilers here relayed the end. I did not miss much. Do yourself a favor - if you want a good Gosling movie, take a look at "The Believer". <br /> <br /> My score: 2 out of 10.
