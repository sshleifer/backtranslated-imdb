What makes this movie so bad? Is sub-juvenile humor lame? Could that be the horrible "trend" suck ass music? Maybe the uninvited go nowhere? Or maybe even the fact that Traci Lords gives his worst actor performance ever and adds an insult to injury that keeps him all his clothes throughout this shitty sandwich. Whatever the reason for this movie, it does not matter. I never wanted to watch a movie with Dean Cameron instead of what I was watching in my life, but "Ski School" is a comic genius masterpiece compared to this tragedy. <br /> <br /> My Grade: F <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Nikol Nesbitt, Buffy Tyler and Suzanne Stokes free all their tits from Tupperware <br /> <br /> Where I saw them : Starz on Demand
