The main problems of 'Saw' are related to huge scripting errors that only a non-critical viewer can simply avoid. The main question is what is the goal of the killer lying in the middle of the ground. The film tries to show that the goal of the murderer is to cause harm and to destroy his victims, he loves to play with the lives of others and to feel the master of their fears and their setbacks. So, why does he pretend to be dead between the two main characters? Incredible improbability: Can a man claim to be dead for more than an hour or two without moving a single muscle or even without breathing so as not to be discovered by two men in the same room? This makes no sense except to be the final effect (d) of the film. The killer seems to always have control along the plot and if he is lying like a corpse, it can not be possible. Finally it does not work. The ideal place for the murderer should have been a darker and untouchable shadow behind the false shadow (the nurse) but not the floor of the white room. The director should not have shown the face of the killer and perhaps the site where he is hidden. Then the movie would be a very good thriller. However, "Saw" is just a fiasco. Hitchcock, please, come back.
