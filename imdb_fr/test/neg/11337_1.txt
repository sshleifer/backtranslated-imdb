After "Traumschiff Surprise", you thought that German comedy could not get worse? It can. This comedy is a new attempt to perpetuate the stereotypes of homosexual men masked as a beautiful comedy. The original concept (openly gay men in football sports) would have been an excellent opportunity to erase some stereotypes, but ... The film's true message seems to be how homosexual men are so different from straight men. Absolutely stupid, of course. Even gay sex is considered less valuable than straight sex. This film only tries to serve a heterosexual audience who wants to laugh at male stereotypes. Well, do not waste your time on German comedy films!
