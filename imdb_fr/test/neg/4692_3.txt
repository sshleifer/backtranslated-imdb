Esther Williams plays a romantic water ski secretary without ties who wants to stop "walking on the water" and being the wife of a man; Van Johnson and Tony Martin are his potential choices for a husband. In spite of some beautiful aquatic footage filmed at Cypress Gardens, Florida, this romantic comedy is terribly obsolete. Under the direction of director Charles Walters, everything is designed to appear intentionally harmless, which does not leave much resistance. Even the great moments of Esther in the water are not quite up to the hypnotic jumps of her other swimming vehicles, although they are preferable to the others with the men, who are both colorless. Carroll Baker, in her film debut as Martin's angry ex-girlfriend, is the brightest in the group. Fragile things, indeed. * 1/2 of ****
