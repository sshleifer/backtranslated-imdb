"Mr. and Mrs. Smith" is one of Hitchcock's first not-well-known American films. But if "Lifeboat" (which unfortunately also belongs to this category) is an underestimated masterpiece, all the films signed by the master of the suspense of this time (early 40s) are not really worth it. to be seen. And to be honest, not discovering this movie is not really a loss. <br /> <br /> "Mr. and Mrs. Smith" is an average comedy and conventional, where it is quite difficult to find the contact of Hitchcock. You may be able to see her shadow (which is not much) in the cruelty Carole Lombard is sometimes capable of (but she is well hidden in an impersonal package), in a vertigo scene where two of the characters are trapped in a fair attraction, and perhaps in the character of the mother. And that's about it! Even for the Hitchcock fan, there is little to connect. <br /> <br /> And for comedy fans to aim, there is not much more: none of the situation is exaggerated enough to be really funny. are far from the masterpieces of Hawks for example. And if one or two scenes are quite amusing, Hitchcock's filmography is not even the funniest that has created comic situations in almost all his films (even "Psycho" can be considered filled with very dark humor). So, there is really little to save in this movie, it can not bother anyone (or maybe just the two hardcore fans of Hitchcock and the Screwball comedy, who are in love with Carole Lombard), remains one of the debut not very famous American Hitchcock movie.
