At the end of this infernal waste, a friend and I solemnly swore never to speak again of the way we had just destroyed the last 90 minutes of our life. This film is completely useless, a two-dimensional hero and a heroine to whom one can not give an impression whether they survive or not, and some of the naughtiest villains who have ever darkened the screen of the horror genre. To prove again how completely useless this movie was, I would have liked to add a summary of the plot, but I can not write fiction. All in all, the only reason I think anyone would ever want to see this movie is if they had just murdered their whole community and were looking for a self-afflicted punishment that will haunt you for all the years to come. !
