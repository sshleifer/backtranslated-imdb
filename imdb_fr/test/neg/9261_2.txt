I bought this film for 99 cents at K-Mart several years ago (with "Hawken's Breed"). Nothing to do with Gabriel Byrne and Amanda Donahoe is definitely worth it. It was not. "Dark Obsession" (the title under which I bought it) was slightly higher than "Hawken's Breed" (rated IMBD at 2.4), but not enough to even allow me to keep it at home. I threw both films in the trash. <br /> <br /> This thing fails on so many levels that it's hard to reduce it, but let's just say it's scary, unbelievable, boring, hedonistic, confusing and even 100 minutes, way too long. <br /> <br /> I love Byrne as an actor, but this schlock really looks bad on his resume.
