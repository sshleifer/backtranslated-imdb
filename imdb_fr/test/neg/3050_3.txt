Before Stan Laurel became the smallest half of the greatest comedy team of all time, he worked under contract with Broncho Billy Anderson in a series of cheap movies, many of which were parodies of Hollywood's great traits. Most of Laurel's "parody" movies are only slightly funny, let alone funny for the modern audience who have not seen the original movie that Laurel parodies. Fortunately, "Mud and Sand" makes a film still well known: "Blood and Sand", with Rudolph Valentino. "Blood and Sand" was released just nine weeks before this parody, which gives you an idea of ​​how quickly Broncho Billy's films were shot, edited and distributed. <br /> <br /> Various sources (including IMDb) indicate that Stan Laurel's The character of this film is called Rhubarb Vaselino, with a final "o". I projected a copy of 'Mud and Sand' with the original titles (in Hobo typeface). I point out that Laurel's role is actually called Rhubarb Vaseline, with an 'e'. But I agree that 'Vaselino' is funnier. Laurel copies the elaborate favorites that Valentino wore in "Blood and Sand" (he should have done them longer!), And there is a parody of Valentino's sartorial scene in this film, which made the audience pale in 1922. A señorita named Carmen in the original film is parodied here as Caramel (a girl in which I would like to bite with teeth). <br /> <br /> This film (like the original) is apparently taking place in Spain, but there is a prohibition gag. Laurel uses a distinctive gesture of tipping his hat, which could have become a trademark for him (like Hardy's distinctive twiddle tie), but I've never seen it in any other Laurel film . There is a funny dialogue: Rhubarb Vaseline tells other matadors to "Save a bull for me". When Vaseline becomes a successful toreador, a lackey tells her "The bull is without, sir" ... which is funny, but I was disappointed that Laurel did not answer "Without WHAT?". <br /> <br /> There's a funny moment here that was certainly not planned when Vaseline comes to the auditions of the bullfighter. Laurel wrestles in the arena and - before he can say "corrida querida" - he throws a bull over the fence, where he lands with a thump near the other listeners. The bull is obviously a fake, but the gag is funny anyway ... and, yes, there is a title card with a joke about "throwing the bull". The fortuitous moment occurs when Laurel repeats the gag and Vaseline throws a second bull over the fence. It lands on his buttocks and stands for a moment before tipping. Very funny! If someone planned this gag in this quick comedy, I salute the unknown gagsmith ... and the technician who manipulated the bull to land in that position. It is more likely that this happened by chance, and the director and editor were smart enough to keep it. <br /> <br /> During the silent period, whenever Hollywood made a big-budget feature movie that was taking place anywhere. do not speak English, it was a common cinematographic device that consisted in showing a text or an inscription in local jargon, then dissolving it in one plan in English. I was surprised that this low-budget comedy spent money copying this device here: we see a billboard outside the bullfight with a message in Spanish, then it dissolves in the same English text. Unfortunately, the photography in this cheapo movie is so dark that the effect is lost. <br /> <br /> The actresses of this film are attractive ... including Broncho Billy's wife, Leona Anderson, and Stan Laurel's de facto wife, Mae Dahlberg. ; this last makes briefly a pretty dance. (Mae had danced in Stan's vaudeville number.) I was surprised to see Charlie Chaplin's half-brother, Wheeler Dryden, in a brief role, since Chaplin had nothing to do with this movie. In "Mud and Sand," Laurel gives a fun performance that is nothing like his later Stanley character ... but this movie is a lot less funny than his brilliant work with Oliver Hardy. My rating: barely 3 out of 10. NOTE FROM TRIVIA: Twenty-three years later, in Stan Laurel's latest American film - The Bullfighters (1945) - he once again played a Spanish bullfighter (with his post-Spanish Spanish voice). doubled ). Coincidentally, this film used footage from 'Blood and Sand': not Valentino's film, but the remake of Tyrone Power. "Mud and Sand" is funnier than "The Bullfighters", but not much.
