Famous as the British film is so bad that it was necessary to offer it for free with a newspaper, the quality of this "thriller" of the Sub-Foundation for the cinematography for children can be guessed thanks to the abnormal number of 10/10 votes that he obtains and to the great number of laudatory critics posters without history of publication and without other critics to their name. The regulars know what it means, the gullible can be deceived. If they dive into the waters of it, they will not last long before training. Technically unfit with the boom of the microphone in shooting or the reflections of the visible crew, it continues forever in a sub-DAVINCI forgotten code at $ 5 per day. The end is just insulting but do not worry. It's not like you're going that far!
