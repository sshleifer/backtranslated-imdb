I will not be too hard on this show because I enjoyed the first season, but then things got worse. The concept is nothing special. This is a young girl named Casey, who is trying to deal with a new half-brother, Derek, and her noisy and raw family, while gradually imposing her princess flags on each of them. In season 1, the story was really interesting. At the time, I liked Casey because she was smart, strong, independent and conservative. She was well brought up and deep. I felt bad when her new half-brother had harassed her in her new school. It was a perfectionist, but not as annoying as later episodes. Oh, and she came out with a nice guy, who is now described as one of Derek's idiots friends. The season caught the real tension that the show's title was trying to capture. <br /> <br /> Now, I can not say that the show has really deteriorated because the story is sometimes interesting, but I prefer now Derek. instead of Casey. Now there is little or no interaction between the two siblings. If they interact, it is only briefly. Oh, and I do not want Dasey fans in my eyes. People are called INCEST, even if they are half-brothers. My tolerance can only go so far, but that's not the question. <br /> <br /> It's strange. Derek, as an antagonist, has become increasingly sensitive over time, while Casey, the supposed protagonist, is more neurotic and inimitable than before. I like the way young children have more air time, but parents are even more naive than before. But that's not the biggest problem ... <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, we're forced to see everything from Casey's point of view, with lame and nauseating background music. She has become more stupid and superficial with time. In one episode, she began to whine and wanted her boyfriend to be more chivalrous, so she voluntarily threw food on herself and blamed Derek. Now, what happened to being a strong and independent feminist? I did not watch much the fourth season, but I hear she's dating a guy named Truman, a fool and an arrogant. Oh, I remember this episode of fencing. She constantly reminds him that she does not like him, is afraid of being "stuffed" by a sword and, in the end, clings to him because she can "manipulate" him? What is going on? Why go with a guy like that in the first place. The first season, Casey would have hit. Or maybe that would have been my reaction. Oh, and she's a cheerleader. Not that it's a bad thing, but I think she fell on her head at one of her practices. And in an episode of the prom, she cried because she could not find the "dress in her dreams" and was not completely satisfied until she became queen of the ball. One thing I noticed was that, no matter how bad the situation is, Casey is trying to tell us about her life at the end (she gets the guy she wants, Derek gets some kind of revenge, all the the world loves him, etc.) Derek is still quite immature, but I see that he has really matured. I do not see why many people hate Sally. She looks nice and it's good to see Derek in a serious relationship with someone close to his heart rather than "playing on the field". He also treats Edwin slightly better and is a good brother of Marti. <br /> <br /> Really, the show is mediocre and I judged it weak, because despite the development of certain characters, the character I admired now, become like any "teenage queen to the fashion "that you can see anywhere on television But it was good while it lasted.
