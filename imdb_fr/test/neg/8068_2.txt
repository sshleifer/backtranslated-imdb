so if a guy meets you and says, "I want you to look at my erection! do not worry, he may want you to watch the movie he did on building his house. Yes! it's the only thing happening in this movie! it's like the worst BEEP Warholian I've ever seen! it's like filming the inside of your toilet before you chase it away; in fact, it's less interesting to watch than that. <br /> <br /> but if you look closely at Lennon's erection, know that he has a lot of background noise in too. I mean, really, it's as if the building was attacked by space mutants from hell or something! during this time, the current building grows as the erection can also (in almost 20 minutes, what accomplishment). <br /> <br /> So if someone asks you to watch his erection, make sure he wants to record everything on video.
