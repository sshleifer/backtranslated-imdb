I made a big mistake by going to see this movie. It's the lottery to go see movies, I guess. After five minutes, you knew it was going to be a mess and I fought hard to stay in my place - the old feeling of "losing two hours of your life". <br /> <br /> The fundamental problem is that, without even mentioning the entire thread of comments "of historical accuracy", the script is painful, painful, bad. <br /> <br /> The first thirty minutes could have been spread over an hour to give a plausible result, real, development of the plot. Instead, he went from one non-dramatic "dramatic" event to another. To make the girl cry at the beginning of the film is meaningless because the public has no emotional attachment to anything at this stage. And all this walking at sunset through the field of long grass at the end, what the hell was it? <br /> <br /> Even the excellent Ed Harris could not save this one. One could almost feel his pain in some of the lines he had to pronounce. The most fabulously horrible was, for no apparent reason, he looks at the girl as she copies his work in his apartment, she looks up, all that becomes a little vague romantic kind of lighting (or am I dreaming) ), and he says, with authority in his voice, <br /> <br /> "WASH ME." <br /> <br /> And she gets up and lava, with a sponge. "Wash me" WTF? It's hilarious. <br /> <br /> And then there was the music. The long extended session where it was only to lead Beethoven and the 9th Symphony echoing in the surround sound to the cinema and the choir waiting, waiting, staying quietly there for what seems like an eternity. And then, finally, embark on a huge sound. It was amazing and I dared to say it to tears. <br /> <br /> This is where the film won two stars. The only part of the film where Beethoven could say exactly what he meant. <br /> <br /> And I believed him.
