It's a very, very bad movie. However, it is good to make fun of horrible ideas and "special" effects. The plot is centered around a European space agency that discovers a 10th planet that revolves around the Earth. They send a human mission (they went to Mars and have yet to discover this planet, is anyone stupid enough to fall in love with it?) On the planet and can you believe it is a reflection of the planet from which they come. Most things are predictable from that moment. Honestly, from the title of the movie, you can guess just about everything. The only thing surprising here is a space program run by Eurpoeans :) There is really no excuse for the concept or the execution of the plot. So, it's good to laugh or maybe if you're in a state of altered consciousness.
