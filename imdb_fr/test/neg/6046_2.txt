An original of the Sci-Fi network. Not the best. Not far from the worst. An electrician (Richard Grieco) discovers a "key" to open a gateway to a parallel Earth invaded by mutant spiders. The mutations are controlled by a gigantic alien queen for thirty years. She has already devoured the population of this parallel world that resembles Chicago minus the inhabitants. Guess what? Now she has to find another world to feed herself. The electrician leads a team of four people who reluctantly end up with the task of saving the world. The final showdown is probably the best part of the whole movie. The cast also includes Richard Yearwood, Colin Fox, Kate Greenhouse, Jason Jones and David Newman. One would have thought that the science fiction network could have spent more money on special effects.
