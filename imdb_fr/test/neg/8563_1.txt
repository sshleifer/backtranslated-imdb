I can not believe they even released such a movie. The only good acting game came from the water in the movie. It must be one of the worst (if not the worst) movie I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> The only scary part of the movie is the bad acting of the actors. , this movie deserves a 0. <br /> <br /> The story, and if you can call it the plot of the movie, seems to have been written by a high school student. Ofcaurse, you have to wonder if it might have been better to have better actors. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor, wait for it to be broadcast on television. <br /> <br /> AND EVEN THEN IT WILL BE A WAVE OF TIME.
