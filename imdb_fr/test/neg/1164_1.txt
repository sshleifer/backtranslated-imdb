It's the worst film I've ever seen and believe me, I've seen a lot of bad movies I love the horror, but it was horrible. There was not a single scene in this film where I was scared. All actors had to be people found at a bus stop 20 minutes before filming. I would have liked Blockbutser to give me back my 99 cents. The game was terrible. The writing was incredibly bad. Someone had to watch this movie before it came out and had to know it was terrible. I would be embarrassed to associate my name with this monstrosity. Do not rent this movie. If you do, do not turn it around so that no other poor soul will ever make the mistake of praising it.
