There are many "bad" movies. Tune in to Channel 5 every night of the week, and you risk a shocking daily effort from one or another filmmaker. There may have been movies that caused me more pain - were harder to watch - than that, but in terms of writing, drama, staging, cinematography and film base, Inbetweeners is a really dreadful effort and must be avoided all costs. The only laugh he gave me was in the DVD's behind-the-scenes documentary, in which the film's geeky director, Darren Fisher, explains how his screenplay has drawn "talent" into the project! Never underestimate the power of self-delusion. <br /> <br /> Darren Fisher - The British Answer to Edward D. Wood Jr.!
