When I heard the movie go out and the theme of its subject, I felt very curious. But when I saw it was the biggest disappointment of my life. Technically speaking, the sound is mediocre, you can talk about men's dialogues that were redone in the studio and were poorly done in the final mix. Secondly, the photography is mediocre, some of the movies show soldiers with night vision goggles, and the way the director of photography manages to get the "dark night" illuminated, as if they were in a real base military no reference used of the moonlight, my god! Moreover, most of the actions are really mediocre, we can not believe the role of the wife of one of the soldiers, his performance is quite mediocre. <br /> <br /> Great disappointment, shame of the jury who chose to send this film to represent Colombia at the Oscars.
