It's really the worst movie I've ever seen. the acting was awful, the story was also bad. it was a good idea, though. If this film had better cinematics and better actors, I might have something better to say. Edgar Allen Poe was a great Gothic writer and this movie just destroyed him. why people must always kill good stories by making bad movies. the only good thing is that the killer put the head under the floor with tape, it was pretty good. the ax was horrible, there was absolutely no suspense. and also when the killer is chasing everyone in the end, he was going from one place to another in just a few seconds, that makes no sense.
