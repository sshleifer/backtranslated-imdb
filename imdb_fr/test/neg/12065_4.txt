It's hard to be too hard on Brad Sykes, a hard-working guy who does what he likes, there's an honesty about him that often seems to be missing from other microbudget managers. Take a look at the tiny credits of the team on Camp Blood. There is nothing usual about thanking everyone for the pizza they have eaten, his Brad and his friends and that's it, no pretentious waste. Jennifer Ritchkoff is not your average horror film star, but does well enough to barely notice you, Bethany Zolt looks like a star and Joseph Haggerty is so funny that it hurts. The clown is not really a nasty original horror movie, but the design is good, Shemp Moseley is doing a decent job to bring it to life and the picture is coming up against the rural background. Camp Blood is a horror as a blue and elemental collar, it's not a good thing, not a bad thing, just a thing.
