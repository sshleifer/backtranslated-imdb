Doing well divorced American with more money than brains buys a dilapidated villa in Tuscany. (Much more money, while looking for the price, she succeeds then to prepare sumptuous buffets for her workers and walks indefinitely in Italy without work or apparent means of subsistence.) An endless boredom and the inevitable Italian lover ensue; It is a film of chicks in the most pejorative sense of the term. Lane acts as a helpless and unintelligent teenager ingenuity - which clashes dynamically with her discolored glances - and breaks through a variety of cardboard stereotypes (mainly Italian), dikes, divas, senile contessas and gigolos along the way. Inflated with useless scenes, the most ridiculous being a senseless and useless reconstruction of the scene of the fountain of La Dolce Vita. (A similar idea was used in an effective and appropriate narrative context in "Only You", Norman Jewison's very superior ode to Italy and romance). "Tuscan Sun" is perhaps the most vacant piece of cinema in the last decade, despite its well-considered views of Italy. Negative bonus point for the foreign lover parachuted at the last minute to provide the required end to Hollywood for its targeted audience of brainwashed housewives at Oprah. Avoid at all costs unless, of course, you consider Oprah and Dr. Phil as clever speeches.
