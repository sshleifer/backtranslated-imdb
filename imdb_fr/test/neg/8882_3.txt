With such a title, you will be forgiven for thinking that this movie is about the great painter Goya. After half an hour, you decide that it is rather the Roman Catholic Inquisition. With even more latitude, it may be just a snapshot of the period. With a sordid characterization, too many axes to deal with and a lack of consideration for the facts, Milos Forman prepares a colorful but chaotic and disjointed mishmash that fails for all three reasons. <br /> <br /> Milos Forman (who lost his Jewish father to the Nazi concentration camps), is the great director who painted the Mozart artist as a jester and took it away with him. Earned prizes for that, actually. His life in Czechoslovakia gave him a taste of various repulsive regimes, including communism. He also directed One Vol over the cuckoo's nest, equally impressive but quite impressive. So, at age 74, how does he come to offer us this mess? In Goya's ghosts, Goya is an abducted step of buffoon. The main character is Brother Lorenzo, interpreted with passion by Javier Bardem. Natalie Portman is as dynamic as Goya's model, Ines (and later in the film, her own daughter). The tenuous connection with Goya is that he can paint them both. <br /> <br /> Lorenzo tortures (then rapes) Ines whom he suspects of being a Jew. His father tortures Lorenzo. Napoleon rushes to liberate Spain (briefly). Ines leaves the dungeon in which the Church left her and seeks her child. Goya is still painting but has become deaf. His main concern seems to be helping Ines. And so on. <br /> <br /> Historically, Goya was also a historian. As Forman had unfortunately given up the idea of ​​a biographical film by Goya the painter, this fact alone could have been used to bring together the entire film ?? a big slice of history seen by Goya. But the painter is too tangential to receive weight. Similarly, a document on the terrors of the inquisition should be done ?? Compared to other despotic orders over time, the Holy See was forgiven with hardly a confession. Although one can ask if Forman is competent enough to be certain to be able to rely on a factual account. <br /> <br /> "I thought this could be the heart of a wonderful story," he says in the production notes. "There were many parallels between the communist society in which we lived and the Spanish Inquisition." But the story is too tenuous to hold our attention. Against our expectations and with a background of something major (the life of a great painter, the horrors of the Inquisition and even the French Revolution), we are rather asked to feel involved in a craze concocted (so nice ) from Goya. The result is that we feel cheated. <br /> <br /> The details of the background are appalling. Goya became deaf in 1792 (at the beginning of the film), not 15 years later. Napoleon is as credible as a cut of a pack of cereals. We see the Church pronounce a death sentence (whereas the normal procedure was for the Church to insist that the secular arm does this dirty work). The battles seem too choreographed and scenic. Chest pieces of naked, free breasts make up for it. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, the production values ​​are generally good. The colors are bright, the pace is excellent (at least until we give up a story that is worth it.) Bardem is excellent, and Portman is a joy until it rushes like crazy . Even if it does not say much about Goya, what he says is beautiful, even if it is superficial and rather irrelevant. <br /> <br /> I had a drunken conversation late in the night when my friends and I had traded, if you could pick a director to represent your life, who would it be? In his record, Forman should unfortunately be at the bottom of my list.
