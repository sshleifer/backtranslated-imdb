This film has been compared to the hilarious British comedy "A fish called Wanda", although I do not see why. The only link I can find is Monty Python (Eric Idle in "Nuns", John Cleese and Michael Palin in "Wanda"). Otherwise, both are incomparable. <br /> <br /> Idle and Robbie Coltrane are two gangsters who want to get out of the market before they get dead, so they decide to get ripped off and leave for Rio. When the fugue goes wrong, the two women are forced to take refuge in a convent, as nuns. <br /> <br /> What promises in the beginning to be a riot quickly becomes a predictable and average movie with bland humor jokes. Once again, there are occasional high places, but neither the cast nor the team can inspire the debate. An attempt to finish maniacal type "Wanda" also fails, as well as the effort of humor "men in drag", which is hardly surprising. When you think about it, men who try to be women are comical, those who try to be religious are ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Friday, April 22, 1994 - Video
