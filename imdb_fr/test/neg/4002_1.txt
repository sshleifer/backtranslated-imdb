Piece of junk, would have given a 0 if I could have. The animation is good, but not enough. The scenario is absolutely the most ridiculous I've ever met, and that says a lot! This 'movie' tried so hard to be interesting, but failed miserably. It's almost as if the writer had started a story, then had another idea and tried to tie the two together. Do not waste your time on it; believe me, you'll be as excited as me. The only actor of this kind was James Woods, and his part was at best peripheral. I'm all for making pissed off things, pushing back the envelopes, but it just did not cut them off.
