This movie is too stupid for words. Even if you consider it a movie parody, if you consider it a camp, even if you waste your time watching it - you've seen it a hundred times already. But maybe you're a big fan of loud female voices, you still love Barbie and Ken, and you can endure that typical 80s electric guitar background ... Well, you'll have a chance.
