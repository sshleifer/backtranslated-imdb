Some people say that this show was good in its early years! I disagree with everyone. The show is just stupid and pathetic. My mother hates him, I hate him, my father hates him, I do not know about my sister, but hey. Here are some reasons why: <br /> <br /> 1. CHARACTERS: Babies used as adult style characters are stupid. Babies are just early and boring. Adults and adults are stupid and unattractive. The worst character is Angelica Pickles (she really does it for the eardrums when you've spent a long, hard and miserable day at the office) and also Kimi Finster's who appears later; she is too optimistic and a pain in the buttocks. She can not decide if she's French or Japanese: whatever, know; you are an American citizen and that's it! Oh, what am I talking about, all the characters in this series are void! <br /> <br /> 2. STORIES: The stories are not original and stupid. Looks like babies are going on a great adventure, yeah in the back shed. In one episode, this awkward little kid, Chief Tommy Pickles, broke into a television control room and almost literally destroyed it. Do not give children any idea of ​​crushing the normal control rooms of the T.V station (they pay a lot for them in real life). I can imagine what broadcasters must really feel to broadcast this episode: they will probably start watching their machines throughout the day with the fear that a baby will come under braking. Sad! <br /> <br /> 3. OVER RATED!: The series has been dragging on for years and people are still inventing stories, new series and spin-offs for that. Get off! The Simpsons have spent almost the same time, but they are much better and more fun than babies. The show is simply overestimated! People, where is your common sense! <br /> <br /> Anyway, I surprised the T.V stations around the world want to stream this series even today. The show is totally undesirable and should never have been produced. The two films for these cartoons were still nil! 2/10
