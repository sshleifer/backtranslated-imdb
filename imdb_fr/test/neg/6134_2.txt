I spotted the DVD in a store near my home, and since I'm addicted to the "horror movie with cheese / alien movies", I wondered how good it was. There were even two price mentions on the cover (I do not remember which festival he won), so I thought, "Hey, that could be good". So I bought it (for five euros) and I came here to IMDb to check some reviews. Here, people criticized the film for saying it was bad, or they said the film was a wonderful feat for independent films, blah, blah. I then played the DVD, without thinking about the reviews I had read, with an open mind and without expecting anything at all. <br /> <br /> The man ... I do not like being so critical, but the movie was really bad ... OK, I'm just going to give some hints about what I thought: <br /> <br /> 1-Interpretation / dialogue: the game was so confusing ... sometimes the actors did a decent job, but there were scenes where I could not find any effort on their part! The dialogue was even worse ... I think that was probably the aspect that I did not like at all in the movie. The conversation between the characters seemed ... extinct. Not only bad, but far from the real events in the film. The monologues of the female character, although well delivered, became annoying and annoying in an instant ... But of course, the most ridiculous aspect was ... the "extraterrestrials" or the "infected" ... I do not will not even comment on that one, just say it was absolutely ridiculous and removed the whole atmosphere of the photo; 2-Visuals: the strongest aspect of the film ... if you forget the effects of FX and the flashes used to simulate explosions or what they were supposed to be. The "camera in the car" aspect was pretty cool, but they did not even use the environment to inspire fear or fright. They left that to the sound effects and cheap video and to the three characters "infected". The film becomes boring in so many scenes ...; 3-Sound: Talk about editing ... this movie has no problem showing how weakly it was edited. From computer sounds imitating forest animals to "extraterrestrial dialogue" ... ah ... <br /> <br /> So, what did I like about the movie ... ( SPOILERS) the only thing I really liked and that was actually quite scary was the succession of two scenes where the car is still and you see something / someone walking in a distance. At first, I really thought it was for me to see things, but when the character realized that the "numbers" that came to her were her own reflection, I was surprised! A rather scary idea well done! Apart from that ... I had a very bad time. <br /> <br /> And I do not recommend it to anyone ... not even a "teenager reunited" because you can not even laugh at it ... <br /> <br /> I give it a solid 2. Only a few technical achievements have worked here ... other than that ... yeah ... nothing
