Mr. Bean is just a bunch of awkward humor. It is the most superficial television series of humor in history. The scenes are often disgusting and the horrible canned laugh sends chills through the spine. Mr. Bean is a selfish and rude character and one can only sympathize with how pathetic he is. It is incredible that such a low-quality television series can last five years. Watching a single episode is a complete waste of time and one can not help but express disgust and pity for why Rowen introduced himself as a two-dimensional, non-funny and ridiculous character. Or, have pity on yourself why you even bothered to watch an episode. Watching this is an aggravating experience.
