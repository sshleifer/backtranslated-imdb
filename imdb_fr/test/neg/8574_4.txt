The major flaw of this Spanish slasher / shocker is in his script. During the first half-hour, the efforts are satisfying, creating suspense and an atmosphere of fear and fear. We even have some beautiful murders too! Then it goes down completely and turns into a complete catalog of "your basic slasher shots". I must admit that I was quite disappointed because the trailer promised a lot more. The last thirty minutes include killings and many displacements in an abandoned convent. It should have been so much better (although the final scenes in the flooded room are going well)! <br /> <br /> First of all, we have the dialogue. It's awful most of the time (there were some giggles in the audience here and there when I saw it) and just enough elsewhere. It is also barely audible during many scenes, drowned under the pressure of the sound effects and the soundtrack (however, this may not be so bad, after all, given the stupid lines we have to listen to !). There is a line in the whole movie that refers to the movie "I know what you did last summer," indicating that the filmmakers have written everything as a big joke, but I doubt it. "<br /> <br /> And the end ... well, some people will hate it, others will dig it in. For me, it was mostly a question of old because the last touch comes from nowhere! If the public had received clues about the mental state of girls, I might have thought otherwise, and it also makes sense out of the window, because the murderer could never have been in place for some murders! But as a fan of horror, I learned to live with these inconsistencies in Spanish and Italian films. <br /> <br /> But everything is not so bad.The film has a big budget, mainly because of its excellent cinematography (the scenes of the past really shine here), a tight montage and an atmospheric soundtrack.Although most of the actors are really bad, Anita Briem is an exception, pulling the best what she needs to work with. Real presence on the screen! <br /> <br /> And, as I have already mentioned, murders are pretty bloody for fans of this stuff and are usually accompanied by very good special effects involving water images (but the "water theme" "tends to be tiring at the end, however). <br /> <br /> So, to finish this review, it's a pretty funny movie in the genre "so bad it's good" and it's also pleasing to the eye. But do not expect too much, because it does not give the expected results, judging by the descriptions of the trailer and the plot.
