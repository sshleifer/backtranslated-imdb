Heart of Darkness, a short novel written by Joseph Conrad on greed, corruption and travels across Africa was at least a tedious reading. The narrator follows Marlow, a sailor who travels to the depths of Africa to save Kurtz, a little Ivory Merchant prodigy who would have gone insane, this finding occurred when Ivory stopped entering the main port. The basis of the story is that Conrad writes extensively about the environment, he describes the scene in a wonderful way, but maybe a bit too much. The story was more like a watercolor painting than the slow story of gentle action Conrad may have intended to shoot. <br /> <br /> It sometimes happens that after reading a book, we may be looking at the story. the film could help to match some thoughts with those of the book, or vice versa. This is not the case with Heart of Darkness. Even with the lead role of actor John Malkovich, the film did not confuse me anymore, there seemed to be no main character in the film, no one stood out from the others, no symbolism explained. It was, to say the least, bland and painful. <br /> <br /> In all that concerns the author, The Heart of Darkness is a true little Romanesque masterpiece that addresses very serious issues, the lies of Marlow. and Kurtz's greed. This is not a book to be taken lightly, and will put you in a rather dark mood. A book like this could be too much for a lot of people. However, I would recommend this book to those who yearn for a sad story of action without a happy ending.
