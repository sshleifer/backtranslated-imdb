After receiving a DVD of this with a Sunday paper, I was hoping it was not the classic movies that were being offered because nobody would buy them. I was wrong. Sheens plays the same role as a ten-year-old boy in a pantomime production at school and the same goes for the majority of actors. Neill is satisfactory, but he plays a Russian and does not benefit from his hybrid North-Irish / New Zealand accent, any more than the rest of the KGB characters, who all seem to be in a meeting of the Cambridge Footlights . In fact, the only people who have real accents are extras who provide a strange word here and there, allowing us to at least know where everything is going in what is otherwise a pure mix. The "spying" factor is mostly unimpressive and consists mainly of Sheen playing in various ridiculous disguises while trying to blend into the background, quickly becoming not only boring but also laughable. The plot has potential but is completely murdered by the rest of the confusing production elements. It could have been so much better.
