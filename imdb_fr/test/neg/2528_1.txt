Dude, are you serious? Have you read the book or watched this movie? Well, if you did, let me warn you, that's wrong. Mark Furhman has been looking for a job since he lost his job at the LAPD. You remember him, do not you? This is the guy who lied to the bar and gave OJ Simpson's defense the foot she was looking for. Well, he's written three books since. I read all three. No, I'm not a fan, they were given to me. However, I will tell you a similarity in the three, they roughly distort the importance of Mark Furhman. He shamelessly exaggerates his stature in all three. In "Murder in Spokane", he claims to have something to do with the capture of the murderer, while he was there for nothing. In all books, he is delighted to defeat the efforts of local law enforcement. A little as if his efforts had been unsuccessful in the OJ trial. In this film, there are many slow shots of ladies looking at Furhman and coveting him. Many other shots have placed it at the center of attention, when in reality, the only thing people thought of at the time was "hey, is not it the racist who pushed OJ to go down?" It was an interesting story from real life, but not a good movie on it.
