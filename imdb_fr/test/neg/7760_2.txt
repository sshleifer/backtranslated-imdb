Yes, I could not stop yawning, any more than my partner. Incredibly boring - 90 minutes seemed to stretch for at least 3 hours - and I'm not even a fan of action movies, but it just falls asleep - unless you're a fan of neck sweaters polo of the 70s! <br /> <br /> ** SOME SPOILERS FOLLOW ** If you were expecting something, do not hold your breath - that's not the case! <br /> <br /> But seriously, he can not convince or involve the observer. It's like a long, boring dream and rather disjointed. Frederic crosses it, being able to leave his work when he wishes it and accompanied by pretty secretaries who bring permanently tea and messages. Obviously not the real life! And an office almost paperless or folder-just a giant calendar to inform you that the movie really takes 6 months to watch. <br /> <br /> Frederic never seems to be touched by real emotion any more than his wife and kids behave like rag dolls, which contrasts with any real life. Even Chloe, despite her strong opinions, never gives the impression of feeling anything real. The last three seconds of a real feeling occur between a couple watched in a cafe and have nothing to do with the plot. Even if you're looking for good cinematography, I think this movie is incredibly overrated by most other viewers.
