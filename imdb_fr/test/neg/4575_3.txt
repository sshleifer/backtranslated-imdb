Before talking about my article, I would like to clarify some things: 1) I am a girl who is not passionate about girls' movies ("Kate & Leopold" and "Someone Like You" are EXTREME exceptions - the ass of Hugh Jackman). 2) I only chose it because I am a Fichtner fangirl who was eager to see him in a bathtub. 3) I'm not a fan of Demi, although I think his performances in "Immortal" and "A Few Good Men" were sublime and gained places in my video library. I also think she is a bit crazy (no way is she still sleeping with Brucie). <br /> <br /> If this is the study of the character of an unsatisfied woman leading a double life of independence and happiness, then I would say that we have a narcoleptic melodrama. Marty: literary agent. Gives a 6-digit salary. Lives in an upscale apartment in Manhattan. It is easy for him to read several hundred manuscripts and fall asleep at his desk for a highly suggested nocturnal escape. Or maybe going through an interdiemsional portal? She has career, looks, a cool car, a good carpet, now where are the man and the children? In stages, our boy Aaron - a real escape. What are architects? They are artists who can do mathematics, dreamers who make money. Aaron gives Marty the dream of security and fills a void where she clearly has no confidence in herself. <br /> <br /> On the other side of the coin, there is Mary, who still lives out her schoolgirl fantasies while losing herself in her motherhood. His children are his career and his life. But what about Mary, does she exist only through her children? In Waltz William, a Parisian foreigner who helps her focus on the one thing she has lost contact with: herself. <br /> <br /> A so-called journey of self-discovery and, late, an arrival in adulthood thrown with anguish and some resentment towards Marty / Marie's own mother. This gives a 3/10. All I can say is thank God for the multimedia division of the BPL. I would not have wasted $ 2.99 on Blockbuster for this, but rather for a Harlequin Blaze title.
