SPOILER AHEAD! The mummy (Lon Chaney Jr.) is on the run in a university town in New England looking for a student (Ramsey Ames) who is the reincarnation of her beloved princess Ananka. Sad, slow (even at 65 minutes - it moves more slowly than mom!), Acted indifferently, but the end is worth the wait. The mother takes the girl (!!!!!) and she ages quickly while the two slowly sink into a swamp. It's (I think) the only time in a Universal Monster movie that the monster had the girl! Other than that, it's a strictly amateur night. Probably the worst of the mummy suites - and that's saying something!
