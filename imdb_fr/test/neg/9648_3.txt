This "movie" b + w, confusing and important, looks like a baby during a very bad trip with acid. You are dealing with something that reminds you of a lump of rotting lettuce that has accidentally fallen from the back of a garbage truck: no one cares to touch it because it will likely be washed away alone in the storm sewer. There is no room for intrigue when you have a "visceral imagery" and a "subtle" allegory. For me, it seems that the director is trying to make the next big art film while praying for intellectual praise. I did not bring my beret either. Looking at this, I felt almost insulted since the "film" was so effective at getting away from you.
