It's a cheap movie directed by Al Adamson - a man who was perhaps the worst filmmaker of all time - and maybe even worse than Ed Wood, Jr. Adamson specialized in horror and skin at a very low budget in the 60s, 70s and 80s and with titles such as FIVE SANGS BLOODY, BLOODY DEVILS of HELL, SADISTS of SATAN and LASH OF LUST, it is obvious that he did not make Shakespeare !! His films all had production values, sensations, gore and rotting amateur play. <br /> <br /> Here, in BRAIN OF BLOOD, several actors of the Adamson series (such as his wife, Regina Carrol, Zandor Vorkov and Angelo Rossitto Dracula VERSUS FRANKENSTEIN was lucky because the previous movie was so terrible and so poorly executed at all levels that BRAIN OF BLOOD can not help but be beautiful! Of course, makeup is laughable, stupid intrigue (this is the omnipresent brain transplant scheme) and the role of actor is level Z, but he is STILL better than their last movie! <br /> <br /> The only good points of this film are this actor of support of the aging, midget Angelo Rossitto had in fact a role better than - with more dialogue and a bigger role in the plot - and there was actually a sense of danger and tension sometimes.For Mrs. Carrol, she ALWAYS looks like a stripper and the rest of the cast was limping through this silly movie, but it's bad enough I'm sure that bad moviegoers are well looked at - you just have to see the make-up on the guy suffering from acid burns as well as the ray gun that seems to be made from an old taillight!
