Sometimes there is such a bad movie that you continue to watch with wonder. This is one of those movies. Of course, I can not help being biased. I'm from Chicago, so I watched the scenes closely to check for accuracy and I do not find Billy Crystal funny. And I can not stand all these English-style photographs (Tony Scott, etc.) with the smoke machine working overtime and all the soft and abundant lighting. I guess we're supposed to believe that Billy Crystal is really from Chicago because he wears a Cubs jersey. Oh and the plot. If you really think about it, these guys should be locked up, not the bad guys, because they are more dangerous. And of course, there's the snapshot of the cops about to pull out. But the funniest scene is the highlight where the good and the mean machine gunners go to death in the Thompson Center (a state building!) Sure, it's a cool building, but it's like making a huge deal of drugs in the White House.
