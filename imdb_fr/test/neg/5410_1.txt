My wife and I love bad sci-fi movies. Some movies are so bad that they are good. Mansquito was one of those. This one was bad but he had some redemptive qualities. This makes you wonder how a self-respecting actor behaves like "Hey! Mansquito!" <br /> <br /> This one is so bad that it has now taken its place as a reference for evil. It's not just a bad movie, it really stinks. There was the mixed strike force, the "Indian" who was walking with a black coat and was using a sword to shout loudly. He shot down a helicopter with an arrow !! <br /> <br /> We tried to laugh at this movie, but there was no point where he was not pitiful. We could not offer exchange features except one. These were the words "The End" <br /> <br /> There seemed to be no plot, no character development and no interest in the film. Someone in Hollywood has to be fired.
