Why was this film made? What were the creators of this thought?!?! The first 8MM movie had at least one sensible and potentially interesting plot. The first film was about the snuff film industry. This sequel concerns ... hold ... the porn industry !! Yes, as if the snuff film industry, an industry in which people are supposed to be killed for entertainment, were in the same league as the adult film industry, an industry in which people are filming. other people engaging in unsentimental acts and sex. for eroticism. The idea alone should warn you of the bad design of this movie. The lack of plot, character, actor, director, script, logic, theme or even sound design does not help. It's a remarkably boring film that never caught my attention. Literally, nothing works. Why would a police film about the porn industry involving murder and betrayal work anyway? I am not very interested in adult films, but I have certainly seen them before. Why would someone make a film about his troubles and do it in a sequel to a movie about snuff films? I do not even know if there is an industry involved in making snuff films, but I hope not. The idea of ​​a snuff film is horrible and only really sick and nasty people are part of it. I do not think the adult film industry is about murder and torture. I'm pretty sure that many people make pornographic movies for good intentions rather than hurting and killing people. Hurting another human being is never acceptable. The adult film industry is not about hurting people. It's about creating movies that are, for me, a diversion and a waste of time. What is this film trying to say? It does not work
