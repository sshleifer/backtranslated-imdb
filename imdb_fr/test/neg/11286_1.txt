Cobb. It sucks. I did not learn anything about the man I had never heard before. The performances were above. A scene where Cobb and Al drive on a snowy road looking for women in Reno must be one of the worst scenes designed in recent memory. It's just stupid and not very entertaining. The flashback sequences were terrible. And they used the same footage over and over and over again. If I saw Cobb's fight against someone from a base again, I would have become physically sick. Looking at this "film", we can not learn anything about what it was in Cobb's day. We do not learn anything from his relationships with his players, nothing from his days as a manager, anything from his relationships with family members, except that "they do not like him". When I sat down to watch this movie, I thought I would learn something about the baseball era in which Cobb played. Instead, all I could see was a retreading of how Cobb hated everything and everyone, and how they hated him. Boy, what a good movie (sarcasm). Cobb is described as a constant liar in the film, so which of his stories is supposed to be accurate? Who knows? We do not care? Nobody will be after seeing this piece of shit. If you decide to rent this movie, make sure the fast forward button on your video recorder works, as you will be tempted to use it repeatedly. I hope someday someone will make a good movie about Ty Cobb. This film pleased me as much as the people who loved it liked Cobb, that is, I hated him. Now, I know why I found it in the RENT ONE GET ONE section of the video store for FREE. I think I will ask the saleswoman about $ 50 because I can not recover the time I lost looking at this garbage. Oh well, what could I have thought of a film that would feature Robert Wuhl?
