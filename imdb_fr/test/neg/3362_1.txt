I remember the first time I heard about Jack Frost. I was in Video Ezy in Miranda with my family and I was talking about a video rental tradition a month. It was then that I had the courage to venture into the horror section of the store. While browsing the different titles, I finally came across Jack Frost. The cover was enough to convince me that the movie was beyond the pleasures I saw. Years later, the film disappeared to be replaced by an inevitable but useless sequel. I once again ventured into the horror section and took over the case only to draw a conclusion: the film would be scary ?? but not intentionally. <br /> <br /> Jack Frost 2: The revenge of the killer Mutant Snowman (a whole title) follows where his predecessor left him. Sheriff Sam is looking for advice after his ordeals and Jack is now in the form of antifreeze. To escape from his past, Sam and his wife visit an island hotel where he meets a wide variety of stereotypes of slasher films, including buxom models, thick-headed sportspeople and Caribbean staff. However, Jack is released from his liquid grave and has returned to his icy methods. He goes to the island and decides to kill all those who prove to have a terrible death. Only Sam can stop him. <br /> <br /> Let me say that this is a directly video film, so it is necessarily bad. But it's terrible, even in the eyes of other great movies. The work of the camera is mediocre, using a camera that would give a soap opera a majestic appearance. Half of the actors seem to come out of a porn shoot and the other half from a retirement home, but in reality they have come out of an asylum. The special effects used in the film often alternate between insignificant puppets and computer graphics that can be improved by a toddler, and the scenes of death are mostly off the screen showing us little about what is arrived at the unfortunate, but deserving, victims. But the film is the most memorable, because it's about lineaments like "There is something that requires a little Christmas stuffing" and "I know that I pronounce you officially as dead!" In the end, the subject of a movie like this is to make a popcorn movie for Friday nights of boredom and even if it fails. Making a sequel to a movie that was a poor slasher with a concept that a kid would find unbelievable should have taken nerves of steel ?? or a total frontal lobotomy. To director Michael Cooney ?? thank you for wasting my time. To all others ?? avoid like arsenic.
