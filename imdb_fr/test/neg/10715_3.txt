Fun With Dick and Jane have not managed to entertain at so many levels. For example, one of the major conflicts seems to be the charge of Jim Harper's character, Jim Harper, but the perpetrators never follow this particular conflict. Basically, the story is weak and most of the time not funny, but Carrey records some scenes with his physical humor, but honestly, Jim Carrey was not very funny in this movie, and Tea Leone could just as easily have been there just for his appearance Not funny either. This is just another example showing that Hollywood has excluded franchise actors from an ugly and unoriginal story.
