Independent movie viewers know they will see stories about dysfunctional families once or twice a year. They now expect to see them and it's getting harder and harder to keep them fresh, but here, despite the good distribution, it seems that same. The story is about the Travis family trying to recover from the suicide of Matt (Kip Pardue), a very promising swimmer in high school. Ben (Jeff Daniels) is the father who gets away from everyone and never treated his other son Tim (Emile Hirsch) or Matt, but he communicates (in one way or another) with his mother Sandy (Sigourney Weaver) who finds his potty hiding and begins to smoke it. <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILER ALERT ***** Sandy is also starting to flirt with much younger men like the cashier at the grocery store but when she tries to buy more marijuana, she gets caught and is taken to jail. She does not tell anyone what happened, but she discovers bruises on Tim's body and also that Ben has taken a leave. After all this, Sandy gets sick and lands in the hospital where his life is in danger, forcing Ben to realize that he may have to accept losing another member of his family. <br /> <br /> This film is written and directed by Dan Harris who worked with Bryan Singer on "X2" as well as the upcoming Superman film and whose scenario allows these characters to live real moments of expression of their pain and confusion, the story (for me) has too much to do The script addresses so many different areas that it is necessary to have a scorecard to keep track of it, including drugs , sex, love, infidelity, abuse, neglect, experimenting with homosexuality and a life-threatening illness. If all these scenarios were not enough for you, Harris finally gave up a plot plot to summarize and explain most of everyone's feelings towards Tim. While I rolled my eyes at least 2 or 3 times with the way the scenario unfolded incessantly, I must admit that I did not hate this film and that I had to thank the actors. Everyone has at least one good scene somewhere in the film, but I hope the story is more focused on Weaver and his character than Hirsch. Weaver is exceptional and with a more specific scenario, she could have played a role that might have led to an Oscar nomination, but we have rather endless scenes of Hirsch at parties or her shenanigans with the neighbor of at side. Harris shows that he can be a good screenwriter / director, but with this effort, he launches so many different things on the audience that the material becomes just laborious and artificial.
