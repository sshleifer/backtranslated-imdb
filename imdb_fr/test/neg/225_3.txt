After reading Fool For Love in one of my acting classes, I was eager to see how Sam Shepard's wonderful piece would be translated on screen. To my dismay, it was not nearly as entertaining as the play. The film seemed to be hanging out, the music was inappropriate for the tone of the film and all the raw energy of the play seemed to have been sucked by this version of the film. It's a shame to see this happen in this way even with Shepard's involvement, playing Eddie. Do yourself a favor ... see the play the next time it's played in your area or just read the book instead.
