Predictable, unmotivated and inventive useless caricatures did what they could The actors made it clear that they were embarrassed to do it Not a single emotional connection REAL SEQUENCE FROM FILM "Who are you calling?" (Police) "You can not do that, Stevie, hang up the phone" (sic) "Jesse has a big load of money for the drugs, you can not involve the cops" (sic) "I'm not sure that stealing money from criminals is a crime, and even if he stops it at least, he'll be alive." (Listen), Stevie, it's not treated Well, Jesse is going to end up dead. "Now, hang up that f-in phone." (sic) Best Friend starts loading firearms Brother, "Hey, what are you doing?" No answer. "Hey, I have a family to worry about." (Keep in mind that his child is sitting there watching all this) So more and more exposures <br /> <br /> Notice how, in the sequence above, at no point does the police say "Hello? Hello? Uh, we can hear everything you say, we are sending someone there right now." <br /> <br /> The embarrassment for all. Oops.
