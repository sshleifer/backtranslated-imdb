Egads. <br /> <br /> I thought Keannu Reeves was the worst actor in Hollywood. I'm not so sure, Willy gives Keannu a tough competition with his performance "I'm made of plaster" in this film. <br /> <br /> Combine this with the fact that there is almost no conspiracy, and not a single, friendly character, and difficult to recommend this turkey. <br /> <br /> Natasha is doing her best, but even Julia Roberts could not save this film from the darkness. <br /> <br /> Avoid it unless it's really late and there's nothing else. -Oh heck, in this case, just read a book.
