First, I saw another reviewer say that this movie was "fantastic". Well, nothing can be further from the truth! This movie is a complete garbage! A stupid horror comedy that is not even a little funny! Do not take that to say it's so bad it's good because it's not. It's a total waste of time and money! <br /> <br /> Here's what I see in this waste of DVDs. A group of friends meets a weekend, gets drunk, then decides to make a video in his garden. They catch the video camera of mom and dad and start creating scenes on the spot. They all have a hard time looking at each other in a cup in front of the camera. They think, if they think it's funny, then everyone will think it's funny. Well, they are wrong. This home video at the backyard is a garbage can. The acting and gore effects are shabby, but I guess that's to be expected because it's nothing more than a personal video. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, I guess the fact that this shit has appeared gives hope to anyone who wants to make a film. If these people could make their film and release it on DVD, then everyone could! <br /> <br /> 0 / 10-- Save your money.
