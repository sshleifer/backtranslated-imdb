If you can go beyond the slow start and the bad game, it's worth watching. The scenario was pretty good. The father had a bad temper because he was unemployed and he had barely been able to see his child, except in the summer because his ex-wife had custody of him. The father was very angry and frustrated most of the time. The monster of the story was not too scary. The film breaks the consistency of the monster which is incredibly loud. The only scene in which filmmakers do this is one of the times the child is in the cellar and the monster is going to attack him. When the monster goes to attack the kid, his arm is caught in a steel trap attached to a chain. The monster is about one foot from the child's face. Every time in the movie, the monster is strong enough to pierce or destroy everything. Yet, the steel trap and chain prevent him from catching the child! It is more than likely that the directors did it for shock because nobody wanted to see one of the main characters die. The filmmakers simply wanted to scare us into thinking that the child might die. Instead of breaking the coherence, the directors should have replaced the child with someone they could get rid of!
