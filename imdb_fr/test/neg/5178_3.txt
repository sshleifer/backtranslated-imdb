This movie could have been great. This is not in my opinion. The script is fragmented, the publisher does not seem to be able to choose between a Guy Ritchie-style narrative and a simpler scenario. The focus is on excessive violence, including torture. Too much, so if you ask me. The characters are very shallow and stereotyped, I would have liked to see more depth. It is difficult to identify with the main character. As a result, the film remains shallow as a whole. <br /> <br /> The film says it offers the viewer a view of the inside of the British criminal class, particularly the underprivileged Essex class. Football hooligans, steroids, cocaine, heroin and violence, a lot of violence. Violence resulting from paranoia and fear in general. In this movie, no one seems to be using his brain, we are watching a group of dressed animals. As I said, there is not much conspiracy and the narrative leaves a lot to be desired. <br /> <br /> If you are a man under 30, love gore and hardcore violence and believe it's entertaining, then it's a movie for you. If you're looking for a movie about real people with a well-developed storyline, suspense and depth, well ... you can ignore this one.
