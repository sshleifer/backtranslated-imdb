The most impressive title of the film "Anemic Cinema" is its title: an anagram that is almost a palindrome. Unfortunately, this only works in American English, because in Britain, "anemic" is spelled differently. <br /> <br /> I have always found the dilettante Man Ray and his deeply pretentious artistic endeavors, and I have never understood why his work attracts so much attention. Besides his Rayographs (which he invented by chance and which are only direct contact photographic prints), his only real contribution to culture seems to be the fact that he was the first photographer to portray the feminine nudity of a way that was rather accepted than as porn. But that must surely have happened one day, and nothing really justifies Ray's merit. The critical reaction to Man Ray reminds me of the story of the Emperor's new clothes. <br /> <br /> In the early 1960s, the second season of "The Twilight Zone" opened each episode with a sequence of rotating concentric circles. in black and white. There is an image in 'Anemic Cinema' that is so similar, I wonder if 'Twilight Zone' borrowed it from this movie. The main difference is that the rotating image here is a black and white spiral. Indeed, if a film deserves to be described as a spiral, it is this one. Throughout 'Anemic Cinema', we are treated (?) To shots of a rotating disc containing words (in French) moving in a spiral. The effect is vertiginous and the texts - on incest and the Eskimos - are almost dada in their lack of meaning. I made fun of a clever word game. <br /> <br /> The Emperor is naked, my friend, and this film barely scores 2 points out of 10. The next!
