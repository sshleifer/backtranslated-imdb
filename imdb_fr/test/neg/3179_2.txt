I like Wes Studi and especially Adam Beach, but whoa is this film a little pretentious. Heavily slow. Too cryptic enough to obscure, not because the plot warrants it, but because there is almost no plot. Even less in terms of characterization. It's almost like one of those grumpy old mysteries of Charlie Chan (the cheaper versions of the Monogram studio) with lots of red herrings and weird characters (like the old senator with the checkered past who is now a loner) and lots of people being killed on art objects you would not see twice in the mall. Super landscape, though. Pretty hair on the redhead too, although I never understood what she was doing in all that. My wife either. Sheesh, at least the old B-movies have had the decency to be short.
