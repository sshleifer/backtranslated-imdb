Okay, I admit that I like Brigitte Neilsen in an unhealthy way, I just have a weakness for women 6 'tall with swords. There I said it. <br /> <br /> What's wrong with the movie? Almost all the mistakes you can make have been made. You take a series of blockbuster movies (conan) and you drag it through the mud with a bad script, a bad cast, some bad effects and the worst you put a cute kid for comic relief. That kind of thing almost killed the Indiana Jones series, you know. Cute kids are for Disney movies, no real movies. Neilsen has at least taken the film seriously, although it seems that no one else has done it. The plot had Schwarzenegger repeatedly remove Red Sonja's fat from the fire and this greatly undermine his character. A warrior woman does not need a guy to get her out of the bazaar, it's her job! Not reusing Conan's character in this movie was a crime. Kalidor? Sheesh. The film never gave a good mood and its rhythm was rather disjointed and sloppy, unlike Conan the Barbarian who had several scenarios that took place gracefully. When it comes to fantastic movies, it's okay to have tacky costumes, have a harryhausen-style animation, have stupid exorbitant decors that make no sense, but having a horrible scenario is unforgivable. <br /> <br /> This film could have been a classic, but the script seemed to have been written by a 12 year old man.
