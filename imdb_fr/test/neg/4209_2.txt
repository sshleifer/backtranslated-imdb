Saw this DVD used at a low price, and got for a little laugh. I had also recently found "The Octagon" on DVD and purchased it as a reminder, after seeing it at the theater as a pre-teen and loved it at the time. The problem now with the "return" to these American karate films is that I have seen since then so many Hong Kong and Thai action movies, in which the fight scenes are long, fast and breathtaking. I'm thinking particularly of fights like Jackie and Benny "The Jet" at the end of "Dragons Forever", or Tony Jaa's circular fight in "The Protector". Hollywood's kung-fu offers are simply not "filmed properly" and even look awkward to someone with certified skills, such as Chuck. And what is worse than a fight in slow motion? Then you know that it looked crummy at normal speed, so they slowed it down for the effect to be effective. This really highlights how ridiculous an opponent is and expects to get a kick in the chest. <br /> <br /> Poor Chuck, he has no intensity in this film and does not project any just threat. Compare that to his former co-star Bruce Lee, who had charm and an attitude to burn. When Bruce faced one or more opponents, you could almost see the air around him crack with what was going to happen. In "Breaker, Breaker", Chuck seemed to accidentally kick, with total nonchalance. When the judge comes to see him in prison and condemns him to death, Chuck looks sadly and I say to myself, "OK ... he's doing this" third eye "trick and is going to grab the judge by the throat and get out of that "but he does not do anything except lift his eyes with a silly look. Terrible. And although the DVD case gives you hope, with an autonomy of 1 hour, 5 minutes, it actually lasts 1 hour, 25 minutes, so 20 minutes extra pain. <br /> <br /> For a good fight, watch Jackie Chan in the first "story of the police" .... the fight in the mall at the end is in pure gold ......
