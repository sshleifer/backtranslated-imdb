I felt compelled to write a review after seeing the only criticism that gave this movie a surprisingly high score of 9/10. I say suspicious because it looks less like a criticism than an advertising statement. Maybe the filmmaker himself or one of his friends wrote this "criticism"? Naughty, naughty. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie on Sky TV's Propeller channel, expecting it to be really horrible. The special effects used had to be very honest for a low-budget movie, and some of the actors were not that bad either, but most of the actors were really awful, but well done for trying, as I was expecting for most of the filmmaker's friends. <br /> <br /> I think the filmmaker did very well trying to break his weight. I found the movie fun because it was trying to be cool when it was not. <br /> <br /> If you do not take this film too seriously and watch it drunk with other friends, it may well be a good time, but probably not as expected. This film is not a 9/10 at all, but it is worth watching for fun, knowing that it was made with a very small budget and in all fairness, because of the quality of its creators.
