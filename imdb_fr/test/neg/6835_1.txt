The "Jackal Day" of 1973, directed by Fred Zinnemann of Frederick Forsyth's novel, was not a masterpiece of the general scheme, but was nevertheless a thriller well above average, written and directed with a lot of panache, wit and style. It's always a pleasure to rent and watch from time to time. <br /> <br /> By adapting it to "The Jackal" of 1997, it seems that the writers and the director make every turn the worst possible choice: completely sealed, exaggerated, carefree, without surprise, no sexy and unyielding. If we made a catalog of all the details of this movie, big and small, I could give you a mini-essay for each topic on how the 1997 adaptation was put in place. <br /> <br /> Item: the weapon. <br /> <br /> In the original, the plot about how the assassin will smuggle it, how he intends to hide it and why he needs a personalized work from his underground craftsmen is very complex. In the remake, they apparently thought that today's audience would not tolerate a small sniper rifle and would require the dismal machine gun on the black market, which needs a minivan to transport it, and whose purpose is to shout Macho. All this complex and interesting case about the disguise of its components has been reduced to show us (repeatedly, as if it was a hard point to follow?) That the joystick of his absurdly high-tech remote control system was in his pen pocket. <br /> <br /> Subject: The conspirators and the motive. <br /> <br /> Without having recourse to dry reading, the original always manages to give us a good understanding of the historical situation of the "blackfeet" ["Pieds-noirs"], the French irredentists Algerians who could not accept that the century was moving away from colonialism, thought that de Gaulle had betrayed them. This gives the entire plot a historical weight. The remake seems to leave him as a revenge story of gangs, minimizing him by turning him into a Russian gangster. Please note that I am not opposed to the update: they could have done it intelligently and propose something more current but not trivial. Certainly, Russia and the rest of the former USSR have undergone tremendous changes lately and an updated history could have been placed in such a way as to make us feel that this * counts *. <br /> Item: the relationship of the murderer on the run and the police chasing him; and the complex direction of the spectator's sympathies, from the naughty to the kind. <br /> <br /> Above, I hesitated to call the original a masterpiece; but in this aspect it was really one. We follow the murderer during most of the first few parts of the film and, having noticed his intelligence and resourcefulness, we start to admire him and we do not want to see his plan annoyed or see him surprised, at least not too early! Then we meet the police officer who is driven to lead the investigation / protection efforts, and we catch him off guard, and note that he is not the sad dismissal that his domestic problems might have suggested. At the moment it matters, we have been won over by him. <br /> <br /> In the remake, Poitier might have managed this type of development, but Gere can not. And the absurd gadget "48 hours" of the gadget presented to help the police should have been left in the comedies from where it came from. <br /> <br /> In the remake, the assassin and the assassin-hunter * explain how they are like players on top of a chessboard, communicating indirectly by their movements and can * only * deduce * the other. This was done beautifully in the original. But in the remake in fact, they are confronted too early face-to-face confrontation, so they can grin, encircle the place and browse hunting scenes quite conventional. <br /> <br /> Object: photography and "landscapes". <br /> <br /> The remake offers beautiful pictures, especially in snowy Finland in the first part. But Washington, DC Metro can not really compete with the streets of Paris for interesting prospects and faces of spectators.
