To be honest, I could not stand watching this movie from start to finish, so I do not know if it will suddenly improve halfway through the movie. But the first 30 minutes are some of the worst I've known for a long time. Children under the age of 12 may have a kick out of this poorly written, misunderstood and directed humor, but adults who have a perfect mastery of all their faculties must stay away from this evil.
