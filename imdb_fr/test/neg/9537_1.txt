I like bad movies, but this thing is a pile of steam. Tremulous cameramen with horrible sound and devastating play, do not waste a second on this pile. Grade 5 students could have made a better film and first-year students could have written a better script. You want a real synopsis? Ugly chicks in neon bikinis have been dancing for far too long. A disjointed plot aggravated by a hideous game. The sets on site were not even passable. The church scenes take place in a dance studio and oh yeah - what about the two tap-dancing numbers that come out of the shadows? <br /> <br /> Oh and the total number of topless' have not even saved this movie - 0. Add this to the trash.
