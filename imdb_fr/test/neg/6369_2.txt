I recently went to the movies to see the new version (2007) of Bridge to Teribithia. Afterwards, I went to the library to rent the old version and see it again without paying. I must say that I was extremely disappointed! I found that the older version had horrible lines as well as lame replicas, including Jessie saying, "I know dad, but I have so much pain inside" after Leslie's death. It was pretty horribly done and the cast was not much better in my opinion. I looked in amazement while saying that it was not surprising that they had redone that. The story is great, but believe me I'm spending my money and seeing the new version. If you only see the old one, you may never experience the true magic of Teribithia.
