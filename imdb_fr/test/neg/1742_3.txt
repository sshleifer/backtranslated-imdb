I thought it was weird and just bloody, not scary. I saw two Japanese horror movies, Ringu and Juon, and I loved them; but this movie was a disappointment. He has never even explained anything about the curse. I just did not see any horror ... it was not scary for me at all. As long as I watched, I waited for Kirie to discover the secret of the curse and why it was happening now. If it was an old curse, why did not it happen before Shuichi's father? And that never told us what happened to his father. I was still waiting for someone to tell us the meaning or the reasoning behind this curse and then it had just ended. I was very disappointed.
