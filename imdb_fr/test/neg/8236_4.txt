Reviewing old movies that you thought means, is not necessarily a good thing. They get worse sometimes. Under the leadership of Camp Fangoria (they nicknamed him Gorezone "the scariest movie since Texas CHAINSAW", uh no), LUTHER THE GEEK inexplicably developed a cult following as an "intense" horror image. In fact, it is an average film that stands out from the pack by staging a killer who laughs like a chicken. Yes, laughs like a chicken. To the credit of the director, at least, they did not make the killer a duck sound at the THE RIPPER OF NEW YORK. That would be just stupid. <br /> <br /> The narrative logic is completely abandoned in LUTHER THE GEEK. I'm not saying that slasher films are full of reason, but at least in HALLOWEEN, Michael Myers escaped. In fact, Luther is released after a long scene where people argue for reform, although he cracks like a chicken and wears razor burns (apparently made in prison). This is the kind of movie where a couple sees a door smashed and the girl rejects it saying, "Oh, my mother must have forgotten her keys, she has forgotten a lot since my father's death." The kind of movie where the hysterical mother meets a policeman in search of Luther and says to him: "The killer is at my house!" So, what is he doing? He catches her and literally drags her to the house and says, "Just show me where he is and I'll do the rest." Why not call back? <br /> <br /> It's a shame that the film is filled with acts and dialogues as horrible because the character of Luther is actually quite interesting. Most of the credit goes to Ed Terry, a singer of Tom Noonan of MANHUNTER, who gives Luther a threatening air. In the hands of a director right, LUTHER THE GEEK could be at the same level as SONNY BOY or SANTA SANGRE and be a real cinematic oddity. But Albright is not this director and simply places the fascinating character of Luther in boring traps.
