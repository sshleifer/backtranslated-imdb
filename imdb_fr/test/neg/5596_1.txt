Of course, this film shot in Eastern Europe is full of sexy, but it has absolutely nothing to do with the movie "8mm" by Nicholas Cage. The daughter of an ambassador and her fianc√©e mingle with a local woman in a threesome that is then filmed. The gang is used for blackmail and the stakes rise as the couple tries to get by on their own instead of going to the authorities. <br /> <br /> Sex comes and goes - and would be the only reason to praise it, I guess if you like that sort of thing - and it's pretty free to the middle when we're on the stage porn in search of "the other woman". I really wonder how it got into Blockbuster, even with a sticker for kids, because it's a clue. (Oh, that's right, it's the standard double.) Artist films such as "The Dreamers" and "Y Tu Mama Tambien" are castrated in R versions, but Straight To DVD shit like this proudly attaches the UNRATED banner .It does not matter.) The acting is awful, the plot ludicrous, but the worst offense is the idea that it's a 8mm sequel. I would give D the note for a note and I would be nice, but since they tried to trap me, he gets the F he deserves frankly.
