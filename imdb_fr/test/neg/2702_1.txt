As a fan of the old series, I must say that it is at best a parody of a very popular series. First, the old series would at least try to follow a military structure. I know in this P.C. world it's not the thing to do but hey does not turn it into a care bear. In the old series, Beachead was a hard-to-talk soldier, now he's a teenage mutant turtle. Another thing is the flying tank, ok it flies out of the cobra base and bounces off the helicopter and they both agree ???? Let's face it if the next is not better, it could spell the end of G.I.joe.
