I've seen worse, which is a roundabout way of saying how bad this movie was. The plot is ridiculous: a student shoots a policeman and five others take him hostage? In a dimly lit and smoky school in New York - and somehow this clich√© hostage taking takes 24 hours to solve? Are you serious? A day of hostages - with a wounded New York police officer, it takes all day? I realize that this film was made before 9/11, but still. I looked at the clock and wondered how they could drag this intrigue too long for an hour and ten minutes. <br /> <br /> The acting game was at best mediocre and the characters seemed to have been thought before the 7 graders. The abused child, the pregnant pregnant girl, the violent gang wannabe, an unhappy and confused victim, the white guy with wise behavior. <br /> <br /> Try to make this hostage taking a mission for "more textbooks" and better school conditions? Please - this is a weak attempt to justify writing a movie about a child shooting a cop. They are confused and ignorant idiots who find themselves involved in an idiotic situation. Do not try to paint them, suddenly, noble, the most laughable is Ziggy, who lives in the attic of the school and admires Michaelangelo so much that he paints these striking scenes on the walls. You are laughing at me. <br /> <br /> The signs "no racism" in the protesting crowd? A black kid pulls on a black policeman and a black negotiator tries to put everything away. It's a random message. <br /> <br /> I understand the message as a whole, which has been misinterpreted, although by some actors having pursued a respectable career. <br /> <br /> It was still a joke. the red sniper lasers on the roof? The worst scene was that of the kid, the falling snow, the death in the arms of his friend on the roof, "promise me", etc. What an originality. <br /> <br /> The epilogue of "I went to jail, but now I am pre-law to XYZ University" ... an appropriate way to end a movie joke.
