Witchy Hildegard Knef imprisons a group of people in an isolated hotel and removes them one by one, disgustingly and disgustingly. I thought I saw everything until an unfortunate man was crucified and burned. Hildy is also a joker: she takes a nagging harpy and sews her mouth ... then hangs her at the fireplace in the fireplace just in time for a chimney fire! "Witchery" made me sick. It hurt my eyes. I was ready to write that it was the worst film ever made by otherwise competent people ... until the final. I must admit that I loved the end. This is a boy and his tape recorder stuck by Linda Blair, who seems fantastically possessed. The scene only lasts about a minute and the film is over, but you know this old adage: "If you have a great ending, people will forgive you almost anything!"
