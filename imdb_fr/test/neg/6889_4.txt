The video case of this film indicates "a story of beauty, passion and forbidden fruit". Are they talking about the same movie I just saw ?! They can not be, because the film I just saw was beautiful, but there was no passion and as far as the fruit is concerned, it's all crap to attract the potential viewer to watch this movie. If only he had a certain passion or a little life, I would have enjoyed this movie. Instead, it was a terribly slow and not particularly interesting film that I certainly would not want to see again. It's not that it's a bad movie (after all it's very beautiful), but it's boring. I kept waiting for something exciting or interesting to happen, but the movie just finished. There was not much sense of excitement, mystery or anything - just a pretty uninspiring story about a girl who becomes a maid and spends the next 10 years of her life working as a wife of bedroom.
