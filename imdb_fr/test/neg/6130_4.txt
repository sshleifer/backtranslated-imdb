Before going further, I must admit that I only saw the first episode of this show. If I had time, I might have thought about watching it every week, if only to see how the season went. However, it was very clear to me from the beginning that the version of Martha Stewart's "The Apprentice" did not "fit in". Martha Stewart has made a career as a happy housewife, a domestic diva composed for example of Oprah Winfrey and Julia Child. It was only after his scandalous legal troubles and incarceration that his public image began to reflect the real brutality of his character. Of course, she has been convincing for a while, and this entire series raises the interesting question of what it means to be a woman in business. Does it have to be cold and hard? Should not she? <br /> <br /> But the truth was that when Stewart was released from jail, his attempts to get back to the public, while certainly warranted, would never catch the interest of viewers for long. Perhaps a real return would have worked if she had returned home peacefully and had waited about a year after her ankle bracelet, often ridiculed, was removed. Instead, she darkly plunged into overwork with 2 sets at a time, the other being her daily subscribed Martha series, much like her older but more traditional series, with famous guests like Bette Midler. Of course, even at its peak, Stewart has never been a mainstream audience, so it is excessive to ask the American public to immediately accept his raid on reality TV. Maybe the United States wants Stewart to make his own return rather than being the base. <br /> <br /> The show was basically a tired retreat of Trump's "apprentice", who still holds my interest, depending on the tasks at hand. , distribution and Trump's remand decisions (often controversial - probably for this reason). The letter fragment was certainly not a clich√©, but odious. The fact that Stewart never says, "You're fired!" - mentioned in the bulletin board of this site - is particularly painful. Producer Mark Burnett should be admired for honestly treating Stewart's jail sentence while trying to turn her into a heroine, but the truth is that anyone who looks at her can say that she's basically trying to show she's a beautiful woman business. Never again mainstream, Stewart lacks the pleasant and identifiable Oprah Winfrey and the admirable "hardness" charismatic Donald Trump. Yes, it may be an assessment of his character based on sex, but I mostly hear about the nature of his business. <br /> <br /> It's not shocking that Stewart was fired, but I'm wondering. if they really wanted it to last only one season?
