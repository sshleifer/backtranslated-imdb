By far, this is the worst Halloween movie ever made. The acting is bad, except for Paul Rudd and Donald Pleasence. The girl who played Kara (forgotten her name) was ok, but overall, this movie was a big disappointment. Nothing had advanced the story, it lacked substance and the fears that made Halloween and H20 so good. Overall, skip this movie, the price of the rental is not worth it.
