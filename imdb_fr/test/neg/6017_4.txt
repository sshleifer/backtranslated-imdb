Christopher Guest is the master of the fake documentary. Werner Herzog is one of the many great documentaries on the market. Zak Penn is not good either, but he could certainly learn from the other two. Guest often plays with reality and fiction, but the distinction between the two is always clear in his films, a sort of essential with a fake documentary. Penn could also learn from The Blair Witch. Even if you knew it was a fake documentary that you totally bought in the world created by the filmmakers. It seems to the public that all this is real, even if basically you are watching fiction. In other words, it was a fiction disguised successfully in truth. In fact, many early audiences at Sundance and other early hearings thought it was real. Penn, whose strong point, by his own admission, is silkscreening, should probably stick to that. The production of documentaries or fake documentaries (and it is difficult to say where one begins and where the other ends with this film) is obviously not. <br /> <br /> Penn sets the stage for what he's trying to sell as a legitimate documentary on the set of a documentary, a kind of meta-documentary. Penn, however, confuses the audience and loses his confidence as soon as he enters Herzog's house before filming Herzog's film "Enigma of Loch Ness" on the myth of the Loch Ness monster (a film apparently never finished? because of Penn's interference). Even though apparently Penn is the director of the film we are watching, he starts by looking at the cameras and saying, "What is the film crew doing here?" and begins to hide from them. He does it on a few other occasions. He will stop and tell the cameras to stop filming, forcing the cameraman to hide in the shadows to capture excerpts from the dialogue between Herzog and Penn. It seems like a gadget, but it never says, and Penn seems to keep us deliberately in the dark. This lets the audience scratch their heads and ask themselves, "Who is responsible here?" If Penn is working against his own film crew, what kind of world are we part of? This is just one example of how he confuses the boundary between reality and fiction. <br /> <br /> Penn does not seem to enter fully into the fictional world (I think) until the crew saw what appears to be the Loch Ness monster. But by the time the monster makes its first appearance, we are totally out of the fictional world that Penn has been trying to create. Everything seems so ridiculous and useless. <br /> <br /> This is a potentially fascinating movie and a real missed opportunity as Penn has the opportunity to document a master at work, but completely loses focus and he becomes a movie about Penn and his antics instead of the shooting a documentary. Penn's presence begins to invade and eclipse the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> The interviews with Herzog are convincing and we think he does not act. We're even starting to wonder if Penn and the rest of his crew are fooled, like the public, but you're never sure. Penn, in his interviews with the camera, tries to be weird and funny, like the characters interviewed in a fake documentary by Guest, but he only manages to be boring. In a guest movie, this effect is hilarious, whereas here it falls flat because you never know what Penn is talking about. As a result, we, the public, start to hate it as much as the appearance of the team. Aside from the beautiful scenery and superfluous appearance, out of nowhere, a beautiful model, thrown to spice up the film, there is little to recommend here. Perhaps its only quality that redeems (an unintentional intention) is that it is an excellent example of why the public is important; and by completely ignoring the conventions of narration, you do them a disservice. For this reason alone, I think it would be a good movie to show to film students ?? a kind of "what not to do" kind of movie. I have nothing against an unconventionally told film as long as it is done with skill, with a thematic base to give it body. This film is completely missing in this respect. <br /> <br /> I'd like to call it a valiant effort, but I'm not sure what it is, except for a total mess and ultimately a waste of time. <br /> <br /> (Note: it seems that bad art always looks good.) This movie made me think of Lillian Ross's "Picture." Ross followed John Huston while shooting "L" red badge of courage "and brilliantly documented it for the New Yorker, it would be a very good movie, if you want a good example of meta-art, read it.)
