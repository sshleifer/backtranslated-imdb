Mr. Brento wonders if this film was produced by the same author of the TV series Dragonball Z. Of course not. <br /> <br /> This is a real action movie based in Hong Kong on the first episodes of the original Japanese cartoon (which was also based on a series of comics). And I really do not know if it was produced under the license of the creators of Dragonball ... <br /> <br /> However, the story of the monkey boy with special powers is an ancient tale known throughout the world. Asia (In Japan, the name of the boy in the story is Songoku, in China, it is Sunwukong, in Korea, it is Sonogong, etc.) and the story of Dragonball has a lot to do with this story. <br /> <br /> By the way, as I said, this film is based on the first episodes of the Dragonball series (followed by Dragonball Z, although I think the American version had a different release order ). And all the scenes related to sexuality were also included in the original cartoon series (without too much suraction and insistence on it!), But because of your comments, I guess they were completely removed from the dubbing American. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I agree with you about the film's over-capacity and the poor quality of this adaptation of the original drawing. But maybe because of that, nobody can forget it after looking at it ...
