I know it's impossible to keep all the details of a book in a movie. But this movie has changed almost everything for no reason. In addition, many changes made the story illogical. Some examples: 1) in the movie "Paul Renauld" really meets Poriot before his death (in the book, Poirot has only one letter), telling him that he was afraid of being killed. It's completely stupid, because if Renauld's plan had succeeded, Poirot would have known that the deceased would not have been Renauld (Poirot was at the morgue when Mrs. Renauld identified the victim). 2) The film "combined" two people in one! "Cinderella" has been removed from the movie. The girl Hastings is in love with and the ex-girlfriend of Jack Renauld are one of the people in the movie! Why for God's sake? 3) Hastings finds the victims because he is such a bad golf player. Totally ridiculous and stupid. 4) The movie tells secrets much too early (eg at the very beginning). So, you know things you should not know. 5) The murderer is shot at the end by a person who does not exist in the book. Perhaps because the person ("cinderella") who stops the murderer does not exist in the film. 6) The book is very complex. The film only takes about 90 minutes. Of course, it is difficult to include all the necessary details, but this is impossible if you include stupid things that were not in the book and have no meaning (for example, a bike race).
