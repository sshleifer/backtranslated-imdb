I felt that the film was rushed and the acting was full of holes. Arnold was good, but the main girl was stupid and the guy who played the devil was awful. The story was confusing and silly. The film had no meaning and was incredible. The film is not the worst film, but is not too far from it. Overall, I was terribly disappointed, it could have been much better. My score is 3 out of 10
