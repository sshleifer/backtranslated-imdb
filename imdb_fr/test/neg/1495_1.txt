Camp Blood (1999) is probably one of the worst horror movies of the 1990s. A group of countless teenagers gathered to discuss their fears. An uninvited guest showed up and kills everyone. movie that could challenge him for this title, has some of the most stupid characters and situations forever thanks to a TV screen. The so-called surprise ending is terrible, as is the rest of this movie. Slightly entertaining on a very bad level, he is good. My rating: 2 out of 10
