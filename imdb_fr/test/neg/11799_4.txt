Ted Nicolaou has done a lot of horror and fantasy movies. I'm looking for all his movies to see. I did not find this one for 3 years, until I found it unexpectedly on youtube. In fact, I wanted to see more ghosts and less discussion here. Looks like in 1999-2001, Ted had a crisis, maybe money. Its characteristics of this time are more like real garbage thrash z garbage films. But I do not pretend he's a bad director this time. Everything can happen. The end has some nice scary and suspenseful details but the whole movie was long boring dialogues. <br /> <br /> reserved for the real fans of Ted. <br /> <br /> www.myspace.com/neizvestnostlab
