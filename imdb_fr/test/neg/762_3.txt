C.H.O.M.P.S. is very similar to any number of comics from the Disney family of the late '70s, like The Cat from Outer Space or Unidentified Flying Oddball, for example. Absolutely devoid of creative, beating to death the same clichés, but entertaining vaguely in a thoughtless way. The actors will not win any prizes, any more than the director, scriptwriter or film crew of FX, but its harmless and bland predicability offer vague entertainment. The idea of ​​the robot robot as a security system is so full of holes that you could use it as a colander. The incredibly repetitive disco soundtrack will stay in your head, so beware.
