This is one of the most ridiculous movies I have ever seen. I can not believe that the one who wrote the review above was serious. Perhaps it was related to its manufacture. There is nothing that goes for that. There is no suspense, the acting is disastrous, the direction without hope. The score (?) Is composed of three banal notes played ad nauseam. The plot (?) Had to take five minutes to write. Dialogue is what a 10-year-old would suggest if asked to do a homework project. The only (slightly) redemptive characteristic is the actor playing the psychopath himself, who grimaces, trembles and transforms beautifully and is therefore sometimes amusing. The only reason you would be on the edge of your seat would be if you were suffering from a weak bladder. Do not waste your time.
