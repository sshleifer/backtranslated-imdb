Uncompromisingly horrible mishmash of the most notorious of the Roman emperors who went mad, leaving behind infamous party orgies and ruthless killings ... I know there are several versions, and this one is based on that of 102 min I watched - but I do not understand how it can make a difference to get the rest of this movie out of the mud! <br /> <br /> I had long heard about the "shocking" content of sex / Nudity (honestly, there is really not much here - and boring when there is) and the blood, but beware, it's the technical hobbyist of technical production that really shocks here: everything looks clear and simply like a junior movie school project! The work of the camera is hopelessly inept, full of weird zooms, missed framings and confusing pans (worms and what usually looks like a huge theater stage!) With grainy and cheap photo quality. The lighting and colors are terrible and uneven - is it day or night? Are they in or out? Have they changed scene? Who is or is supposed to be in the loop? Editing is the ultimate sin here, creating a confusing mess with random cutouts, flaws of continuity and random transitions that destroy any chance of momentum, progression of history - and implication. There is a potentially interesting dialogue and a true historical story just as interesting ... but these faults distract so much that it's tragic. <br /> <br /> A story with so many possibilities of being great is just a gargantuan, burnt (and Fellini a kind of turkey that fits only a few gobbled laughs and Peter O'Toole, who manufactures a most memorable Tiberius Oh yes, which brings us to the big names I'd like to line them up one by one and just ask: Who did you get free access to Bonk in the orgies to be part of that? I wasted enough notes on one of the worst movies of all time - a period! <br /> <br /> 1 of 10 from Ozjeppe
