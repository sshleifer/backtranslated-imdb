Another film that makes the Beach Boys story worse than it is. I remember especially the scene where Brian said he had to leave the tour and the other boys called him a traitor. I did not arrive like that, and as the film indicates at the beginning, some scenes have reacted too much. A movie about The Beach Boys does not have to be that way, anyway, a lot has happened. What is sad is that this film gives a bad image of boys to those who are not so familiar with the group. Hardcore fans like me knew it was not the whole story and that's why I gave a low score of 3. However, it's the best Beach Boys movie I've ever seen. now, which says a lot about the subject. the other films. If you want the truth, I recommend the documentary Endless Harmony.
