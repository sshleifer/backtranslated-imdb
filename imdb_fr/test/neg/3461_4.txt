It's a DVD rental movie. I'm a big fan of cast members, but the screenplay never really caught me. Do not expect "Oh brother where are you" in any way. The funny thing in my opinion is when the hero of the war explains what happens in the Argon. Looks like they were trying to copy some of Clooney's fun facial expressions into "Oh, my brother, where are you", but you could say they were trying for that. John Krasinski was the bright point and was solid all the way through. Renee Zellweger plays the role of a zealous journalist who is ready to do anything for history. Overall, it's a movie worth watching at home.
