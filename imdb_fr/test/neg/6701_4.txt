Last night, I attended a screening of Badland with my cousin. We were rather enthusiastic to learn once there that the director / screenwriter, the producer (his wife) and several cast members were also present and there would be a discussion and questions / answers after the film. But once the film finished and the credits began to roll (and the film was not really enough and is too long), my cousin and I, without consulting us, we immediately got up and left. We discovered, once we started talking outside, that we were both so angry that we not only did not want to stay for the discussion, but we could not even look at the actors and the team who stood near the exit and with whom we were walking. Next door, when to leave. <br /> <br /> I understood that the roots of my anger were planted during the scene in which Jerry cuts the palm of his daughter Celina with a large knife so that her blood can be used to leave. a false trail. It was inevitable to relate in my mind the physical pain that he inflicted on his body to the emotional pain he inflicted on his spirit by murdering his mother and two brothers in his presence, by sparing her and taking her with him. him when he fled. I sliced ​​my palm before (accidentally); even a rather superficial cut is incredibly painful because of the sensitivity of the palm and its slow healing if you do not hold it still, you just have to open it to try to take care of your life. But after a very short time, with only a narrow band of cloth knotted clumsily around her palm and a scene with a big blindfold, it was as if she had never been cut. My anger has reached its climax - I will not spoil this moment for you - in the final scene of Celina. <br /> <br /> I got angry because Celina is by far the most sympathetic character of the film (the actress is good); L was ?? and you can not tell me that a good scriptwriter would not know? immersed in physical and emotional pain; and the screenwriter, treating Celina's emotional pain so casually and with such disrespect, also treated me, the audience member, with cavalry and total lack of respect. a dialogue that tells us that she is in pain somewhere, somewhere. But at that moment, the audience feels so manipulated that we closed. The manipulation begins very early in this film, when the dialogue of Jerry's family makes it clear to the public that Jerry has psychiatric problems. First rule, writers: give credit to your audience. Let them do a good creative job by themselves. Tell the story; do not explain to us everything we are supposed to think and feel. We do not like that. <br /> <br /> My cousin also knew she was having trouble with the movie at the beginning of the dialogue, when Jerry and his wife had little to say to each other ***. this, f *** that, f *** you. Some couples find themselves so in such bad relationships that the f-bomb ends up being a word out of two. But it's like watching comedians who curse a lot. Some of them are really funny; the curse is incidental. But some of them substitute curses for humor, and this writer, to bring the metaphor to its conclusion, is not Chris Rock. <br /> <br /> This husband and wife couple has bravely chosen to tackle a terribly complex story with awful complexity. characters. But they do not seem to have realized that the meaning of a story, especially complex, will vary among members of the public. To tell stories successfully, one must pay attention to important factual details and not seek to interpret the meaning for the entire audience. <br /> <br /> I worked with veterans from Vietnam for five years. I heard more stories than most people. and I'm always happy to see films coming out that bring their stories to a wider audience. It is important that we hear them at all levels. But I'm not happy this storyteller decided even before the movie started what Jerry's story meant and began to explain it to us with a heavy hand. Next time, pay more attention to details.
