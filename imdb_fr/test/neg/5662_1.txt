iCarly tells the story of a teenage girl named Carly Shay (Miranda Cosgrove) who lives with her artist brother, Spencer, in a Seattle loft. Carly offers a webcast that collects millions of views and brings in tons of money each year. She has so much money that she "does not even know it's a real number". Her best friend is Sam (Janette McCrudy), who is as predictable as they come! She says "normal" things and beats Carly's neighbor, Freddie, who is in charge of everything that is technical for their web show. Carly screams every word and seems to have no emotion. Sam continues Freddie and Freddie screams. In one episode, Carly and his friends shoot down Lewbert (the porter) in an elevator and he survives. <br /> <br /> I would not recommend it at all unless you like teenagers shouting, hurting and making fun of everything.
