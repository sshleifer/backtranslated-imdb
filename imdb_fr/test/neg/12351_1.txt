I saw it in a preview screening and I must say that this documentary style movie is the biggest load of tripe I've ever seen. the whole audience (young and old) sat in the movie, most of them not laughing ... there were literally only two places where you would laugh in the whole movie I blame them ... I remained convinced that the film was going to resume, but that was never the case and I would have liked to leave. <br /> <br /> The humor was really lame and I'm surprised it was ever shown on the big screen. I am not at all offended by the adult content of this film. It was just not funny. The people who made this film do not really deserve your money. Do not pay to see this movie. <br /> <br /> It's not even funny enough to be broadcast on TV, not to mention the movies. .. <br /> <br /> I wanted to give him 0 out of 10, but the system does not allow it ...
