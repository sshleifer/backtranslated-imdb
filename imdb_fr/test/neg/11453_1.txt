The selection of "Cimarron", swollen, boring and racist, is considered the worst choice for the best film in Oscar history. Badly acted (especially of Richard Dix, just forgotten, whose performance as Yancey Cravat egocentric and irresponsible is among the most narcissistic characterizations of the history of the screen) and extremely rhythmic, the film really shocks today in because of his racist orientation. his only black character, presented sleeping asleep in a chandelier. <br /> <br /> Further comments from IMDb commentators have rejected the character's attitude, calling it a mere dated, but many films DO NOT depict blacks as mentally retarded and lazy mentally retarded the same way that this monster takes a delight; so that argument seems weak to say the least. But whether you consider this degrading characterization to be a shocking bad taste for someone at any time or simply forgivable ignorance of a less educated era, it is very painful to look with the eyes of the 21st century. <br /> <br /> But even that might not matter if the film was not as long as it was. Voted Best Academy Award Winner at the 1930/31 Oscars when such enduring classics as "City Lights", "The Public Enemy", "Dracula", "The Dawn Patrol" and "The Blue Angel" were not named, " Cimarron "is by far the worst choice to join the Oscars Hall of Fame.
