Reinterpretation very neat, glabrous, edgy. <br /> <br /> They fell in the "because it is modern, it must be plugged, slippery, etc." trap. <br /> <br /> "Romeo and Juliet" has done this idea a lot better, but I really think it's time to go beyond the two extremes (vintage piece versus angry film). <br /> <The mere fact that this film is "modern" does not mean that the film must look like an advertisement in a magazine or that it has something to do with drugs or guns. <br /> <br /> If the traps were the same as subtle as the honeyed words, Macbeth would be a much more powerful movie. As it is, read your Shakespeare. Read it aloud. Ask a few questions to your Oxford dictionary. Pass the movie. Or, but you have been warned. <br /> <br /> Sorry for the very long review. IMDb made me do it.
