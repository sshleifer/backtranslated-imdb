This movie was not good at all. Here is the first clue and it will not be a strong film. Harrison Ford's name not only appears first, but is also bigger than the title. The music has been nominated for an Oscar. what was that? This music was probably the most annoying thing in the movie. The acting was mediocre at best, except that the Amish boy did a decent job for his youth. Then you have the story that was weak and a little on the spot, and he won for adapted! The music was awful, I know I already said something but it was really bad. The premises were really good and it should be redone. Well, that's all I really have about it. <br /> <br /> Your type at the cinema, <br /> <br /> -Trever
