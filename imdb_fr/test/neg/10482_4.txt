Okay, when I bought this movie, I thought this movie was supposed to be the ultimate B-movie, Space Monkey landing on Earth and immediately starting to kill people! <br /> <br /> Well, that was just about all I expected, a typical 1960s low-budget scifi movie. Playing must be the worst I've ever seen, especially the girl who plays the main role and the girl who plays the waitress made me laugh with laughter. <br /> <br /> So why "Night Fright" does not fall into the category "so bad that it's good"? The reason is that some scenes were too long and boring. For example, the scene where the police were looking for clues in the woods was a few minutes walk aimlessly. And then the grand finale, the people waiting for the monster about 5 minutes and when the space monkey appears, it gets up in 20 seconds, end of the movie. <br /> <br /> Yeah, 'Night Fright' is boring, but there have been some fun moments. I can recommend this movie to anyone who liked movies like "Zontar, the thing of Venus" or "The curse of the creature of the swamps". <br /> <br /> I give 4 monkey slaps from the space "Night Fright". . <br /> <br /> -Rob Gruesome-
