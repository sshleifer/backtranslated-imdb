I will limit myself to the following points: 1. Very poorly written. 2. Try to be like Resident Evil. 3. Zombies are slow and docile one minute the next. 4. Never seen the blood get cleaned up so easily! 5. The special effects are not as good as the original "undead day". 6. Act not as well as "fat and beautiful". 7. It looks like it was written in a week and done the following week. <br /> <br /> The Basicaly Med team and special forces visit a zombie infested university to find the first zombie and extract a serum to cure the plague. All die except the 2 main stars so predictable, even if they are not armed and are invaded by a hundred zombies. However, the special forces (formed as part of the nursery school scouts) took only one zombie to kill them, even if they had weapons. Also the obligatory reflex on hand to fill the gaps. Overall load of waste.
