This film is very difficult to understand, why does the couple want to divorce? No reason is given, we know nothing of their lives in Lisbon and even nothing of Mary's work. We can only understand that a certain boredom has appeared in this life. We do not even know who took the initiative to ask for a divorce. <br /> <br /> The way of filming is quite special: I did not know the name of the director before the end of the film, when I read On the screen, I understood why it was so slow , only 42 shots in a hundred minutes (I counted them)! It reminded me of some of the Japanese films that I saw in the 90s. In fact, we have to accept the fact that it is the expression of another culture, even if the decor is Western. I do not know if this story could have suited a Japanese couple. <br /> <br /> We can see the logic of the scenes but the result is boring, anyway I decided to look at the end because I wanted to get the spirit and meaning of everything. In fact, I only understood that the story of these two beings is perhaps not over because the train leaves the station without Marie. It's little for such a long time! I can not recommend this job.
