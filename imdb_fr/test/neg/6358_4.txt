* Spoilers - sorry! * The first word we thought about watching the movie is 'Gremlins'. This is the only movie about the critters that I saw among the four films, but I appreciated. It was not too complicated because I had not seen the last two, but I thought it was still a good movie. <br /> <br /> Critters begins with a man, his son and daughter who stop on the way to vacation (even if it turns out they end up at home - what I do not know at all.) The girl ends up with a boy (played by Leo DiCaprio) and they will hang out in a nearby forest. They meet this strange guy who tells them to be careful and trick because of the critters. He seems a little psychotic and if I were in this situation, I would not talk to him. The critters steal the car from the girl and the boy and end up in their apartment. They hide in the basement and end up killing that lazy idiot. They almost killed that fat woman and the girl's father. They are pursued higher and higher in the apartment until they hide in the attic. Bugs eat things in the kitchen (parody of Gremlins cooking ???!). And I do not remember (it's not a good thing) but I'm sure they have to go back for something / someone. Anyway, they end up going out and are saved. The psychotic guy comes back and, before killing the last two creatures, he is told that he can not because they are in danger and he sends them home. <br /> <br /> The end was disappointing and I was annoyed that A lazy guy died, because there were a lot of boring characters that I personally would have killed. It is an exciting and exciting film that is worth seeing. But, if you're looking for a better version of this genre, I recommend Gremlins movies. Sorry!
