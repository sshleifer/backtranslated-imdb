This show was an amazing idea, fresh and innovative in the 70's during its first broadcast. The first 7 or 8 years were brilliant, but things deteriorated afterwards. In 1990, the show was not really funny, and it continued to regress at the loss of time it is today. <br /> <br /> It is really a shame that the show has fallen. The writing is painfully bad, the performances are almost as bad - if not for the slightly entertaining respite of guest-hosts, this show probably would not be broadcast yet. I find it so hard to believe that the same creator who manually selected the original cast also chose the group of hacks that followed. How can one recognize such brilliance and then consider it opportune to replace it with such mediocrity? I felt that I had to give 2 stars out of respect for the original cast that made this show so successful. At this moment, the show is horrible. I can not believe it's still on the air.
