Sorry, after looking at the credits, I thought it would be at least a decent tribute to the retired SF actors. <br /> <br /> I was wrong. <br /> <br /> The direction and story told in this movie POS are terrible. I have never been so insulted by a production. <br /> <br /> I have a lot of respect and love for many of the actors of this "film", but I must say that they have been deceived. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen this debacle yet, do yourself a favor and stay away. It's not just two hours that you will not come back, but they will also spoil your respect for some actors that you may have already appreciated.
