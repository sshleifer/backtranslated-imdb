Finally, here is finally a preview of this underrated film. But you can not find a good copy, a terrible copy filled with green drops, the editing is not synchronized, the sound sometimes has a terrible whistling and you can even sometimes hear the camera. Overall, it is too dark, you should say, but it is not. It's a little slow, the first part of the film speaks and makes love. It's even strange that girls in 1960s movies never wear a bra. When they enter the bedroom, his glory is total. Anyway, banned in the UK for 84 years and still on the list of bad video. The reason is simple, it's gore for their time. There are really some nasty dismemberments and it's scary in a way because of the fact that it's filmed in handycam. Thus, every picture of the image moves, what they do nowadays with the stabilized camera. The Ghastly Ones could have been better if the quality of the movie was better, but still better than other movies of the time, like Schoolgirls In Chains.
