Please watch the 3 series again and do not go see this movie, the trailer is completely misleading and the 3 weakest characters in the series extend a 25 minute badly thought-out TV episode in the most painful 2 hours of my life, really a horrible film. tubbs and edward are in for a few minutes, micky has 1 line, and his lipp just rewind the same old tired word games, the focus of mr briss changes about 5 times in the movie tons of badly played extras, and really some laughs that they seem to recycle for 2 hours, honestly, I feel that this series was completely ruined by this horrible shit .......... batman and robin, all is forgiven
