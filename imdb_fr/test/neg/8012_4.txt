I'm a fan of Judy Garland, Vincente Minnelli and Gene Kelly, but this film leaves me cold. I was expecting another American in Paris from Minnelli, so maybe I was expecting too much. <br /> <br /> The film was short in songs and impressive dance numbers. I was impressed by Kelly's highly expressionistic dance as a Mococo on the ship. I was also impressed by the Nicholas Brothers in Be a Clown, a shame that the song is so annoying. I also appreciated that Judy is attacking Kelly with bric-Ã -brac. Check out Lorna Luft's autobiography for some interesting information about this scene. <br /> <br /> In fact, the film contains what must be one of Cole Porter's most boring songs, including "Nina". In addition, Judy and Gene constantly shout like screaming kids. <br /> <br /> The plot is thin - which is comparable to musical drama - but it's not backed up by impressive dance numbers or memorable songs. I suspect that the best parts of this film have been left on the floor of the editing room. Please, a movie restorer, find these movie pieces and show us what the movie could have been!
