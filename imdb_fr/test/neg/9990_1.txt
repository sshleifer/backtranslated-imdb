I saw this movie at the age of 18 with a group of friends. His reputation had preceded him and, although all my friends were also of legal age, I was the only one to have the courage to enter the video store and rent it. We gathered in a house where the parents had left the city for the weekend. Although we are sitting close to each other, we have neither spoken nor acknowledged the presence of the other. In the end, the film deserved and did not deserve the anticipated shame we felt. Caligula tries to transcend genres by combining a historical epic with a cheeky pornographic film. <br /> <br /> Caligula tries to transcend genres. He fails miserably in his ambition, subjecting the public to the worst of both worlds. The obvious selling point of the film is its pornographic aspect, and it provides much more than its share of real sex. But placing this sex in the context of Caligula's depraved reign makes it even less worthy of the act than the average adult movie. Contextless sex could at least be physically pleasurable for the consenting adults involved, but pleasure and perhaps even consent are largely absent from the world of Caligula. Sex serves at best as an idle pastime and at worst as an instrument of sadistic domination. Nowadays it is quite common to hear words such as "sin" and "depravity" used facetiously to describe pleasurable acts that are considered taboo according to certain moral or religious perspectives. Caligula takes the viewer beyond facetiousness by portraying true depravity and demonstrating that it provides neither joy nor pleasure. <br /> <br /> Not only do historical parts fail to contextualize sex significantly, but they do not entertain, enlighten, intrigue. , or interest the viewer in any way. They provide only long periods of incessant boredom. Rarely has a film been so boring. Sex, after the initial shock and astonishment fades, only contributes to the general monotony of the image. <br /> <br /> Rarely the discussions on this film imply its violence. Although many more violent films than Caligula have been shot, few of them can compete with him in terms of shock. Apparently, relentless barbarism and hyper-depraved sexuality characterized the emperor of Caligula. Violence is even weaker for sensitive souls than for sex. <br /> <br /> Such an examination will probably generate as much curiosity as it does not want to. I understand why someone would like to see this movie. after all, I myself have succumbed to the same curiosity. I simply hope that my criticism, by clearly describing its lack of redemptive value, will at least give potential viewers the necessary knowledge to make an informed decision about whether to see it or not. My high school criminal justice teacher described police work as "hours of boredom punctuated by moments of pure terror". This statement perfectly describes Caligula. You were warned.
