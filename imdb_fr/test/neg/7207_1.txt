Previously, video distributors such as Sub Rosa and Brain Damage Films broadcast low-budget, video-driven horror movies at a gorehound market of choice that consumed them with joy. It's okay for me, because you can see these one-and-a-half-mile movies with their models and their tacky titles. <br /> <br /> We now have Lions Gate in the mix, they only decided it would be better to drop their pitfalls by putting a "professional" quality blanket and charging the same price as the one of its professional features at higher budget. Do not be sucked by that! Of course, if you have already seen Dark Harvest 1 or 2, you already know what to expect with 3 but there is a place for movies like this and it is not on a shelf of a video store next to professional functions. <br /> <I'm a freelance movie fan and I watched several low-budget, video-driven productions that were a worthy rental, but it was one of the worst films I've ever seen. The "game" (if you can call it that) was catastrophic. It was fun to laugh at the horrible line for a minute or two, but in the end it was too hard to take and became unbearable. The story is bad, the dialogue is worse, the game of actors manages to be even worse. The only thing that could save this scene would be a debunking scene that always manages to be awful, but that is an award-winning effect over the blood splatter that occurs after a girl's slap or decapitation of the model. . <br /> <br /> That took I tried three times to cross all this film and I did it only because I paid a lot of money to rent it and that I had at least the finish in full. Stay away - stay away, far away from this one.
