Wait to watch this one .... I mean, even after reading this review. No other film so far has sucked so much as this one .... One thing I will not understand is that when you rip a film in English, why add your own creativity? With the amount spent on the production of this film, the producers should have considered buying rights on "Cellular" in Hindi and releasing the film. They might have gotten profits that way, I guess. If there was a chance to score this movie with a 0, I would have done it and the most pathetic performances come from Tanushree Datta and the girl who played Aftab's teammate. I do not know if my problem is that I saw Cellular much earlier than this movie ..... but that can not be a reason to support this movie ... I could go on for hours but I do not I do not have the time either. To discuss this useless shit of a movie, I do not want to remember those awful scenes from the movie ..... <br /> <br /> Please stay away from this movie.
