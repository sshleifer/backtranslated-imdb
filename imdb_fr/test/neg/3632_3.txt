First, I want to dispel a common misconception: It is not unrealistic that the school Zoey will give laptops to students. In my school, students in grade 7 and up must have an Apple MacBook (this is paid in the entry price). Move on to something else This show is very annoying. He has boring and predictable intrigues and bad action. Often, in the show, he brings "girls power" to a new high, with girls beating guys in everything they try. But that's not the worst. The worst of all is that girls are all described as being focused on their personal appearance and screaming when they are happy. With the exception of the only intelligent girl, who is described as a monster obsessed with ugly boys and science. However, this show is very addictive. I do not know why, but it is. Although the most recent season was SO MUCH horrible, it brought stereotypes, boring intrigues and bad actions to extremes that I would never have imagined inaccessible. So I'm not hooked anymore, thankfully.
