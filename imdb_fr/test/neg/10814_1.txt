The movie "The Cave" must be one of the worst films I have ever seen. There was no plot, no scenario, and the lighting was terrible. During most of the film, I was not able to make sense of the landscape because it was lit by flashlights. The "gray" spaces that persisted throughout the movie were boring. The only scene that really went through was clearly in the cavern lit by what appeared to be a bad simulation of the conditions to be found in Hell. Overall, the movie was not really interesting to watch. If producers can not come up with something better than that, they should find another job. The underwater scenes were particularly dreadful, consisting mainly of bubbles and flashlights, with sometimes a look at the actors. In summary, a really horrible movie with poor lighting, foreign lightning.
