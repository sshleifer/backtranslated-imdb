American Graffiti is one of the best movies ever made. I've seen it at least 30 times and I'm emotionally affected every time I see it. (I graduated from high school in 1962.) <br /> <br /> However, More American Graffiti is one of the worst films ever made. <br /> <br /> It's hard to believe that anyone associated with the great original movie has been involved with this terrible sequel. The part of the film in Vietnam was extremely imprecise. (I spent 18 months in Vietnam with the 101st Airborne Division.) <br /> <br /> The whole film has no value in any part. <br /> <br /> If anyone ever wants to defend a case More American Graffiti would be the best example of what can go wrong against great movies.
