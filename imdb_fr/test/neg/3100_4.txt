It has been said that some administrators make low budget images look like blockbusters. Albert Pyun gives the impression that low budget movies look like high school A / V project films. This film was sorely lacking in all departments. Virtually every scene hangs out, the "experimental" lighting and the camera work are terrible, Rob Lowe apparently seeming to be unkempt, and Europop's euphoric low figures stop the film. On the benefits side, Burt Reynolds is doing a great job with what he has given (which is not a lot), Mario Van Peebles is surprisingly correct and Ice-T is staging another group of longtime gangsters . Not the worst job of Pyun (Urban Threat), but certainly not his best (Mean Guns).
