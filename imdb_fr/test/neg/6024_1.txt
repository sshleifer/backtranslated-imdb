I remember Hey Hey Fuss and I saw the Jackson Jive, it was a pretty simple comedy sketch but I saw that and it's free and is clear? Have I forgotten something? If the black community has to complain about racist comments in a TV show, that should be the case and if you've read my previous comments, I'm not an easy guy to offend. The basic plot is that an African / American settles next to this white guy and they make such racist comments as the value of a house will fall just because of black neighbors and the white guy makes references like ( If your easily offended by racial Slurs Do not read) Nig-Nog Jungle Boy Sambo. (I'm sorry, but it's really happening in this show, I'm really a guy who's fine with the black community.) People could tell me to clear up, but even when you're eliminating racial slorr, it's strange No new joke misinterpreted & I Can swear in an episode I saw someone's eyes focus on something unknown with the situation. All in all horrible comedy.
