Among the four main actors here - John Candy, Jean Kelly, Amy Madigan and Macauley Caulkin - the only one I have ever heard of (at that time) is the one that pissed me off and ruined the film. Well, she had to do a decent job to make me want to throw her with the VHS in the trash. I refer to Kelly as a bratty teenager, "Tia Russell". Ironically, six years later, she played an amazing and extremely friendly role in the character of "Rowena Morgan" in "Mr. Holland's Opus". <br /> <br /> Candy, as usual, is fun to watch as "Buck Russell", "or the character of the title," Uncle Buck. "Not many actors were as good at playing an adorable and unfortunate slob as Candy, I enjoyed her character here, but I can not watch this spoiled teenager more than once, and in the first few minutes of the movie , the little boy "Miles" (Cauklin) pronounces the word "G-damn." What harm does it have to have a six-year-old who says in vain the name of the Lord on a movie? Hollywood is so sick, no wonder many of their child actors turn out to be mentally messed up, like Caulkin.
