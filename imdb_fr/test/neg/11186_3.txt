OK, this is a historical film that caused an uproar, shocked people and was banned. I'll give it to him, that's why I gave him a 3 rather than a 1. It might have been ahead of his time, but it's certainly late now. I am a big fan of Salvador Dali and I loved an Andalusian Dog. This short film was captivating with one creative scene after another. The golden age was far too long and boring - it was only a self-indulgent pompous film, created simply as a faint attempt to outdo An Andalusian Dog by creating a feature film (and shameless operator Dali). name and fame even though it does not have much to do with it). Total, except for a few (very) rare shots of "shocking scenes" separated by long periods of boring non-action. A waste of time and money. My two thumbs are low, very low. This will go on my shelf to no longer be watched.
