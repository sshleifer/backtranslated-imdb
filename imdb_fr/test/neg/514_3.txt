Intentional word game. This low-budget action / horror vehicle for Don Wilson's ability to kick is the basis of the price of direct video shooting. <br /> <br /> The plot: Wilson is a humorous vampire hunter who is under fire from local law enforcement after being forced to kill creatures of the night in public view. The police pursue him, the vampires pursue him, he reacts by kicking ... a lot. <br /> <br /> There is a little more in the story, but it is so insignificant that I honestly do not remember it; I think people have actually spoken in the movie, but it's debatable. The plot is nothing more than an organization that allows Wilson to kill as many vampires as possible, usually by kicking them. <br /> <br /> The technical specifications are, in a word, anemic. Little color processing, amateur use of lighting, simplistic use of the camera and the angle. Blood and blood are visibly limited, which is strange for this type of film. The most hurtful of all shooting scandals is the discordant change of the super shaking camera during each fight scene. If the camera starts to bounce like a reese monkey about speed, then you know that Don is about to start giving the best of himself. <br /> <br /> In the end, this is the kind of bad movie we can do. good with some friends and a lot of cynical humor. Otherwise, do not look, unless you really like to watch things get kicked. <br /> <br /> 3/10
