I bought a DVD of this movie for a dollar at the department store. This is probably the best and the nicest comment I have to make. At least that did not stop me from paying the price of lunch. <br /> <br /> The problem of "Chiller" is Craven's problem as a director. His apologists claim his travel papers prove he is a very intelligent guy and a complete conceptualist. But it's no secret that as a director, he has never possessed an iota of the visual and narrative sense of a Hitchcock. As "Chiller" strongly testifies, he is much closer to the legendary Hershel Gordon Lewis. What's missing in Craven as a director is the main ingredient that would take him from the director to the lease to move to a higher level of film production. <br /> <br /> Let's be precise. The moments of transition of this film are refined. The shots give him the impression of a quality production. The film was designed in a professional manner, like a film shot by a television director. (One thought: the visual distinction between films, these at least transitions that look professionally managed may very well be the work of some second unit directors.) These are the parts between the bridges and the soft transitions - the drama - who fall flat. <br /> <br /> The essence of the procedure is systematically treated superficially. Critical Strokes (after, say, leaving the car in the camera well positioned, then we head out to the outside of a hospital, then into the waiting room and hallway, then into the phone booth in the corner, which will appear in the next actions) are quickly distributed so that we can hurry and move on to the next part. Craven never manages to explode the dramatic or visual possibilities of any moment. The end result of all this misplaced attention on the less important parts and the frantic race to keep things moving is a film that resembles the work of the young art student who sharpens all his pencils, ferociously adjusts his easel and its lighting. Raise, crush all his pigments, stretch and start his web ... and then have nothing more to say. Craven, like the art student, never gets to the reality of the exercise. <br /> <br /> For the Craven apologists who will point out that this film was shot for television, I will post Spielberg's "Duel" and say no. more.
