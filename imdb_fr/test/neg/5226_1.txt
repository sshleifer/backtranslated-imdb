Wow, that's the big-time anti-Christian bias! This is based on a novel by Stephen King and he wrote this kind of bias before Hollywood exaggerates it even more. In this film, we see a Protestant pastor and a Catholic priest behaving like fools and being profane at the same time. Of course, the devil took control of the city, so maybe his influence was on those guys too, but these are typical Hollywood representations. They never show a minister who speaks and acts like Billy Graham, or your local minister or priest. And - another "given" - they make the character of Satan the most interesting of the film. <br /> <br /> Max Von Sydow plays the devil and makes him a nice man. Ironically, Von Sydow played many of these roles after portraying Jesus in the 1964 film, "The Greatest Story Ever Told". Wondering why the actors are so damn? They do not know if they are God, Satan or anyone in between. <br /> <br /> Ed Harris, who has played so many inconceivable roles so far, is well described in this story. He and the rest of the petty characters in this movie do not make it fun to watch. <br /> <br /> From what I've heard, King's book is even darker and sicker than this hate-filled movie. but better built. Frankly, we do not care. King and Hollywood deserve each other.
