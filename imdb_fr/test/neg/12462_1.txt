In general, I try to find as many movies as possible to enjoy. I made no exception with "Tart", doing my best to enjoy it for what it was. But no effort, no matter how big, could possibly buy this pitiful excuse for a movie. <br /> <br /> It failed for several reasons. First, cinematography was directionless and ineffective. Secondly, the script reached depths of "poor", which really propelled it beyond the category "so bad that it's good". Third, the interim game left something to be desired - it was appalling, really. Anyone who has seen Mischa Barton (seen here as the terrible terrible Grace, a character so badly invented and aware that Ja Ja Binks does not seem so bad), like Devon in "Lawn Dogs" John Duigan will wonder what is wrong between yesterday and today. . Perhaps, if she had been given a character worthy of trouble, and a minimum of orientation, she could at least have given this film ONE a redeeming feature film. Alas, that was not the case. Finally, the film seemed to have no interest, expressing nothing, not realizing anything. Really, I wonder why Christina Wayne has bothered. <br /> <br /> "Tart" weakly tried to be something and failed. The result - a movie, unfortunately, is so bad that it's just very bad. Do not worry, it's not worth it.
