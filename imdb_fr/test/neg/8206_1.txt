If it were possible to give negative stars, I would do it for this stinkburger. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, I'm afraid a good shit movie. I am a big fan of movies like Octoman, Mars Wizard, Queen King and others. Real classics of cinema B. <br /> <br /> But this film gives Jack Nicolson and Boris Karloff in The Terror an air of winner of the academy !! The Dialouge is so unnecessarily long and above all badly used. (ie "I will now be condensed (yes, condensed !!) as you wish." The acting might have been much better if it had had some more logical lines. <br /> The story, what a story, A The count is exiled because his wife had leprosy.I am still not sure to know.A (rich?) and captain of one of his ships crashing on the island? people acting abnormally? -films a lot, there is a lot of its charm, but it was just stupid..plain stupid.a salt sea captain that sounds as good as a university teacher? A fleet owner who is as helpless as they come (I felt this guy had no idea how to play it, a scene where he plays Spanish, the next English / European) The count, who is not sure if he is a reincarnation or really DeSade (do not ask me how DeSade takes into account, after 4 beers my wife, mo my friend and I, we still could not understand. <br /> <br /> I could show this turkey to my grandchildren and only worry about falling asleep. I like a lot of horror movies from the early '60s, and some still have good shocks, but this thing ... never had a shock, or even a hint of fear. <br /> <br /> On the info on the back, it says, "This movie contains scenes so vivid and degrading that they will surpass your worst nightmare." The ONLY degradation is to WATCH THIS FILM. It's 90 minutes (you say it's 74 minutes) of your life, you do not recover. <br /> <br /> I only paid one dollar, yes one dollar, for this film and another. I always feel like I owe 50 cents of money for this session. <br /> <br /> To sum up, Dungeon of Harrow had NO name of Harrow, but there was a pretty cardboard dungeon.
