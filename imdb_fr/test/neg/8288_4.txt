I must say that I am not a big fan of Troma movies. I've only seen three (or four, including this one), but two (blood-sucking Freaks and Mother's Day) are widely known to be the best, which leads me to believe that all the others are worthless seeing. This would certainly be the case with graduation, a Troma version of the highly popular 80s slasher. Although the film is never particularly bad (given the type of film), it is never particularly good either. ; and in the end, all I could think was "why did I bother to look at this? Be that as it may, the plot sees a girl dying on a race track and soon after; more people are starting to die. Of course, there are some possible suspects; but it's hard to worry about everything that's going on. Of course, in clear terms; it's the gore that's the most important, and given Troma's roadmap for the red thing, I was expecting a lot of things. There are scenes of decent killings, and some are bloody; but it's never very shocking, which really makes another sullen sullen based on a celebratory event of the American calendar. It should be noted that Queen Linea Quigley, a movie queen, has a small role to play in this film, but the rest of the cast does not deserve to be mentioned. The direction, the intrigue and its execution are very commonplace; and I will say that unless you are a big fan of Troma or someone who wants to find all the slasher ever made; do not bother with this movie.
