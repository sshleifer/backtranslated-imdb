I saw it when it was released in theaters in 1996. I remember that I already knew the work of Elijah Wood (it's true, he had already done things before "The Lord of the Rings"!) And the Commercial links with the movie were beautiful. abundant ("Flipper" water pistols were circulating). <br /> <br /> The adults were reminded of the old movies and a TV show and, for the sake of nostalgia, they took their kids to see him, who were excited because it was a movie about a dolphin and a stupid boy. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it was not what we expected and collapsed severely. You know that a movie has problems when a boy swims away from a hammerhead shark in the middle of the ocean and a pack of dolphins scares the shark and the kid - instead of getting out of the water in a boat - floats in the water for five minutes, thanking his dolphin for saving him ... apparently he did not realize that the shark was still outside, maybe even below him. <br /> <br /> Paul Hogan is another problem. He looks old, crisp and tired of recycling his shetick Croc Dundee. To this day, no one even remembered "Crocodile Dundee", let alone Hogan, and I almost expected him to suddenly start pretending he did not know what a hair dryer was. for laughs of social satire or fish. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's a really poor, "amateurish" family movie and almost hard to watch from time to time. I hated him when I saw him in the movie theaters in '96 and I hate him no more now.
