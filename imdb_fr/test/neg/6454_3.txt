A hideous, heartless cheater in Hollywood who is only waiting for the ugliness and heartlessness of her audience. Scenes WITHOUT Spacey reveal just how awful the movie is. But the scenes with Spacey are so much fun that you will linger until the end. Yes, he could play that role in his sleep but he does it so well, he is so happy to watch it, so credible and so wonderfully monstrous. Enjoy it for its performance, but do not expect anything else from this movie. If you want to see a great movie about the evils of modern Hollywood, check out "The Player" by Robert Altman. This sad little boiler is not remote in the same league.
