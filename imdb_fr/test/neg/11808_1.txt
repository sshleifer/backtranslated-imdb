The video box of 'Joyride' says "featuring superstars of the second generation", and we can not help but be sad. Granted, Melanie Griffith has moved on to bigger and better things ... but who cares about the rest of the cast? So, since that's what draws attention to the box, I was stupid enough to buy the movie for a dollar thinking that I would be in the country of movies 'so bad-they-are-good' 70s' Uh, not so much. While so many 70s youth-oriented movies (or just 70s old movies) have tried so hard to say something deep and meaningful, Joyride does not even try. It's just aimless. He is devoid of any interest. Each character is so poorly designed that it is not surprising that these actors seem so apathetic. <br /> <br /> In summary, the film is about three young people over the age of 20 who go to Alaska to start a business but get stolen to find work. They are beaten, eating dog food, stealing cars, robbing banks. All this is very typical, but in addition, it is executed in the most banal way possible. There are no surprises and the casting is so bad, and the actions of the characters so ambiguous that you can miss several scenes without disturbing you. <br /> <br /> But if you're a fan of Melanie Griffith's breasts - then that's a must. It is still not enough to get this result above the lowest note I can give. <br /> <br /> Best sentence: "Jesus, everything is biology at home." * out of ****
