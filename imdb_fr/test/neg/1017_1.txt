Director Fabio Barreto got a strange name at the Academy for his latest film, O Quatrilho. Quatrilho is a bad movie, but in Bella Donna, Barreto made one of the worst movies of all time. His adaptation of the novel Riacho Doce is ridiculous. Think with me how poor Brazilian fishermen speak perfect English? In the movie they do. There is no script, it is only a very long video with beautiful places and many sex scenes with Moscovis and Henstridge.
