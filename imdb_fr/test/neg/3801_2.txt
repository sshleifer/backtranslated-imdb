The sequels, well, there are many reasons to make them, but what went through Irwin Allen's mind to come up with such a boring idea goes beyond all logical questions. There are so many open responses to this film that it's ridiculous ... like The Poseidon, which is a monstrous ship with drifting passengers and just that Michael Caine with his miniboat and a villain Telly Savalas discover the boat .. At first, the French navy was flying over the wreck with its helicopter, but as a sinking cruise ship is daily, they fly away ... What am I trying to say? Hmmm, Michael Caine gets on board with Sally Field and he could get everything back (diamonds) if there was not a Telly Savalas looking for weapons on the ship ... God, why am I wasting my money? words here? It's ridiculous to know that Field and Caine were involved, which makes you think of what went through their head when reading scripts ... certainly no diamonds ...
