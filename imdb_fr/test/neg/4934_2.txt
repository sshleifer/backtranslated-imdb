I had a hard time sitting down there. Every turn is predictable. You sit there waiting ... wait ... and yes, that's it! Just as you predicted at the very beginning of the film. Or 10 minutes outside. Etc. <br /> <br /> Smart writing? No. <br /> <br /> Torture porn? No, there is no nudity. Other critics who describe this torture as pornography are most likely written by drug addicts. Unfortunately, there is no torture and no nudity (yes, no nudity). <br /> <br /> There is no suspense in this "thriller". The only good thing about this movie is the end, but I'm not going to ruin it. <br /> <br /> I give him a 2/10. A 1/10 would be a horrible B movie. This movie had better play.
