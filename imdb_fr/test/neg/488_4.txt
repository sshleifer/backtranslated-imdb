This short film was the last and only short film by director Del Lord. The problem: it was quite weak and the caf√© scene was more like a copy of a short film by Curly "Busy Buddies" (1944). The interrogation scene was quite funny and the beginning of the coffee party. But there are many plotholes in this short film. For example, why do the henchmen hide in the trash when the police arrive? In the remake "Of Cash And Hash" (1955), the director Jules White corrects this problem. The reason the guys are hiding in the trash is that there is a shootout between the police and the armored car thieves. The scene in which Moe has problems with the oyster has already been made with Curly in "Dutiful But Dumb" (1941). The part of the spooky house was not so great except for the hilarious scene outside the spooky house. To top it off, the end had no stings. Note: C-
