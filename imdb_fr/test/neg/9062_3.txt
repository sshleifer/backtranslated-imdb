I saw this film with a friend who had run a marathon with me and we both had the same feeling: it was not very motivating, and we did not even mention the idea of ​​what a training program. non-marathoners might have an idea of ​​what it would take for them to train and run one. In fact, there was virtually no technical information. I did not expect it to be a heavy instructional video in technology, but when this information was close to zero, the movie was simply not balanced and was not particularly useful for non-marathoners who were considering their first descent. <br /> <br /> There were other problems. Some of the very first images are people who collapse near death while trying to run a race. Yes, really inspiring. The timing was also difficult to follow because it was semi-chronological, but the filmmakers rarely gave you good clues as to when you were watching. And they withheld information. You see that Kantor has an injury and you just assume it's all her training, but several scenes later, they finally tell you it's because she stumbled on a pine cone in her garden. <br /> <br /> The games were very good, however, like that of a woman defying the race officials who wanted the race to be reserved for men, and the coverage of a race in Chicago where two of the runners described earlier were competing for first place. <br /> <br /> From memory, I'm thinking of other chronological documentaries, such as Supersize Me and Grass, where you always know where you are and where you feel like you've said everything you want know. <br /> <br /> In short, it would not have been difficult to make a better marathon movie, and in the current state, I can not recommend to non-marathoners to educate them and incite them to try one, because I do not do it. I do not think it will have that effect.
