The story of an ex-Navy Seal who became a combat medical officer assigned to an ultramodern Russian submarine with a nurse. It is a question of answering a call for help launched by a dying member of the initial crew. The submarine has been overtaken by terrorists determined to destroy. So we see the duo trying to regain control. And that happens with the fear of the US Naval Forces releasing everything it has on the terrorist submarine to prevent it from launching its arsenal. Pay attention to the explicit sex scene at the beginning of the first quarter of the movie. Some unexplained scenes towards the end. Watch when you have time. Nothing to lose even if you let the show unfold while you go get yourself a cup of coffee: it moves slowly.
