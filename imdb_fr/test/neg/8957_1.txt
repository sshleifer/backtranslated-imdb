It was a shocking film and I literally gasped when I saw the Blue Screen puppets. Imagine the worst blue screen special effects you've ever seen, make the situation even worse, then combine it with poorly made rubber and Play-doh puppets that look like a semi-preschool art class. -retard√©e. Then add some screams, Yngwie Malmstein-esquire, metal-melodic guitar solos far too strong and too long. The film as a whole is absolutely awful and makes "Feeders" look like "Rashomon". It's one of the worst films I've ever seen, with every quantifiable metric in a dark spiral, a bit like a water-soaked shit in the slow, perpetual whirlwind of a broken Rest Stop toilet. Nevertheless, a movie like "Actium Maximus" should not be missed by bad film conveyors, even by searching for clips on YouTube or elsewhere. This film is a little revealing, if you can handle the journey. I think this director may be mentally ill, which is a little degrading. Watching him discuss the project, you feel that he really believes he has created something wonderful. I guess he's the "Star Wars kid" of gonzo filmmakers. What a mess. :-)
