<br /> <br /> Spoilers <br /> <br /> I'll be as nice as I can about this movie (some people, including directors!), can be very upset when critics speak out , then ... <br /> <br /> There is a nice car accident and the opening credits are beautiful and ... that's all; everything else bites the big one. All the actors are appalling, the scenario is embarrassing, the special effects look like those of schoolchildren on cheap computers. Overall, the film has serious tendencies in bowling shoes. <br /> <br /> As a horror movie, it's not very scary and if it's supposed to be a horror movie for a "thinking man", he's managed to a certain level, I kept thinking that the end of this film is very far away. It may be an ironic look at bad horror movies, but I still lose my point of view. <br /> <br /> It's a complete warehouse of a car movie and I could not recommend it to anyone. and it hurts me to say it as I look forward to the resurrection of British horror. <br /> <br /> If you do not agree with this review, that's fine, it's just my own opinion, and I'm sure someone will like it (the director's mom by example).
