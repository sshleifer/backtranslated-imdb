I love Brian Yuzna's other works, even more raw stuff like "Necronomicon", but "Progeny" was too much, even for me. My main complaint is that he is unnecessarily exploiting Jillian McWhirter's nudity, I'm not a prude, but these nude scenes strip all the time ... to end up (practically every time) at a dull * wink , a boost *, insinuation of sexual violence. The scene where she tries an abortion after several minutes of screaming is an excellent example. Arnold Vosloo's "performance" is completely overwhelming, but even Jeffrey Coombs could not save that bunch of movies. The extraterrestrials are boring, the uniformly dull lighting disinterested you and the plot is absolutely predictable. The only highlights for me were a too brief glimpse of the true form of the extraterrestrials (very pretty model) and the scene where Vosloo found his wife in the closet was also acceptable. But you have been warned.
