I saw terrible adaptations book to film in my day, but it surpasses them all! The strangely unattractive distribution undermines the story, which is, in itself, false for the book. Mr. Tilney is not handsome; As for Catherine Morland, a rat appearance makes this heroine difficult to sell to a friendly public. Isabella has nothing to do with Aphrodite spoken of in the original text, and James Morland appears in the film far too little to let the viewer understand the important role he has played in the story. In addition, as others have already pointed out, this novel was intended to satirize the Gothic craze prevailing at the time of Austen, but it seems that this film "of sweet horror" was designed and intended to be taken seriously. I'm sure Jane Austen turns in her grave every time one of her fans is disappointed by this horrible interpretation of what was supposed to be a joke.
