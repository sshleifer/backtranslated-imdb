It's hard to believe that a movie can be so bad, but you live and learn. Even more surprising is the fact that the people who put this project together probably had a college education. Meanwhile, the fruit of their work suggests something that a group of five grade eight students could have imagined. On the bright side (if there is one), the soundtrack has some nice moments, which is another reason to wonder about how the rest of the movie can be terribly bad.
