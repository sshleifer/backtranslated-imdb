One of the worst movies I have ever seen! After looking at it, I go out like, what happened? I'm confused so far, can anyone explain this film to me please? the quality of the actor and the quality of the image are so bad that you will see the school project of someone with a camcorder at home. First, I can not believe that some people were able to give 10 stars to this film. Because it's an incredibly bad movie! This movie is not scary at all! There are not even typical horror shots. The plot and the act of This movie was terrible. It's not, fantastic, surreal or horror, it's just a horribly bad Turkish movie. And finally, there were many useless scenes and useless characters. When I look at "Gomeda", I fell into a situation so desperate and so sad for a young Turkish director. Please, do not do "cinema" like that!
