Eaten Alive is a small film that starts in New York and the Arctic, where tribal men snake venom snakes on a few people, then a woman enters the police compound and tries to find her sister disappeared after 6 months. Sheila is from Alabama. but her accent is nil, she teams up with an adventurer who seems to want just his money and seems to say it often throughout the film. They venture into the Amazon to find a community with people and they find the sister, they 'I'm facing a crazy man who has probably already seen too many Jim Jones preachings. He'll bring them to a better place it might be a paradise but no, Mark and Sheila will find out later that it's actually a suicidal cult. Why do I call Eaten Alive a "little movie"? I'll tell you, but when I looked at it, I was overwhelmed by all the clashes with the cannibals. Robert Kerman plays a different role than his teacher in Cannibal Holocaust.It is a little annoying, once we met him during a tussle match like Russian roulette, we know a tough guy.More the strong misogyny makes you just cringe and it looks like I saw it somewhere, oh the animal scenes that kill each other. But the whole movie revolves around these scenes, it's like watching them from nature pictures with movie parts But after watching this movie, I realized that most of the movie scenes are from other cannibalistic movies, and even from the disappearance of 2 characters, and well ... most of the movie is.That's why call it a little movie, when I discovered that scenes had been borrowed, I had the impression to throw the disc across the room, it's not a movie, but a simple montage.
