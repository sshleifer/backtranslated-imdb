I saw this film shortly after watching Moonlight & Valentino with Elizabeth Perkins, Gwyneth Platrow, Whoopi Goldberg and Kathleen Turner. There are many similarities between the two films. They both have excellent actors and a good interpretation. They both have characters from very different sisters, an offensive mother-in-law, a friend / confidante, an emotionally unavailable father, a dead mother, and a surprise lover. The two films bring to life characters that have changed their lives and the two films suffer from a kind of sentimentality "Love triumphs over everything". They both add a little titillation with Cameron Diaz in black underwear and a partial back of Gwyneth Paltrow naked. <br /> <br /> Both films seem artificial, as if the writers of the works on which they are based had made market studies. and says, "Okay, there's a market for stories about women's relationships, so I'm going to write about two sisters with an offensive mother-in-law?" In other words, instead of the drama emerging from the truth of the relationship, the relationship is invented to fit the dramatic situation. It seems forced, the characters do not seem real, relationships are incredible. <br /> <br /> The resolution of the tensions between the characters is simplistic, with simple excuses that completely remove years of acrimony leaving everyone feeling hot and confused. forever. It's just not real. Romantic fantasy. <br /> <br /> The characters in In Her Shoes are a bit more overwhelmed than Moonlight & Valentino, especially her stepmother. Sydelle Feller is so perverse that it's hard to believe that the father would stay with her, or even marry her in the first place. <br /> <br /> If you liked Moonlight & Valentino, you will surely like In Her Shoes as well. Pleasant performances at the same time, in fact, actors bring a depth to their roles that goes far beyond the artificial sentimentality of scripts.
