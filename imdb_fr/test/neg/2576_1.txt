[POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT] <br /> <br /> Seagal is unlikely to reach the heights of urination again with * On Deadly Ground * (mainly because no one will ever let him run to new), but is he sure he tries? <br /> <br /> This is a brainless little fantasy and poorly written about how traditional Indian remedies are much more effective than Western medicine. Seagal seems to really believe this nonsense, though it never explains why life expectancy in the Americas and Europe is so much higher than in 1492. <br /> <br /> A bit like s He never explained how his so-called "powered water" engines "work" on "Deadly Ground". <br /> <br /> Even "the action" in this one is null.
