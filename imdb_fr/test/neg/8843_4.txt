Although it begins in a promising way, a woman in a car winds up in the middle of the night in the middle of the night on dark roads until she almost hits a man holding a lizard! It gave me the impression that we were going to see something special, almost David Lynchian (if there is such a term), but unfortunately, the film begins to be broadcast everywhere, without a central center, but rather as a sinister story. woman trying to solve a mystery of a small town. The study of characters is ubiquitous and I would not really care about any of these characters, especially when part of the story suddenly goes into flashback mode. I had some hopes for this film, but overall, it was a little disappointing.
