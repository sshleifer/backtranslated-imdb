I had read online reviews praising this obscure release as a combination of bloody horror, offbeat black comedy and borderline art house; the film contains elements of the three, certainly, but they are at the service of such a stupid principle (the title immediately gives up the game)? and amateur production to start ?? that its long-term negligence due to lack of proper distribution ?? until Cult Epics retrieved it for the DVD release 30 years after its creation! ?? was not a big loss for the cinema or even the genre (s). The bed was apparently created in order to accommodate the madness of a demon with a woman; Anyway, a dying man who had used the poster and even the paint got stuck in the wall behind the canvas (!) and commented intermittently on the action. Several people (from teenagers on the run to hidden gangsters) provide forage in bed that is always hungry; the last on the menu are a trio of girls ?? One of them, however, reminds his mistress of a long time ago and, as a result, the bed apparently fears her! See various objects ?? cigars with fried chicken pieces ?? and people being swallowed (the belly of the bed is represented as a honey-colored liquid tank) sometimes makes the film slightly amusing (especially when a young man's hands are reduced to their skeletal formation, which he seems to take a not too easy in his stride!), but also terribly repetitive? so that, even after 77 minutes, all this useless exercise feels tense and downright desperate.
