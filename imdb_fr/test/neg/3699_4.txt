It's a fair film, good for a single viewing. The plot itself is pretty well worked for a photo of this kind, which is a pleasant surprise, as the acting, which, although slightly hammered, is better than normal for these types of films. <br /> <br /> The 'special' effects are hilarious - a translucent giant and a flagrant hand made of polystyrene / paper mache waving unconvincingly on a piece of wire. <br /> <br /> Must-see for the value of kitsch entertainment. <br /> 5 / ten.
