I gave it 3 out of 10 stars. <br /> <br /> Unless you did not like to waste your time watching an anorexic actress, in this movie it's Carly Pope, behaving like a saying, do not you do not bother. <Br /> <br /> Carly Pope plays Sara Novak, a young student, intrigued by a puzzle game that takes her into subway tunnels under the city - dangerous even for a well-armed man. only. <br /> <br /> There are various intrigues in the film - a bizarre classmate who is apparently stalking Sara, a cynical trader who runs some sort of offbeat establishment that seems to be located in the wall in the alley of a ghetto, a negro spirit hovering around the cynic store, and a woman named Emily Gray, who is back in jail. <br /> <br /> Sara's father is a lawyer who deals with Emily Gray's case. <br /> <br /> A few years ago, Emily Gray tried to drown a 12-year-old boy. Emily was placed in a psychiatric hospital for 5 years and, for some reason, let her go out again, although it is obvious that she is still dangerously disturbed. <br /> <br /> The only explanation Emily has ever given for her crime is: I have never sinned. <br /> <br /> It's all part of the design. <br /> <br /> Well, my friend, do not expect an explanation better than this one, because you're used to it.
