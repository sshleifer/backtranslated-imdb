"Go Fish" has given Rose Troche, rightly or wrongly, the reputation of a very promising filmmaker. <br /> <br /> It is difficult to understand how she could make a movie composed of stereotypes that are associated with sitcoms of inferior quality. . The whole movie sounds hollow. I went all the way. <br /> <br /> This is supposed to be a glimpse into the human sexuality of the nineties. Well not much more here to learn than "In and Out". Right now, most of us know that there are men sexually attracted to women and men sexually attracted by men and even men sexually attracted by both sexes. <br /> <br /> This revelation has rarely been presented on the screen with so little wit and style. <br /> <br /> Pathetic.
