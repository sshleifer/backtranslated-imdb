Is it really possible that so many people in this film believe that the girl is a witch? Just because she has black hair and dark makeup, she is supposed to be a witch? And I feel like the movie is trying to portray her as a "different" person, someone no one understands ... She's just a teenager and a stupid girl from her high school says she's a witch and that everyone believes it. Moreover, Brandi is very poorly portrayed or the character himself is made to be so ... False. She did not convince me that she is not a witch, not that I would believe her in the first place. Everyone accuses her of being a witch and she acts as if she was not entirely sure whether she was a witch or not. And the way they dressed her for the court - I see old ladies every day who would not wear that, even if it was the last outfit in the world! Brandi's brother was not very convincing either ... But you see, the important thing is that she "put the bad girl on the ground at the end of the film". "She won the battle and proved to everyone that she is different." <br /> <br /> This is probably one of the worst movies I've seen in a life that is far too superficial. I only watched it because there was nothing else on television at the moment, so I was sentenced to this trash. Please, do not waste your time watching this movie. When I saw the rating of 7 stars, I nearly fainted ... That does not deserve it, compared to other movies that are also rated with 7 stars.
