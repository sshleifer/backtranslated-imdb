If you do not like bad actor games, mediocre montages, ridiculous dialogues and incredible characters, you'll hate this movie. If you like all the above, ie if you're a fan of Lynch, then you'll love Mulholland Drive. It may be the worst movie to score above 7.0 on IMDB. <br /> <br /> Outside of Naomi Watts' work, you'll be hard pressed to find a competent actor in Mulholland Dr .. the theater "hide your face with your hands when you do not have chops". Given the scenario with which they had to work, it is surprising that not all actors are holding their heads in their hands. <br /> <br /> Characters come in and out of the movie without advancing the script. You have a policeman, a mysterious cowboy, an adulterous woman and her pool lover, a mafia character sitting in a dark room talking through an external voicemail and a host of others too numerous and tedious to mention. Suffice it to say that they manage to do a little more than fill in the time spent on the screen. <br /> <br /> This is not serious, however, in that it distracts the viewer from the fact that the film has no discernible intrigue. You wait until all the loose threads come together and at the end you will be terribly disappointed. The hardest thing for a writer is to put everything together in a believable way at the end of a movie so everyone can feel fulfilled. The easiest thing to do for a writer is to create a lot of strange characters and place them in scenes that are not related to the film as a whole, then take the few coherent threads that exist and mix in the end for the end. a concern for surprise. Guess which way Lynch is going. SURPRISE !! <br /> <br /> You know that you have a bad scenario when you have to use dream sequences to make sense of them. After all, a sequence of dreams covers all sins. Dreams do not make sense. Everything can happen in a dream. <br /> <br /> The edition is similarly disjointed. Let's just say that a good edition does not call attention to itself. Much of the editing of this film seems to be done for the sole purpose of drawing attention to editing. "Look at me ... You can see my editing ... Is not it a genius?" Uh, well ... NO! This film has all the characteristics of the worst French films most complacent. <br /> <br /> So why is this movie so popular? My theory is that it's just another sign of the degradation of our culture. The melodies are difficult to compose so let's listen to the rap. The plots are hard to follow, so do not worry about it. The images are difficult to paint, so pee in a cup and plant a crucifix. These are the symptoms of our time and Mulholland Drive is just another part of the affliction.
