The famous horror director Emilio Vierya directs a screenplay by Jack Curtis and Antonio Ross. Cheesy and ridicule are in the mix for the madness method. The son of a doctor is about to die prematurely, until his desperate father transplants the heart of a monkey into his chest. As expected, things will get weird; when this young man turns into a mask wearing a monster and walks on the beaches looking for pretty party girls to make his slaves. When the heroine is injected, her beauties become zombies. The monster calls his henchmen dazed with strange organ music. So bad ... well ... it's just bad. In the cast: Jose E. Moreno, Alberto Caneau, Mauricio De Ferraris, Gloria Prat and Gina Moret.
