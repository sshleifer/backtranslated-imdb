Some movies are not for everyone. This accurately describes the film by Igmar Bergaman, Skammen (Shame). At just 18 years old, I still have what I suppose you could call a minor form of ADD and, well, I watch movies for entertainment. Shame was a movie with a very interesting premise, trying to convey the effect of the war on the common people, but it failed to accomplish that for me. I do not know if it was subtitles, black-and-white filming, the length of the film or the fact that it took me two hours to get a huge chemistry test, but I did not appreciate it. I understand it's a great film and it's very important in film history, but as my teacher pointed out, not everybody liked it or liked it. I guess I just wish it was over all its many secondary plots. Maybe the translation lost something, but I felt that there were infinite little endless shoots that never reached a conclusion. You met characters and never saw them again, or you did not really understand why they were included in the movie. My general recommendation for this film is that it is worth seeing, but only to make your own opinion about it. Whether you like it or not, it is necessary to respect the point you are trying to convey.
