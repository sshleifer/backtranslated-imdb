This review contains spoilers. I had no expectations about this movie. I extracted it from the video store with the movie "White Noise". <br /> <br /> First of all, the credits of this stupid movie lasts about 5 minutes. The rhythm from start to finish is slooooow. The main heroines do not like to wear bra and the director seems to like the jiggle effect while Anna Paquin goes down the stairs. If you like crazy movies, this one has a low buzz factor. <br /> <br /> Secondly, it's good that the movie tears off elements of Lovecraft and other horror genre mechanisms, but in the best movies, it's at least a rational or always irrational behavior. This stinker tries to establish a sense of modernity and reality, but there are situations in which no one calls the police when they have discovered a treasure trove of potentially compromising medico-legal evidence, and that rituals of another world are well described in a complete book on the other world. the rituals as on Buffy. I was waiting for Miles to show up and give some advice on how to kill a certain type of this or that demon. <br /> <br /> The basic principle is that it is possible to open an age of darkness where creatures crawling on the ceiling can slit your throat or reverse the effect of the meat grinder. Ho hum. To do this, you must have a sacrificial circle and then seven children who must have their throats cut by people who love them. This opens the world to the age of darkness. At least, this is what is written in detail in the book of ancient occult rituals. Which raises the annoying question of, uh, well, how did those who wrote the book know, and if that happens, would you actually leave that information in a book that you can take out of the library, let alone get it from a library in a world that is not already covered in Darkness, an age brought on by lunatics who could have executed it as much earlier by using "Occult Practices to Bring the World to Life". 'darkness for dummies, 2nd edition'? It turns out that the father of the story is the 7th child, the one who fled the ritual 40 years ago; He was released by his father, the doctor / grandfather of the film, who wanted to try the ritual with possibly other stupid parents, who simply wanted to know if such a stupidity like this was opening the world to darkness actually worked . The grandfather let the father go because he "did not really like him". Aduh. Stupid silly movie written by a moronic director who seems to think he is a kind of Eurofilm Author. There is also a scene in the film where the boy appears with big marks on his face and where the mother catches him and totally misses a reaction. The whole movie is like that. People who really see what's going on weird continue and do not react in a normal way. Must be a bad plot and a bad direction. <br /> <br /> Anna Paquin does her best to portray her character realistically, without a smirk, and she really looks shattering in a halter, but at several critical moments in history she the character does not bother to call for a backup. You know, more or less, "I'm going to enter a demonic situation probably demonic without any knowledge of defense or the help of other people carrying flashlights or firepower, even if I feel a imminent destiny ". And even though it may sound silly, even if you're talking about the dark ages, these bloody creatures can not attack if you have a light source, but they appear as people you know and ask you to turn off the light. Light source. It reminds me of the video game "Alone In The Dark"; maybe this movie is a scam of the concept of this game. <br /> <br /> The best actors in the movie are the boy and Anna. They both die at the end. The whole family dies. Dark creatures lead them to death, but in reality, the stupidity of the characters in the family was the main cause of death. The other adults could be interchangeable with any other actor in the Red Shoes Diaries series of the big cinema. <br /> <br /> To conclude, the worst things about this film are the stupidity of the characters who blindly jostle an obviously abnormal situation, the really crappy plot (there is an old architect in the history who conceives a house with a sacrificial altar hidden in it - the architect has suspected from the beginning that there would be occult sacrifices in the house but does not tell anyone because, well, no real reason they do not have could not find the children, but he has not bothered to talk to the HIDDEN ROOMS authorities he designed for the house, but he likes to stay at home for 40 years because he worries about what happens inside ... derrrrh ... duuuuh), the disconcerted use of scaring mechanisms (more children standing in the dark or only showing themselves on photographs and blood on paper painted), and the egotism of the director who, when seen in the DVD, the functional The ideals describing his shitty work as a new and original interpretation allow you to understand where lies the true horror of this film. <br /> <br /> Is it entertaining? At 2x speed on a DVD player with the subtitles turned on, it can be fun, until you reach the end and realize that the movie is shit, otherwise it would get lost. The cinematic equivalent of a fat shake; the empty calories are horrible. <br /> <br /> The film gives the feeling that the director had to see "The Ring" and wanted to try to create something similar in an atmosphere that, in this respect, the film fails miserably, and also, to In this respect, Jaume Balaguer√≥, I think you are afraid of what you are doing.
