Do writers who evoke this type of "comedy" have such an empty life that they have to embody them in tragic shows like this? <br /> <br /> Why is the talented and beautiful Busy Phillips part of this trash? Me, I can not stand the Hispanic girl whose accent sounds very wrong and who is so funny and annoying as the other African-American girl with strident voice. <br /> <br /> The jokes are often stupid, the Jewish guy screams. a lot and the show never goes anywhere, an episode with the soldier looking for love was just terrible. <br /> <br /> I do not think there would be many who work in a love search office and only one man? Of course, all women are in fitted tops and tons of makeup to make up for their lack of talent. <br /> <br /> In fact, I found Holly funny in his older shows and I always admired Busy, but show is dumb, empty and nothing wins.
