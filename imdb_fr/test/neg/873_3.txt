* Warning: 1 small spoiler without consequences * You are right. It was not bridges in Madison County. As soon as the lonely woman and Richard Gere entered the big empty hotel, it was obvious that something fun was going to happen. The question is: how will this happen? The answer is a stupid story of connect-the-dots that is not worth sitting down. In a supposed bonding experiment, they get drunk and clean the closet of old cans. (It was my spoiler.) And the next day they put them back. LOL It was not convincing at all. I am an old married woman like that of the film and MY friendships are more interesting than her romance with Richard Gere. LOL. . . He had this advantage. You go away and go, oh brother. . . even I could have written something more believable than that. I guess my life is not as flat as I thought if I could make fun of a relationship with Richard Gere. LOL! And this friend inherited from her grandfather who built it after the Civil War ??? Maybe his grandmother is Oprah and it was after the Civil War? And yes, where was the email? In which alternative universe do these people live? I never want to see another movie claiming to have no email, facebook and texting. And OK, maybe these people have a horrible dislike of transmitting news over the phone, but do not ask me to believe in the era of instant communication that someone throws into your life without calling beforehand.
