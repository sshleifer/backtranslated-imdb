All right, we start in the office of a shrink, and apparently not very good. The main hero of the first Jack Frost is in the miniatures office scrambling random nursery rhymes about Jack Frost. Well, my brother yells, "Turn it off! Anyway, let's go back to the shitty movie. <br /> <br /> The therapist has his speaker activated and lets his secretary and his friends listen to this senseless sheriff. I guess he's supposed to be the hero of the first movie, but he looks nothing like it !. Yadda yadda yadda, they make fun of the poor sheriff, yadda yadda. Now, some people are digging up the frozen snowman, yadda yadda, now we're in a lab with some kind of doctor. / Good mutant killer mutant killer with needles, heating it, shocking it, adding strange and weird chemicals to it, the whole nine yards. Nothing. Well, they give up and leave the fish in an aquarium. One of the doctors leaves his coffee at the top of the tank. The janitor comes in, cleans things up, knocks the fish tank and the coffee spills the tank that makes Jack live. <br /> <br /> See the power of mocha! Now he's in .. uh .. I believe in the Bahamas ... but it looked more like Hawaii ... but it could not be Hawaii! Unless they spend their entire budget on Dang airline tickets. Well .. I will not spoil the rest of this rotten movie, so you'll have to rent it and watch it yourself ... Uh ... I would not recommend doing it so ... Sheesh ..
