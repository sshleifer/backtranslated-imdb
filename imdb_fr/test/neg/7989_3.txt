"The Menlo Park magician" was deeply responsible for many things that we took for granted in 2007: even though he did not invent them without rivals or assistants, he gave birth to the electric light, the phonograph, the camera cinematographic, car battery, electrical network (probably the most important invention, but the least recalled), prefabricated house, telephone and telegraph innovations, as well as the teletypewriter and an old voting machine . The total number of patents is over 1,000 - much more than any other US inventor. <br /> <br /> But Edison was a ruthless competitor in the business field. He has often had vast legal conflicts over the primacy of his inventions over his rivals. The best example is the phone, where he was one of seven or eight rivals to have claimed Alexander Graham Bell. In reality, Edison's invention was not the central idea that Bell and Gray had developed independently of each other in 1876, but an improvement in the sound quality of the receiver and the transmitter of the telephone that Bell did not develop. That was part of the huge Supreme Court decision of 1888, which was the longest decision of the US Supreme Court (only one volume of their reports!) Written by Chief Justice Morrison Waite - who passing, killed the poor Chief Justice overwork in a few weeks to complete it. <br /> <br /> In 1886, Edison found an equally ruthless competitor in the field of power grids for big cities. It was George Westinghouse, inventor of the air barrier. Westinghouse was helped by a new inventor and former Edison assistant, Nicola Tesla. Tesla has developed "AC", which is a competing system of Edison's "direct current". The Edison system was essentially a straight circuit electrical system. Tesla's system was able to switch the current from one circuit to another. In reality, it was a better and more efficient system. But Edison was determined to break this rival by an advertising campaign. <br /> <br /> It started with power lines. From the beginning, Edison had put his lines underground so as not to endanger them by the weather conditions. But Westinghouse was forced to have its lines in the open - like phone lines. When there were several accidental deaths by repairmen on the Westinghouse lines (especially an incident where the repairman was burned alive in front of hundreds of horrified spectators in Manhattan's business district), Edison began to insist the fact that AC was far more dangerous than DC <br /> <br /> One of the results of all this was Edison, who helped subsidiary inventors acquire Westinghouse generators and dynamos for a chair electric. Edison himself has always denied inventing the electric chair, but he has helped several less important characters along the way - to read the full story, read Mark Essig's EDISON & THE ELECTRIC CHAIR (New York: WALKER & COMPANY, 2003). <br /> <br /> Edison experiences himself with cats and dogs (experiences that he is pleased to show to the public). In the long run, despite the help given to the invention of a new method of execution, Edison has failed to dislodge public support for AC power. But he never stopped trying. <br /> <br /> In 1903, he had the opportunity to combine his campaign against Westinghouse and A.C. with his invention of the cinematographic camera. He helped "shoot down" a well-known public elephant ("Topsy") who had killed several men. He did it by electrocuting the poor beast with AC but all the murder is filmed - and we can see it to this day. It's a pitiful movie - no matter what poor Topsy did, he was a poor beast - not a Machiavellian murderer. By the time we see the explosions of sparks of electricity that show the death of the elephant, we are aware that it will soon be over, but the sudden collapse of "Topsy" is still an unpleasant sight. The film leaves a bad taste in the mouth of the modern public. Unfortunately, Edison probably made a profit - his description of the film in his film catalog shows a real pride in what he has achieved here. By 1903, this could have been an exciting entertainment for many Americans. We are happy that more and more people are dismayed today - we can sometimes feel that the human race has improved a little.
