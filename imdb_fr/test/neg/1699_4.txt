If you are an anarcho-socialist Catalan nationalist with unfounded respect for the mythologies of the Spanish Republic, this film may be for you. Two brothers, real ones (including Marc Recha himself), reproduce a fictional version of a trip they made through the spectacular Catalan countryside, and the story is evoked (pans of perforated walls, shots of artillery on the soundtrack) but not shown. There are very few dialogues, and most are accidental: the story is told by a voiceover in the third person, the voice being that of an actress imitating the real sister of the brothers. The images have little to do with the plot, which is not big. Many stunning pans bustling across mountains and semi-arid rivers (think Terrence Malick or Gus Van Sant - there's not a bit of "Gerry" and "Last Days" here), interspersed with stunning still images and still frames. These are better appreciated in the beautiful natural sound environment of the film and without the narration eventually tedious or even occasional background music (some very good, others rather strange, but all free). The best of what this film has to say is said in these sequences, with their occasional inclusion, without comment, of power plants and dams. <br /> <br /> The relationship between the brothers is rudimentary and generic; a major character is a biting catfish, never shown. The more the Catalan-nationalist anarchist director's engagements are suggested, whatever the director's words, the more the rich and tacit message of the film is subverted and the more the experience becomes irritating and narcissistic. Although the director stated at NYFF's screening that the film had been designed from the beginning with his third-person story, I would like to see a version without narrative or music, with only the natural soundtrack and the dialogue minimalist - the result could be more moving and, in any case, would not be less confusing. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, this is probably the only movie you will see this year in which a guy is striding in the frame of a cloth object (the swimsuit he wore?) hanged to his penis. This is one of the few moments of the whole film in which your interest is (sorry) stung by something that is actually happening on the screen (what is it? Why is it hung there ?), But, as usual, no answer is provided. Very Warholian, very sixties and a little tiring.
