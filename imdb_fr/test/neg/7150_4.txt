Everything this movie has tried to do is done better - and beautifully in "Run Lola Run". The Cutie Red Haired Hip Cutie, critical deadlines, The Lover in Peril and the message "Crime pays sometimes". BUT, unlike "Lola", it's just not credible or well established. It's a difficult shock that could have worked for me if I had seen it before "Lola" - but that is ridiculous in comparison. Yes! The beetle was beautiful! But that was pretty much the only surprise in the movie. Do yourself a favor and see the Real McCoy - (and the REAL Red Head hip!) - in Run Lola Run!
