It's a film that reminds me of the Rajesh Khanna's avatar of the 80s. The question of the parent-child division is interesting but has been treated in an unoriginal way. The characters have not been fully developed and the children seemed to have become extremely in love (in the first 15 meters of the film) and totally indifferent to the parents, this transformation was not credible at least .. they would have explored a little more. Amitabh and Jaya were disappointed like this old helpless couple. First, amit was not too convincing in his role because he did not seem to be helpless. w / children who did not want them .. hema was not convincing as a 60 years old either ... she did not look at a day out of 50 .. then all the isssue of the baghban pound win the price booker has asked credibility .. all in all, a movie that deals with a big problem but whose things have been improved, I give it 5/10
