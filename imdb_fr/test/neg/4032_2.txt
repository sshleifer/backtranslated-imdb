From other reviews, I can say that NO ONE could ever enjoy this little piece of shit, it's the same thing I felt. <br /> <br /> All the time I was watching this movie, I was horrified that anyone could make a movie That's stupid! Where is the world going? I guess it's my fault that I stayed in the whole movie (yuck!), But it was like a bad car wreck. I could not look away. <br /> <br /> If you are a child under 8, you might like this movie. Otherwise, stay away at all costs. It's the most stupid movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Everything is stupid - the story, the scenario and especially the acting, everything! While watching the movie, you can either turn off the television and think "how can a movie be so stupid" or continue to look out of curiosity to see if things can get stupider than that (they can not) . These movie directors (if you can call them that) have to seriously go back to their jobs, none of them have an ounce of talent, and I doubt that you can make a living brewing garbage. useless horrible that no one in their good sense would ever want to see! <br /> <br /> Just out BS Do not waste your time.
