I'm starting to wonder if all these PG-13 horror movies are just glorified screen tests for young emerging talent. Get a screenwriter for the first time, an inexperienced director, some TV actors looking for their break on the big screen and see what they can do. "When a Stranger Calls" is a little better than most recent offers, but remains completely private; full of holes in the plot and clich√©s of genre. <br /> <br /> The story is incredibly simplistic. The slim 87-minute race time is heavily padded with unimportant friends and a useless misleading boyfriend. The killer is devoid of any motivation, even symbolic, Jason or Michael, or even the killer of the original film, and therefore is never particularly scary. The police are behaving incredibly inefficiently and lazily to the point of complaining of malpractice. Simon West brings to the procedure the same seductive banality that he led with Lara Croft, but his management style is decidedly generic and has no indication of real talent or vision. The performances are routine, the dark corridors replace the real horror and the scarps are of the tired type of cat-in-the-closet. movie. The house is beautifully designed, with dark wood and glassy highlights. Some moments are of visual interest. <br /> <br /> Although it lacks an ounce of dramatic originality, it serves as a reasonably satisfactory dark house. "Thriller, and keeps the interest longer than most of its peers.
