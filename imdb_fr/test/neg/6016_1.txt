I wish all the fake documentaries and horror parodies go away. If you are going to study loch ness ... do it for real. Enough of the bull ****. Same thing with horror and sci-fi ... if you're going to make a movie and it's supposed to be scary ... do it scary ... not funny. I hate watching a horror movie and the character is fighting for his life (or running or whatever ... their life is at stake) and they make jokes. It never happens. Where are all the good directors? I think that horror and science fiction have really exploded since the 70's. I'm looking forward to the days when a horror movie scared ... all this mess of "horror film" is for birds. This film is also for birds. If you really want to see a good survey or talk seriously, do not expect it in this video.
