This film, which I rented under the title "Black Voodoo", should be avoided. I was expecting a movie blaxploitation / horror; but what I got was a dull and classic "dull of excerpts of the vegens". In this case, the ghost was that of a religious leader who had tried to refuse treatment, but whose plea had been ignored and he had died as a result of an operation. The result: her mind possesses Nurse Sherry and forces her to commit murder. The only voodoo connection was with one of the three black characters, in this case a former blind football player, whose mother practiced voodoo. The film is very slow and very dull. There is a standard end that arouses enthusiasm, followed by a terribly stupid ending (warning: SPOILER) <br /> <br /> In which a woman manages to defend herself against murder charges by saying she is possessed. This film is slow, and bad in a non-funny way, just amazing. Avoid it at all costs.
