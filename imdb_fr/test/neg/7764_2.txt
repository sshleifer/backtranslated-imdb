I know this show has liberated many women in the late 90s and early 2000s, but come on! You have a whiner, a kill buzz and an over-analyzer. This show really made women look bad. I can not stand that Carrie analyzes everything that's going on in this series and that's what really killed me. In addition, Charlotte's moaning about her non-existent problems hurt my ears and Miranda's cynicism was a total slaughter. I mean, can not she just be happy? Samantha was the only cool person in the show and the only one watching. There was also a good episode when Nathan Lane was in the series, but it was the only one worth watching - the rest of them were pretty much the same. The humor was drier than a bucket of sand and the plot was not very interesting. Overall, it's not a very good show and I'm glad it's over.
