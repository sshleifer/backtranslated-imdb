I can imagine what happened to the creation of this film: a group of studio guys is sitting, drinking gin-tonic, maybe a joint, and one of them thinks it would be great if they could. Find a film that would bridge the generational gap, which at that time was about as far apart as Archie Bunker and Mick Jagger. Something that university rebels and their parents would find just as interesting - for different reasons, perhaps, but still, a ticket is a ticket. What interests hippies? Asia, philosophy, pacifism, sets and wild costumes. What interested their parents? Musicals, candies for the eyes, scenario well felt and nostalgia. All right, then, "Lost Horizon", the old classic, as a musical, in color. Can not miss, right? It was a bomb. James Hilton's Lost Horizon is perhaps less than a classic, but not a bad novel. In a general way, he sketches a utopian society in Shangri-la, "The valley of the blue moon", located near Tibet, inhabited by villagers satisfied with the calm which serve an abbey of <i> very </ i> very old monks. Intruder in paradise is a crowd of strangers (a World War I veteran, a missionary, etc.) that resembles Gilligan Island, each with its own twist of the situation - the plot concerns the reaction of each of them. between them to be presented with a choice to live in paradise, or to try to return to the tumult of the twentieth century. Taken on his own terms, he is gentle and fluff-pop, presenting Hilton's own conservative British views in an "oriental" dress, as exotic and as familiar as a fortune cookie. As captive guest-guests of the monks, castaways are forbidden to leave the valley, but they are never obliged to work or pray (not that the monks do too much themselves), treated with royalty and receiving simple but luxurious accommodation - would you like to escape? In this paradise on Central American land, the monks are cultivated and wise, the climate is hot, the food is plentiful and tasty, the villagers are picturesque entities and nothing ever changes. The nuns are chaste, but encouraged to be pretty, and even to flirt a little (the reason given is one of the most hilarious and inaccurate explanations of tantric sex I have ever seen). Even their religion is non-threatening: revealed as an ideal mix between Christianity and Buddhism, there is nothing offensive that could offend the most fundamentalist or the wacky who knew anything about Tibet (which in the early years 30 was very small). <br /> <br /> As a Capra film dedicated to the angles of adventure and game characters, it was enchanting; and maybe Steven Spielburg could have made it fly if he had been around. As a Hollywood product of the seventies, the adventure was over too quickly and the updated list of characters too bland to make a great impression. Deprived of the summary and suggestive qualities of the classic B & W, the monastery resembles a luxurious beauty spa in white and pale blue, and while at least some of the monks' robes attempted historical accuracy, most other inmates seemed on the way for a morning massage and a fango bath, with a few holes of golf in the afternoon. Perhaps Stephan Sondheim could have given back a little bit of history, reproducing the real conflict in the reaction of each character; Only five years later, Brian Eno would have captured the tranquil atmosphere until a T; Bert Bacherach and Hal David were given the role of writing the songs, which combine melodies similar to those of Muzak with some of New Agey's most clunky lyrics ever written. Quite naturally, each song calls a dance number, ranging from simple forgettable to completely boring, as well as the script, which does not have a single line that deserves to be quoted. <br /> <br /> Tie-ins with this movie were legion - there was everything from cookbooks to posters planned to promote this movie, and the hype was such that I actually went to buy the sountrack album . The only good thing I can say about this is that it impressed me enough to write this review completely from memory almost thirty years later - the next month I read Aldous Huxley, bought a copy from Bardo Thadol, and thus learned about the true Tibetan culture. Moan. <br /> <br />
