Wretched. Talk about sloppy. BEYOND POSEIDON ADVENTURE is bad in every respect. Lifeguards Michael Caine and Karl Malden decide to tow the wreck of the eponymous ship with a very cute tug. They are challenged by the ruthless Telly Savalas and her menacing machine gun gang. Caine, Malden and another group of Poseidon survivors make an equally dangerous outing from the sinking ship. Shirley Jones, Slim Pickens, Peter Boyle, Shirley Knight and Slim Pickens are part of this group. Jack Warden plays a blind man. You will surely want to be blind after seeing this mess. Sally Field is particularly annoying as a stowaway aboard Caine's tug. <br /> <br /> The disaster master, Irwin Allen, not only produced this one, but he also decided to direct it.
