How do I describe the horrors? !!! First, a few points: First of all, this criticism must be taken with a grain of salt - I saw it more than 20 years ago, at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. <br /> <br /> Second, I give some scenes and plot points. However, he does not have much intrigue. <br /> <br /> Finally, I do not like this type of art film. <br /> <br /> This film was directed by proto-author Luis Bunuel. He was surreal and dadaist. These were popular modernist themes or movements in the 1920s and early 1930s. Surrealism was the school of art that made things hyper-real while often having Freudian symbolism. Dadaism is based on what is supposed to be the first word uttered by an infant - Dada or father. <br /> <br /> Done in black and white, it was also created by a group of communists (or as term, socialists). Bunuel and his group of filmmakers and artists had worked on a number of ideas and symbolic problems in Spain and France between the two world wars. <br /> <br /> Dadaism and Surrealism have influenced many artists - The Police (Doo doo doo da), the poet Arthur Rambaud, Edvard Munch (The Scream), Rene Magritte (floating hats in space) , Salvador Dali (melting clocks) and even Hitchcock (Psycho). No Norman Rockwell. <br /> <br /> Here's what I remember most about this movie: a girl meets a cow; his eye is cut by a razor; clowns go astray in a meadow. As I said, there is not much conspiracy, but again, it must be the goal. <br /> <br /> This was attacked as pornography at the time, and still would be. One of the trademarks of Surrealism is an important anti-feminism.
