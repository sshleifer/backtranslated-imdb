This film is slightly entertaining if one neglects to recognize its many plot incongruities and lack of credibility. Bruce Willis as "The Jackal" never seems to live up to his reputation as the evil brain of hell. Instead, it rolls in broad daylight, parading a hodgepodge of poor quality disguises. Why this man has never been captured before (or even identified) exceeds me. The public has not been impressed once by his intelligence or daring; Given the price he claims for his services ($ 70 million), his methods are decidedly low budget and stupid. <br /> <br /> As for those who seek it, they are at least as ridiculous in their behavior. . They do not show any sense of expertise, but rather rely on a half-cooked conjecture that makes them cross the country as they please. It's amazing, these wacky assumptions (maybe he bought a boat, maybe he's in Chicago, etc.) invariably lead them directly to the Jackal, which escapes them once again. <br /> <br /> Richard Gere, whose Irish accent settles like a distant radio and plays the inexplicable role of a jailed convict who is released from jail to work alongside the FBI. In fact, he makes a compatible partner, if only because his means are as amateurish and incompetent as his professional friends. At one point, he faces the infamous Jackal, but unfortunately, the FBI, although he has enough confidence to leave him out, can not bring him a weapon or any means of communication. What kind of operation are they running here? <br /> <br /> The film also seems too dependent on a macabre violence, totally superfluous and which leaves no suspense. The so-called stealthy Jackal acts more like a mad and insane serial killer, eliminating people for the sport and writing on the cheek of a bloody victim. <br /> <br /> The action scenes of the film are both predictable and unrealistic and many moments are ruined. with melodrama. This film is poorly executed on several levels, the only positive point being Sidney Poitier. Avoid this movie if you are in the mood to think while you watch it. <br /> <br />
