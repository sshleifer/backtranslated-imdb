Dracula 3000 or Van Helsing "Dracula's Revenge" because I saw it as a master class on how not to make a movie. A collection of rag tags from the unsuitable collector embarked on a previously lost cargo ship "The Demeter" in the Carpathian system (cough) (which is later transformed into the Carpathian galaxy) and wakes up a relentless evil (in this case the scenario). The film is a strange bastardization of Event Horizon and whatever the darkest vampire movie of all time. <br /> <br /> **** Spoliers Follow **** After a plethora of production company logos and a sequence of credits that most of the budget had to spend, we start with a speech like Casper's cheesy show (silly name) that interprets Captain Abraham Van Helsing (sillier name) and, instead of developing the current character, continues by describing the twisted, unintelligible quirks that make up his crew. Van Helsing wears a spray on the stubble and wears a bulletproof vest in a sort of retro tribute to Han Solo (I guess) of the 80s. From time to time, the Demeter's captain appears in a kind of crazy video diary to say nothing important in a pronounced German accent (subtitles are unfortunately not included). Crewmember Mina boarded the abandoned ship (only ???) armed only with a rifle-shaped torch and a European-east accent accent, while conversing with Van Helsing on her ships deck (which is basically a single scintillating wall). Mina, wearing a gas mask and rubber tubes glued to the front, meets what can only be described as a skateboarder dressed in a black cape that slides continuously in front of the camera. Why does this happen as long as the vampire is not yet flesh is never explained. This leads to a fragile camera that chases Mina down the halls until she meets Humvee. It is possible that Will Smith could have written the lines of Humvee because most of them are composed of Humvee reminding us that he is black every ten seconds and saying the word "donkey" enough for a Guinness record book all by delivering all this in a "DA Hood" accent (this is the year 3000, "DA Hood" does it exist?) One of the main problems of this film is that it is madly trying to make appearing to play its set in the year 3000. Unfortunately, all those who have healthy eyes have won "Do not buy this, because the Demeter looks strangely like a Soviet-style tanker. -being thought it would be acceptable to leave hammer and sickle symbols everywhere, a sexy poster of Lenin next to a bunch of lockers and explain it as some sort of futuristic communist special return. seem to come from an Oxfam collection box (sealed since 1 993) and they are armed to the weapons with the last automatic weapons of the twentieth century (with an additional year of 3,000 zing at the moment of firing) which, of course, serve absolutely nothing. vampires. Health care is a thing of the past (in the future) because the simpering teacher not only has glasses but is in a wheelchair ??? My God, what happened to all these genetic engineering stuff. <br /> <br /> The professor is an interesting character because he is a direct scam of Alien Resurrection who had his own un-tagged crew with a guy in a wheelchair (which oddly was not killed) . The fans did not get carried away by the teacher, because he appears frightened in many scenes. If I were buried in a Soviet ship without wheelchair access pursued by active vampires, and everyone left me because I was a whiner, I would be scared too. <br /> <br /> During the dramatic scene of the hunt in Mina, the teacher informs us (with emotion) that "it is disconcerting". The rest of his lines is also disconcerting, "and we'll all die" X 100, follows. <br /> <br /> Erika Eleniak appears as vice-captain (what are the 1st officers?) in what I thought was the tired, standard, hard-nosed question, no nonsense, "do not look at me unless I tell you that too, "beats 10 stunt-men at once super-baby, but it's a Z-movie so she's basically wearing a low-rise top and even narrower leather pants. Coolio's performance increases the ham factor by 90% and is more than a tent camper but luckily for us, it dies pretty early. Although he seems to keep his heart on the right side of his body. <br /> <br /> After having run a lot in the same hallway, using clumsy Soviet-style controls and sitting in Soviet-style locker rooms, the crew finds themselves stuck while their own ship sets off in search of the 'a more interesting crew (probably). We do not even know why Dracula is mentioned, because the main villain is called Orlock, who is a transgender for "crimes against fashion". Orlock stops to explain to Erica Eleniak all of her background (off camera), but fails to kill her in a new twisted twist of Alien Resurrection. His story is so busy that it's not worth repeating. As the budget can not afford combat coordinators, special effects, original music, a scenario (not written by a chimpanzee) and even appropriate end titles (the first distribution list I saw was composed from the same characters but from completely different and Italian names), the film begins to destroy what you started with mental health. Fortunately, the crew can defend themselves with the help of an onboard computer containing obscure and millennial references on how to kill fictional creatures and some handy 20th century pool cues they find in the game room (the "holodeck"). The end is terrible and a small suspect, either they ran out of money, or the ex-Soviets demanded the return of their ship. I entered this film knowing that it was bad but I did not know how bad it really was.
