What begins as a passable film degenerates into one of the most incoherent, unreadable, incompetent, and stupid horror movies of recent years. <br /> <br /> Absolutely terrible. It's such a spin-off mess that tears up all the movies for fear you can imagine without producing a single scare. Whether copying the recent trend with terrifying children or ghosts walking past the camera or the horror of the old school of the gates of Hell Fulci. <br /> <br /> The worst thing is that there is not even a cat jumping from a closet to make you jump. To avoid.
