Oddball romantic novel-comedy with a large cast and a script less than stellar. Brenda Blethyn ("Lovely & Amazing") is the main character "Betty", a woman imprisoned in a loveless marriage with a man who obviously has an affair with her beautiful blonde secretary. Guess who plays this minor role, yeah! Naomi Watts ("Mulholland Drive") is due to join this project before her superstar status is secured with the hit thriller "The Ring". <br /> <br /> On the male side of the list of actors, there is Alfred Alfred Molina ("Frida"), a former funeral director who suddenly decides to reveal his desires for 'Betty' who stayed in sleep for decades. Maybe Miramax is hoping that Molina's turn in the upcoming "Spider-Man 2" will spark interest in this little gem on the DVD rental tray. <br /> <br /> But the price of the craziest and most thankless performance goes to Christopher Walken ("Catch me if you can") who goes completely above as a modern funeral director with his funeral at Vegas, in a small provincial town. His character had to be parachuted into the village because there is no reason to let him exist in this scenario. <br /> <br /> That said, if you want to see leading actors indulge in shallow humor. so this one is for you, and if it's not your cup of tea, then try renting "Harold and Maude", the ultimate fun movie and still funny.
