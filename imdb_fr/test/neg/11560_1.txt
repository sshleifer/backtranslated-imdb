Some movies are just stupid, beyond any explanation. This is one of them. Words can not do justice to the wooden game, the stupid plot and the ever predictable result. The only thing that makes this movie worth watching is the lightly dressed women (and the dumb guy for you ladies). The leader of the warriors and Valeria are very attractive to the eye. But that's about all that this movie has to offer. <br /> <br /> A certain foolishness: a scene, when they begin to go into the shadowy hideout, they move away from a country supposedly destroyed. But we can clearly see a 1980s New York behind them. About two-thirds of this film seems to have been shot in a basement of a high school. The deadly sock puppet looks as scary as a street monster with sesame. I totally agree with Latronic that many 1950's trash-like B movies did a better job than this one. About all I can think of is Teenagers from Outer Space.
