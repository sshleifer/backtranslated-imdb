This is by far the worst of the Toxie series. Playing in Tokyo is horrible and you can understand it about half the time. The major problem of this film lies in the sudden changes compared to the original. For example, there is another Toxie's girlfriend in this one or it could be the same character with a different name and played by a different chick. Why is this movie made like a Disney movie? After about fifteen minutes, everything starts to improve. There are two brilliant murders, then the film goes straight to poop. After the movies 20 minutes are up the film is a bearish entertainment. H * LL IT'S BEARLY WATCHABLE. Well, unless you're drunk, do not watch this movie. YOU HAVE BEEN PREVENTED.
