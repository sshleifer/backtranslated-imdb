What we know about Caravaggio suggests a brawler with a sound sense of entitlement who lived among whores, thieves, and prostitutes and put him on a canvas. The themes of his works were sex, death, redemption, above all, finding the sacred in the profane. He lived at a time when homosexuality was punishable by death and political intrigue normally involved deaths in a society defined by the maxim "strangling the boy for the purity of his cry". <br /> <br /> You can not blame Derek Jarman for his cinematography, nor his reproductions of Caravaggio's paintings, and you certainly can not accuse man of escaping homosexuality. But frankly, Jarman never lets himself go beyond the caricature of the 80s. The Italian patronage becomes the London art scene of the 80s with nice servers and calculators. Sean Bean is a bit sexy from the north who lubricates his bike. Tilda Swinton performs a transformation worthy of a Mills and Boons ("Why, Miss Lena, without this gypsy scarf, you're beautiful ..."). Jarman provides Caravaggio with a particularly banal motive for the murder that left him exiled. <br /> <br /> It could have been a surprisingly visual treatment of a man whose life was dangerous, exciting, violent and decadent but who nevertheless raised the lives of ordinary people to the status of masterpieces of the Renaissance, under the empire of emperors and kings. Instead, what you get is Pierre and Gilles make Italy. The beautiful bodies of young boys are shown to perfection, but never the men who inhabit them. Jarman seems to be satirizing the London art scene, showing it superficial and pretentious. Using Caravaggio and Renaissance Italy to illustrate this is to use a silk handbag to make a pig's ear. To be fair, this film remains visually striking, but ultimately as two-dimensional as the paintings it describes.
