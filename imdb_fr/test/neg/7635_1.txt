It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It's a thriller with a rather ridiculous end. I watched this film in the hope of the best and found something really bad. the film features two actors that I really like, Rebecca DeMornay and Antonio Banderas. Of course, they had a decent chemistry together, but for what? The film's debut was bad and the performance made it even worse. <br /> <br /> Miss DeMornay plays the role of Sarah Taylor, a psychologist who tries to analyze a convicted serial killer whose defense is based on several personality disorders. This will give you an idea of ​​the direction of the film and the identity of the killer. At the beginning of the film, she receives an unexpected visit from her father. This was done in the 1990s, when the bad father was in Hollywood, is another clue to the final conclusion. <br /> <br /> Mr. Banderas plays a mysterious man named Tony Ramirez, who enters Sarah's life. The first meeting and the first meeting between Tony and Sarah are so unprepared and unconvincing that you wonder how they were shot. And there is a sequence in which they are supposed to know each other and which are so empty that they do not seem to belong to the current situation. One thing I would admit is that there was a very hot sex scene. Anyway, terrifying things begin to happen after her arrival, strange parcels arrive, items that could kill Sarah, incidents that say things are no longer normal. <br /> <br /> Overall, the film was poorly designed, editing seems sometimes unstable and the conclusion is laughable. Another thing that bothered me about this movie was all the orchestral music played in the background. A more subtle musical score would have been better. I must say this, no matter how bad the end was, Miss DeMornay was very good in this sequence. It's sad that she has never had any material of the highest order in her career. She is this rare combination of talent and beauty.
