Hellraiser: Bloodline is the place where the mediocrity of the Hellraiser series truly lies. Finish the imagination and the invention of the first two films. No more Pinhead's ethos and his henchmen. No more sick desires of humans. In fact, everything that made Hellraiser so original was destroyed by this mess of image. <br /> <br /> There remains only the basic principle of Christian mythology that there is a hell with bad demons. What happened to the evil that men do? This diluted excuse for a Hellraiser film is complemented by innumerable Psycho Babbles, so that Pinhead becomes a feeble philosopher who springs forth, and not the presage of fate as it is supposed to be. <br /> <br /> The film uses the most basic formulas with characters separating and being killed individually. Pinhead is no stranger. The link between the box and the "demons" or "hell" is never established - it just happens to a sacrifice and sits on a buffet. <br /> <br /> The main character is called "Rimmer" and the producers are obviously thinking that it's really funny because everyone keeps saying his name. Really, the film should have been renamed to give it the name of this character. <br /> <br /> Shame on you, Kevin Yagher and Alan Smithee.
