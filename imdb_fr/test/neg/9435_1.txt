At the beginning of this film, it is easy to say exactly what will happen and who will die. It is about 4 women and a man who is on vacation. This was done in the late seventies Nazis, when blond women were supposed to be ultra-American survivors and the brunettes all deserved death. <br /> <br /> This film, like other films from this era, is timely, and the viewer knows that. There is no mystery or suspense. People quarrel, but everything is so predictable for the prejudices of the time, it's laughable. <br /> <br /> The five people meet two young wild characters and go crazy. Everyone is crazy, so that the team of directors-writers can justify his Nazi propaganda. <br /> <br /> For some reason, the guy is attracted to the blonde, who does not have much to look at and ignores a super hot-looking brunette that any heterosexual man would go crazy . We must not forget that in the seventies, movies were designed to please women and not men. <br /> <br /> Totally zero and totally depressing.
