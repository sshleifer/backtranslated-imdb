Great piece of fiction played as if it were factual. Tonight I was watching Alcatraz's Birdman. Robert Stoud was not a moderate model prisoner and he was in prison because he was procuring and a client was not paying. Once in prison, he was so uncontrollable that he spent most of his time in solitary confinement or at the prison hospital. Killed a few people in prison too. This film reminds me of the Birdman of Alcatraz, but even worse. Robert Stroud wrote books and contributed to society in a certain way. And the BOA had allusions to Strouds madness. BUT this guy, Henry Young, who is supposed to be murdered in The First, was a known bank robber who took hostages and beat them in addition to a burglary. It was not a poor guy who stumbled into a grocery store that happened to be a post office and took money. This man was a tough criminal. He also killed a person 3 years before leaving for Alcatraz. He killed another person in prison, not because of the solitary confinement that ended one year before the murder. The real story of his life would have been more interesting. They did not even get the guardian right. You can not be a guardian in 3 different prisons at the same time. And, in all respects, the guardian of the film was a very nice man, instead of the guardians. Moreover, if my calculations are correct, the director played by Karl Malden in the BOA is supposed to be the same guardian in this film. Oh man. In addition, in this film, we must think that poor Henry committed suicide. And he wrote the word victory. Not true..he could be alive right now. He was sent to Springfield, where Robert Stroud was also a medical center prison, and then to Walla Walla for another murder he committed. He was later released and granted parole in 1972, never found. Maybe he spends time with that guy from CB Cooper who jumped on that plane in Washington State after committing a bank robbery lol. Now, the acting game was very good. Kevin Bacon is part of this class of actors including Jeff Bridges and Dennis Quaid, the largely underrated club of actors. Gary oldman and well they might have invented the role of guardian so he could play because he was great. Christian Slater still sounds like Jack Nicholson, I'm not sure it's a good thing or not. Bacons' wife, Kyra Sedgwick, was in the movie, I think, just because she's his wife. I like it but not in this film. For some reason, I thought that this film when it was released was supposed to be a special project for Kevin Bacon. I think he could take a person who is really a victim of the criminal system, there are enough and shed some light on his fate. Others then choose a psychopath to show as a victim.
