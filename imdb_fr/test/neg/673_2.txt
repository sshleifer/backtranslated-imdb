I would like to comment on how girls are chosen. why are they always more white women chosen then their wives are black. each episode is always more feminine than black. as if to say that white women are more beautiful than black women. I would like to see more black women than white women. and it's not just your show, it's like that in a lot of whiter series. but I would have thought that since you were the show's honorary chief, you would see that yourself and have more black women in your show. but you are like the others trying to act as if you were so fair and so kind. you are just a big hypocrite.
