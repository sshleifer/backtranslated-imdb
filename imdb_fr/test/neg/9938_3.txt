Wow! This is the film that should be broadcast on television at two o'clock in the morning on Cinemax for all these insomniacs (the lord knows they would probably faint by watching this movie). Terrible game, the killer is far from scary, I saw carnival clowns that were more scary. In this film, there is a lot of useless 'skin', pseudo-porn scenes that are horrible to over a million dollars, a soap opera-like scenario that really hurts the film and the director really did not have the flair he wanted to create with this movie. I could see a group of teenagers with their parents' camcorders doing a better job than that. I do not think part of me can recommend this film to anyone ...
