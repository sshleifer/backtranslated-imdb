I must confess right away that I have not watched all this movie. I missed the first hour on a Sci Fi Channel show. Or was I spared the first hour? The other commentators summarize this one well. It was badly designed. Wrong scripted. Badly acted. <br /> <br /> But the worst thing for me was ADR. The entire movie, which seemed to have been dubbed, sounded as if it had been shot in someone's garage. There was a voluminous echo in the words, which only blocked the wrong dialogue. And hang. And hang. Even a movie made for television should have recognized it. <br /> <br /> And the idea that the alternative dimensions are differentiated by the saturation of colors appeared in the 80s.
