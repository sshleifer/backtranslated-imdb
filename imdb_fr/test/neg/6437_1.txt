If this is considered the "real life" of London, the producers must be on another planet. <br /> <br /> This is the most depressing, suicidal, gloomy, dark and filthy sadness of television. <br /> <Everyone is fighting, everything is underpinned, nothing is done for real reasons. <br /> <br /> If you want a real picture of the population in London or the UK, then this program is the farthest from reality. <br /> <br /> There is not a single word I can say about this program. The only certainty is that it will be a big fight at Christmas dinner. <br /> <br /> Even the characters are totally incredible!
