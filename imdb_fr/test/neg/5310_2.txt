This film, although slightly defective, was quite amusing. About half an hour after the start of Be Cool, I started having Hollywood Homicide flashbacks. But guess what? It's worse. Even the dance number is bad. I like most of the actors in this movie, so it makes me uncomfortable writing a negative review, but I feel obligated. The Rock, Andre 3000 and Vince Vaughn were in a comedy. No one else seemed to decide what kind of movie he was playing. I feel bad for Travolta because he brought the same Chili Palmer from Get Shorty in this movie. He was totally consistent in the role, but this movie is so different from the original that the character emerges as a sore thumb. I was going to give this film 4/10 because I like actors so much, but there is a conversation in the movie about a certain song that is so stupid that I could not believe that the performers had actually said. If you want to go to the movies this weekend, there should still be some Oscar contenders. It would be a much better way to spend your time.
