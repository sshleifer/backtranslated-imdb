it's by far one of the most pretentious movies I've ever seen. it's a little pat on the faces of some English-speaking Indians who look at each other in the mirror. repugnant. the bubble-gum version of the 1970s policy of the plains of northern India. the message - the educated English-speaking Indian tried to save poor beggars from India with seriousness. he ignores the fact that poor beggars are also able to save themselves. <br /> <br /> like a love story, it's okay. the problem is that the love story and character development are based on a totally fraudulent version of the policy.
