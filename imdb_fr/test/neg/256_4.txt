On his first trip to Hollywood, Humphrey Bogart got his first lead role in this love story of B. The first thing you need to understand is that this movie has absolutely nothing to do with the classic Love Affair of Charles Boyer and Irene Dunne later in the decade, nor with the two remakes that followed. It's not as good as one of these movies. <br /> <br /> In fact, Bogey is presented for the second time to Dorothy Mackaill as a spoiled heiress who discovers that she lived her extravagant lifestyle through the best friend and financial adviser of her father Hale Hamilton. It's a shock for Mackaill. She considers a career in show business as a source of income. <br /> <br /> Bogart is a test pilot who is also an aeronautical engineer. He designs an ultimate aircraft engine and looks for investors. Mackaill is willing to do it. Besides, she likes what she sees in Bogey. <br /> <br /> Given the cynical roles that Bogart has made a specialty, it is a bit disconcerting to see him as a very moral and fair character. in a love story. The party does not wear well on him. <br /> <br /> Love Affair is your second feature film in Program B, nothing very special about it.
