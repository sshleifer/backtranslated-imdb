Proud to be Dutch, I'm really shocked by movies like these. Why? why this cheap actor game? Why this story that just fears? why a dozen suites? why o why they add a lot of hot dutch girls in order to save this movie of redemption, and guess what? all the minor breezergirlies in Holland will see him. I had to watch him at a party. all the girls were going crazy when Daan Schuurmans came on the screen, all the guys took another beer and grumbled ... But what really bothers me is that these kind of movies are the only one kind of films that Dutch filmmakers can produce ... (apart from "Van God Los" and "Lek") This does not prove our superiority over other countries .. It does not add anything to our imagination ... has just awakened the brains of 13-year-old girls ... Johan Nijenhuis, I hope you'll burn forever!
