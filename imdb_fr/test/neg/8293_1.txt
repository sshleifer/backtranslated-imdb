This film spends most of its time preaching that it's the script that makes the film, but apparently there was none when they shot this wasted time! The trailer shows that it's a comedy, but the film can not decide if it wants to be a comedy, a drama, a romance or an action movie. The press releases indicated that Shatner and Hamlin had made this film because they liked the script (what were they thinking?). If you like William Shatner (me too), see "Free Enterprise" instead.
