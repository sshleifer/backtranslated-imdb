Not only the title, but the film itself is long, it seems. It's because of the outdated actor style and the pathetic way his used themes are visualized. Bad marriages of sisters and a homo-brother who does not dare to say the name of his sexual preferences - Italy 2003, you do not believe it (and you do not have to do it).
