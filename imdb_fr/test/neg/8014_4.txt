I saw this Hallmark TV movie when it was originally aired. I lost interest in the story because a character was a witch. I was just not in the right frame of mind to watch this movie. But Hallmark represents the best quality movies. Now, there is a reason to re-read this movie. Clive Owen who plays "Damon Wildeve" may have a chance to be selected as the next James Bond 007 when Pierce Brosnan will pass. Clive Owen may have to wait until 2008. The other reason is that Catherine Zeta-Jones is now a celebrity (she was unknown at the time) and has won an Oscar for best actress in a second role in 2003. Joan Plowright as "Mrs. Yeobright" is also in this film. I like the opening sentence of this movie: "Deliver my heart from this terrible and lonely place, send me a great love from somewhere, otherwise I will die, I will die."
