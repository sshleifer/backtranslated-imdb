Have I seen a worse movie? No, I can not say that I have. It was pathetic. If the director is still alive: 1. He should not be. 2. He should be ashamed. 3. My God, how I would like to take out my 2 hours of lost time on his money. <br /> <br /> To give you some tips on the "movie": <br /> 1. (I am a man) and I would prefer to give myself a papercut on the opening of my front urethra to see him again (seriously). <br /> <br /> 2. It contains some well-known names (Casper Van Dien, Erika Eleniak, Coolio). They do not help and their film career after this "movie" is officially over. <br /> <br /> 3. The dialogue is the worst I have ever heard. "I want to cum on your bozonkas."? What kind of writer did they have on this movie? Was he still using the hooked voice and his letters mixed to make those horrible sentences? Or was he trying to get the director killed by the few who saw him? <br /> <br /> 4. Look at this "film" upside down. Because I promise you that you do not want to look ahead. <br /> <br /> 5. This "film" would force Helen Keller to get up and out of the theater. <br /> <br /> 6. The entire movie looks like a McDonald's adult-sized gaming venue. I was just waiting for what's called "Dracula" to fall in the ball at some point in the movie. <br /> <br /> 7. In addition, I like that in the year 3000, they still have a helmet with threads that go to their mouths. No bluetooth, no wireless headset, no chips in the brain, but they use headphones borrowed from a telemarketing agency that ceased operations in 1983 (director of Nice job set on it.) Real professional. I hope you are currently unemployed and reading this.) <br /> <br /> 8. I do not know who was responsible for the special effects, but I could have done better in my garden with my VHS camcorder without drums. <br /> <br /> 9. I was a fervent Catholic before this "film". But since I saw it, I know there is no God, because if he had one, he would not have let this film be produced. I am now an atheist. <br /> <br /> 10. I will be honest, I can not talk about the end. The last time I tried to explain it, I fell into a coma. <br /> <br /> Whatever your boredom, whether curious (or brave) you are, whatever the level of laughter you thought you were escaping from this movie, please DO NOT WATCH THIS. It literally ruined my life. AVOID AT ALL PRICES! <br /> <br /> Comment to the director: I hate you. You ruined my life. After watching this, I feel empty inside. My wife and children left me and hated me because I could not speak or move almost after seeing this. I lost my job, my dignity and especially my pride. I will never forgive you in this life or in the next (which does not seem to be my new beliefs).
