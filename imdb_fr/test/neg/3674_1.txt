Val Kilmer is almost nowhere in this movie - a chance for him! He plays maybe 30 seconds on the screen and his role is completely irrelevant. After seeing the movie, I could not tell you what "role" he was playing in the movie !! ?? OK ... they suck you the first hour by immersing you in dark underground tunnels. Spooky movies filmed in dark underground tunnels easily drag most people into the first 30 minutes to an hour. Then you will begin to ask yourself, "Why am I looking at this?" I remember thinking how easy it should be for a director / writer to use dark underground labyrinths to make a movie. Just film people wandering in dark tunnels and you get instant "suspense". But this is where this film does not go further! We all wonder what happens in the night, but there is nothing in the dark in this film, but more darkness. The story is even worse. Apparently, there is a story behind the film that I learned "after" watching the movie. But the film uses a dialect so poor that it was never clearly identified during the screening. I still do not understand what the screenwriter / director meant. Children trapped underground by a lost sister in Russia? Why? Are they in our time, at the same time as the characters? Are they ghosts? <br /> <br /> It was an absolutely horrible film that had led me to write my first article on IMDb to warn others to avoid it.
