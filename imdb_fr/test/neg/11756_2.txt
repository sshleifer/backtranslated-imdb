This is an above-average film, but why was Bog shot? It is impossible to treat it as a thing in itself, because it is an almost irreproachable remake of a 1960 Alfred Hitchcock classic. You can not look at it without the 1960 film plunging you into the consciousness. <br /> <br /> What does the word "credit" mean? How can we attribute to Van Sandt and his associates anything other than deciding to use actors, slightly different sets and different colors? <br /> <br /> Anne Heche is attractive but lacks Janet Leigh's firm determination to become a respectable middle class. women. And Heche is younger than Leigh, who tried unsuccessfully to get married and settle down, the desperation of a woman in front of forty. And Heche does not project anxiety in the same way as Leigh. The scene with the CHP officer looking in the window of his car illustrates the weakness of the role. In the original, the agent asks, "Something wrong?" Leigh: "Of course not, do I behave as if something is wrong?" The officer hesitates before answering, "Well, frankly, yes." This exchange is omitted from the remake for the simple reason that Heche is not nervous enough. <br /> <br /> The worst change, without a doubt, is the replacement of Vince Vaughn by Anthony Perkins. It may not be Vaughn's fault. Who could correspond to Perkins in the role? Perkins is tense, bird-like, with a long neck, hidden in a charming exterior that masks the inner void. Each of his gestures (eating sweet corn, with his Adam's apple in motion) and each enunciation, his light laugh, his arid laugh, are waiting for you. It just can not be improved. Vaughn points to the presence of a beefy, short-haired guy recently removed from his position as Lance-Corporal of the US Army. All he can do to suggest his psychosis is superimposing a mad laugh at what he seems to be a normal Norman. (Unlike the original, Vaughn does not even stumble over the word "mistake" because he looks like "phallus".) He may well be hanging out at the motel waiting to hear about his UCLA scholarship application. <Br /> <br /> Management deserves some comment. I do not see what this adds to the story when we see Norman masturbate watching Anne Heche. I do not object to it. I wonder why this is there, just as I wonder why the rest of the movie is there. <br /> <br /> And, I suppose, to impress us with how much color adds to the visual experience, Van Sant seems to have missed a few of Hitchcock's more subtle things. Heche receives underwear of all colors - green, pink, orange and - mango? Is it a color? If so, what color is it? It does not matter. The fact is that in the original, when the traveling camera peeks through the window of the Phoenix Hotel, she captures Janet Leigh in bed, wearing a white half-slip and a bra White. Later, after she steals the money, we see her in underwear again. This time, her panties and bra are black. It's a small thing, but Hitch's is clean. <br /> <br /> At that, the idea of ​​shooting in color may not have been bad, except that the black and white shooting of the original was superb. The bizarre color and lighting effects of this version turn the ordinary, drab and sublimely threatening motel into something resembling what is in the darkest part of Las Vegas. <br /> <br /> The 1960 film was shocking in many ways. I remember seeing him in a drive-in in San Diego and watching with dismay the screen when it became clear that the central character was actually DEAD - halfway through the movie! Nothing comparable to what had been done before. <br /> <br /> The assassination in the shower, in both films, was a big improvement over Robert Bloch's original novel, in which the author wrote something like: "The murderer then went into the bathroom and cut off his head with a knife. "I do not invent that. Well, not quite. Even here, Van Sant's film gives us excesses. There is more blood and more bare flesh. And where Hitchcock first closed on the blood around the bathtub drain and dissolved in Marian's open eye, then slowly pulled the camera back to reveal his face, he swiveled his camera with a slight inclination to the proper vertical, giving the viewer a sense of incredulity to the murder, but incredibly unbelievable. Van Sant does not lean his camera 10 to 20 degrees as Hitchcock did. It is practically spinning on its axis. <br /> <br /> Do not call it a bow for Hitchcock because that's not the case. It is a pecuniary plunder of Hitchcock's material (already torn in "Psycho", II, III, IV and "Psycho: Beginnings" and "Come into my living room: Mrs. Bates' Revenge" and "Hand Me This Knife, Would You Like you ?: The true story of Norman Bates. ") A reworking and destruction of truly original things, a crenial act if not a criminal act. Not to mention the many tributes made in other films, especially French, such as the famous "ocean of boredom" between Marcel Brûlé and Jeanne Gateau in the highly admired "The Mother of the Night". (Perhaps I should add that this last sentence is a terrible attempt for a parody of academic criticism, and when a lean chicken gut is a "cruminal" act, I will not continue to say those lousy gags as they are, are more fun than the movie.) <br /> <br /> So, for whom was it done? I should guess. Children too young to know the original and who do not like black and white movies? Children hoping to see another ordinary movie? Chimpanzees?
