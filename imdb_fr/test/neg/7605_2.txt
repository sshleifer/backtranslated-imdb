This suite is horrible enough to be honest. I'm a fan of kung-fu movies and it's by far the worst I've ever seen. The white-haired bride 1 was actually quite good and it's a huge disappointment. BWWH 1 was awesome in some ways with a nasty and unique villain. <br /> <br /> The couple of the first film played a small role in this film. Instead, the film revolves around a group of uninteresting characters who are trying to take revenge on their fallen clans. But since there is no antagonist in this film, revenge is mute. <br /> <br /> The worst thing about this movie is kung-fu or lack of it. They literally had a street knife fight. The character at the end refused to fight because there was a lack of choreography.
