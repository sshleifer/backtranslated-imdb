I can immediately admit that this is one of the worst movies of my life. And that does not say a bit, because I consider myself a bit of an aficionado when it comes to shit movie. But it's beyond evil. This movie is so horrible that there is no more fun in it, it's just bad. <br /> <br /> Revise this is almost impossible. There are no strengths and nothing positive to say. I'm just going to talk about some of the things that have been pissed off. First of all, the CGI must be one of the worst I've seen. I can not believe this film was shot in 2005, the CGI reminds me of something I may have seen in Babylon 5 a long time ago, when CGI was new and fresh. It's poor beyond belief. Secondly, the actors all seem to belong to the worst kind of daytime soap operas. And looking at their resume, I find that I am correct. Third, being able to raise huge reptiles is not up to the technology they invented in this movie: the recoilless pistol with an infinite amount of ammo! Seriously, Michael Par√© pulls 100 to 200 times without reloading all the other scenes ... As if that were not enough, there are also planes that change shape! At first, they are regular F-16 fighters, in the next scene, they are completely different and in the third scene, they are still F-16! If you buy archive footage, please do not mix it like this! <br /> <br /> Honestly, there is a lot more to say, but I think I'll stop. You all understand what I say. Honestly, I did not think that kind of movie was done. It's like Ed Wood is doing something. Completely ignorant of the quality, not caring about anything looks like ... It's almost unbelievable in everything that's awful. If I could give it 0/10 I would like, but 1/10 is the lowest note. So that's it.
