What a waste of time and money ridiculous !!!! This movie was the biggest loser of the year. All the hype was a warning. I am disappointed for Julia Roberts, she is by far the most talented casting member. I think that his ability to really act has carried the film. The club was a bit too phony, and to add an insult to injury, why bother throwing Catherine Zeta Jones? She only has the ability to ruin a movie. She does not have the ability to make chemistry on the screen with anyone, let alone her ability to act. She lacks chemistry with the other characters: a kind of reminder of "America's Sweetheart's". She manufactured "The Terminal" terminal. This film is directed nowhere, what a shame, please, do not tell me that "13" is on the way!
