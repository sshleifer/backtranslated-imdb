This movie had the potential to be a decent thriller, but it was only hampered by about 20 minutes of quality screenplay, which was used for the most part at first. After that, holes began to appear in the story in which one could drive a truck. The film followed a downward trend from good to ordinary, from bad to ridiculous at the end of the film. It is not recommended.
