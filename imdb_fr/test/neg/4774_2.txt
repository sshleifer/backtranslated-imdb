There was potential ... really. But there are so many things in the movie that were ridiculous and laughable. I'm a horror movie and I thought it was stupid; like my 13 year old son! I was expecting to be at least scared. And, yes, the essential factor of the vine that was squirming in people was there; However, the path to the ruins is simply stupid, silly, silly. <br /> <br /> I really mean who is hiking ... in the jungle ... with a total stranger .. with a little water and some snacks ... FLIP FLOPS, NOT LESS ?! Puh-lease! Better yet: who goes to a foreign country and leaves the tourist area without interpreting or speaking a little language? Are these people fools? <br /> <br /> Do not hear the brother of the German and he does not call for help? Who does not do that? He just finds Greeks and Americans to do a little research and find?
