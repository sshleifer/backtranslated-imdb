Vampires in the skate ?! I'm sorry, but even for the 80's, it's way too old-fashioned to be a little scary ... You can excuse the original kitschy moment as it parodied old movies and TV shows, but that's already been done once, so you had to be a little less camp, not even more far-fetched! In addition, the first film had the presence of Chris Sarandon - a man who could even make the discotheques harassed in casual knit seem attractive! - that it is sorely lacking, so there was no "danger" in everything that was happening, it just seemed silly. <br /> <br /> Of course, I had only seen it once at the age of 7, but I was already a huge fan of the original I remember being disgusted. For me, there is no follow up to Fright Night, but just a senseless parody that does not deserve any evaluation.
