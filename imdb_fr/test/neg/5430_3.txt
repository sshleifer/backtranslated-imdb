I just watched Congo on DVD. In most cases, I like this kind of movies, but this one is different. This made me write my first comment for a movie on IMDb. I was surprised to see how such a team of experienced filmmakers could create this film. You can see that there was a lot of money for this production, but you can not make a good movie if you do not have a good screenplay. And as a producer, Frank Marshall gave us a lot of good movies to watch. he should never have tried to become another Spielberg. This shows how difficult it is to make a good movie. You may have all the ingredients, but if you can not cook, stay out of the kitchen. If you can make a suggestion, do not spend your money on this one. If you want to see it, watch it first on TV and decide for yourself.
