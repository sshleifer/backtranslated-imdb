This is a comic version of "Strangers on a Train". It works pretty well. I am a hard grader, so the grade 3 mainly reflects the characters and the plot. The performances are extremely good, all. Of course, the two stars, DeVito and Crystal, shine the most. Each performer plays well enough to play. The comedy operates at a level close to the slapstick. DeVito characters work best when they are depraved. His character, presented as a writing hack, would probably be more real if it was published and rented as much as most hacks. His character would have, in real life, an excellent agent and many solicitations. The characters are one-dimensional, which suits the comedy. But the character of Crystals is not very well written. His desire to kill the moma suddenly does not make sense. It sounds like a pitiful attempt at humor. The lamentable attempts are not too frequent and the film runs pretty well.
