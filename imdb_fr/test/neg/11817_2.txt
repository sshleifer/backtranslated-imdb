It's a big movie. Like so many "Chained Women" movies, this one is filled with lesbianism. However, unlike most earlier films that strongly implied this, BLACK MAMA, WHITE MAMA shows a lot of skin as an excited jailhouse eyeing women as they shower and have sex with an inmate. For the early 1970s, this is a pornographic film "soft-core" - a bit like GIRLS GONE WILD, GO TO PRISON! It is also a bad scam of THE DEFIANT ONES, although in this case it is two hot women who hate each other and are chained when they escape. While the original film is considered a classic, it can only be considered as a classic example of bad taste. This is because there is no subtlety and the film is just cheap - cheap thrills, cheap writing and very cheap acting. <br /> <br /> Pam Grier is the "black inmate with an attitude" - a lady who was chosen and sent to prison on this infernal island. Margaret Markov is a revolutionary. When they escape, they can not support each other and have opposite goals. However, as it is based on clich√©s, there is really no surprise as to the end of the movie - with their two friends becoming (gag me).
