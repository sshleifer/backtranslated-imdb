Blind Date (Columbia Pictures, 1934) was a decent film, but this film poses some problems. First of all, I have absolutely nothing to reproach the actors of this film, but I have more or less a problem with the scenario. In addition, I understand that this film was shot in the 1930s and that people were trying to escape the reality, but the scenario has made the character of Ann Sothern weak. She kept going back and forth between the contenders and I felt as if she should have stayed with Paul Kelly's character at the end. He really cared about her and his family and would have done everything for her and he did it by leaving him in the end on the fly of Neil Hamilton who, in my opinion, had only gone out to spend a good time. The character of Paul Kelly, even though a workaholic was a man of integrity and really liked Kitty (Ann Sothern) as opposed to Neil Hamilton, while he loved her very much, I did not see the depth of love that he had for his character. The production values ​​were excellent, but the script could have asked for some work.
