I am myself an animator and a passionate of medium. When I saw this film in a $ 5 bin, I thought it was worth adding a shot to my collection. Although I never regret having a new addition to my animation library, this movie was disappointing. <br /> <br /> The place has enough potential. A penguin named Hubie finds the perfect pebble to offer to the girl he loves, the equivalent of an engagement ring, but before being able to give it to him, he is hunted by a diabolical rival and lost. He then befriends another penguin who helps him find his way. This installation is not great, but it's enough to set up an adventure that could be fun. Unfortunately, the exploits of the duo are never really huge and everything becomes quite repetitive. Most of the situations they are in are really uninspired and lacking in creativity ... and the bond between them is ruthless and forced. <br /> <br /> The animation is good, but not up to the usual Don Bluth. standards. This is the guy who gave us The Secret of Nimh, Land Before Time and An American Tale, all of whom were paying attention to detail that often surpassed Disney, the grandfather of feature film animation. This one does not represent much beyond the high-end television fair. <br /> <br /> The music is good but quite forgotten and the doublers are wasted talents ... Martin Short is particularly spoiled here as the main character who despite being considered a bumbler is practically a man right throughout the film. <br /> <br /> In short, the film will probably appeal to very young children, but a good family film should appeal to all ages and unfortunately it does not have what it takes.
