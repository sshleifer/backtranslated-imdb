This film was terrible ... How could one even think that this film was like that of "good old days" when Tim Thomerson was not even there. And to make matters worse, they used excerpts from old transsexual movies. It's just terrible. NO film trancer is complete without Tim Thomerson. I love Fullmoon's movies, and I watch them since I was 4 years old. I went through everything they did and this film almost made me lose it. Now, I have a few lines to fill in for me to continue. Their way of raising new trances is completely stupid, as well as sending Jack back into the past. What happened to the TCL's room? And finally! What happened at the end of Trancers 5 where Lina said and I quote "Jack gave me something special" AND she and some other great looks on her belly. I do not know ... maybe a baby is there. There were so many other places to go, but the full moon goes to bed
