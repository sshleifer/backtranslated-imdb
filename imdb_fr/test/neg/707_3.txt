When the film starts, it is obvious that the boys are old and sick. Even if Oliver Hardy is huge, it's Stanley that looks like warmed up death. Apparently, he was fatally ill during production and had visibly lost a lot of weight. Although he would eventually recover and live another decade and a half, he looks like a dying man. Also, when I watched the movie, I was shocked by the number of shots Stan took - I was almost expecting his own to fall dead from this effort. I really can not understand WHY they came out of retirement considering their health - especially when the story and production values ​​are as bad as with this film. <br /> <br /> Stanley inherits an island and a boat. He and Ollie are ready to leave when Antoine, a stateless person, is literally dumped in their boat and they begin their journey to find the island. On the way, they discover that Giovanni has tidied up, but despite this, the four men become friends and land on another island. It looks like a paradise and they are all very happy. A little later, a pretty young woman joins them and everything looks great. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, uranium is discovered on the island and the place is flooded with riffraff. Finally, the crowd decides to suspend the four men and take over. The island then plunges into the sea and the men are spared. <br /> <br /> to be interesting. However, one thing he's not funny about is FUNNY - and it's unforgivable for a Laurel and Hardy movie. Although it's not a bad movie, it's certainly not a good movie. Sad end of their brilliant career. <br /> <br /> All the actors, with the exception of the duo, are dubbed in English, the film having been shot in France. Although it may not be the worst movie they did (it would be THE GREAT NOISE), it's really close !! Watching this movie is painful and it's like watching people clean up after a serious accident.
