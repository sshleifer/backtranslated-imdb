I was really disappointed after seeing Pinocchio's Revenge the other night. I had a good feeling that it would be a bad move, but I did not think it would be as bad as it was. A wooden puppet depicting a murdered boy falls into the hands of the daughter of an eight-year-old lawyer. From there, the path is deadly for anyone who goes between the puppet and the little girl. We've seen films like this one, the Child's Play series, which is a lot better. However, it was good to see actors like James W. Quinn and Todd Allen. Who have both worked under Kevin Tenney before. Anyway, I encourage viewers to watch "Night Of The Demons" and the original "Witchboard". These are titles that tend to bring out the best of Kevin S. Tenney.
