This movie was really terrible. <br /> <br /> This is worth seeing, however, because it presents the most extensive sex scene of all time. I mean, this thing lasted about 7 to 8 minutes (repeating the same "moves" again and again), almost 10% of the entire movie! It had been a long time since I laughed so much. <br /> <br /> There were seriously weird and useless stories in this movie, but the one I found the funniest was when (for whatever reason) a helicopter lands and 5 or 6 guys in orange suit run towards the complex towards the end. 2 minutes later, they run out again. What was that? In addition, the tiny white forklift that magically turned into a huge yellow shovel was rather classic. I am led to believe that it is because they used images of the "carnosaur" trilogy to rejuvenate this absolute donkey. I'll have to see them now! <br /> <br /> The film is worth watching for a laugh or two, but if you do not find bad movies, stay away!
