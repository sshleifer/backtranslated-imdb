I do not care what anyone says, this movie was shit. The only thing left was a camera job that was very well done. As for the dialogue I've heard so many people talking about it ... that's a fear too. Yes, it was honest and true to life, but then, I hear everyone talking like that on the street or in a fast food restaurant. What has made the dialogue fruitful in films like Pulp Fiction and Gosford Park is that it is the WRITTEN dialogue that takes time to think about. Another thing was that the director should not have put himself on the stage. I think the male character could have been a lot stronger, but he seemed pretty weak. In fact, the film seemed to revolve around the male character, then it disappears completely in the last twenty minutes. The film girl that I found completely repulsive, not in appearance, but in the sense that she was in need. To say that she is in love with a guy and that she is really jealous of him the next day is a pile of shit. Last thing: the sound was terrible and I hope it's only something that has undermined my theater instead of being on the final version of the film. There was a constant humming during several scenes and it really took away the conversation. The only good thing was the work of Blood as PD, but the actress who played the ex-girlfriend of the main character also did a great job. These two things could not save a really awful movie, which I refuse to call a movie. <br /> <br /> 2/10
