What a waste of talent - although, it seems, in real life, Crudup looks much more like the tasteless, absorbed and characterless character he represents in this disappointing movie. <br /> <br /> In art, sometimes empty spaces reveal more than the content painted or created. This film reveals the unconsciousness and the contradictory impulses / consciences / in competition, unsolved of the director / scriptwriter of the film. This unintentionally shows the lack of awareness that a truly evolved and deeply conscious character should have and should be tormented to merit the empathy or sympathy of the audience OR whose lack is used to serve as a public warning tale. But the film fails in this respect at one or the other level. <br /> <br /> The fact that Cal, the main character (essentially an antagonist, not a protagonist in the true sense of the word), has no empathy for anyone. , especially those who deserve it the most (who do not include it) and that he has such exaggerated sympathy, titled, self-apologizing, which is only for himself, combined with the absence characteristic of remorse and no sense of guilt or awareness of its impact on others - all converge in this film to make him the narcissistic sociopath self-involved, arrested for developmental reasons - this is a way or another of the gold standard for men on film and in the world right now. <br /> <br /> One of his counterpoints (James LeGros) says with a laser flash: "I bet you did not do anything good in life - and I bet you will not do it" . It captures the absolute essence of Cal's character. Something other characters he bulldozes in the movie seem to realize quite quickly, even though the director has stacked the game to manipulate sympathy for Cal. This demonstrates the talent and skills of the support cast. <br /> <br /> The eventual "return" of Cal has nothing to do with the development of the character, his transformation or the evolution of consciousness. It's only because of the final capitulation that until something better comes along, it might as well be back in its comfortable and comfortable status quo of empowered activation where it's easy to live and where nobody will require that he grow - which he is voluntarily incapable and indifferent to doing. <br /> <br /> The film could have been pointed and intentional about showing traps and tragedies - the devastating effects of this type of lack of awareness / consciousness, but it excuses and glorifies it instead - in fact, he wallows in self-pity just like the arrogant, selfish and emotionally stunted main character. <br /> <br /> (and it certainly made me cold in the back when I thought about the recent revelations about murder convict Scott Peterson). <br /> <br /> If you want to see Crudup in its most nuanced and exciting aspect of exciting potential that has never really been realized, see the underrated "Invent the Abbotts". ...
