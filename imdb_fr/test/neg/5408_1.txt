Although Casper van Dien and Michael Rooker are generally relegated to the B movie, they are even above this film. It does not convey the slightest sense of excitement, fear, or fear - unless you count the fear of sitting through the rest of that trash. The management is amateurish, with annoying cuts and a jerky movement that hides the fact that the killer is not near the victims when attacking. And what a killer he is: a cheap skull mask and a black hood. I liked him better when he was fighting He-Man. This is one of the most lazy character creation tasks I have ever seen. I mean, it's Skeletor! And he is on horseback! This is supposed to be a scary, supernatural creature? How are we supposed to take this seriously? All we get are scenes of this guy riding in the woods on his horse - on which he can barely stay - interspersed with scenes of soldiers firing randomly into the woods, thinking they could shoot a ghost. From time to time, Skeletor shoots someone with an arrow or walks past him and stabs someone, revealing how vague the effects are. I generally enjoy the Sci Fi channel cheese price, but this movie is too inept for any pleasure. Where is Dolph Lundgren when you need him ???
