It's an incredibly standard Western movie, featuring action-packed actors, a dull scenario and silly action. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the biggest problem is how incredibly formal the film is. It contains all the usual clich√©s, yes, even a fight in a bar and the movie really has no surprises. This makes it a dull and weak western to watch, not at all partly because it's a bad quality movie. <br /> <br /> This is obviously a small production and the film seems to have been shot in 30 days. The staging and editing can be described as bad and all the action sequences presented in the film are incredibly ridiculous. It may be almost a bit funny to watch, for all the wrong reasons. <br /> <br /> His story is not so interesting. It's a pretty nice western (so no blood), in which, for some reason, everyone seems to be against the Younger brothers, who are described in this movie as good, very friendly guys. The story becomes more and more stupid as it ends. The Younger brothers really existed and were part of the James-Younger gang, whose famous brothers Frank and Jesse James were also part of it. Of course, they were not as friendly in real life as what is described in this movie. In the early 1940s, the custom was to have nice characters. It was not until the age of Spagethi-Western that the main characters themselves became rotten criminals. Curiously, this approach has always worked better than the first westerns in which the main character is on the right side of the law. <br /> <br /> What makes this film original is the fact that it was shot Color. It was something quite unique for a 40s western and still gives something to the movie. You may, however, wonder why they photographed this western in color. The film is still made in the style of a western western black and white and I think in fact that this film would have been a little more credible if it had been shot in black and white instead. <br /> <br /> could easily do without this western. <br /> <br /> 4/10
