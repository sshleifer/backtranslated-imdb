Do not see "Mr. Magoo." It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Leslie Nielson was not funny. It has not been funny since the Naked Gun movies. Well, it will not take long to understand that this is not a Naked Gun movie! The plot of the movie is ridiculously stupid. Nothing in the whole movie was funny. The first few minutes of the movie were animated to look like old Magoo cartoons. I wish the film stayed that way.
