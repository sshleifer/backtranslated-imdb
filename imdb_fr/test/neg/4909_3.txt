This film is a third-rate attempt for a captivating and morose thriller and fails miserably on all three points. He almost managed to catch my attention because the protagonist was seen slowly and predictably breaking all the rules of life he had set himself at the beginning of the film. <br /> <br /> But it's in the last 25 minutes or so. that things really start to spiral. A vaguely plausible plot (and it's generous) becomes completely ridiculous when suddenly new characters appear from nowhere and random and fanciful events are never explained. <br /> <br /> It would not be so bad if the script had not been. So cheesy, the wooden game (despite a strong British cast) and the direction so uninspiring. This is not an example of a good British film, nor should it make Tarantino an eyelid, at least not in comparison with his previous work. <br /> <br /> My advice in this case, so hard to get. of, do not waste the effort. If you're a Brit like me and it's in your local video store, do not be fooled. Maybe head for the video called "American Beauty" - this is an example of the great British leadership.
