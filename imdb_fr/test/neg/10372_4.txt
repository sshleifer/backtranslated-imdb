I love the first three movies, they were great! I already caught Part 5 on VHS 10 years ago and was disappointed. But maybe it's because I've never seen the fourth, because they were shot one after the other. but after finally seeing a copy today, I must say that it was by no means better than number 5. My expectations were not high at first, but it is a cheap film in Direct video, not even a horror movie, it's PG -13. The acting was not convincing, the story was rather silly without any excitement and there were not many effects. But the main problem is that there were no killings or coolness (the annoying kid who was killed in his car was supposed to be the highlight, but hey ...) <br /> <br /> > Surprisingly, parts 4 and 5 were made by Jeff Burr, director of Sequel, who introduced us to the excellent Stepfather II and Leatherface: Texas Chainsaw Massacre III. I liked Puppet Master: The Legacy, even if it was only a tribute to the best scenes of all the movies. <br /> <br /> Overall, Puppet Master looks a lot like the Hellraiser series: a great trilogy, but we forget the rest ..
