Okay, do not get me wrong - it's a pretty ugly film, but I actually thought it had some terrifying scenes and went beyond its lousy budget from time to time. At the very least, he is involuntarily funny in places and has a clear air of goose bumps and embarrassment (scene with a burning face, the role of the bride disfigured). <br /> <br /> This baby falls in the category "So bad that it distracts me", and just for that, I would give him a star. The effects are terrible, the acting is catastrophic and it looks like everything was shot in a day. You must love this toy ship early, too! It reminded me of childhood memories of seeing it on TV late at night many years ago. While the Alpha DVD print seems weak and as if it had been recorded directly from an old TV show or something, I liked that in this case!
