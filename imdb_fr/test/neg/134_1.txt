Fran√ßois Traffaut's "Mississippi Siren" had an unconvincing plot. The scenario required too much elasticity in suspension of disbelief. The plot took place at a glacial pace. It started in an interesting setting, but quickly drifted onto melodrama benches devoid of logic or intelligence. What did the critics think? He is overestimated even to be described as a loser. Even Catherine Deneuvue, charming in "The Umbrellas of Cherbourg" and "Belle Doe Jour", managed to be just annoying. <br /> <br /> We rented this film at the same time we rented another movie about Traffaut. We first looked at this one, and we thought it was so bad that we sent the other away at the same time.
