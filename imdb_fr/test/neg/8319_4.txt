The Brave One is about New York radio host Erica Bain (Jodie Foster). Her life is a dream of living in the city where she grew up and loves. She has her big fiancé David (Naveen Andrews), with whom she plans to get married. But one night, while Erica and David are walking their dogs, they are attacked and attacked by a group of degenerates, leaving David dead. Erica recovers but is heartbroken and traumatized afterward, and can barely cope with real life. She buys a gun from a guy on the street to protect himself. But one day, she goes shopping in a shop and a man comes in and kills the clerk. That's when Erica shoots and kills this man, who becomes a vigilante. Kill anyone who tries to threaten or harm them or others. At the same time, Detective Mercer (Terrence Howard) tracks down this unknown and elusive killer and, in doing so, befriends Erica. Erica begins to find reason when she kills these violent people, but does not know if what she does is morally right. And as she and Mercer get closer, he does not even realize that the unknown murderer assailant is right next to him. <br /> <br /> Jodie Foster gives a very good performance in The Brave One. She brilliantly portrays this type of violent, morally corrupt character. Terrence Howard is also great in this movie. Both have excellent chemistry together and reinforce the film to a certain level. The Brave One seems visually pristine and transmits a brilliant camera work, but all that does not work very well. The scenes where Erica is absolutely traumatized and afraid to leave her home to face the world. The camera swayed to the sides almost dreamily and captured the moment with essence. While almost every time Erica killed someone, it was enough to do everything to show his facial expressions in every detail. The slo-mo was used correctly when Erica committed his first murder. But why continue to do this almost every time she commits murder? The work of the camera creates a good mood in most of the film, but there are some scenes here that are simply excessive. <br /> <br /> The Brave One largely describes how these murders emotionally affect Erica. His fiancé is killed by a group of thugs and his love for New York is suddenly upset. She realizes that there is a dark side to the beloved city and she says it in her radio show. I do not quite understand that though. Erica acts as if she has never realized that violence can happen at night in the city, and it's pretty stupid. If she has lived there all her life, she must be blind or very unconscious. Erica also seems to be a glutton for deadly and inhumane people. She does not really need to go get them, they just come to join her, as if they begged to be shot for committing wrongdoing. The Courageist first approaches the morality and the good use of violence, then suddenly, he glorifies it. The end is very negative and completely immoral and inhuman. It also denies the purpose of Terrence Howard's character, that the film spends so much time trying to develop uniformly, and suddenly his morality turns around. The morality in The Brave One becomes very fractured and breaks completely at the end. So, is the violence going well? Is it a good thing to commit murder as long as it's for revenge? I almost refuse to believe that. You know why? Because I have a conscience that this film surely misses. It is not right to take another person's life, no matter how serious or hate it is. Erica Bain decides to put an end to these evil acts, but in the end she is no better than the horrible people she kills. <br /> <br /> Jodie Foster and Terrence Howard give a lot of strength to this movie. The Brave One contains a strong message, but this message is both immoral and false. This film may look pretty, well played and cleverly strong. But it gets pretty rotten in the end. I give The Brave One 1.5 out of 4. The message is very misplaced, morally incorrect and can not really be saved by good acting.
