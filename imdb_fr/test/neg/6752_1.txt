they should encourage terrorists to watch this video as a torture, and not just for the disturbing final scene in which to tie and beat a mentally ill woman is apparently a source of comedy. in about half an hour it would convince even the most fundamental fundamentalists to drop everything, rather than sit still for a minute. <br /> <br /> This film is awful. I rented it because a friend said it was hilarious, only to find out he was talking about the blowhard director who made the comment rather than the movie itself. I guess if you find the unbridled arrogance funny, you'll like that. It is apparently true that he still talks about the girls he has "hit", the most tasteless example being the passage of the leading actress on the screen. <br /> <br /> In fact, CJ Stacy was the only good side of this film - his charisma shines like a diamond in this horrible pile of excrement. According to IMDb, it is apparently the only film she shot. I hope she will be involved in the theater or in independent films, because I think she has the talent and the natural beauty of being really an asset for any production.
