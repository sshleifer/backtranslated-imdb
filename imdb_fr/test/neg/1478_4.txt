Again, it seems like I'm the only person on planet Earth who can criticize Japanese films shot before 1970. "Fires on the Plain" (1959) is another example of the seemingly endless series of "classics" that spark all kinds of praise. without apparently good reason. Although I like to generalize and psychoanalyze all those moviegoers who have such a horrible taste in the film, it's still almost impossible to justify why anyone would ever think that such fluff should be proclaimed as a kind of "masterpiece" ". What I find really ironic is that fans of "classic" derivatives such as "Fires on the Plain" focus so much on making movies "inside the box" (orthodox ranking standards like script writing, role play, camera work, etc.). always seems like the most revered "classics" are the most deficient in these very standards. For example, one of the filmmaker's most lazy buddies involves forced verbal exposure, where the characters explain everything to the viewer, even when the constructed scenario is totally artificial. The most surprising is that the very first scene of "Fires on the Plain" uses this indolent tactic to the extreme. <br /> <br /> After a funny slap, the following useless dialogue attacks the viewer: "Why can not you We landed to the west under heavy fire to reinforce the Tacloban units. two-thirds of our men, our artillery was poured in transit, we tried to go to Burauen Airfield across the central mountains, but without artillery it was impossible. you know it. "So why exactly does one character tell another what he already knows? Oh yes, it's true, the filmmakers are too lazy to think of more natural ways of communicating this information. You see, a quality movie would actually show that these events were happening, or at worst, it would involve a dialogue involving a character who has no knowledge of these events. Heck, even an opening paragraph summary for the viewer would have been better than what happened here. <br /> <br /> Such cases of poor film production are littered throughout "Fires on the Plain" to the point where this film seems to have been written by fools for fools. For example, the main character falls on skeletons wrapped in a Japanese outfit. Instead of doing the natural thing like ?? oh i do not know ?? giving a depressed mannerism, the character throws "Japanese soldiers". Thank you, buddy, but I could have discovered it for myself. <br /> <br /> Worse, this film is saturated with too dramatic stratagems. The most ridiculous scene involves a pair of boots. Imagine this. A soldier walks along and finds a pair of worn out boots. One might think that such a find is totally useless, but it turns out that the soldier's boots are in an even worse condition, so he picks up the worn boots and leaves his worn SUPER boots. Well, I understand the point. The soldiers are in bad shape ?? a fact that is already clearly emphasized with their worn out boots. The scene is ridiculous, but I was ready to give up, until the SECOND Soldier arrived! You see, he finds the SUPER worn boots of the previous soldier and notices ?? get ready, because here it comes? that his boots are worn SUPER DUPER boots! Lucky man, he picks up the super worn boots and leaves his boots SUPER DUPER. But you see, that's not all ?? because the THIRD soldier arrives then! He finds the worn boots of the previous SUPER DUPER soldiers and inspects them, as well as his own SUPER DUPER boots. As the two couples are nil, he throws them aside and smiles while continuing barefoot. At this point, I was ready to launch my television through the window of my living room. The heaviness, the surramatism and the supreme absurdity of this sequence go beyond the bad realization. It's SUPER DUPER a bad achievement. <br /> <br /> There are a number of similar and completely stupid moments to live. As when the main character asks someone, "Hey, are you dead?" As if the guy was going to answer "Yes" if he kicked the bucket. I will also be the first to condemn the mediocre performance of the main actor, the post-child par excellence of the artificial reaction. I laughed hard during that slap opening of the head where his head resurfaced with that stupid and crazy expression on his face. <br /> <br /> The fact that this piece of trivial plush gets an average rating of 8.4 for IMDb while it is certifiable A masterpiece like "A tale of two sisters" (2003) n has a score of 7.5, the height of stupidity mass. And to say that some people are fooling themselves into thinking that "AToTS" does not make sense. Well, not all movies can have extravagantly worn SUPER DUPER boots.
