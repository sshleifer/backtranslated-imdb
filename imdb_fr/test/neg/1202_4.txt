... but it certainly deserves only 4/10 stars and no more. The father of a stupid idiot kid is a fighter pilot who is shot by an Arab country. They never name the country in the film, it's really ridiculous, they vaguely refer to an Arab nation, this movie is really ignorant like that. But Lamar of Revenge of the Nerds is here, he is friend with the main character Doug Masters. Doug Masters, who lives in an Air Force base, his father is a pilot of the Air Force, but he fails to enter the aviation academy. He devises a plot (with the help of his belated friends) to steal two jet planes and leave. save his father. Yes, it's one of the greatest movies ever made !!! Louis Gossett Jr is fantastic in his role. You can tell he basically wanted to fuck up Doug Masters all the movie. Anyway, you can probably guess how the plot ends, I can not believe they made 3 sequels to this movie.
