This Asterix looks a lot like Disney cartoons. Soulless, technically good and the usual jokes for adults. Maybe that's because it's the first cartoon I watched after Laputa: Castle in the Sky, but it was pretty disappointing. <br /> <br /> The plot is artificial and can be forgotten. Save a spoiled teenager who learns humility and finds love. Oh and at first, they do not get along, but after facing adversity, they all share a deep bond of friendship ... yadda yadda. <br /> <br /> It's best to pay attention to small jokes. The Vikings have all the best. Like for example Vikea (the wife of the chief of the Viking) giving a list of furniture and skulls to bring back from the next raid. Or the Vikings do not know the meaning of mercy (literally). Oh, and Olaf, the craziest Viking, is actually hilarious (both for voice and dialogue). <br /> <br /> For example, aboard the ship Viking: (after a speech by Abba, the captain's daughter) Olaf: Who is this new guy? Captain: It's my daughter, cod brain! Olaf: Your ... girl is ... a man?
