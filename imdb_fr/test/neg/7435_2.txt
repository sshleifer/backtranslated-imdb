LTL is the kind of formal and hopeless comedy that must be appreciated by sheep who stop to listen to a group playing in a mall. <br /> <br /> I remember Murray promoting LTL in Larry King's case. CNN broadcast, where he said something like "if this movie does not become a success, I will stop making movies (or comedies)". He was not as jovial as one might think; he must have the feeling that LTL was a hit and that his failure would mean that his star status was in sharp decline - hence a kind of live ultimatum for fans who spend their hard-earned money in mute comedy. 'elephant. (The comedy is dumb, not the elephant ...) Or maybe he simply realized during the shooting (or when he saw the final cup) which turkey it was, so he tried desperately to convince everyone of his optimism with regard to LTL quality. "Go see it, it's really good!" The actors are prostitutes linked to car salesmen. <br /> <br /> LTL is the kind of ugly project from the comedy school "Friends"; Their motto: "If you run out of ideas - or have never had one before - insert an animal into the plot so that there is at least one element of kindness." Kindness = a sad substitute for the lack of fun gags. The other motto "Friends" was: "Always include a useless and uninteresting sentimentality", which this film ends predictably, when Murray rather pathetically says: "What they forgot to tell you, you will never forget an elephant. " Maybe not an elephant, but I certainly managed to easily forget that turkey I saw many years ago. It suddenly reminded me when I saw a scene of it on television today (hence this equally useless criticism). <br /> <br /> Murray wastes his talent on this turkey (disguised as an elephant), but he's not nearly as uninteresting / bad as McConaughey (or yet that man's name is spelled); you would think that MM would have a hard time playing himself, that is to say, an idiot, but it is so painfully ridiculous and unconvincing that I could barely stand to watch him do such an asshole of him -even. It was grumpy. To complete this nonsense, we have Garofalo, the jester of Generation X, in a rather useless role. Again, everything about LTL is useless ... <br /> <br /> After LTL, which bombed to my knowledge, Murray became more of a "serious actor". What about these comedians and their inferiority complex? Is it just about getting rewards, that is, "the recognition of their peers" (read: votes of their weak colleagues)? This piece of shit marked the end of a series of good and big films that Murray made in the early and mid-1990s, such as "Groundhog Day", "Quick Change", "Mad Dog & Glory" , "Kingpin", "And for Bob?" And "Ed Wood". Recently, we had the immeasurable pleasure of seeing him in garbage cans / mediocrities such as "Hamlet", "Lost In Translation" (you simply can not escape these "ultra talented Coppolas") and "Broken Flowers" . Compare these two lots. <br /> <br /> A guy described LTL as "funny as hell". This is now the kind of audience this film was hoping for ... Shopping malls and trailer parks ...
