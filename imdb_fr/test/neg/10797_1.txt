It seems to me that Joe Estevez spends most of his time hidden under the shadow of his rather successful brother and he appears in very bad movies. Joe spends most of his time strolling dressed in black and looks rather moody. He receives orders from a puffy-faced, deadly angel, whom you might recognize as Tango & Cash's puffy-faced villain and Future War's puffy-faced cyborg. Well, Joe and Puffy have a job to do and that involves taking children's souls in a big car driven by a brave unbalance that questions Led Zeppelin. The car breaks down and the pursuit is launched. The lucky kids who have escaped Joe are like Tonya Harding and Rick Springfield. They are pursued in the city, breaking things and Tonya is shot by her mother while she undresses to take a bath. The action ends in a hospital where we learn that the sky is at an elevator. In the end, green lights flash, Joe screams and Puffy disappears without a trace. I wish I could say as much for this film. Look at it from the relative safety of MST.
