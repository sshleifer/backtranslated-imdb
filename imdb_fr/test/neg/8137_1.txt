Barbara Payton is Chickie's hot and sexy young woman, supposed to be sensual, from the owner of the geezer plantation somewhere in a jungley lot located in a cheap Hollywood studio. Raymond Burr is wearing his work shirt with the top button undone as the chunky chunky plantation foreman with whom Mrs. Payton wishes to blow the joint. There is another girl, a kind of peasant slave whom Burr used to frolic, but he gave him the old ho ho, so that the old old heroine voo-doo is a good spell to cast. I looked at it only half way because it's really awful, so I did not even have the opportunity to see the star of the show - which, I guess, is a gorilla that the singer of voiceover turned someone into something ..... who cares? I give this half-star out of ten possible. It's not even campy, just really bad.
