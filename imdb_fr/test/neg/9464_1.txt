I can not believe I even tried to look at this dirt. As a B-Horror film enthusiast, Herschell's budget horror filmmaker Gordon Lewis made me more than happy. Unfortunately, from the beginning of the movie, I could not, for my life, think of a movie worse than this one. Well, maybe Gigli, but I firmly believe that Dr. Gore (The Body Shop) is worse when I think about it. A horrible plot and incredibly slow, the film drags on without real horror. However, I will admit the sheer hilarity of a few scenes when Dr. Gore is cursing his future victims. The camera zooms in on her bulky, bulbous eyes, while this purely putrid soundtrack adds to the entertainment. I laughed for a good part of the 10 minutes. After having erected his "miracle woman", the film loses about 20 minutes to show it, as well as to his "girlfriend" who teaches him to speak, then they talk, frolic among worries, picnics, etc. Unfortunately, there is only music playing during all this fandango without any speech. This part of the movie will leave you wanting to have you cut your wrists with the sharpness of a butter knife. I almost feel like throwing up at the very thought of this movie. If you like bad movies, watch this one.
