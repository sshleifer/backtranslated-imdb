It is indeed one of the weakest films based on the work of Agatha Christie, a lifeless and confused mystery that clearly lacks the grace (and the budget!) Of its predecessors ("Death On The Nile" , "Evil Under The Sun") and Donald Sutherland is a pale shadow of Peter Ustinov as far as the screen detectives disappear (of course, he plays a much less interesting character than Poirot). The film reaches as far as the strength of Christie's plot (all his plots have some inherent interest), but the direction is desperately flat. (* 1/2)
