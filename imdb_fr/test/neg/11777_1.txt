Looked at this piece ONDEMAND because the description was a little weird. This film stinks of cocaine, the opening scene alone must have cost at least five digits in pain to the film. This is a racist and homophobic garbage that works for a good hour and 22 minutes without any direction. I am a little confused about how this has good reviews here. I will not give you the trouble to tell you the plot, because as far as I know, there is no intrigue. I'm pretty sure everyone was on the set every day with gigantic lines, Loretta Switt dressed with plunging necklines to show as many flapjack breasts as possible and screaming for action. let the actors improvise in a cocaine frenzy. A bit like real beer, this film almost caused the failure of my liver midway. Save your money and see "Strange Brew" instead.
