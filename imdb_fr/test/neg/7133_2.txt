People can say that I am hard but I can not help it. The film is so bad that I was completely stunned. The first movie was bad enough if you ask me. It was very exaggerated and silly, but this one, despite the scary scenes, has a really stupid story. They actually explored Kayako's past and discovered that she had a mother (miraculously speaking in English) who was an exorcist and "fed" bad spirits to her daughter. Stupid? Yeap. OK, it all started with Kayako, an ordinary housewife who had an affair with a guy and who killed himself. This part is always OK. Because of this moment of anger, she has become an avenging spirit that kills all who come to her home. Acceotable. Now her murders have begun to expand a bit and she has had the opportunity to travel through Tokyo to finish her victims. (His victims traveled, did not they?) It hit me hard. Now, if a ghost could actually do something like traveling to a country without paying for public transportation, it would not bother me to be. Ask someone to come kill me then * sniffs *. And to top it all off, the ghost who was once portrayed as a very vengeful person (In Ju-on: The Grudge, who was way better than this trash can) is now portrayed as a real-life specter and his mission to finish people. The situation got worse (for me, the viewer) when the ghost appeared in the form of large strands of hair. I want to say, ??? If a ghost had such power, I really would not want to be one. I have never really liked movies depicting ghosts like MONSTERS because they are not. The overall results are simply bad. Like The Grudge 2. With a better screenplay and less exaggeration, this show would have been better
