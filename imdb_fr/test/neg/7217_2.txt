If I had never seen the first Road House, I guess this movie would have one more star, but even then, it's a 3-star movie. By the way, I was really surprised at the relatively high rating he currently has. <br /> <br /> In reality, I could not finish this film because it was painful. Where it went wrong (at least in the most obvious way) is that it fits the original pretty well, even if the original plot is still referenced. It does not really make sense and does not work. In addition, the acting is weak ... I never felt like I was in the movie, but I felt like watching people play. Even good actors like Busey do not work, probably because of the scenario or perhaps clumsy editing. The strangest thing is that the film looks like a B-movie from the mid-90s, but it's made in '06. I'm not sure why, but again, that often seems to happen with suites for some reason. The music, the look and the overall mood remind me of the movies you saw 10 years ago in Cinemax late at night. The strangest thing is that I'm also waiting for Ja Rule to come into play at some point ... it often reminds me of more current movies with rappers as actors. <br /> <br /> The most irritating thing is love The girl whose character looks like a total scam of Lois Lane's character on Smallville is also pretty annoying. And let's not forget the more sophisticated "Southern Accents" I've heard since Walk the Line. I realize that this is common in movies, but no accent would work better than trying to give the impression that you are from this awesome spot on TV, where anyone from any state in the South (or KY and WV) sounds exactly the same way. Of course, the inhabitants of the desert cities in Arizona are like the inhabitants of the Southeast States located more than 2,000 km away. It was thin 10 years ago in the B films where the technique came from. Why do authors / directors make such decisions? <br /> <br /> Conclusion: I would not really recommend it if you are a Road House fan or if you like good movies. Moreover, if you have not seen it yet, do not spoil it by seeing this version first. The original Road House was one of those casual classics that people love and watch over and over again. It was an unexpected success like American Graffiti, Dazed and Confused, and more recently Office Space, Fast and Furious (only the first!) And Napolean Dynamite. Why did they spoil it !!! ??? <br /> <br /> They should never have done a sequel to Road House other than a big budget version with the good actors / directors. Of course, you can never surpass the original (eg Bad News Bears, The Longest Yard, etc.), but at least if you can do it correctly, it will be presentable as is the case with the examples that I I mentioned. But to make a self-production of off-grid Road House is criminal.
