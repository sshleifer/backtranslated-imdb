Found this movie in a DVD delivery medium for $ 10. It was not worth it. Part of the camera work and dialogues resemble those of a film student. Sandra's performance was somewhat credible, but the film was predictable and the action was uneven and dragged. <br /> <br /> One thing I will give them, though. Unlike most action movies, the people in this movie ran out of ammo and recovered corpses to get new weapons and ammunition.
