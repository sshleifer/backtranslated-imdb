When you make a movie with a child-murderer hypothesis, there are two effective ways to approach it. you can make it as realistic as possible by creating believable characters and situations, or make it as fun as possible by playing it for laughter (something the creators of "Silent Night, Deadly Night" have done, for example, to funny way, also controversial subject: a killer Santa). People who have done "Bloody Birthday", however, do not do any of this. they simply rely on the shock value of a child's image with a firearm (or knife, or slipknot, or arrow) by hand. The result is both offensive and stupid. The film as a whole looks like a bad idea that has been rushed into production (and whose release has been banned for several years). It is bought a little by the good performance of children, but it is VERY poorly done. (* 1/2)
