I had high hopes for David Lynch's movie, which I really like, but the very poor role of everyone except Naomi Watts was the first indication that it was a useless effort. Some Twin Peaks characters are recycled in this movie, but it was not strange, it was not interesting (except topless Watts scenes) and the quirks were poorly executed. <br /> <br /> I'm probably going to give Lynch another chance, but the hype around this movie does not make itself felt, especially for those of us who saw Eraserhead on his first outing.
