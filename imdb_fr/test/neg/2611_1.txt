This movie may have been the first puppet master, but it must have bothered me to death when I saw this movie stupid, I wanted a refund. It was a bad series for the puppet master and I'm sure I'm not the only one who thought it was terrible. For some, it was great, but for others it was a ticket to snore city and boy. The puppets did not even kill or kill people. It should not be seen by people, so I warn you not to see it. You will even be disappointed even for fans who like Puppet Master. It was a waste of time and it did not bring in a lot of money. Nobody even killed one or two, without much use. <br /> <br /> 1/10
