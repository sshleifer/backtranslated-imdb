I have been told that Jon has been living for some time with spiritual experiences. I guessed that the movie would be interesting. In fact, it is not at all. Not so deep for such a subject. "eternity" endless life. Experiences after death and "dejavu". The film is not a comedy, but is not funny at all, at least not yet expressive. It's so naive. Charming film but naive film. A must to avoid. The sequences of the Middle Ages seem to come directly from fairy tales and this is not the material at all. Eileen Davidson is so charming and Voight does her best. Normal is a co-producer and screenwriter of this film. The film was launched directly on video, so I discovered it in a video store. It's a shame because I know that Voight was very involved in spirituality and the film does not have so much depth.
