I can not say if "The Cavern" is a scam of "The Cave" because I have not seen it. I saw "The Descent" and it's not that great, but it's very hard to watch and this one is too. Hard to look at, like in, there is very little light and a lot of fast movement, so you have a hard time saying what you look at There are times when I guess you are supposed to be scared, judging by the music, but scared of what? Bad camera work? Low lighting? If so, it should be the scariest movie. The story is that a band of cave explorers goes to a cave in Kazakhstan (Borat homeland) and goes down there, but something is (of course) there. And what is it? A guy says he's a wolf / bear hybrid, just before he's torn, but whatever you do, you can not see him. And just when you think (or hope) that the movie ends, since the screen darkens a little, you see the two remaining cavemen (the two women) waking up somewhere in the outfit of Betty and Wilma and start trying to find their way from wherever they are. They drink water and start eating SOMETHING until they know what it is and start to vomit ... and then the mystery of what's in the cave appears and you'll be stunned. Maybe, maybe not. Dumb Dumb Dumb ... I think I'm pretty well done with cave movies at this point, 2 out of 10.
