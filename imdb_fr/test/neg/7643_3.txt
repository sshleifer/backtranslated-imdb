Sayles had a very interesting film about Silver City, but he became very confused as he progressed. Chris Cooper did an outstanding job in embodying the essence of his character, a kind of Dubya, but he did not quite spend enough time on the screen. Instead, we find ourselves in an outburst with a character who felt less personal, less developed and, overall, too confusing. The path on which this Danny Huston leads us inevitably becomes the fall of the film. Too many characters are presented to us in such a short time. These characters were involved at random in the progression of the plot, which became more complicated every minute that passed. Sayles knew what he was creating. I have the impression that it has not been well translated on the big screen. <br /> <br /> Sayles perfectly masters her job. His films continue to inspire and evoke thoughts even if they are not commercial successes. The problem with Silver City is that I think he found himself plunged too deeply into lack of money or time to explain everything. At the beginning of the film, I had an idea of ​​what was happening, but as more and more characters were introduced, more and more plot twists tried to happen, I lost the sense of movie at the end. While the end was very smart and very dark, I needed more explanation. I think part of the reason I lost my thoughts with this movie was due to the casting of Danny Huston as our guide. He was pathetic. I did not seem very enthusiastic to lead us on this adventure. He seemed to take action, but did not realize much at all. It was the first fall of the important film of Sayles. <br /> <br /> Although I have to admit that the characters played by Richard Dreyfuss, Miguel Ferrer, James Gammon and Daryl Hannah were interesting, I just needed a better guide to help me understand their roles in this political scandal. Danny Huston just did not cut me. Apart from the characters, Sayles needed a stronger script. I sometimes felt that unless I was deeply rooted in the political world, some of these references far exceeded me. All the reasoning for the construction of Silver City and the corruption that was there escaped me. I'm a simple fool who likes advanced movies, but this one does not make much sense to me. I have often wondered why, instead of seeing the whole picture. I felt as if the individual stories were as clear as glass, but the whole thing was both dusty and cloudy. Sayles had to focus more on the bigger picture than on these minor issues, which ultimately fogged the film. <br /> <br /> Maybe I went into this movie with the wrong idea. I was expecting another version of Primary Colors, but I came across something less sincere and more technical. Without giving an end, I thought that the final scene was one of the most beautiful moments in the history of political cinema. The brilliant symbolism has remained in my memory for the past two days after watching this film, while the rest of the film has moved quickly away from my mind. Maybe a second visualization would suit me better, but for some reason, Silver City just did not click on me. There seemed to be too many loopholes that were never explained or explained. A set piece always suits me, but when the characters are introduced without explanation, it loses all its momentum. It was one of those rare occasions. <br /> <br /> Overall, I was very upset with this movie. Being very democratic, I wanted to see one aspect of politics that I did not know and another one that would make you laugh. I wanted to be swallowed up in the world of business and elected dufus money. I wanted a smart humor framed by the words of George W., but all that I found is a very puzzling story that addresses to a certain public and of which I will never be part. Sad, this picture had so many promises spoiled. <br /> <br /> State: ** on *****
