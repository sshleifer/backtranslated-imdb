As I watched this episode, I glanced at the clock while waiting for something to happen. As we approached the hour, I thought they would give us great success in the end, then nothing. The whole family is huddled around the Christmas tree, as if it were coming out of the Hallmark Channel, then dimmed. <br /> <br /> Perhaps one of the worst season finale I have ever seen. Nothing to arouse excitement for next season. The only thing that drove us to look at the next season was the ambiguous nugget offered by Agent Harris while she was making a sub sandwich sandwich that the guys in New York were looking for to get one of those sandwiches. New Jersey. Oh really? I would never expect anything like that from gangsters, I'm at the edge of my seat. <br /> <br /> It almost seems like they are trying to make everybody lose everyone's interest. They start more intrigues that just end up disappearing than any show I've ever seen. They tease and suggest, but rarely deliver more. <br /> <br /> What about Arabs hanging out at Bing? They keep throwing them in front of us and, magically, nothing happens. <br /> <br /> Paulie puts a baby to the knee after Tony has promised his mother that nothing will happen to her son and that he is gone in the wind. <Br/> <br /> And how many medical montages are we still snaking with Christopher? Please ask him to stop, overdose or something interesting. <br /> <br /> It was one of the few shows I used to watch, but now, forget about it.
