The film's production values ​​do not give it Hollywood blockbuster status, and the script gives it cult status. What's left is a tired attempt at the kind of disaster movie that will disappear with the rising tide. <br /> <br /> A decent distribution, either missing or unbearable. The beautiful Joanne Whalley is unable to bring any gravitas to the role of Police Commissioner Nash who wears the most irritating belt over her skirt. <br /> <br /> Jessalyn Gilseg plays the heavyweight role of the director of the Thames barrier with all the conviction of a carnival silk bonanza. His Canadian nationality and accent have probably been introduced to appeal to a transatlantic audience. His initial appearance in a pink jogging suit adjusted to his arrival at work is laughable. <br /> <br /> The role of Siren's "old sorcerer who was right" is played by Tom Courtenay as if he was acting in his sleep, and the various intrigues designed to stimulate his son, portrayed by Robert Carlyle, try to get an answer from him. <br /> <br /> Nigel Planer seems determined to commit a ritual hari kari for his failures as director of the meteorological bureau, or for his acting role, or both at the same time, and only David Suchet emerges with a credit for his role as Deputy Prime Minister. <br /> <br /> The story has enough casting and the effects of having produced a decent effort. Alas it did not happen.
