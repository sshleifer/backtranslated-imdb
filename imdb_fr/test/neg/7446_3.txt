I recently bought the three Robocop films in a single box, at a relatively good price, and the only reason I did it was for the special edition of the first one. I have seen Robocop 2 before, but not for 17 years, the year it was released. I have not looked at it since, because I still remember how disappointed I was when I found out how appalling it was. It's really a complete mess, it has all the signs of a troubled production with so many sub-plots taking place at the same time. It also has a very uneven tone and it's also one of the meanest movies I've ever seen. I do not mind a bit of violence, the first was incredibly violent, but this one is just mean. Also, the SFX is terrible even for 1990, say hello to the bad stop motion. Also, having a drug trade, cursing a kid as a bad guy is a bit much. Peter Weller had at least the good sense not to come back for the next one. The only positive thing I can say for this film is that it has some nice gags, like the thank you for not smoking it and the children's baseball team burglarizing an electrical shop. To quote the kid who plays the villain "it sucks"
