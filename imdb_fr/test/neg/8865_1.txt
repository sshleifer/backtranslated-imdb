Now, let me first say that I like the terrible movies of God. Especially horror movies mainly. I watched hundreds of movies on Mystery Science Theater 3000 without pain. But it's the worst movie on the planet !!! I had to turn it off it was so bad. It was not funny and just unassailable. Give me 3 consecutive visits of Manos The Hands of Fate or Monster A-Go-Go on this day. Avoid this movie as the plauge !! Now, excuse me as I dig my eyes to cleanse them of the dirt that I had to watch to get a proper judgment for this movie. Only one decent gag in the part I looked at was that the killers are now a pair of extermination for the Hitmen exterminators. Even that was not really a gag.
