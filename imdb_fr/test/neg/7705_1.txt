This fake documentary is defective on many points, it is poorly done, its characters are irrelevant, but the most important problem I encounter is the basic premise. <br /> <br /> This film uses the idea that H.P. Lovecraft traveled to Italy and some of his work is based on real supernatural events he witnessed. I am willing to accept the idea that he went to Italy (only to put an end to disbelief), but that some of his work is based on reality and that Insmouth exists is total nonsense . <br /> <br /> Lovecraft's premiere did not believe in the supernatural at all. In his letters, he clearly stated that he considered himself a mechanical materialist, his monsters being there to show that humans were not so special after all. Another myth used in this film is that Lovecraft was an expert in occultism, but all his knowledge on the subject came from the most basic sources. <br /> <br /> So we end up with a movie about people jostling a lot and when we finally see the monster, it's so terrible that you can not even laugh at it, you just feel a pain in your love for horror. <br /> <br /> After seeing the monster The movie Frankenstein Lovecraft said he felt sorry for Mary Shelley because he felt like his job had been slaughtered. I'm sorry for Lovecraft.
