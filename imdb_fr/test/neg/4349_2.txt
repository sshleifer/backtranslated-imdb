My brother and I are big fans of Asian cinema. So, when I found this movie hidden in a store, I bought it on DVD, because it looked very promising and I could not wait to watch it. So I watched this movie with my brother and I must say that at first it was very promising. We both liked this brutal ball scene in the first scene. But I guess that was all. There are interesting fights, but it's not an action movie, as he claims. Instead, it's a love movie ... with the clich√© of love so played, even Shakespeare would throw up on that title. Sorry for my language. By the way: the characters act as if they were stuck in the street and given 100 ?? to play in this movie. <br /> <br /> Well, my brother and I watched it all the way because we thought it could only get better. But hey, that was never the case. This film challenges the first place on the list of "worst films ever seen" of my brother and my brother, followed by "Fantasy Mission Force" - do not look at that either.
