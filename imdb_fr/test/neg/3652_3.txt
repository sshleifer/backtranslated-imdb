MGM has tried to pair and bring young men together with the Divine One to expose and test them as leaders. Gable and Garbo had chemistry in SUSAN LENOX but it was an ugly film. Here, in INSPIRATION, there is no chemistry between Garbo and Robert Montgomery and the scenario is also mediocre. What were they thinking? Montgomery, a modern, fast-talking, loud-talking man, and the Garbo who has suffered so much? It's a tale like CAMILLE. A young student falls in love with the woman of the world and is rejected by learning her past, rejects it, takes it back, rejects it ... you get the picture. Garbo is quite credible as a top model of Parisian artist and completely at home, even if she is bored, with her life at the top of society amidst her artist friends and their unbridled morality. Suddenly, she is fascinated by this innocent. She ends up giving her life for him and sinks into poverty, to be saved by him and settled in a house of hers. Ironically, he intends to get married and keep him on the side - both for his pure moral ethics. <br /> <br /> The scenes are incredibly boring and boring and nothing happens. Only Marjorie Rambeau, as Lulu, can breathe life into the debate with phrases such as "Unfortunately, weak women have a keen appetite" and "Odette, where is your sting?"
