This is one of the few films I did not immediately discuss with my friends after watching it. This is not because it particularly appealed to me or impressed me. On the contrary, it did not give me anything at all. <br /> <br /> Why? Because one way or another, everything was so exaggerated that I could not take this film seriously. There was so much sex and violence that I had the strong impression that the film was trying very hard to be offensive, as if it were aimed at superlatives in ugliness, rather than telling a compelling story about two women caught in a spiral. of crime. <br /> <br /> For me, Fuck me had been described as "Thelma & Louise with real sex". Well, it's true that the main idea is similar. Two women are traveling in the country because they have committed crimes and know that their life is over now, that the police will stop them, and they decide that now that everything is over, it is impossible to hold back. <br /> <br /> Fuck Me has been described as a feminist film in which women, who had suffered from male domination in the past, take their revenge on the men they meet. <br /> <br /> something that I had never interpreted in this film, simply because none of these women had been innocent and because they did not only kill men who were violent and irresponsible, but also men whom they seduce themselves, men who show the feeling of wanting to do it protected sex. And they kill women. No, they are in no way better than the characters they meet and murder hideously and brutally. <br /> <br /> How easily the "heroines" decide to kill him and what a pleasure they take, it is absolutely impossible for me to understand or even take them seriously. It was too much. Too much sex, too much violence. I had the feeling that sex and violence were only there to create a superlative in ugliness, rather than convey a story or make a point. <br /> <br /> Fuck me, leave me no impression. do not make me think because it was so far away from any real world. So constructed, unrealistic and excessive. <br /> <br /> There was nothing I could do with this movie, there was just nothing to think about it except "Why did they make this awful movie?" If the intense discomfort that occurred in this film had been used for something, I would have easily accepted it. But since I did not find anything, since the story of the film seemed to be no more than an excuse to make a sex as ugly and as ugly as possible, I classified it under "unnecessary torture", I decided never, NEVER, review this film and I now consider it the worst movie I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> Worse, not only because it's not really my cup of tea to watch people being raped, raped, having sex in another form and killing each other. but because whatever the makers wanted to tell the world with their movie ... if they meant anything ... it did not work. And nothing else could save this film because it is also shot in such an ugly style.
