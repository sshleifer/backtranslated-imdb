There is a famous news about a man who falls prey to a safari hunter who has lost interest in hunting, except the man. It's pretty good, and it's been done and done many times in movies and on TV. Some are remarkable, but this urbanized version, which injects the old themes of tired racism, simply stinks. Leguizamo's slapstick is almost as weak as the non-funny script. Chaplin, this guy is not. There must be people who find a dwarf who can not stop dancing in a fun way, I mean, I guess it's pathetically funny, but it's just not enough to make a movie. You have the usual Nazi or neo-Nazi heist, no matter what we are supposed to think, type a villain, whose son is naturally gay, with German accents ... you see the picture?
