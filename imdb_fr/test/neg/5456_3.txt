The use of "astral projection" (wandering soul), to exist outside the body, with the result of inflicting an atrocious death (crushing the inside of the victims leading to a fracture of the spine and organs broken) to those who have the ability, is the threat of ETERNAL EVIL, offering Karen Black (.. as Janus) another "unique" character to play with an influential woman on a commercial director, Paul Sharpe (Winston Rekert), tired of his declining marriage and his mate career. In fact, she is dying and needs her body, her mind potentially damaging her wife and son (her son has a "special friend" who talks to him, even poisoning himself at one point given). An inspector, Kauffman (John Novak) investigating the unusual killings of those killed by the benevolent spirit, links Paul to the dead and discovers Janus through him. Soon, both realize that Janus must be arrested or she will simply switch to another human host. What Paul does not know is that his new secretary is Janus's lover. Both were older intellectuals featured in his documentary on the astral projection entitled WANDERING SOUL. <br /> <br /> Director George Mihalka (My Bloody Valentine) certainly creates a strange atmosphere with this film that contains a rather bizarre premise. It seems that Paul's boy can see the spirit moving in the form of a "blue man", manipulating him in a disorderly manner. Despite the treatment of the star, Black is rarely photographed closely, taking advantage of his face, which can produce the type of evil that his character deserves. Instead, she is shot from a distance, her voice doubled, and she never settles herself completely with the proper threat, which is a lost opportunity, in my opinion. For some reason, despite the intriguing idea (so strange) of astral projection causing the spirit's death by the mind, the film simply does not take off. The soundtrack is very "Yanni-ish" and the lighting (.. and sound), although sometimes dark and effective, is often quite murky. Rhythm is a problem, too, as the story mules along. The distribution is rather soft, especially Rekert in the lead, its erratic performance, at best. It does not help that there are not a lot of characters (except Paul's wife) that we totally do not care about, and what really hurts is that Paul is not really the kindest person in the world..it can be quite difficult and bad mood, his unfulfilled career is a reason for this behavior. Black should have been more prominent in the film, while remaining in the background, as the dialogue between Paul and Kauffman shows, but she rarely has the opportunity to have fun with his fiction films, which is a shame .
