This spaghetti western uses three American actors, which removes a little of the typical aura of spaghetti. The plot is about an amnesty the New Mexico governor gives to all criminals wanting to give them a chance to start a new life. Usually, this kind of opportunity is limited to past events, but in this movie, it sounds more like an authorization to kill, even new crimes (such as threatening the governor) are forgiven. The story is a chain of endless murders where almost all the characters have the sole purpose of delivering more carcasses. Only the few tracks have endurance. Clay McCord is haunted by nightmares related to an event from his childhood where, unsurprisingly, he killed many people. In the midst of eternal chaos, this kind of thinking lacks credibility. Compared to similar films like for example BANDIDOS none of the characters of this film did not like me. <br /> <br /> Apart from the weak content that targets certain customers, this film is well shot, the sets are somewhat detailed and the acting is average. <br /> <br /> 4/10.
