A special unit of four police detectives do justice in a unique way in the 1950s in Los Angeles. Nick Nolte plays Max Hoover, the unit's chief officer, and his partners are Michael Madsen, Chazz Palminteri and Chris Penn. Melanie Griffith, Jennifer Connelly and John Malkovich are also playing. A list of names quite impressive. Unfortunately, this is the only thing that is really impressive about this movie. <br /> <br /> Our story begins when the young Allison Pond, played by Connelly, is found dead in a remote area of ​​the city under development. Our group of four detectives is called and it is immediately obvious that Max Hoover de Nolte will take a very personal interest in this case. We will soon discover that Allison, besides getting to know Hoover, has also been involved in some fairly important types of military and government that might have reasons to want him dead. But who exactly was involved and why would they exactly want this seemingly innocuous dead woman? Hoover and his team got down to work. It sounds interesting, but unfortunately it is not going anywhere. <br /> <br /> Despite the impressive number of names, the actors' game leaves something to be desired. Nolte is too active, Madsen seems incredibly bored, Palminteri and Malkovich are caricatures, Penn has almost nothing to do and Griffith is as dull as possible. By far the best performance is that of Connelly in all flashback sequences too ephemeral. The dialogue throughout the film is forced and wooden. The meaning of the drama you expect from a mystery of this type is totally absent. Nothing dramatic is really happening. In fact, nothing seems to happen for most of the chart. Instead, we are content to reach a rather ridiculous and incredibly disappointing climax. When the "mystery" is resolved, you may find yourself saying, "Come on, that's all there is?" But that only gets worse, because once the mystery is solved, we get a completely ridiculous and absolutely incredible action sequence. And even then, we are forced to suffer more as another dreadful, misinterpreted and useless scene is added at the end. And then luckily it's over. And not a moment too soon.
