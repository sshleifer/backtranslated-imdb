I really like Full Moon Pictures, so I ordered this movie in the US, because in Germany it's impossible to get it anywhere. I thought it would be as nice and fun as the Subspecies or Puppetmaster series, because they were full of atmosphere. <br /> <br /> I was happy that the film finally arrived. <br /> <br /> But after watching this cheesy movie, I was very disappointed. The actors (I think you can not even say actors) are boring and talentless. The story was a poor performance and even the decor and the monster were very cheap and ugly. <br /> <br /> I hope nobody will ever make a sequel or a remake of this awful movie. :-)
