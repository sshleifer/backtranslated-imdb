Oh, my dear, that's what we need from another Essex-Cockney waste effort on the rise of the British footy hooligan / rave gangster who of course followed West 'am (East Londan / Essex style) . Did not someone tell you he won the world title ?! And then, of course, the inevitable disintegration in the British underworld of rave culture. Blah blah blah Why and how would you like to finance a movie like this? I do not know, but pray for it to be a private financier (see former drug dealers, merchant bankers, we all know how to call them and the rest of the mockneys). rather than means financed by public funds. Let's hope that with the recession, we will not see anything like it again. If we do, we will be the death knell for British films and, of course, we can all blame gangster Guy Ritchie, the number one Briton at Mockney Country.
