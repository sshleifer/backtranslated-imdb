This story had a good plot about four elderly men sharing a deadly secret about a young woman they met 50 years ago. After all this time, the young woman returns to take revenge on the men. This story sometimes made me fall into the film in the middle of the tiring music of lifts and storms always constant. But it's worth waiting in the end when we find out who this mysterious woman is who continues to torment the old men in their dreams and who interferes in the life of a young man. What I liked in this film was especially the suspense in which the young woman appears to men just before their death. Special effects were something. Whenever I heard them calling, I would say, "Not that face yet." But it was a good movie, I just wish the pace was not so slow or the acting less tiring. And what I also liked in the film is the return of the 1920s, very authentic, as well as the original costumes.
