Dear reader, attention! This film is not really a film, although its creators have the impertinence to call it so. If you have not been warned of its content, the film is a series of images that flow continuously and try to convey a certain feeling, a concept. They could therefore be called symbols. The images are accompanied by a soundtrack, the goal being to create an atmosphere as well. However, the images chosen by the director can only transmit emotions to an American public, because they are overwhelmingly American icons. Although the film aims to express the idea of ​​"civilized war", it does not do so either because of the general chaos, but also because it is much too long and tedious, and I strongly felt that a lot of scenes do not have to do with "war", whatever the design. To conclude, I was very disappointed by a documentary that is not a documentary, a film that is not a film, a "something" whose only strength is the extraordinary use of technology in image processing.
