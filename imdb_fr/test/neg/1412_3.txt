I went to see this film mainly because it looked so good in the caravans. Robin Williams and Barry Levinson should equal greatness. Instead, he's just chasing the bad Williams movie series lately. What is the problem with the movie? It's more like what's right: the team is doing a great job with Robin and, as usual, Christopher Walken is fantastic. That being said, this movie was just not good. I really recommend seeing him only if you want to know what it would be like if Jon Stewart ran for president and won. To say that he won is not a spoiler since he was in the caravan. The concept and idea are really fun, but that's it. Most of Robin's jokes are simply recycled from his old comedy pieces, and there are very few moments of laughter, and most are just stupid. Like most comedies that turn out to be nil, all the fun elements are placed in the trailer. Really no surprises there, but come on! Some movies read like a novel by Tom Clancy or Vince Flynn! People expected it to be Robin's return to greatness. Instead, it's more of a Flubber.
