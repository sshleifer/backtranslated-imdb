I watched this film with a kind of dangerous fascination, like a hedgehog trapped in the headlights. There is no doubt that (even if you liked it), it's a bad movie, but the important question is why? He has a good casting; it is animated it is ready to face the sex of front, some characters sometimes receiving here and there, which is unusual for a British comedy. Johnny Vegas and Mackenzie Crook also agreed, but the marmite performers agree, but they had their moments in the past. <br /> <br /> What is mainly missing is the charm. The characters are incredibly stupid, unbelievable and alienating, whereas instead of a Men Behaving Badly movie, the producers made Game On. Any mediocre writer wanting to make a film about the sexual attitudes of sleepy, sexist Britons could have bought some copies of Loaded, Zoo or even Viz to read Sid the Sexist and it would have been written. Instead, the producers clearly tried to create stupid characters, difficult to manage. Character comedy - as opposed to slapstick, etc. - only works if the public can recognize a human truth to the situation. But watching this film is like being told an annoying joke that we know will not end up funny, but that we can not stop. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the film is also poorly realized. The structure of the plot is weak, there is little delineation or development of characters, and many scenes are not funny. Time and time again, the same lame reggae tears to divide the scenes, in a useless and squeaky way. There are a lot of useless rehearsals - when you make a joke about parking outside of a sex party, you do not need to do it again. One wonders what the UK Film Council saw in the scenario. <br /> <br /> This is a world where most men are rakes and where most women are still going. The Apartment and Alfie satirized the same vision of the world, but the film's producers accept it without criticism. So, they ended up with some sort of inferior update of Confessions from a window cleaner. Someone from Britain needs to get into this stuff and do it right ?? a good project for Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright, I think ...
