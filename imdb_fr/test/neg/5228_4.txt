Based on a Stephen King novel, NEEDFUL THINGS provides the intrigue and mystery to keep you in your shoes. A mysterious man (Max von Sydow) arrives in town and soon becomes the most talked about citizen. Could it be that the devil himself has established himself as an antiquarian in a small town in Maine? von Sydow is masterful and dynamic in this role that dominates the screen. Ed Harris and Bonnie Bedelia are also playing. Harris is stable and Bedelia deserves your attention. J.T. Walsh and Amanda Plummer. Not the best, or the worst adaptation of the horror of King on the screen.
