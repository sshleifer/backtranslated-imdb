First, they ruin it with the unique quality of animation, then they get voices that look nothing like the original. They make so many movie mistakes. When Sasha sings in Count Me Out, the drummer disappears and reappears, Itchy's shirt changes color, his hat keeps changing position, one of the decks is white, everyone in the background appears in bold, the halos change color, appear and disappear. Even the sky looks different. I do not care if this is a low-budget movie, they should not cut the thread of the animation. They completely ruined the first ADGTH. The only good thing about this movie was the soundtrack.
