A 10-year-old who is fed up with his parents arguing decides to hook up a car and make a surreal trip across America to find the Motorama cards, which is a game of gas station cards. has a chance to win $ 500 million. He meets many weird characters along the way. Nobody can do a "instant cult classic", Joe Minion's previous "After Hours" did it by his merit and by an extraordinary director, but it was not instantaneous. This movie, on the other hand, is just weird to be weird. No rhyme or reason for anything of it. The plot is at best incidental and seems to exist just to present various cameos. It's just not a fun or thought-provoking movie. It's too much slapped together. I've heard a lot of comparisons between this film and David Lynch. It's almost a heresy, because even Lynch's "worst" movie (the worst in quotation marks, because he does not really have bad movies) is still miles away from this mess. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Cynthia King is topless very briefly <br /> <br /> DVD Extras: Trailer of "Joe Dirt"
