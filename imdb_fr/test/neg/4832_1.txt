It's a cellular scam. <br /> <br /> Bad casting ... <br /> <br /> Bad direction ... <br /> <br /> Bad music ... <br /> <br /> And the list continues ... <br /> <br /> Well, there was no direction since the story, scenes and sets were raised directly from another movie. <br /> <br /> Even the fight sequence is copied. One with the mass came from Kill Bill and another with garden hose came from a movie of Jet Li or Jackie Chan (I can not remember the name of this movie) ... <br /> <br /> Stay away from this cheap imitation and try to see the real thing ... <br /> <br /> You can not expect anything original Bhatts !!!
