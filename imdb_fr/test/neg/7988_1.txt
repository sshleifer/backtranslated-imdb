This vicious little movie is horrible. My low rating for this comes for two main reasons. The first is that it is a snuff film for animals and I find this concept so bad that it turns my stomach. Filmed over a hundred years ago, I can only hope that we have become something a little more human and compassionate. This film is a complete and complete exploitation, made to take advantage of the sensational aspects of the film and the subject. Apart from historical interest, it is something to watch only if one finds oneself in the grip of a morbid fascination. <br /> <br /> The reason number two? Look at how the camera is configured. It is placed in the best possible location to fully capture the effect: long walk in front of the elephant, perfect view of the electrocution platform and a clinically elephant cold and impartial view of the elephant. smoke before it finally collapses. Sick. <br /> <br /> Thomas Edison has done a lot of great things for civilization and his talents and intelligence are beyond question. Nobody is perfect, but when you realize that this film provides him with an opportunity) to challenge his first competitors with a sensational film about an elephant electrocuted and B) he filmed the execution to demonstrate the greatest efficiency of DC in relation to AC, you can not help but wonder if the scientist in him was a little too cold and unbiased. Any number of crazy scientists from Peter Cushing would be proud. The rest of us should be ashamed and rebellious.
