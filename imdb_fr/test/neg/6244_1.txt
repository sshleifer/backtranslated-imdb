After reading a lot of good things about it, I finally looked at "the glade". With a cast of big actors like Redford and Dafoe, we could at least expect a decent movie. After the end credits, I was still shocked by this film was bad and incoherent. <br /> <br /> Is it supposed to be an "art" film? I do not think he's too melodramatic for that. The problem is that the drama seems far too forced and unrealistic. <br /> <br /> The truth is that the script makes absolutely no sense. First, he never really explains the motive underlying the actions of the characters, he simply crushes their so-called "personal problems." What is so bad about the life of the character of Redford that he must "erase" ?? The fact that he cheats, from time to time, with his wife ?? This guy is a millionaire who has had a good life, a wonderful son and a wonderful girl, a woman who loves him (and a girlfriend who also seems to be well above the generic type of mistress) o and a little -the newborn son.The only problem seems to be that he ... worked hard all his life to succeed. So what? It seems that his hard work has really paid off and that his life is not really a problem. <br /> <br /> Then we come to the character of Dafoe: here is someone who was director of one of the companies in Redford and was fired. Why is this guy unemployed since ... eight years ??? He seems to have some kind of good education to have a job like the one he had at the start and who seems to have been a man with strong ideas about his work (as evidenced by the backtracking of a conversation that he had with Redford while working for him). Why could not a man like this get a decent job and a decent life ?? Because he has already been fired ?? Totally unrealistic. <br /> <br /> The film really tries to describe these men as "tortured souls" or something and that emerges as really cheesy. In fact, I would say that if the creators of this film were trying to say something about the American dream They failed miserably. <br /> <br /> As for the events that take place during the film, they also have no meaning. In fact, the last 20 minutes of the film are an insult to the viewer. intelligence, because there is not something that happens that makes sense. Redford seems to have about 1000 chances to escape, but he does not. At one point, he is ready to escape and yet he misses his chance because he feels sorry for his kidnapper and does not want to hurt him !!! So Dafoe takes his weapon in the water and mud, which should be useless (if you fire a shot after the gun has been in the water and the mud will eventually explode in your face) and the gun is in perfect condition !!! How an unemployed, useless (as described in this film) and mentally unstable character manages to thwart the entire FBI with such ease brings the story of this film to the level of the "twilight zone". to finish the viewer. <br /> <br /> This film claims to be something that it is not (ie a sophisticated psychological thriller of quality). Unfortunately, it fails so hard that it becomes a disaster and that's the word that describes this better film: a disaster.
