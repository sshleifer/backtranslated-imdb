The TV commercials in this film showed that warlocks struck a truck in front, broke into pieces and reformed on the other side of the truck. I thought the special effects were good, but the overall style of the movie was sullen. Here is the TV series "Charmed" with three boys instead of three girls. <br /> <br /> The big surprise for the three teenagers on the way to becoming adults is that a fourth unknown member of the clan is to get them and consolidate all their power. In addition to driving in trucks, these children can fly on the sides of houses, go out the windows, throw garbage and bring out the veins in their necks. But if they use their powers too often, they become prematurely old and weak. The father of one of the boys is the proof, because he is sitting in a loft designed to look like a mummy, but he is only 45 years old. <br /> <br /> The three good wizards are rich in his own right, completely spoiled, obnoxious and boring. In any public school, these children would be beaten every day. Their eyes and their facial ticks did not cut the mustard with the boys of the hood. Unfortunately for all the good people, these charmed boys were sent to Hogwarts Reform School for warlocks who could not enter Harry Potter's class. <br /> <br /> What was the film? Three teenagers act between them and their girlfriends. Another teenager who wants his power and his money and who happens to be a lost parent. After a few scenes where the charmed boys show their powers and have sex with their friends; the film evokes the vengeance plot of the unknown warlock. The predictable thing happens. The bad warlock ambushes several friends of the other warlocks and ends up attacking them as well. The final confrontation happens, and that's about it. <br /> <br /> The special effects are not bad, but nothing special. If you like to see fireballs, spiders and blue veins, then this is a good movie to watch.
