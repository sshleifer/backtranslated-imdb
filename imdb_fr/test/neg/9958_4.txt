Fortunately, you do not need a lot of "book learnin" to understand where this will happen ... Obviously, the big success of Universal, THE WOLF MAN (which was directed a year earlier), George Zucco can be seen in another of his patent roles of "crazy doctor" as a brilliant scientist, Lorenzo Cameron. Cameron, who has settled deep in the marshlands of what I suppose to be the Louisiana Bayou, plans his revenge against four of his former peers who humiliated him and forced him to resign from his previous position. You see, they made fun of his claims that he was able to mix man and beast to create an unstoppable army of wolf creatures that would prove useful in times of war. Fortunately, Cameron found the perfect test subject for his wolf blood injections - a strong, childish half-wit named Petro (Glenn Strange). Petro has no idea what's going on, does not ask too many questions and lets the doctor attach him to a table and shoot him with what's in his syringe. This translates into a quick change of the man who turns into a werewolf. Cameron lets him out of the house by taking a secret passage. So you have a big guy (Strange 6'5 ") dressed in a combination with a bushy beard, hairy legs and a set of oversized plastic teeth In the woods most of the time After an eyewitness saw the beast and a little girl is killed, the locals grab their rifles and set up a detachment to hunt him down, Dr. Cameron, who can control the beast with a whip and has a practical antidote to reverse the effect, also drives Petro in the big city trying to find the teachers who mocked his original theories and destroyed his reputation Cameron's daughter, Lenora, also hangs in the house Anne Nagel), as well as Lenora's boyfriend reporter , Tom (Johnny Downs), who first looks at the fact that they are dealing with a prehistoric creature that walks right (!) <br /> Although a film typically quintessential in many ways, with decorations not very impressive ts, cinematography and ake-ups, as well as a fairly bland secondary distribution, it remains visible thanks to the story of star George Zucco. I do not know why Downs was the most profitable. he comes in half an hour and really does not have much to do, and he is not so impressive. This is Zucco's show from the beginning. He loves to shout and dream, telling himself while fantasizing that he is talking to his peers ("I'm not interested in your foolish comments!") And temporarily slips into mental health. Strange seems to have modeled her performance as a hilarious, naive, slow-motion, semi-retarded campaign bump around the work of Lon Chaney Jr., from his turn as Lenny in OF MICE AND MEN to his performance as WOLF MAN mentioned above. In any case, Strange and Zucco do a pretty good job of playing against each other. What I like most is when Zucco calls him his "guinea pig" in front of a colleague, while Petro remains sitting, smiling and staring at a doorknob. Some fog scenes in the marshes are rather atmospheric.
