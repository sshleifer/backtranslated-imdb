When this film was shot in 1980, I was a teenager in the football stands and I was part of the public. This was done in Mooseheart, Illinois. The big letters spelling "MOOSEHEART" at the top of the stands were covered with a banner in the film. The director told us to cheer loudly at times, as if a touchdown had been made. The St. Charles Juvenile Correction Center is a real place less than 50 km from Mooseheart, although I think it closed recently. During a scene, they show a black woman and a white man among the audience watching the game. Just below them, you can see the head of my sister Noel (she was 11 years old at the time). In the VHS version, I can only see the top of her head, but when I saw her on television in 1981, I could see her whole head and sister Jacqui as well. was OK for a movie made for TV. Since there is already a description of the film here, I do not need to repeat it. It is worth seeing at least once.
