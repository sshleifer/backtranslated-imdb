Princess Warrior is a sci-fi action movie with a pretty thin plot - basically about the death of their queen mother, two sisters, a nasty and a good, are fighting for control of the throne. The good sister is being beaten so she escapes to Earth where she appears naked in a strip club in the middle of a wet t-shirt contest. The rest of the film is essentially a long hunting scene, while the evil sister tries to find and kill the younger sister. But the younger sister is helped by Bob, a big-hearted DJ, and everything is complicated by police intervention and ignorance of the customs and culture of the Earth. The older sister catches up with her younger brother several times, but he manages to escape and run again. Throughout this action, there is a cult that women of the home planet have a kind of space age session to bring back the good sister. Unfortunately, a good part of this film seems to be rather boring car chase scenes as they wander through Los Angeles (and what sound effect does this sound have when the police car crashed ???) The film ends with another physical fight between the sisters ending. <br /> <br /> It seems to borrow elements of Star Wars (the lightsabers and the look of the planet of origin of the girls in the opening scenes and following), Dr. Who (the telephone booth as a means of transportation) and some of the costumes (from the cult on the home planet) could have been taken from Star Trek episodes. <br /> <br /> Ms. In another user comment, Dana Fredsti (the perverse sister of the movie) mentioned "the endless (and dull) wet t-shirt contest." This is truly the longest wet t-shirt contest in the history of cinema ... wearing industrial strength cotton and polyester shirts that have challenged every effort to make them wet and translucent. "I could not say it better. The only thing I would add is that the music in this scene is just annoying. <br /> <br /> Most actors play pretty badly, but that seems to fit the whole style of the movie. The actors who played Vinnie and Vito were too much for me - I just found them boring. Mrs. Fredsti (Curette) seemed to be having fun and not taking all of this too seriously, unlike Sharon Lee Jones who acted decently but seemed to take everything more seriously. All the police were portrayed as stupid idiots, probably to add comic relief, which is a little useless, since the whole movie was rather comical. <br /> <br /> From the point of view of ratings, this film had a lot of foul language; some women with bare breasts and others lightly dressed with thongs, but not enough skin to satisfy those who seek nudity; a sex scene that has been portrayed in a non-graphic and artistic dreamlike manner; and little violence - while there were threats of violence everywhere, the scenes of sword fighting and fighting were exaggerated, and too campy to be "offensive", even though it seemed that the actors were had fun with it. <br /> <br /> I have to wonder who invented the names of the characters? Ovum (small egg), Curette (surgical instrument used for scraping and cleansing), Exzema (strangely similar to a disease characterized by peeling skin and pruritus), Bulemia (an eating disorder with binging and purging ) and Rickettsia (another disease)? <br /> <br /> All in all, it's a very laid-back, low-budget science fiction action movie, but it entertained me, although I may need to take a drink before looking at it again.
