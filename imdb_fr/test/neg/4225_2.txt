I think the cards were against the Webmaster, because from the beginning, there was this feeling of itching, as if something was wrong, but I could not quite put my finger on it. Then it hit me. Double. For a little while, they handled most of the lines in voiceover or off-screen, with just a hint here and there, until it became painfully obvious. This is the kind of dubbing that annoys you, without anything funny. I hate to double, but at least, even badly placed, badly dubbed martial arts movies tend to have a sense of humor about it. <br /> <br /> What I wanted was a movie about a hacker who does hacking and things like that. Maybe as a backhand of the movie Hackers (talking about the person trying to stop them from entering, rather than people trying to get in). What I had was a mystery of badly written, absurd murder, sometimes with a ton of bad prosecution sequences, a so-called unfit computer hacker who was castrated without his little ego and a director who, from obviously, did not know how to handle a camera. I just wanted to go in there, catch the guy's camera and shoot myself. The editing was not much better. The game? Well, I guess if the band leader did not have a script that bad, he'd be at least observable. The main villain was OK too, but just about everyone was a joke. The dubbing did not help, but the acting was pretty bad, even considering that. <br /> <br /> Before going into the details, let's move on to some good things. Well, one or two. Despite the rudimentary graphics, I rather liked the content of the cyber-world, the little that there was, and I would have watched much more a movie mainly about, in and around it, than the environment lukewarm of the "real world". The falsifying fingerprint of the thumb seemed pretty cool, but rather useless in the order of things. The heart gadget, which reminded me of Guillermo Del Toro's Cronos, was interesting, although as a plot plot straight from the pages of Escape from New York, it was horribly designed in the long run. There is a point where the wicked is unconscious and our hero is there. Why did not he try the thumbprint of the type at the time (since the cardiac device was activated by the thumb)? Nevertheless, some interesting gadgets and cyber-objects, if only they could have been used better. <br /> <br /> Now who will dare to compare this movie to Blade Runner? Both films take place in the future and there is a kind of offbeat romance, in a sense, in both films. There is the investigation of a murder, but I have seen a lot of movies with a murder in its center that look nothing like Blade Runner or Webmaster. Identity, for example. That's about where the similarities end. Period. There is no comparison possible, just as there would be no Blade Runner to Hackers. Ridley Scott is a brilliant director with a great sense of artistic direction and the basics of filmmaking, such as where to place the camera. The Webmaster is cheap and not just because of the budget. It's cheap because of bad writing, and because it usually takes the easy way out (like writing in a character who barely appeared in the first place to save the girl in the end to bring it to the point B alone without the hero, so that he can do his job.Very practical.Or the attempt of sympathy for a character we have no reason to take care of.On foolish things like the car prepared to block them just enough for someone to escape.) <br /> <br /> It tries to be connected, to exploit, to try even a not so surprising end, and to be exciting. But a bunch of almost identical chase sequences, bad writing, editing, horribly shot, bad game, etc. do not make an exciting movie.
