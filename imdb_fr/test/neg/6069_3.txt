I am a music lover and I was excited to see this movie. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. I was ready to go out in the middle of the movie. I did not identify with any of the characters, which meant I did not care what happened to them and lost interest in the story. On the plus side, Ed Harris looked exactly like Beethoven, and the 9th Symphony is still a pleasure to hear, making it a part of the bearable film. In addition, the parts where they talk about the bridge have almost redeemed the film in full, but that could not support me until the end. The actors did what they could with what they had to work with, but the script just was not enough to make it interesting, even from a distance. The word on "wash me" was hogwash. I wonder how many takes the actors had to do on that one (I could not say these lines without bursting out laughing.) In any case, such a shame, it could have been so much better.
