IMDb lists this movie as a comedy. I have no idea what kind of film this is, but it's certainly not comedy. tragedy maybe. <br /> <br /> I will not say if it's a good movie or not. All I know is that it's not a comedy. I wanted to laugh tonight and had a weird idea of ​​someone's attachment to an ugly chair. <br /> <br /> This film is not what is announced. These are guts of film school which, I can only assume, are meant to "make people think". I would not recommend this film to anyone I know, or even that I do not know. It's a ridiculous absurdity that makes no sense. <br /> <br /> That made me think. It made me think, "I would have liked to find those 90 minutes of my life." <br /> <br /> I'm sure the world is full of unpretentious critics who have a liberal view of the world that will this film is worth watching. <br /> <br /> I'm not one of them.
