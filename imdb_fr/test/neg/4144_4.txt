I did not want to write this film in critics and critics of the Western world. I wonder how they were wrong about Asian cinema that has become a staple of the Hollywood remake monster. Moreover, Jet L is really cool and he has made some interesting films in Asia. So, with an open mind, I was surprisingly surprised by this movie. <br /> <br /> There are good points. The story is very clever and uses M-Theory as a basis to advance the plot that there are multiple universes, each with its own version of the worlds, and most likely yourself. Whenever one of you is destroyed, the others share energy and power. The idea that someone can try to purposely become the only version of themselves in all universes to know if they become a god. <br /> <br /> There is also Jet Li, and he is not a bad actor and quite lively as a martial artist, plus Jason Statham who is a good actor. As for the special effects, some of them are really cool, a mix of ball and slow-motion time with normal speed, very cool to watch in places. <br /> <br /> The negatives? Statham's focus is appalling, and some effects are not as comparable as others. It is clear, therefore, that money has been spent on the main plans and not on others that have probably been deemed too short on the screen or simply. ran out of budget. <br /> <br /> The action against the close camera favored by Hollywood for a long time, a subject of which Jackie Chan has often spoken, is a big point. Filming battle scenes closely has two goals. It puts more emphasis on a single punch or movement, making it harder and more real than it actually is, and also hides what is happening around the lens of the camera. For example, people holding a fake arm or the face of a double stuntman, etc. <br /> <br /> What Chan has always said is that he tried to open the camera and show the audience what was going on, to let him see. people are fighting hard instead of closing their faces and fists, cutting off someone who falls into the frame. Showing the whole picture is more effective and more impressive. <br /> <br /> The closeups are more annoying than anything else, you did not see Li's impressive talent for the fight, and you had a hard time seeing some of the action . Slow down the cuts and take out the Hollywood Directors camera! The biggest problem was the story, though, despite a solid foundation on which to build, they seemed to lose the sense of intrigue and focus on the action scenes. There are scenes of construction of intrigues and moments of serious explanation which are totally ignored and covered in the space of a few sentences, but which could have formed an excellent and complex character development. <br /> <br /> All this holds together. weakly, and not enough of the story. Overall, not a good movie and its potential has been seriously ruined.
