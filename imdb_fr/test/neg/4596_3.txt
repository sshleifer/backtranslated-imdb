Praise this to my local Blockbuster under the title SPECK - this could be the way to look for it if you still feel the need to see it after this review. <br /> <br /> It's a movie about serial killer Richard Speck, who killed several nurses in Chicago in the sixties. Looking at the film, we have the feeling that he follows the crimes to the letter. Unfortunately, this is not a good movie. <br /> <br /> Another problem I had was the almost constant music letting us know it was a SCARY FILM, and a hideous narration letting us know what's going on. motivating Speck. The game was average for this type of film; to give credit when the credit is due, the film is very well photographed for my taste. Your mileage may vary. <br /> <br /> Overall, if the topic interests you, it may be worth it.
