Do not choose this one. **** Spoiler Alert ***** The plot of this particularly bad movie is that four friends are persuaded to take the shuttle bus from the airport by a very zealous driver. On the shuttle with them is a type of business rather milquetoast. <br /> <br /> Shortly after, the driver of the shuttle takes an exit ramp and a crazy driver tries to make them flee. The end result is that they get a flat tire. The driver asks one of the people on the shuttle to change the tire and the jack slips and the guy's fingers are crushed between the tire and the shuttle. That's when the driver turns out to be a kidnapper and has taken everyone hostage. <br /> <br /> Now, the film becomes extremely slow and tedious because the characters are doing lame things one after the other. One of the men is killed while trying to escape - even if there is no shortage of suspense. Finally, it is revealed that the milquetoast is racing with the driver when the milquetoast kills the other friend by cutting his throat. <br /> <br /> Women are trying to escape. Milquetoast is hit in the head with a tire iron, but he survives. <br /> <br /> The driver is also beaten and survived a head-on collision with a high speed fence while kneeling by the steering wheel. In one way or another, he did not go through the window or even seriously injured in a collision with a windshield. Yet the woman driving the shuttle is stunned - but she had a steering wheel to protect her and he had nothing between him and the windshield. <br /> <br /> He is finally able to subdue the women and bring them to an underground garage that is a front for human trafficking. One of the women is killed. The other stabs the driver in the leg with a good sized broken mirror and pulls / pulls him to the head, but he is capable (in what should be a severely weakened condition - a significant blood loss, two injuries to head and big leg) to get her out of the shuttle, drop her into a big box, throw her inside and lock her, while fighting her hard. <br /> <br /> Now, some people are admiring the film's message about human trafficking and how it is happening today. This is a serious problem. But making an extremely boring movie on the subject does not entitle him to a higher rating.
