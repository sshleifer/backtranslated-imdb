It's certainly not a bad little low budget movie, this "Bride of the Gorilla", but nothing special either, and not memorable enough to be ranked among the significant Sci-Fi efforts of its time. Director Curt Siodmak was a prominent screenwriter in the 1930s and 1940s, and he told stories of real classics like "I walked with a zombie," "The Wolf Man," but, as a director, he clearly lacked the required skills. "Bride of the Gorilla" is similar to the "Werewolf" mentioned above in terms of history and atmosphere, but the film looks much more amateurish and pitiful. The two deal with cursed men who turn into big animals at night, but the titled gorilla does not look as threatening as the werewolf, though the movie was released a decade later. In an introductory speech, actor Lon Chaney tries to convince us that the jungle is a sinister place and hides many mysteries, but that there is no real mystery in the plot. It simply speaks of a plantation manager who is jealous of his older colleague for having such a beautiful young woman and he kills him. An aboriginal woman attends her crime and casts a spell on Barney who makes him turn into a horribly big gorilla at night ... Or maybe she just wants him to believe that he is becoming a frightful gorilla? Lon Chaney himself plays police The commissioner charged with investigating the murder while Raymond Burr (who starred in about a thousand television movies Perry Mason) portrays the director's gorilla of the plantation / evening. Siodmak tries to make the film look like a supernatural thriller ?? is it or is not everything going on in Barney's mind? ?? fail miserably and that causes far too much talk and too little action in the jungle. Many of the jungle settings are well represented, but the rest of the "special" effects are sticky and poorly done. Still, the acting is pretty good, Barbara Payton is beautiful and ?? although very predictable ?? the story is strangely fascinating until the end. Strange movie, he probably cursed me voodoo ??
