I was invited to a first screening of the film about four months before its release. I had to watch the movie and later fill a packet on my thoughts. It was the most difficult thing to sit on the ground. The show just crawled, and you soon start wishing to be dead. The fact is that there are two types of Mormon films. Good guys with real good stories, and crappy shitters. Saints and soldiers, now there is a good movie. But, with these wannabe-comedies, writers and actors strive too much. Basically, they try to be funny when they are not. No wonder the target audience for these films is so small. they are filled with "indoor jokes" that are not funny to start with, and they are just trying to make fun of the average. It's the story that makes the film, and the stories of these movies are simply weak. I bet you can guess what my package looked like when I was told to fill it after the movie. ;)
