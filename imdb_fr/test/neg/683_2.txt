An excellent example of the disaster that occurs when you combine a difficult scenario with two actors chosen for their physical appeal. It's rare for me to be consciously aware of the acting game when I first watch a movie, because I'm just trying to follow the story and save the analysis for the second viewing. In the case of "Full Ride", the acting was so weak that the film was impossible to appreciate as a story; I was too busy (during the first and only viewing) alternating between laughter and nausea. <br /> <br /> Fortunately for most individual cast members, virtually everyone on the whole is weak, individual talent limitations do not contrast. with any truly competent actor. Riley Smith and Meredith Monroe are at least physically well matched, finding common ground by appearing far too old for the credible age of their characters. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the scenario requires particularly intense and convincing performances to represent their characters. just exposed Smith and Monroe of the glaring lack of talent. On the positive side, they know enough not to look directly into the camera and do not stutter. <br /> <br /> Better to have used a less attractive pair that can pass physically for the good age. The basic story is not particularly original, it's another variation of "An Officer and a Gentleman", but it would have provided a beautiful showcase to a talented pair of "teen" actors. <br /> <br /> do i know? I am only a child.
