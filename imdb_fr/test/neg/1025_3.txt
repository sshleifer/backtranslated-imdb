Although I'm not a big fan of the Coen brothers, I'm an admirer of their films about black humor, such as "Fargo" and "Miller's Crossing". I was much less impressed by their other comic mode, goofy-camp (or is it a silly camp?) Unfortunately, 'O Brother, where are you?' falls into this last category and is not even as good as "The Big Lebowski" or "The Hudsucker Proxy". <br /> <br /> "O Brother" is basically an episodic series of jokes with little interest, and not as much humor or skill either. As most critics have noted, the plot of the movie is very vague ?? and, as far as I know, quite arbitrarily ?? based on The Odyssey. His main character, Ulysses Everett McGill (George Clooney), is an "adventurer" as his Homeric namesake and has the "real" goal of returning home to prevent the marriage of his wife Penny with a suitor. Of course, we do not find out that this is what the Clooney / Ulysses character really wants until long after we stop worrying about it. And what does Homer have to do with "Cool Hand Luke" chain gangs, Ku Klux Klan worship meetings at "Indiana Jones", the vocabulary of a defeated lawyer, a talent for singing of country music bluegrass, the association with Baby Face Nelson, a hairstyle resembling Clark Gable, and other random and varied character traits and encounters? I leave this at the discretion of others. <br /> <br /> The allusion to Preston Sturges' "Sullivan's Travels" in the title "O Brother" is also meaningless. Yes, viewers familiar with Sturges' comedy classic might find it gratifying to recognize the title of Depression's socially conscious film, Sullivan, abandoning Hollywood and comedy in hopes of doing so. And they might even be slightly amused by a few scene / scene riffs (for example, the freight car jump and the group of chains that parade to watch a movie). But what? The Coen brothers seem to have nothing to add to the critical debate between art and art about the gravity of moral gravity about the function of art. They obviously fall in the old school, but this does not seem to motivate the reference. Is this a tribute? If so, why do it? I like the reference to postmodern pop culture and textual games as much as the next person, but it's a lot nicer when it equates to something less tonal, if not thematically, coherent ?? and not just an arbitrary concoction. <br /> <br /> This scenario is simply a stupid mess. The only consistent and always pleasant element is the soundtrack of folk / country music. It does not have much to do with Homer or Preston Sturges, but considering the rest of the movie, it's probably a good thing. On the other hand, I would recommend using the price of entry on the CD of the soundtrack.
