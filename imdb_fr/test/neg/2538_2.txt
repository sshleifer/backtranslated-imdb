Anyone who will pay to see Troma movies will know what they are going to get and appreciate the price. That said, I did not think it was possible to make a film that bad and always convincing. I found myself just watching to see how much it could get worse before the end. First of all, this is an Indonesian action movie with an American main character who looks and acts like the bastard son of Christopher Lloyd and Rambo of "Taxi". He places posters of his own dressed like Sly's "Cobra" and even has a custom firing range (with cutouts laid by the action of his biggest enemies) in Jakarta although he is in the CIA and he arrived a few days earlier. There is a lot of action involving gun games (no sounds of mouth on these M-16s, only sound effects), motorcycles (this bust through the walls), karate (where nobody made of physical contact) and even a little sex (where the actors are ugly). The main plot of such an epic should at least be reasonably plausible, but not here. This is the world's most dangerous drug cartel that is trying to find a "drug detection device". Why would they need it? This is never revealed, why not kill sniffer dogs? It does not make sense, but it's taken seriously. The actors must be congratulated because they really seemed to think that this film would make them all famous and would try to "act". Best line? "Now, dance on your grave, dirty bitch!" Best scene? Rambo jumps into a flying helicopter, fires a machine gun from the villain's hand, lets go, falls, pulls a helicopter as it falls, a helicopter explodes, a mannequin thrown into the water. F ** King Genius! If you can not appreciate the garbage, do not look at them. If you can, it's great. One last thing, did I mention that she was led by the three Punjabi brothers?
