Some people like to tell you that Deep Space 9 is the best of all Star Trek shows, as it emphasizes the development and continuity of the characters and presents a more complex background and ongoing intrigues. In some ways, this makes it more satisfying, but in many ways, the show fails completely. <br /> <br /> The series begins as a soap opera on a space station, with two full seasons of generic science fiction stories in equilibrium with trivial side intrigue about the characters. The characters are a good group and most of the actors are decent, but I think the writers have tried too hard to make them "normal". By "normal" they mean "ordinary and tedious". <br /> <br /> At the end of season 2, we present ourselves to the Dominion, which remains threatening for a while before finally making war on the gentiles in season five. This is the main architecture of the series, but it represents only a fraction of the series. We still have lame independent episodes, the heroes are stuck on strange planets for forty-five minutes, and there's a lot of comedy in low voices featuring the greedy and clumsy Ferengi. Many episodes are simply boring, and some are impossible to watch. <br /> <br /> The Dominion, the main villain of DS9, is interested in galactic dominance for the simple reason that they simply do not appreciate anyone. The whole war is presented with a naive lack of moral complexity and imagination. Impressive pyrotechnic space battles appear with great frequency from season 3, but they are ridiculously simplistic, as two huge fleets of super-advanced ships fight each other and propel themselves off. The writers of DS9 (including the talented Ronald D. Moore, later known as "Battlestar Galactica") spiced up their monotonous spectacle by starting a war, but deep down it's still a pedantic soap opera. <br /> <br /> DS9 remains a very frustrating experience. The story continues is too flat and too obvious to be really captivating, and the characters never really develop in an interesting way. "Babylon 5" and "Battlestar Galactica" have both kept the promise made by DS9 and have done much better. For Star Trek, stay true to the original and the next generation.
