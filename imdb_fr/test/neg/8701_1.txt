I really want Hollywood to come up with new ideas quickly. Instead, they come and go to recreate and ruin a perfectly good movie with a re-make. This film is awful from the DeMille version. Throughout this movie, I said to myself, huh ??? - What? - I do not remember this part. So far, the only exciting thing in this movie was the separation of the Red Sea. And in the version of Heston, it was much better than this version. Has anyone else seen a cloud of nuclear or atomic bombs fade when the Red Sea separates? I think I did it. Anyway, I could - could - watch the last part of the evening. <br /> <br /> I would like Hollywood to discuss different ideas and topics when creating new movies. Instead of redoing old movies. <br /> <br /> They should be left pretty well alone. <br /> <br /> UPDATE: <br /> <br /> Well, I watched the last part. Did Moses make the second copy of the Ten Commandments with his own hand - or did I see things - please someone - send me an email and let me know. HORRIBLE
