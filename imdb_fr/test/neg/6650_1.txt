This is one of those films where I was rooting for the one who could end the film as quickly as possible. I wanted to see the cops kill Keaton and Garcia just to finish. This is actually the deal: two policemen must die and a third must have horrible burns in the face for Garcia's son to receive a bone marrow transplant from the murderer Keaton. Is it worth it? No!
