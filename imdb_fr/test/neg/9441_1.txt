This movie has absolutely no redeeming feature. It's not even worthy of being in the "so bad it's good" category - it's just bad. Badly acted, poorly shot, poorly written, misdirected, terrible sound recording and everything is incredibly amateurish. Oh, and could anyone THANK YOU to the lead actress that if you play "crazy", that does not mean you have to constantly play with your hair - in a film that was usually irritating, it was probably the one of the most irritating things of all. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, I think it's the only movie ever to feature a Nazi carjacker ...
