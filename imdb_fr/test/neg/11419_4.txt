Other than that brought together the characters from the first film and gave them more of the story. Lucian the Lycan (werewolf) fell in love with Sonia the Vampire, a scenario of Romeo and Juliet who, you know, will end badly if you saw the first movie. So, without absolute suspense, we move forward with two hours of incessant CGI and actors with little or no presence on the screen. All shot in that monotone color that the first film had because nothing was shot in the light of day. <br /> <br /> Have time ... probably not. In fact, the quality has dropped, even the CGI seems to have been made for cheap, you do not buy a minute that they are real werewolves.
