The on-screen treatment of Broadway's hit comedy "The Gay Divorce" (a title deemed too scandalous for American moviegoers, although it has been used in the UK) is about a man and a woman (Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers) who are meeting in embarrassing circumstances in the process of divorce from his wife; they dance, argue, make up, dance, argue again and dance again. Betty Grable is very attractive in a short time (singing and dancing in the "Let's K-nock K-nees" with Edward Everett Horton openly), but the star couple always looks distressed and unhappy. The surroundings are sophisticated, but the characters are not more than one-dimensional. * 1/2 of ****
