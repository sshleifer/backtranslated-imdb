The idea behind Dead Silence is great: an epidemic of zombies takes place during a radio talk show on paranoia. There was so much for this film. Unfortunately, as soon as the zombies have appeared, everything has been lost. <br /> <br /> The movie is ridiculous and only cheese and horror lovers will enjoy this movie. The zombies were so stupid! They ran around their arms. It looked like a group of people who were building a haunted house for elementary students. <br /> <br /> I know this is a short report, but I simply do not see the need for much investment in this area. It's a silent movie. You have been warned.
