In the history of bad movies, this film must be considered the worst I have ever seen. It was not even a bad movie ... I would have noticed it was z. The special effects were ridiculous ... Uh, if you could call them special effects. I think that the critic before hit the nail on the head ... it was the box that sold the film, while the cover was superb and the synopsis intriguing (that's why I rented it) was not only a waste of time but money too. I did not last long. I brought it back to the store and replaced it for another movie. I think my local video store let him down because he had SOOOO a lot of complaints about this awful movie. My 6 years could have done a better job of filming / writing the script!
