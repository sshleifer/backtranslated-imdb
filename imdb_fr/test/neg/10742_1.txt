--------- SPOILER ALERT ---------------------------- <br /> <br /> It was The worst of the series is the horror disguised as political satire and as subtle as a sledgehammer, not very scary and not very insightful. Does Micheal Moore have anything to do with this piece of Garbage? <br /> <br /> I really have enough that Hollywood uses entertainment as a political campaign against George Bush and keeps repeating the same points of discussion. This film wants to be DeathDream, but unlike this film that subtly addresses the problems of soldiers returning from Vietnam by making live the main character as a bloodthirsty zombie and building slowly on this theme: it was a real movie of horror It was also a good social comment, because it was not sanctimonious, exploited or preached. <br /> <br /> I guess Joe Dante thought it was trying to make a horror movie to frighten Republicans, conservatives and libertarians and I last on this list found this movie totally ridiculous, manipulative and exploitable at the same time and I do not speak of the good type of exploitation, which you will often find in the movies of type "drive-in", I mean operator in the most disgusting and most vile way: use the death of our soldiers as a manipulative political statement disguised as a horror movie. <br /> <br /> This film assumes that all dead soldiers in Iraq would vote against a conservative president if they came back to life as zombies, which is a flawed postulate, because, to my recollection, and comply with the rules of George Romero; The zombies are blind creatures, feeding on flesh, operating on a pure impulse and even though the zombie Andy, in DeathDream, could talk, he could not really hold a conversation and he was motivated by his addiction to human blood. Okay, zombies are mindless creatures driven by an impulse and not by the intellect and, obviously, they are dead, so why should the dead have the right to vote? My interpretation of this film is that the only war a liberal democrat can win is by making people vote for him soulless and dead. I guess they meant that those who vote for presidents like George Bush are insane zombies, while the real zombies are actually the ones who make the sound decisions intellectually. Yeah whatever. Dawn of the Dead approached this idea much better, but used the idea of ​​unthinking consumerism. This film is not the Aimee of the Dead far from being imagined. <br /> <br /> The film deals with the issue while the soldiers are alive and a majority of them voted for a Bush as president, but after their death they would vote for a liberal anti-liberal Democrat. war after they are zombies, who are normally considered dead brain creatures and they might destroy them after voting. <br /> <br /> If you're going to make a movie about zombies, Mr. Dante and call it George Romero's name, you'd better have headless zombies who like to tear up people and eat their intestines , not zombies who vote. I also like the way zombies are content with "evil" conservatives who support the war. <br /> <br /> If you want a good movie with social commentary, skip this piece of junk that's badly done and sneaky and look at DeathDream instead. <BR /> <br /> The worst of the Master of Horror series hands down.
