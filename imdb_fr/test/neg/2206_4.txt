It was a modest movie attempt, although it sounds more like an extended TV pilot. <br /> <br /> Some may find this unfair, but it seems like someone has seen "The Brothers" and "Save the Last Dance". and I thought, "Hey, I could do it too." Well, not quite. <br /> <br /> While I personally found the film predictable, rather badly played and unnatural (beware of cookies), Carl Payne shows that he can take a lead role and that he should be back to television. The main woman (I do not remember her name, sorry) was also plausible, but you keep thinking about Julia Stiles (she was the one of "Save the Last Dance", is not it?) Because that It was really stuck in "White Girl" mode.
