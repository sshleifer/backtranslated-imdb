It was without a doubt the worst horror movie I have ever seen ... Forget the fact that the story had little to do with the facts about Ed Gein ... The story of Ed Gein is horrible and this film ignores facts and goes astray of course. Acting on all levels was pathetic. Story, again, for some unknown reason, did not get into the horrible facts. It could have been so scary if he had stuck to the facts. WHAT THEY THOUGHT TERRIBLE FILM! Steve Railsback's version was much better. Do not waste a cent on this terribly directed film ... And why ignore the reality of horrific events? That alone would make a good story. Man, one wonders why this would be approved for an outing. Why spend so much money in a movie that will never pay a dime (with the exception of my $ 5 lost)?
