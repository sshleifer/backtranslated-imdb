for me, it's not a good TV show, whether it's animated or otherwise. It is nevertheless annoying to the nth degree. There are some reasons for this, in no particular order. Batmite.This character serves no purpose at the show, either. It may be conceived as a comic relief, but it does not work that way. Next door, the Joker.i thought that character released with that ridiculous laughter after almost every sentence. Talk about repetitive. It gets old very quickly .. well, they made Robin look like a complete dork. In addition to these problems, the series is not so bad.But these are important enough issues so that the sympathy factor is greatly reduced. a 3/10, at best.
