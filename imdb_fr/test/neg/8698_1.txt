This film was a loss of 3 hours of my precious time..in the first 10 minutes, I was already angry because I know the real version of the story according to the Torah (5 pounds of Moses) ... but I I decided to look at him for my money and see how bad he was. Well, it was fearing..well more than I thought it would be. First and foremost, let's start with the script and skeleton characters that make up the body of a movie. If you study the Torah, you will see that the whole story is wrong. Here are some of the most unpleasant mistakes: Moses does not do slave labor because he was in the Levi tribe, he does not kill anyone at Mount Sinai. But yet, the film shows that Moses is whipped and Aaron and that he himself kills people ... really not! When Moses speaks to the burning bush, he knows who is speaking, but the film makes him look like an idiot, he says he does not know who the god is in the bush ... whatever | Aaron knows his brother well regardless of As they grew up, Aaron was known for his quiet and calm nature, yet he is described as being angry and arrogant in this movie. Moses looks like Jesus in this movie ... how ridiculous ... the real pharaoh was actually a naughty dwarf sitting on a pyramid of stairs so he could look bigger than he was and Moses had more than ten feet and in the Pharoah movie is bigger than him and he is hot with clear eyes! The woman of Am Israel (nation of Israel) covered her hair and body and did not dance or sing in front of men, she did not participate in the golden calf and did not dance with a man in public the film portrays. Moses' wife, Tzipora, was married to Moses and so she covered herself. As humble as she is, she did not cuddle and did not hold hands in public. The daughter of Batia Pharoah (the one who adopts her and saves her from the water) converted to Judaism and would have been proud of Moses when he said that he was going to liberate his people.Fast fwd to ride Sinai Moses go down the 2nd beat with two sets of tablets ... with gibberish writing .. at least put the writing in the holy language, Hebrew or English and put it on a tablet not two games .. In conclusion, the film is horribly written, made and the characters are all wrong. By and large, EVERYTHING is wrong in the movie ... The old is also inaccurate, but it's more realistic, and the actors are believable. Follow Israel Chai!
