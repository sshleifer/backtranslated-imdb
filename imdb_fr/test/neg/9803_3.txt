I was still waiting for the film to move me, inspire me, shock me, saddens me one way or another, but it does not awaken my emotions. He just mulled to the end. None of the characters seemed very unique or complex, they just seemed to be actors reciting their lines. I think it could have been a better movie if the characters expressed more emotion. The only one who did it and who was credible was the veteran and he probably committed suicide just to get out of the movie as soon as he could. It was a waste of talent, film, their time and mine. If there is a message, a meaning or a genius in this story, it is certainly well hidden or I am very dense, which I doubt.
