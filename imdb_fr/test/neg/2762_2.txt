A good cast ... A good idea, but it turns out that it is flawed because hypnosis is not allowed as evidence in the courts. So many good actors and they all act so badly! So why were they all attracted to this mess ... And yes, it has its advantages such as lighting, etc. ... But in the end, I wondered two things. What is this accent Nigel Hawthorne puts on? He is / was a great actor and what is this accent? It is impossible to identify? What was he trying to do? Maybe that's his subtle indication as to tell us, "I'm involved in a turkey, so here's a crap accent to accompany it!"
