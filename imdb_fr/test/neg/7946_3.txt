It's New Year's Eve, a cop killer (in the form of Laurence Fishburne) finds himself in an enclosure that closes its doors under the snow. When people are under siege, the cops have to team up to survive. This redesign of John Carpenter's classic was simply to add some stupid twists beyond the staggering plot, eliminate all the tension and add a horrible John Lequizamo to the cast, would not it? The first film was exciting, serious and enjoyable to watch. This one is more Hollywood, clich√© and painful to see. The only thing I've learned from this film is that OCD can be very boring ... VERY. The ending song is SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO. <br /> <br /> My Note: D- <br /> <br /> DVD Additions: Commentary by Richet, Demonaco and Jeffrey Silver; Delete scenes with optional comment; Featurette "armed and dangerous" 5 minutes on the weapons expert; 7 and a half minutes behind the walls of the city; "Attack plan"; "The assault team"; 12 minutes and a half behind the stage, featurette;, trailers of "Unleashed", "White Noise" ,: Chucky Seed "<br /> <br /> Miscelanious: I got it at Best Buy and it is accompanied by a bonus disc including the first 2 minutes of "Cry Wolf", a first 10-minute preview of "Unleashed", the trailer of this film and an interview of Fuzion with John Leguizamo
