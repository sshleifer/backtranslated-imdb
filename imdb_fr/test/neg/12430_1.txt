** Spoilers Possible Ahead ** <br /> <br /> Whenever fans of bad movies gather for more than a few minutes, a name that invariably comes up is that of Larry Buchanan. This amazing director presented us remakes of other turkeys (ZONTAR THE THING FROM VENUS), cheap crime series like A BULLET FOR PRETTY BOY and crazy movies of conspiracy such as DOWN ON US and GOODBYE NORMA JEAN. LOCH NESS HORROR is a humdinger to say the least. Larry filmed this howler on a wide, narrow California lake, unaware that Loch Ness is extremely long and narrow. From the beginning, the film offers dazzling underwater photographs (for the budget) and still creates an atmosphere. Then it degenerates into windy dialogues uttered by nameless actors with Scottish accents that slip, not to mention a soundtrack that will do nothing for the much-maligned bagpipe. At one point, campers sing "You take the road, I'll take the road" to add another Scottish shot. If the Scots decide one day to take the policy of political correctness, they will continue Larry Buchanan for this film, despite his last name. The monster looks like a giant paper mache puppet and gives the Beanie & Cecil dragon a terrifying look by comparison. In an unforgettable scene, Nessie lands to land and, to escape patrolling soldiers, the three-meter-long creature tries to hide behind a tree - and the soldiers do not see it! THE LOCH NESS HORROR is a truly mind-boggling mind that must be seen - many times - to believe.
