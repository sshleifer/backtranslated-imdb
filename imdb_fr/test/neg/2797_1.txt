forgive my spelling. It's probably the funniest horror movie ever. Think evil is dead * 1000. The acting is horrible, you can see the line of makeup on the face of a certain lady. there is a lesbian scene, which makes no sense. And the end, haha ​​ohhhh the end ... get ready to have a stomach ache. Now, if you watch this movie for more than 5 minutes and you're still waiting for something, take a look and ask yourself what's wrong with you. This is a very bad movie, intended to laugh and appreciate his pure stupidity. <br /> <br /> Remember to watch all the tournaments after the movie, you can see how everything is really low budget was. All in all, this film is a rare gem to demonstrate the pure and superficial lack of talent / care / abilities / money / and everything you would need to make your movie successful. But it's definitely worth watching.
