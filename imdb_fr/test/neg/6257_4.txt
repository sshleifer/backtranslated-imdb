"According to a joke told by Jim Wynorski" ... that's what I read at the end of the ending credits. Well, Mr. Wynorski must have a terrible sense of humor then! This movie is terrible, really. I loved the first two chapters of The Slumber Party Massacre series; the third movie was totally useless, but completely watchable, compared to this shit! There is not even a Driller Killer and the plot, the acting, the characters, the places, the events ... everything is boring, absurd and laughable. Girls are the only good reason to watch this turkey: if this movie was a porn, I think it would have worked really better! The film also lacks gore: the first scene (the one in the tent) could be bloodier and the scene with the headless guy knocking on the door lasts a second! Some moments of light sensations can not save a non-existent plot. Buzzy (Lunk Johnson) seems to be the only real actor here: I found him the only bearable character in this movie! Oh ... there is an absurd side to Brinke Stevens, who played "Linda" in the first Slumber Party massacre: the police bother her about knowing more about the murderer; but what we get is just a few pictures of the first movie! Not a dialogue, nor a monologue, or anything of this great girl still traumatized, who is forced to revive the worst 30 minutes of her life (as she says), giving us no indication of the murderer! <Br /> <br /> Look at your own risk.
