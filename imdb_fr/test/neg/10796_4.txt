First of all, as I'm one of those who have never seen the cut-out version of this movie in MST3K, I can not talk about it. <br /> <br /> However, I saw the original version of this film movie on the Sci-Fi channel and I thought it was as good as anything else on this channel. In fact, I thought it was one of their best offers. <br /> <br /> I have read carefully the comments below. Those who write in detail about SOULTAKER with a minimum of intelligence, seriousness and maturity tend to like at least a few things about this movie and rightly so. In its original version, most reasonable people, I think, would award it at least 4 or 5 out of 10 stars. That's average for me and I think this movie is about average for a Sci Fi pick. <br /> <br /> In contrast to the above, I have also noticed that critics who seem immature, dull and come out as idiots of my position, are the same ones who find nothing good in this film. basically the trash without cause based mainly on the see chopped and fricasse on MST3K. Or, if they saw both cuts, it seems that they were greatly detrimental to the MST3K visualization.
