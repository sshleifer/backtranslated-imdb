The Grudge 2 is one of the movies that makes me wish there were more synonyms for "terrible" in English. With a plot filled with more holes than a net of trawlers, this movie fails to make compulsive viewing for a fan of the most stupid movies, which I am. I felt compelled to stay in the cinema until Â£ 5.70 of entertainment was removed, although I was afraid to stay there for a few years. A better film could be made from the first shots of the first installment of The Grudge, although I'm not quite sure that this is not the result of such an exercise. Predictably, what goes on as a conspiracy in this terrible example of wasted celluloid comes to an end without any resolution, leaving producers the option to inflict "The Grudge 3" on the public when the time comes true hatred of civilization.
