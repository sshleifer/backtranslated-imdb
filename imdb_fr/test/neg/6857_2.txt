I do not really know why but I looked at it with a sense of anticipation. Unfortunately, it was misplaced. First, it's not horror, it's not scary and (unless it's worse than what I've given it - what's possible) does not try to do it. It's a trashy comedy and the fact that I smiled once means that I gave it a 2 and not a 1. This film tears Gremlins in a really special way, I can not claim to have ever seen a movie who is more dedicated. Very, very bad - to avoid.
