This is the kind of film that appeals to 50-year-old teachers and those who see themselves as aware of social problems - but who have not the slightest idea. The actors - I think all are amateurs - are doing their best, but the screenplay is so full of clich√©s and stupidities that they can not save it. <br /> <br /> The worst of all is the school cabaret that children work on - brings back all your worst memories of acting classes to school. The lyrics of one of the songs go as follows in a quick translation, at 2:30 in the morning: "I am the dwarf of society, an emotionally paralyzed individual." <br /> <br /> Please!
