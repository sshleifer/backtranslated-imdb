I was only fourteen when I first saw Alien movies and I loved the movie right away. Original, terrifying and classic. Sigourney Weaver was the ideal choice for the female character and she would have earned a statuette for her number. In 1979, something eternal was born that the immortal series continued with a legendary film as the first. Alien3 was a different point of view but I think this part was the most stressful and the most unique of all, it was my favorite. Unfortunately, the last one was a failure in many ways. It was tense, illogical with lots of meaningless massacres. I did not like it at all, but I never thought it would be worse in the future. In 2004, I was wrong. Alien vs. Predator was a bad pass, which should have been done by a more talented director or never be at all. But when I saw Alien vs Predator Requiem, I was totally shocked and devastated. When I sat down and decided to look at it with a lot of doubt, even though I never thought that such a bad movie could be done. Without a scenario, without a director and without actors, I do not understand how to make a film. Because this film misses these three terms. What you get is a beautiful show of massacre without a story but with a lot of annoying and boring dialogues. Waste of money and time. This film is rather an impudence, an honor for fans on both sides (Alien / Predator). Shame!
