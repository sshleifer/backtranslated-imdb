I did not really hate Mirrormask. I really wanted more of a movie than pretty visuals. The film begins with a girl named Helana who works in a circus. But while other children (supposedly) want to escape to the circus, she only wants to escape from the circus. In a heated discussion with her mother, Helana wants her to fall dead. Bad movement. The mother gets sick ... with something (presumably cancer) and has to be operated on. The night before her surgery, she dreams of traveling to a wonderful world of dreams and nightmares where she "finds herself". Personally, the film was rotten as soon as it began to dream. The first scenes show the strange and wonderful world of the circus and then compare it to the gloom of the hospital and the uncleanliness of a building. But as soon as she dreams, the whole movie moves to CGI's land, where almost everything is a computer image. The problem is that this dream world has neither the mystery nor the wonder it should have. While movies like The Wizard of Oz seemed appealing to explore, Mirrormask shoves images into our faces, then removes them to give us another picture. The design of this film is uncomplicated and although some things are very pretty (the librarian is a masterpiece), they disappear so quickly that they are quickly forgotten. Helana and her acolyte Valentine are at best annoying and at worst unbearable. Overall, Mirrormask is like a pretty challenge that you bite and find out that it's actually ash. Stick to the real world of children.
