the first film was dark, bloody and mountainous. This film is an unbearable battle against frenzied jazz music, not at all gore, and the worst mask I have ever seen! His deep voice is now a light and joyful voice, the characters of Part 1 reappear by actors who do not resemble them in any way (Claire, Mom Junko), the names of the characters change (Claire or Sara?). It lacks all the brutal violence, the black humor and the political inaccuracy of the first film. Without nudity, this film could have been rated PG. Really bad I'm a huge fan of Part 1, but I can not stand this one.
