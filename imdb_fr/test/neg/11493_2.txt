This is the perfect example of turning a good book into a bad movie. The management gives the impression that the film was built as and Patrick Swaze is so much wood that you can almost see the chains of the puppet on his body. <br /> <br /> Spy Vs Spy movies are not - or should not on - car chases and shootings, the villains of this movie are really bad shots and miss the main characters even at close range. <br /> <br /> Even action plans are just a clich√© with the usual climbing sidewalks and crashing on tables and chairs - yawning. <br /> <br /> I found myself halfway and I went out - completely bored.
