Words can not describe how this series of steam series is asynine, juvenile and repetitive. It is based on 3 things: 1. The constant references of pop culture of the 80s 2. The little tired "bite the joke to the point of clumsiness", and 3. At least 3 or 4 useless flashbacks per episode. The only reason I can see that this shit festival is as popular as the references to the constant pop culture that I suppose elicit a "OMG LOL IS SUPERFRIENDS !! IT'S TOTALLY IRONIC, AND I AM SO EDUCATIONAL AND SMART TO GET IT !! " viewer response. The writing is more than lazy and is aimed at its viewers, mainly in their twenties or thirties. In addition, the design of the characters, which seems to consist of the same three characters with the same bored expressions drawn over and over again, but with different skin colors and possibly a different hair line. Insulting shit.
