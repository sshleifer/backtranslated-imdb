Based on a novel by Edgar Rice Burroughs, AT THE EARTH'S CORE only provides ways to escape and give your brain some rest. Victorian scientist Abner Perry (Peter Cushing) invented a giant burrower that he and his American partner (Doug McClure) used to sneak into the depths of the earth and explore its mysteries. They soon discover a lost world of subhuman creatures in conflict with prehistoric monsters. <br /> <br /> Cushing appears as a distracted teacher to the point of being boring. Instead of being a daring adventurer, he falls on an effeminate face. On the other hand, McClure is tired enough to make himself so laughable. Caroline Munro plays the pretty princess Dia who refuses to leave her world near the center of the earth. Godfrey James, Cy Grant and Michael Crane are also part of the cast.
