The film begins with Ingrid Bergman and his two weird servants arriving in New Orleans from Paris. Apparently, years ago, her mother had been involved in a scandal and Ingrid had come back with the intention of angering parents who would have forgotten earlier that she or her mother existed. It is because she reasons that if they are sufficiently shocked, they will pay her to get rid of her. Then, with that money, she will leave New Orleans and look for a millionaire elsewhere, as she presents herself as a countess. Gary Cooper presents himself throughout his career and seems totally out of place as a love interest. <br /> <br /> It's amazing that this film is not the reason why Ingrid Bergman's film career has fallen: So bad! Instead of the classy and discreet woman she's used to playing in movies, she's probably one of the most boring characters in the movie. His false Contessa was superficial, demanding, unpredictable and stupid. How she could vampire Any man seemed to be a mystery because she seemed less vampire than mere crazy! I do not exaggerate by saying that she behaves, sometimes, as a person suffering from both a serious mental illness and a personality disorder, and all of this together makes me think "who, in the world, would fall in love with this mess ?! " . Frankly, I could not stand watching her histrionic and narcissistic behaviors and she looked more like a guest of "The Jerry Springer Show" than a leading woman! When I think of its role, the words that come to mind are confusing, terrible and excessive. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast is frankly overwhelmed by Bergman's hysterics and hysterics. Although Gary Cooper is usually an excellent leader, he is dominated by her and looks lost. And, oddly enough, they threw a total of two crazies into his entourage - Flora Robson and Jerry Austin. Ms. Robson is best known for her depictions of Queen Elizabeth I, but here, for some strange reason, they have smeared her with makeup and the end result is very much like the love child of an Indian cigar store and of his Aunt Jemima! Her face was very wooden, she wore weird eyebrows and she dressed as a slave. As for Mr. Austin, he was a dwarf and although that should not be held against him, his role was written as if he were a court jester - a very, very thankless role for someone who is "challenged" vertically"! Overall, rotten play, writing and sluggishness make it one of the big stink of the time - almost as useless and dull as turkeys as famous as PARNELL and SWING YOUR DADY.
