I found my cassette of this "show" long forgotten. In addition to the theme song "DISCO BEAVER FROM EXTER SPACE". This show is barely watchable. You will flip through channels, like the couple flipping through TV channels. It's a parody of television. <br /> <br /> The beaver is cool. The homosexual Dracula, the girl who discusses her experiences in Peria and the woman with big lips who talks about homosexuality show us everything that is wrong with television. Everything is BAD. Just like the beaver of space that seems lost in this new world, so will you. *** out of *****
