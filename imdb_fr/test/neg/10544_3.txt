The Toxic Avenger, a horribly deformed creature with superhuman size and strength, is back in this sequel, which has it all wrong. Toxie goes to Japan to find her father at the suggestion of his psychiatrist, who has close ties with a devilish society that just wants the avenger to seize the grip of Tromaville in his absence. With new actors for Toxie and his girlfriend, who has a different name in it, a tone much less dark, much more comical and a plot that does not hold in hand. Even with the totally uncut version that can only be obtained by buying the Tox Box DVD set, the gore is the only thing that counts for this one. And if you come across ANY other version, forget about any possibility of taking advantage of it. Although the first is a low-budget classic, this is simply not the case. <br /> <br /> My note: D + <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Erika Schickel has a very fast brushstroke; Phoebe Legere goes topless; a nasty girl becomes completely naked; and some extras in a bathroom show different amounts of skins <br /> <br /> Tox Box not rated by director DVD Extras: Intro and Commentary by director Lloyd Kaufman; Second commentary with director Lloyd Kaufman, Troma editors Gabriel Friedman and Brian McNulty; Toxic on Japanese television; Interview with Michael Gingold, editor-in-chief of Fangoria; Mike Mayo interview of Videohound; the same damn Radiation March that appears on EVERY DVD Troma; Lisa Gaye clip; Documentary "Toxie 15 Years Later"; 2 PSA; Troma intelligence test; Visit of the Troma studio building; Announcement for Lloyd Kaufman's autobiography; Gallery of stills; Theatrical trailer; and trailers for: "Toxic Avenger", "Toxic Avenger 3", "Def by Temptation", "Class of Nuke 'Em High", "Sgt.
