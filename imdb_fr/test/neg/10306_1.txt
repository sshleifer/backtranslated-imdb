I am very open minded. I watch all kinds of shows until the end ... good or bad ... just to give them a chance and learn positive and negative aspects. This show had the potential to be good. But my God, what were the writers, the casting director and the director thinking about? The troupe of actors is terrible ... at the slightest exception of Meryl (Mimi Rogers) and Darcy (Joy Osmanski) being occasionally provided with good lines with the best execution of the lot. <br /> <br /> The rest of the actors kill the show. It's the same story in every episode. Sam intends to do something. His boss disrupts these projects by giving him ridiculous work projects. Then, the insane ways that Sam tries to reconcile the two in a way essentially stupid and devoid of true intelligent humor. This is EVERY episode. It becomes very tiring. <br /> <br /> Season 2, they give up the pleasure of the eyes. The 2 "hot" girls of the series are written (the brother remains? Explain me this casting, please). I can see why they wrote them ... they had no important role ... but they did not add anyone better to replace them. <br /> <br /> The arrogant character of Derek Tricolli has a continuous appearance in season 2. His interpretation (with that of all the others) looks like a lot of bad sitcoms of the 80s ... might have been funny so ... but painful now. <br /> <br /> the show could have been so much better with some good writers and people who had the talent to perform them. This show lacks everything. The quality of the production is the only positive aspect of the show. It's great in this regard ... unfortunately, the content is painfully sad. <br /> <br /> My god. FOX, was there really nothing better to choose? I stick to shows like "It's always nice in Philadelphia" or "30 Rock" for now. The bar should be set by programs like these that actually assume that the audience is smart and does not drool continuously on itself using all the power of his brain to keep breathing.
