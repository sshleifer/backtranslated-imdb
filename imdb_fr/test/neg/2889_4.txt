*** SPOILER ALERT *** Disconnected and confusing incendiary drama that has to do with a sinister plan to burn a major holiday resort before New Year's Day. Insured for ten million dollars, the man behind Valley View Estates in the Blue Mountains in Australia, Julian Fane, Guy Doleman, is determined to put his project to fire to collect it. This must happen on January 1, in two weeks, before the project's insurance policy runs out. <br /> <br /> While focusing on his builder, Howard Howard architect, Tom Skerritt, has no idea that his boss, Julian Fane, intends to set fire to complex it builds and probably place it at the fall. Anderson becomes a little suspicious when insurance investigator Sophie McCann, Wendy Hughes, informs her of some very crazy things between Fane and insurance company Proud Alliance. It turns out that the pride of Allience actually belongs, or 60%, to Fane himself! This explains why Fane has all these arson attacks to collect the $ 10 million worth of insurance, which is at least double the value of Valley View Estates! <br /> <br /> We will have Sophie McCann murdered later, in a fake swimming accident, to prevent her from discovering what's happening with the suspicious chips around and at Valley View Estates. It was when Lloyd's of London, underwriter Proud Alliance, insurance investigator, George Engles, James Mason, shows that Fane takes a powder leaving his incendiary arson alone and out of control to defeat the whole plan of Fane. </ B>> Meanwhile, Anderson has been advised by Fane and Engles, who, unlike Fane, want the properties of Valley View Estates to be swallowed up for reasons that are never clearly explained. The arsonist is exposed as he is about to do in his girlfriend with Anderson coming to his rescue. We then have this wild hunting scene with the arsonist straying into the Valley View construction site just to set it on fire, with the help of Howard Anderson, where he ends up burning chips before the service goes on. fire can not stop it. The sudden and unexplained end never cleared up what happened to the Big Cheese in all this stuff, the sinister and perverse Julian Fane. It was as if Fane was leaving without Scotland and only his unstable and disturbed henchman, the pyromaniac, who was only the instrument of Fane's crimes, ended up being the only person who paid them.
