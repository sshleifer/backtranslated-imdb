My wife and I both remembered that this movie was a lot better than it is now. When we rented last weekend, we wondered if we were watching the same movie we had 22 years ago. We both agreed that we probably remembered the TV series which, in its one-hour segments, was forced to end the intrigues. This film leaves many traces, as has been mentioned by others here ... the main story of each main character is not resolved. <br /> <br /> But I have to like the title song.
