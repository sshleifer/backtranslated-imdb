The name of this film and the clips I saw made me believe that this film would have exciting and interesting moments. I was disappointed. The sands of the desert were interesting but this film was moving slowly. It started well with an underground cave and something coming out, but then we tried to get involved in the lives of very unfriendly people. When they found corpses, or should I say flesh-covered skeletons, they started looking for the reason? Sometimes it became a bit different as something followed in the desert. A kind of black vase or something that would begin to eat the flesh of humans. As the flesh was nibbled, a bag of bones began to slip past the remaining humans. The reason for this black oozing, as we discover it, was rather bad, ants? Unbelievable! So the end did not make sense. I guess the motto for this film will be this: when you have a scab and you see an ant, kill it quickly before your friends smell your flesh.
