I rented this film at my local library and I thought it would be nice to consider this type of film and the name of it, but I was wrong. The fighting scenes were just as bad and attracted some well-known people but did not throw anyone to star. I noticed that some people gave him a 10. Why would you ever consider giving this horse pile **** a 10. You can say that it's worth a 10 for the pure comedy of it, but when you vote on a movie that is not supposed to be a comedy, you can not give it a 10 for comedy. You have to evaluate what he was supposed to look like and not something that the director did not intend to do. Some of you may have voted 10 because you thought it would be fun to give this shitty movie a high score for people to rent or buy, because you think it's fun to deceive people. You play with people's time and money, which you do not have the right to do. If the film is nil, give it a bad rating if it's good, give it a good rating, but do not lie. I gave a 4 to this film and I'm happy to have been able to check it for free from my library because this film is bad and not worth paying a cent to see.
