Other than John Krasinski, this film was absolutely terrible. The love story of Lacey Chabert and Andrew Keegan was as cliche as possible, full of incredible bad words about her parents never letting them be together and nostalgic looks. None of the "emotions" had depth or reality. The two accented characters (Dean Edwards in the role of Rupert and whoever is playing the gun expert) ... once they have noticed the magnitude of the accents, would not they could decide to delete them and rewrite a few lines to avoid giving headaches to the public? Apparently not. I do not even know where to start with editing, especially audio editing. If you hate as much as I do obvious duplication, do not look at it. That being said, Krasinski was great. From the outset, I'll admit that I'm a big desktop fan and that's why I rented this. But he is quite entertaining as an "ordinary friend with crazy ideas". He has a role cliche, but he still manages to make it as entertaining as possible. The end was terrible. Just terrible flat. The idea of ​​the flight that went wrong had potential, but Keegan crawls after being shot down to his studio to fall over a painting of Chabert (which looks nothing like it) is the scene the crazier than it is.
