You're Dead is an indescribable attempt at a British gangster movie. It contains no original idea, being an atrocious copy of various elements of Lock Stock & Two Smoking Tuxedo, The Suspects usual and Pulp Fiction. The actors' game and the dialogue are absolutely untenable, the plot is ridiculous and quite predictable despite the constant attempts to divert intrigue, and contains only ordinary characters and clich√©s. There are good actors, but they are out of shape and unable to do much with the dreadful equipment they work with. It's an absolute torture to get through this drag.
