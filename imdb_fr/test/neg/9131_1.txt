There seems to be a specter of cinema. On the left, there are movies made mainly for entertainment and / or commercial purposes. In the middle, there are both entertaining and artistic films. On the right, films that are not as commercial, but that focus more on the cinema than on the art, than on the cinema and on the products. <br /> <br /> I'm not here to say that part of the spectrum is better than any other. but when a movie goes too far, it's rarely good. This is the case of Naqoyqatsi. <br /> <br /> I did not know what to expect when I saw it announced. Some friends were going and asked me if I wanted to come with me. None of us knew what to expect and in the end none of us were happy. <br /> <br /> Yes, there are breathtaking images. Yes, I am amazed at the efforts of filmmakers to search for archival footage. Yes, the soundtrack is fun to listen to and is probably the best part of the experience. The fact is that it goes so far from the right side of the spectrum that I mentioned that I can not say anything good about the film as a whole. <br /> <br /> It's preached. It is a mixture of symbolism and obvious morality. It's not about saying anything new or forcing the viewer to look at life in a new way. It's just telling us things we already know (that is, if we can even understand what it says). <br /> <br /> This film is simply art for the sake of art. An attempt to say "Look how deep we can be and inspire reflection by using editing!" When a movie becomes smarter or smarter than its creators, it ceases to be a movie and simply becomes a self-satisfaction in celluloid.
