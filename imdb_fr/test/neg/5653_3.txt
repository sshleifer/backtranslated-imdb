Miranda Cosgrove is known for her "School of Rock" debut with Jack Black and for her role as Megan in the "Drake and Josh" series. She became one of Nickelodeon's favorite fans of the public. So it's no surprise that Dan Schneider would create a fair show for her. Unfortunately, it ends up being as bad or worse than "The Amanda Show". <br /> <br /> "iCarly" talks about three friends, Carly, Sam and Freddie, become idols in the world. Junior High Community through a webcam show called "iCarly". Carly and Sam are the hosts and Freddie pulls and puts it on the Internet. Carly also has an older brother named Spencer, played by the hilarious Jerry Trainor, known for his work in "Drake and Josh" as Crazy Steve. <br /> <br /> Well, let me tell you this. Do not believe the 8.3 out of 10 received by this show because it's pathetic in almost every aspect. Dan Schneider probably spent about 5 minutes studying the interests of teenagers because all I see is saying to him: "iPod? IPhone? IHome? Aha! Teens love everything that starts with" i "! a majority of concerts that were used in "Drake and Josh", if not, then they're just really dry and forced jokes that do not even count on a generous chuckle, like "You want me to go back to AC 60 degrees ? " "No. We want you to process up to 60 pickles! "Not only that, but if you look closely, almost all sets of the series were used in" Drake and Josh "and" Ned's Declassified ", which were simply spit and polished with random stuff to try to give it a different look. <br /> <br /> The scenes where the show shows an iCarly network show are as terrible as the whole show.The dialogue in them is atrociously bad, which can be accepted by some since it is only two friends playing in front of a camera, but what is the problem with the really strange and humorless antics they like "Random Dancing!"? the situation is getting worse from here. <br /> <br /> As far as acting is concerned, Miranda and Jennette are not at their best, by far, Nathan Kress, who played Freddie, is sometimes not credible, but it does a good job. What really steals the spotlight is Jerry Trainor's humorous prowess, which fits very well into his role as "big brother protector" and his wide open-eyed game can make some pretty amusing passages. Too bad they are not frequent, because it could have given the show an extra star in my opinion. <br /> <br /> Dan Schneider must have done this show for the sole purpose of giving Miranda Cosgrove his own cable-born son a playground to jump and tell ruthless jokes and pathetic landmark card lines in every way, because everyone has an exceptional talent buried under the badly done scenario and the game in weightlessness. Dan Schneider did a great job with "Drake and Josh", so it's a real disappointment that "iCarly" is such a failure. Jerry Trainor's acting game has saved this show by a score of 1 out of 10, but it can not prevent the "iCarly" from being as horrible as it is.
