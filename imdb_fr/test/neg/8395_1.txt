This movie is honestly the worst waste I have ever seen. it's slow, conspiracy less and boring. the filmmaker deserved to be shot. There were various aspects of unintentional comedy, one of which was Jared camp strangely. Brought up a lot of laughs but also many yawns. do not look with anyone, at any time or place. If you hate someone, recommend it to buy or rent. big loss of time and money. Thank you Gus Van Sant ... no. I can not think of anything else to say except to never see this movie, it will make you want to jump off a cliff. Hope Gus and his comrades read this comment before it's too late and he makes a sequel or another disaster with what appeared to be shot with a camera phone.
