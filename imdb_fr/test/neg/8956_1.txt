I just do not understand why, every time someone makes a show on one of the country's largest metropolitan areas (Houston, Dallas, Austin / San Antonio, etc.), he portrays the average person as someone one who wears a cowboy hat / nail, speaks with a drag, has no sense of fashion and drives a truck to either go to the "salon" or to his next hunting trip, rodeo, skeet shooting or country music concert. I never even saw a police officer from a small town driving a police truck ... anywhere in Texas. <br /> <br /> The funny thing is that this is not done for artistic reasons or for comedy ... they are really serious and I guess believe that the average person is too stupid to know the difference. Bad scripts and bad acting give that. This show makes wacky shows in the past, such as Knightrider, look like a top-notch entertainment. At least Knightrider had the car talking.
