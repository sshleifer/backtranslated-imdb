it is the best film that takes the first place to the sick and a useful film ever made in this poor country. really, you do not even know what the word cinema means and you vote for movies, I'm really curious how many P.P.P. or L. Bunuel have you seen. The result of this "experience" reflects many ways of understanding things and recognizing a good quality movie when you see it. We, the Romanians, have only one film and until today the status has not changed and this film is called "Padurea Spanzuratilor". But I do not waste my time thinking how many of you have seen it. It is a film that respects all the qualities required of a film. From the scenario to the frames and even to the quality / clarity of the photo, he has already spent 41 years. I recommend that voters search for better films and then vote. KuDos will see you later.
