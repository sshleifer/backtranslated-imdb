Wow! Here is another movie about the scarecrow that goes straight to the goal of pleasing the masochists of cinema. If the cheap opening credits do not tell you that you are going to go a long way, then the devilishly tragic "writing" will surely do it. <br /> <br /> A diabetic child is tied to a legendary scarecrow part of his initiation on the baseball team. Then the scarecrow goes crazy and starts raising people. Do I need to say more? This film contains a lot of cheap effects, which gives the impression of having been edited with iMovie (note the spooky inversion of colors) and actors who, apparently, were not well enough to participate in a special late-night Cinemax show. In fact, it's not fair, because the actors did not have much room for maneuver to turn around the pathetic scenario. Some parts of this movie really look like a parody, especially when a character takes his guitar and starts playing the worst song ever written by humans, with the worst lip sync ever made to follow it. The "gore" here is also a major disappointment. In most B-movies such as this one, there is a thick layer of cheap gore FX to compensate for what's missing in the story and acting. Here, the material is so cheap that it's not even fun. In comparison, this film gives the funny look to "Jack Frost 2". <br /> <br /> If you think this movie is "the worst you've ever seen" then you're probably not immersed in the details of the B-horror video world. Anyway, this movie will cause you a lot of mental anguish, no matter what your background.
