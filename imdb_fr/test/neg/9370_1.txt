All she has to offer are the interesting opposites of Tru and Jack, their choices and points of view, as well as the philosophical questions he raises. Tru thinks she's helping people who are not supposed to die, and Jack thinks they're supposed to die, and she interferes with the plan of destiny, the plan of the universe, or whatever. <br /> <br /> But she is obviously capable of changing things, so there is obviously no destiny in the metaphysics of the series. Jack has no reason to believe there are any. And very conveniently, Tru never asks him the right questions. Nobody does it. This obviously proves that the creators of the series have no answer. <br /> <br /> There is simply no plot! <br /> <br /> Instead, they leave it obscure for the show to be able to continue with its boring girl tricks, only occasionally interrupted by Tru and Jack running against each other toward goals. unknown ... <br /> <br /> It turns out there is nothing. A teen pop series that claims to be something else. <br /> <br /> You will be better off sleeping.
