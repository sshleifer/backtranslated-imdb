J.J. Jameson (from Spiderman 2) Quote ... Shit, shit, ... <br /> <br /> Mega-Crap It claims to be a homage (a / intentional) to the Coen brothers ... badly done. <There is no real mystery in the plot. <br /> <br /> Diaz's performance is not inspired. <br /> <br /> The original characters do not really work. <br /> <br /> There are many "duh" moments. <br /> <br /> I like black comedy, but this movie is not funny. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, it was not worth the electricity. <br /> <br /> There are many films of this kind that are much more entertaining. <br /> <br /> I hope you find this review useful.
