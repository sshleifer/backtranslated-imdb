Cage plays drunk and gets critical acclaim. Elizabeth Shue actually has to make love to the most unattractive and overrated bit of dunking in Hollywood. I literally vomited watching this movie. Of course, I had the flu, but that does not mean that this movie did not contribute to vomiting in the kamode. <br /> <br /> Why can not Nick Cage play something he can really shoot like a bad actor? Nick Cage who is brilliant in a role of bad actor. Heck, nobody could do better. <br /> <br /> The search for Nick's contract with Lucifer begins or was it Lou Cipher from "Night Train To Terror".
