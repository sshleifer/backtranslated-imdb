Terrible! Dismal! Terrible! Ridiculous! Disappointing! <br /> <br /> Yes, you are trapped in "The Cave" with several "men" and a "hard" woman, you are systematically killed by "Something" and you can not even hear anything. Words grandis !!! A Cert 'here in England, and you can tell! <br /> <br /> The Egos of the "Macho Men" were too heavy, pass the bucket, I will be sick. <br /> <This film should never be exposed to daylight and, ironically, be kept in the darkest and deepest hole of the ground and be forgotten forever. I have the feeling that this description is not the first time that one pulls one's head from a hole in the ground. <br /> <br /> Like the movie The Cube, it was a good concept, but we just left it on the last post of, well, his self. <br /> <br /> This comment contains Spoilers ok, it's called The Cave. <br /> <br /> Thank you, Bruce.
