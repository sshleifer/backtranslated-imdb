Praised this one by mistake thinking it was another movie with the same title and realizing that I had already rented some time ago. <br /> <br /> Fast track line. A couple composed of an artist and a photographer rent a studio in Los Angeles to Joe Estevez, still cursing the fact that his brother, Martin Sheen, can really ACT! They find a bed in a forgotten room, but the bed is haunted by a nasty serial killer of the 1930s and his latest victim. Their ghosts inhabit the couple, first improving their sex life, but eventually becoming more menacing. <br /> <br /> It follows cheap sex scenes, less expensive sensations and a waste of time.
