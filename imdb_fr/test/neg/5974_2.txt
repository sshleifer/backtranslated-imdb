I'm sorry to say that, but it's actually one of the worst documentaries I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Because of its name "Darwin's Nightmare", I was waiting for a documentary about the problems related to the Nile perch in Lake Victoria. <br /> <br /> What I actually saw in this "documentary" is an accumulation of individually told elements, most of which have no connection with the fish or the lake. And for the most part, you can hardly call it stories - it's more like accumulated scenes that lack meaningful connection ... <br /> <br /> Why does this movie waste you time: - We showing irrelevant information about the families of Russian pilots (for example, a few minutes are wasted on their private photographic snapshots of wives and girls) - Mourning the death of an African child who was bitten by a crocodile (as if it could not have happened without the Nile Perch) - Show us about 100 times how planes land and start at the airport - Show us strange religious events for several minutes - Discuss in detail the life and death of a prostitute at the airport - talking to the children of their mothers, their fathers - what they work for and / or how they died (well, guess what: some have died of HIV - who would have guessed?) These are just a few examples, I could go on for several pages ... <br /> <br /> This movie is absolutely blurry and does not know at all what it means to see you. have never heard of Africa and have no idea that this continent has social / health / HIV / violence / war problems, so this movie might suit you. If you have not closed your eyes in recent decades, 90% of the shows in this film will not be new to you - and the way it is presented here will do its best to put you to sleep. <br /> <br /> My expectations of this film were perhaps too high, but I did not really like it, even if it is a subject that seems to me generally interesting. If this film wants to show the link between poverty and the Nile perch, perhaps it would have been necessary to spend some time discussing it ...
