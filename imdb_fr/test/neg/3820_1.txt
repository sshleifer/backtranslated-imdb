It's one of the worst movies I've seen in years. The scenario has a potential that never comes true. The actors are a bad choice, but given the writing on the screen, their talent is not lost. I really wanted everyone to be dead as soon as possible to get out and look at something else. Unfortunately, I stayed to the end and laughed at the murmur of people who complained of misery. After all, it was not booing, it's England, just moans on shit. Then I look at IMDb and see that 288 people gave 10 out of 10. I really do not see how these people can give this score. They must be a public relations company working with the distributor. There is a hilarious plateau problem towards the end of the movie, when in the graveyard and hick attacks, look for the shady landscape that cradles when hit (supposed to be a brick wall) - the blood effects are waaaay OTT - the movie Feels like everyone is doing a horror parody except the director.
