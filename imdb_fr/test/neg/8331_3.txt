The world now seems to be in a strange phase of downsizing, in which the size of objects such as DVD and CD drives is steadily decreasing. It is obviously much cooler to have an iPod smaller than a bigger one. This is not the case with theatrical screens, as is the case with IMAX, the huge, widely known drama system that has stunned audiences on its release, and to this day. As long as the material is correct. <br /> <br /> The main problem with "Magnificent Desolation: Walking on the 3D Moon" is that it uses the giant screen as the main advantage, it is dull, devoid of information and ruthlessly impatient. to please and amaze us with its nerdy special effects and inspiring quotes from big names such as Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin Another problem with the movie is that it does not even take the time to sit down and interview those who had the chance to experience the extraordinary experience of living on the moon.From this, the writers simply pressed COPY and PASTE and engaged famous voices such as Morgan Freeman, Bill Paxton and Matt Damon to emulate their famous quotes. <br /> <br /> I would say without hesitation that I did not learn any information from the movie that I did not already know. <br /> <br /> And he insisted several times by irritating the shit off of me with his feeling In just three minutes, Tom Hanks' voice seems to be able to say something like: "Without the contributions of these brave men and women ..." Watching the film is like watching a bad commercial . For forty atrocious minutes. <br /> <br /> 1/4
