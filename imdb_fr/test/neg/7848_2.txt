This must be one of the worst films of MGM and FRANK SINATRAS. A funny musical that fails in almost every aspect. SINATRA tries to perpetuate the reputation of his father as KISSING BANDIT. He is not a bandit and does not kiss !! He plays the character "corny" as well as you would expect given the dialogue he must speak. The thieves are J. CARROLL NASH and MILDRED NATWICK. Too bad they did not have more scenes together. I gave two stars to the film because the sets and costumes are superior and one of the songs interpreted by KATHTREN GRAYSON "Love is where you find it" is sensational. Could have had a repirse of that one. In addition, a comic strip dance number of RIDCARDO MANTALBAN, CYD CHARISSE and ANN MILLER has fun. Therefore, for these reasons and only for these reasons, it is possible to observe it. KISSING BANDIT is part of the Frank Sinatra collection for early childhood.
