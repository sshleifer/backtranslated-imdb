After his success with A Nightmare on Elm Street in 1984, director Wes Craven decided for some reason that his next project would be this TV movie. I am not a big fan of this director as a whole; The early exploitation film The Last House on Left, as well as its modern slasher, Scream, I like a lot, but the rest of his work is very random and I hesitate to call him a master. The main theme here is cryogenic freezing, although it is more of a stepping stone for the plot than a major part of the film. The main influence here is obviously the excellent 1974 zombie movie, Deathdream, and we focus on Miles Creighton; A businessman frozen cryogenically for ten years before an accident, he must be thawed immediately. Miles is part of a project for the sick. they pay to be frozen in the hope of being revived in the future when their diseases can heal. Miles is reconstituted successfully and it is perceived as a miracle ... but the person who wakes up is not the one who was frozen, because Miles returns without soul. <br /> <br /> This movie could have been pretty decent. judging by the underlying idea, but instead we get a plot that does not have much to see and it must be said that Craven does not make the most of the movie's potential. The soul is the focal point, but it would seem that having no soul and just having a killing intent / no compassion is the same thing, which does not seem a little imaginative. The film was made for television, so it's not particularly nasty and obviously it did not cost a lot of money because the whole production seems very cheap. Michael Beck has never become a very popular actor and it is not surprising if we judge by his performance here. if it is passable, it lacks a lot of charisma and is not great in the central role. The plot does not unfold too badly, but there is a real lack of suspense and / or tension and things slow down too much, which makes the film rather boring on occasion. It all comes down to a predictable end too. Overall, I have to admit that this film did not impress me at all and that in terms of Craven's filmography, Chiller would have to fall with Shocker, the sequels of Scream and The Hills Have Eyes II.
