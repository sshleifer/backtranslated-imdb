Although a fan of shock and gore, I found this film disappointing, to say the least. The effects and the work of the puppets were impressive, yes, and the humor was well chosen, but ... something was missing. You see, the first act of the film is devoted to shaping the character of Jack Brooks, despite the fact that everything we need to know about his aggression is delivered within minutes of the first title cards. As for narration and many flashbacks: useless. <br /> <br /> Stimulation in the second act was tedious. Freddy Krueger eats, then vomits, then eats it again, then waving his arms and saying something sharp or rude. All the while, the scene is punctuated by brief scenes of Jack discussing his rage problems with a therapist. (Definitely the fun scenes of the movie - an excellent dialogue that is worth a lot of laughter.) Then, without warning, Jack decides to kill some monsters. And then, it's over. <br /> <br /> In the end, reminiscent of the horror movies of the 1980s, Jack Brooks: Monster Slayer has a lot of potential, but it is aimless and continues without conflict or adequate resolution. <br /> Hope these problems will be solved before Jack Brooks VII: Jack Goes to Hell or Jack vs Ash goes into production.
