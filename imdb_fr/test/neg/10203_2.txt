Hulk Hogan and Zeus are wrestlers and horrible actors. Hogan for some reason was quite popular to get a movie, I'll never know why. Without Vincent Mcmahon's money, this stupid movie would never have been done. Maybe someday, someone will make a good movie about professional wrestling. No Holds Barred is not this movie.
