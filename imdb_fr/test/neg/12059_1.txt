Camp Blood is an absolutely atrocious slasher movie. We mix Friday 13 with the Blair Witch project and add ... a killer in a clown mask. <br /> <br /> The budget of this film was to be very small, some actors played several parts and the camera used produced an image equal to the colorized version of the original Night Of The Living Dead, who, if anyone has seen this version, will tell me that it is poor. <br /> <br /> This movie was just a pity. Nothing in the film deserves to be watched. The very fact that I watched it all over me stunned me. Just follow my advice and do not buy or rent this movie. It's terrible.
