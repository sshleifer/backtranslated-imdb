It's by far the stupidest thing I've ever seen on celluloid. I mean, we started looking at assuming it was a T & A skinemax movie, but other than a few breasts, that was it. I mean, I have the interest to make stupid movies to show sex scenes, because that's the only reason to make a movie like this. This movie, however, has no sex scenes and really does not make sense. There is no linear time, the scenes move like a fart in the wind, people show up for no reason, then leave, and we never explain, the plot is never advanced and nothing happens. I have never been so stunned by the gravity of a movie until I see it. Did the director go to a film school? Has he ever seen a movie? I do not know, but judging by his appearance, he seems to have made a stupid pride with this piece of shit, because he is still working. I literally moved away from this silly movie, but I still recommend watching it, as it should be shown in every film school in the country, as an example of what not to do to make a movie. Move over plane 9 from space, you have a new candidate for the worst movie of all time.
