How are such bad stories done? It is not a question. It's an affirmation. <br /> <br /> Here are my problems with the film. <br /> <br /> 1) Much of the development of the story was predictable and boring. My emotions worked pretty much in a flat line all the way through. There was not much that attracted the viewer to the film. <br /> <br /> 2) The characters were decidedly not very charismatic. One was a loon, another was confusing, and the third was rather boring. There was absolutely no reason to be attracted to these people. Although I knew it would not happen, I was hoping they would meet someone else, someone more interesting. <br /> <br /> 3) The physical environment was uncomfortable for me. A trailer??? In the desert??? The desert is a place that most people prefer not to visit. How is it that these three people find themselves in the desert ??? <br /> <br /> 4) And in the same desert. Is the writer really expecting the last three people on Earth to meet in a few weeks in this desert? <br /> <br /> 5) Was it really necessary for Ms. Ryan to be in two scenes that required a swimsuit? Hey, she looks great, but it was rather free. <br /> <br /> OK, so if I thought it was so bad, why did I give a 3? I try to be as objective as possible. Even if I found Alan annoying, I must say that David Arnott did a very credible job in describing a neurotic nerd (the character reminded me of some more annoying roles of Albert Brooks). Jeri Ryan tried to do something with Sarah, but it was not very well written. Okay, so she was supposed to be a confused and dysfunctional woman. But why? What did this add to the story? His mood swings left me feeling shaken (hard!) In one direction then in another, then another. <br /> <br /> I do not often go out movies, but this one made me think a lot. time. Rigid, predictable, boring. Proceed at your own risk. <br /> <br /> My 2 cents.
