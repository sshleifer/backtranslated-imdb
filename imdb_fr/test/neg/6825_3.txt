In recounting these events that took place a few years ago (hard to believe that it really happened), I thought: well, there is a basis for an interesting story here. Many secrets have never been discovered, the horse has never been found, the main conspirators have never been captured, etc. <br /> <br /> However, this film seems to be distracted by the study of the character and very little attention to the plot. Some other questions are however asked, like: why the devil Mickey Rourke would it be in this film? It is good to see that rourkes' career has taken off again, but he must cringe to mention this waste. <br /> <br /> If you are interested in the subject, do a search on the Internet about it, you will be more educated and dare I say more entertained. Avoid that.
