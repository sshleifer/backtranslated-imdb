I saw this film as part of a Billy Graham program. The church I attend was part of an awareness campaign to introduce God and Christianity to our community (Hartford, Ct USA). I was one of the counselors who helped the participants (who were invited to make themselves known and to do the kind of religious profession they want ... and to follow them after the film.) As such, he did what he was supposed to do, and personally, I found it to be a way to strengthen my faith in God.I also found it very helpful to those I counseled. Kim Darby's work in this film, and the parents (the Wintons?) were sort of a little behind ... no one tells his child if he thinks he could be the parent of an illegitimate child as the Wintons did, "oh, no, no, not thaaat." That's not quite what they said, but the sympathetic audience I saw burst out laughing, what they said, but also with the emphatic son "No, MOm, not me." Don Berghuis
