1 st watched 8/7/2004 - 3 out of 10 (Dir-Brett Thompson): A silly, minors-focused film about three children being zapped in their favorite drawing with the experience of their parents. The scenario left much to be desired in this Hanna-Barbara, such as the Saturday morning swindle with "costume scenes for dinosaurs" with zany riders. Nothing to really admire about it and nothing to say either. I'm just stunned to find it so bad in a Blockbuster video store and in the way stores are getting rid of their old VHS movies. I guess they could not even sell it, so let's go back to the rental rack.
