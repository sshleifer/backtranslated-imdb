... Once. "Manos, the hands of fate." It was worse, much worse: but there was one thing: there were beautiful neglected women who attacked - for about 20 minutes. This has a big boy of 45 with 3 tits and a tail, in a cantina scene cloned directly from "Star Wars". Not to mention the seductive blue Uhura, obese, her fat legs and her ass hooked to some sort of insane bird costume, in this mess of the acting method. She always wanted to perform in front of a "captive audience"? She had to hint at the poor sluts who spent $ 8 in hopes of seeing another "Wrath of Khan" or at least a "return trip".

"<br /> <br /> No doubt," Final Frontier "is not just it's a cruel and unusual punishment, it's Star Trek from hell, it's Shatner on mushrooms - or maybe that's where peyotl is where no man has ever been before and he never would have been in the first place - a review of "Heaven's Gate:" It's like Gene Roddenberry had sold his soul to the devil for the success of a TV series, and that heck was just coming to collect. "<br /> <br /> And do not even make me jump on a drunk Kirk and a smiling McCoy singing" Row, Row, Row Your Boat "together, as if they were the lovers in a kind of crazy gay fever dream. Then we have the dynamic Hideous Dynamic duo of Sulu and Chekov, walking together in the woods ... probably on their way to a Barry Manilow concert. Then there is Laurence Luckinbill as Spock's brother ??? !!! Yes indeed! It's amazing how these relationships we had never heard of suddenly fade away when we need a new plot. And do not forget Spock who was flying through the air after Kirk when he fell off a cliff in Yosemite. Sure. He catches up with Kirk and saves him one foot from the ground. Where did you get those great Rocket Spock shoes ?!
