As was mentioned by others, could there be another reason to see this film than to see former Wayne's World star Mike Myers play a serious role? The scenario is interesting but lacks development and is sabotaged by loose ends and bad characters. If there were good panoramic views of Ireland, it would give him another reason to see it. But instead, it focuses on a small, normal village that is obviously surrounded by the "green pastures" of the Emerald Isle, often shown in Irish films. If there was a cultural "spice" to admire the "Irish personality", it deserves to be seen, but it could almost have been shot in England. Too bad for Myers, but it does not satisfy or satisfy the heart of anyone who has always wanted to visit the country of Guiness.
