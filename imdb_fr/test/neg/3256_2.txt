When a hard-working entrepreneur is rejected by a prestigious national club, he starts a battle between his members and ends up buying it from Ty Webb (Chevy Chase) and making it a theme park / golf course to which everyone can join. <br /> <br /> It's certainly not a good movie, but it's still a little fun. Almost all comedy is a cheap joke and bad jokes except for Chevy Chase. Chevy Chase plays one of her biggest roles as Ty Webb for the second time and plays it very well. He's not just the funniest character in the movie, he's the only fun character in the movie. Even Dan Akroyd can not bring humor to this film that aspires to be a beautiful sequel to a classic comedy but falls apart with the others on Comedy Central. The film might have been better if Ty Webb (Chase) had a bigger role, but instead it was reduced to a minor character and the star had become Jackie Mason (Who ??) The right way! This is a perfect example of what not to do to follow up on an already great movie. Overall, Caddyshack II is full of humor but it's a big mistake. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend this movie.
