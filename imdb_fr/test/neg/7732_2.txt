God, this movie was nothing more than the making of numbers. A struggling salesman can not cope in New York, a mentor with a gold heart takes him under his wing, a troubled salesman moves to California and makes him fat, then loses him fat, then bounces back with life single hits the bottom trying to get back to the top. I do not think I can remember any part of the plot whose development took more than five seconds. Special case (spoiler?): When the character of John Kapelos called to say that he and his girlfriend came to Santa Cruz for a visit, and James Woods said there was virtually no chance he would come you knew for sure that they were coming next or both. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, Sean Young looked good.
