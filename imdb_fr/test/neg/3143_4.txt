What should have been a dramatic tale of life on the Murray River turns out to be an idiotic and silly story about an English refugee (Sigrid Thornton with an Australian accent) who falls in love with Larrikin's first companion (John Waters). a steamboat. <br /> <br /> The first half of this four-and-a-half-hour miniseries is promising, but it falls flat quickly as it becomes predictable and thin. It took a bit of verve and spark in the plot to give a little life to the film. The early exit of Gus Mercurio did not help, because his character seemed to me to be the only one interesting. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the longer version of the television has more depth, because this video translation was certainly lacking. <br /> <br /> Sunday, June 27, 1993 - Video
