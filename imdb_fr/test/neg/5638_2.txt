Go then. How did all these talented actors / actresses find themselves in this mess? Was it a kind of blackmail / lost bet situation? Vinnie, you are a muscular man. Be what you are born to be. <br /> <br /> The spa scene? The Scrabble scene? I was expecting to hear the sound "needle slip on the disc" at any time. <br /> <br /> And what was he carrying with him the priceless manuscript of Dickens? Let's see, I'm drunk in a bar, why not take out Dickens' precious manuscript? I will meet dubious hooligans on the banks of the Thames, why not take my precious Dickens manuscript? <br /> <br /> Crapola. <br /> <br /> Terrible. To avoid.
