Maybe here in Sydney, we are all nightmarish and as a result we have the chance to knock ourselves out like in this s-eek movie! -In refined theaters. Released here in 1980, this hilarious, tar drama was greeted with howls of joy during the session I attended. In fact, the audience was so excited about the silly jokes on the screen that it sounded like a session of Rocky Horror. In less than 5 minutes, we all knew it was a disaster: the tug scene where we can see the buckets of water deported. After that, it was every customer for himself and the movie sounded advice, applauding the bad actors and the deplorable reactions. Shooting in the hold between crates is particularly silly and allows drunk viewers with friends in modified states to also watch to contribute appropriately. I call these movies with Michael Caine his holiday home movies because I still think he agrees to do them because he has seen a house he likes and does not want to spend his savings. Like Jaws 3 or 4 or whatever it's called.
