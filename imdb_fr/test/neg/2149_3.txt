Hell to Pay was a disappointment. It was nothing like the substance of a B Western film and should in no way be compared to a fantasy film like Silverado. The dialogue was dull, the plot was torpid, the soundtrack was excessively useless and the acting was awful. Even professionals could have taken lessons from the Sunset Carson School of Acting. The only positive thing about this movie is that it has featured some of the country's best cowboy shooters, but you can see them in a better light in any SASS video. The packaging of this feature makes it very attractive, and the preview is correct, but everything is finished afterwards.
