Am I the only one to notice that the "realism" of the 19th century ship is wrong. In fact, it is a fifteenth century, around 1620, if I remember correctly, because the "realistic" ship in the film is the Mayflower. As far as I know, the Mayflower NEVER went to Australia or even tried a trip to Australia. I do not know who managed the R & D for this film, but I use the Mayflower and I hope nobody will notice it is a bad job. <br /> <br /> They even printed it on the jacket and on the DVD. I wonder how other people have noticed this small mistake? Not to mention that the movie itself was just awful, I would expect better from Sam Neill.
