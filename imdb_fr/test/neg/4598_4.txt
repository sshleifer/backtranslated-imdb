About twenty years ago, Charles Bukowski was one of my heroes. I blindly accepted the image created by intellectual types and seen in various films. Of course, I have never met the intellectual types who prescribed Bukowski as a hero. They can usually be found safely behind the counter in hipster video stores and record stores. These people barely spoke, and when asked a question, sneered and bowed their heads in a vague direction. They were useless for locating a specific title, but their shelves were always filled with strange and unique titles. To be inducted into the secret hipster club, I thought I would have to give up my bourgeois education and marry the counterculture. <br /> <br /> My introduction to Bukowski began with the movie Barfly, the late eighties movie that played Mickey Rourke and Faye Dunnaway. I was a fan of Rourke at the time. He has also embodied a kind of modern male fantasy anti-hero, a dark intellectual type. At the time, I liked it. The hero of Barfly made fun of the convention. A tramp in the mid-thirties, who lives without connection, does not respond to anyone, and who wants to be recognized as a genius by a very hot literary snob, the icing on the cake. Then I read Post Office and Hollywood, the latter being Bukowski's opinion of his experience of the film. Now, let me quickly return to the latest film based on Bukowski's book, Factotum, which I read and appreciated. Bukowski takes the form of Chinaski in this novel. I often wonder where Bukowski ended and where Chinaski started. 20 years after Barfly, the fiction film Bukowski is still the same. I watched about an hour of the movie and I have not seen any signs of cracking the facade yet. This is why Factotum Bukowski was my hero. Chinaski is beautiful (played by Matt Dillon). He has clean, neat, stylish hair, but not on top. When Dillon smokes and writes, he looks cool. Chinaski goes from job to job, ignoring and / or fighting with different bosses. He fucks two fiances, which he lives with one of them, goes away, to come back with little repercussion. Chinaski is his own man and we never see him emotionally. It's an archetype of James Dean sterile, one-dimensional, 30 something. Factotum is to the spectator. To do this, he harangues the idea of ​​a man (a writer) without consequence. A poor man who suffers for his art. What could be cooler than that? Now, let's say that Factotum contains some truths, namely that the events took place. What is missing from the public is the pain that envelops Chinaski's existence. Perhaps the goal of this film, and most of the movies, is that for 80 minutes, we must escape a world full of consequences and pain and adopt by proxy an anti-social smoker who smokes, speak, drink with freshness. One who rejects the classic behaviors of work and family. My hero was Movie Bukowski. A long time ago, it would have worked. It was easier then. Now, I have not claimed a hero yet. Things are not so easy. Hipster logic and counterculture icon film renderings offer no solution or even questions.
