Poor Bela Lugosi. Just another day at work. A group of saboteurs trying to disrupt the American war effort from the inside. It's pretty hard to understand at first because, although we know these guys are preparing something, the way they work is just not very clear. I will not spoil it, but the end is pretty amazing. There is a series of murders perpetrated by our hero. A police force that does not know what's going on. What a coincidence that all the victims seem to come and go from the same house. There are comments like "A true patriot would do this or that." It is obvious that if suspicions abound, most people would not know a spy or a subversive if he jumped on them and bit them. I was also surprised to see Clayton Moore (the Lone Ranger) in a romantic role. I never realized that he had never done anything but sit on horseback. There is of course the sufficiency of criminals who think they are safe from the murderer's guest list. Anyway, Bela is kind of a good guy and a bad guy in one. The best scene of the movie is at the end, but I will not spoil it. As curiosity and as a period piece, it can be fun to watch for some people.
