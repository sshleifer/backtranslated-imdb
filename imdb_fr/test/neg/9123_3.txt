I really do not think producer George Lucas has really decided to make a sequel as horrible as "More American Graffiti". But, in retrospect, it was the first crack in his armor that seemed so impenetrable. Coming directly from the huge success of "American Graffiti" and produced essentially at the same time as "Star Wars", this film is the first film that Lucas managed to make disappear from Coppola without having to bother to direct it himself . The result is typical of Lucas - much more interesting from the point of view of the structure and the way it is edited than the actual material. Writer / director Bill Norton was allowed to use various screen ratios and split screens to produce strange associations in the images. Although it is interesting to see ironic juxtapositions of the four lines of the story, the style ultimately represents only the fractured nature of the film itself. <br /> <br /> Lucas's brilliant original film only spoke of a group of friends on the "last big night" archetype before the end of class and Kurt (Ron Dreyfuss) and Steve (Ron Howard) are supposed to go to college. One thing that made this movie work, despite the fact that it's very episodic, is that you have the main characters together at the beginning and end up at the end. There is a disposition of time, as in Nick Ray's "Rebel Without a Cause", in which some time becomes very elastic and takes more meaning than a specific time in real life, but everything happens in a space static. "More American Graffiti" is basically the opposite - the space is very dynamic, with Toad (Charles Martin Smith) in Vietnam, his former girlfriend Debbie (Candy Clark) partying with hippies in San Francisco, Steve and Laurie ( Cindy Williams) involved in student demonstrations at Berkeley and John Miler (Paul Le Mat) on drag racing on the semi-professional circuit. In an artificial meeting at the beginning of the film, all the principles are there to watch John's race, but after that, the threads do not get close and do not weave as they are in the original. Instead, they separated and we followed the characters for about three years. We attended various events on New Year's Eve in 1967, 68 and 69. It's easy for the public to get confused, and I think it's fair to say we do. While the original film seemed to condense important events and rites of passage into an unrealistic theatrical time that produced a nostalgic experience even for those who had never experienced these events, this sequel draws and extends the few points of the plot. from the epilogue of the original and try to make a coherent film. <br /> <br /> The best parts of the film are those with Candy Clark (SF) and Charles Martin Smith (Nam). Some jokes fall flat, but the style of these sections is interesting and they contrast sharply. A good movie might have been made if these parts were just a little better and the other parts were not that bad. Speaking of dragster, the whole plot with Milner, who was talking to a student in exchange for foreign currency, was really lame, not funny, and throwing Mackenzie Phillips as a cameo did not help at all. It was just another artificial moment, when they briefly explain why Curt is not in the movie because he's already in Canada. Instead, Laurie just has another brother who is basically identical to Curt, but who has a different name and is now played by a very boring actor. There is a kind of black satire to some elements of Vietnam, very similar to what I could have imagined at the origin of the original idea of ​​Apocalypse Now by Lucas and John Milius. And there's some of that manic fun in the San Francisco scenes that made the first movie fun. But always with these fun things, you have the rest of the movie dragged, as if someone wanted to see Steve and Laurie arguing in their horrible suburban home as if they were auditioning for a Spielberg movie about divorce and abandonment children. I think that even if these parts of the movie were not so painful, it would still not be comparable to the first movie because there is no closing and no sense of reconciliation or someone having learned something. It sort of ends when they ran out of money or something, a cheap imitation of the frozen image of "Two-Lane Blacktop" and so many better movies. <br /> <br /> Like the original, this film has an excellent period soundtrack that is probably worthy of being owned for its own sake and makes the film almost acceptable. Country Joe and the Fish's performances are excellent, and Scott Glenn pretends to be a hippie in love with Candy Clark. It's a sight to behold. I even wonder if at the time he had to use a wig? I could not recommend this movie, and yet it has a small affection in my heart because I like the original so much. Every two decades, I guess I have to try this film to make sure it's really as useless as I remember. It's a party killer but it's something that all fans of "American Graffiti" or George Lucas in general will want to see at least once or twice. This shows how much effort can go into something and it can still be pretty half-cooked. It makes you think how much it is a miracle that Lucas made a film as good as "American Graffiti", as if all the elements were in place and all the appropriate gods had been appeased. Unfortunately, this was not the case for this film or Bill Norton.
