I acquired this movie a few years ago and trying to find information about it, I discovered that even the powerful IMDb had not listed it. That's all I needed to know. <br /> <br /> With Friends Like These is an anthology that presents itself as a collection of second-rate episodes of Twilight Zone / Outer Limits, all connected by a bus ride that never really seems to make the connection with the rest of the movie. Of the three stories, the only one I can derive from entertainment value is the second episode in which a man (of a kind) develops from the bacteria in a type refrigerator. This episode earns points for some humor spots and its weird premises. Apart from that, there is an episode with a talking car (bland and without direction) and an episode in which a girl visits a very unique dating agency (my dog ​​guessed the end of it). <br /> <br /> mentioned in other comments, the score of 18 is totally unjustified. There is nothing to offend here. If you're looking for a good horror anthology, try Asylum or Creepshow movies instead.
