Cujo is a giant, kind, gentle and affectionate Saint Bernard who belongs to the Camber family. During the opening sequence, Cujo chases a rabbit over fields and through a local wood, somewhere in Castle Rock, Maine. The rabbit disappears into a burrow and Cujo pokes his head into the hole. The rabbit disappears from the sight of Cujo. Angry Cujo begins to bark and, in doing so, inadvertently wakes up and interferes with a colony of bats, one of which bites him in the face. Donna Trenton (Dee Wallace-Stone as Dee Wallace) has an affair with Steve Kemp (Christopher Stone, Dee Wallace's husband) that her husband, Vic (Daniel Hugh Kelly), who works in advertising, discovers. Obviously, their relationship becomes tense. Fortunately, they are unaware of all this, their young son Tad (Danny Pintauro). Joe Camber (Ed Lauter) repairs cars to make a living in the barn on his farm. Joe prepares a weekend of boys with one of his friends, Gary Pervier (Mills Watson), when his wife Charity (Kaiulani Lee) wins $ 5000 in the lottery and decides to take his young boy Brett (Billy Jayne in the role of Billy Jacoby). to see his parents. Arrived at Gary's home to look for him, Joe finds him dead on the ground, he goes to the kitchen to ask for help and his dog Cujo, who is now enraged, attacks him and kills him. Donna and Tad go to Camber Farm to try to have her car repaired. The place is deserted, with the exception of Cujo who is now completely enraged, foamy in the mouth, her fur stained with blood and made mad with pain. Cujo attacks the car to try to join Donna and Tad. Fortunately for them, the windows are good, at least for the moment. Donna tries to start the car but she is completely down, they are both trapped with nothing but the hope that someone will come to save them. Cujo is on the lookout, ready to attack and kill anyone who crosses it. Directed by Lewis Teague, I thought the movie was a little slow for my taste. The first half is moving forward, the second half is gaining momentum, but I still felt it was a bit disappointing and uninteresting. The acting is good for everyone, I do not complain. Technically, the film is OK, photography, music, special effects, editing and it's usually done well. The big problem is the scenario of Don Carlos Dunaway and Lauren Currier and especially his first half, most of which seems to pad to lengthen the execution time. Arriving at a little under 90 minutes, it seemed to me that it lasted longer. It's also a bit predictable. Cujo as a monster has never really frightened me either, I do not think that overweight overweight St. Bernards scares me, I guess. I suppose there is nothing wrong with that, but I do not think I would be in a hurry to see him again. Average, not so bad if you can find a cheap copy or catch it on T.V for free.
