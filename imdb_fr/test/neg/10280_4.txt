I have always wanted to see ELECTRA GLIDE IN BLUE for a very long time. I have always been intrigued by the title, the star and the desert, but for some reason (now quite clear), this film is never shown on television or I miss it if ever. Well, after watching the DVD, I now know why the movie is rarely shown: it's because it's not very good. In fact, I would say it's a bit of a mess. <br /> <br /> ELECTRA GLIDE IN BLUE was created by a new director and it shows. The film is mainly a series of vignettes, absolutely nothing holds it back. It's more like a collection of short, random movies. The film can be summarized as follows: intro (murder); cop and girlfriend together; introductory credits; the cops go to work; a fool tells a story; the cop finds a corpse; cop, chef and girlfriend at the bar; hunting scene; etc. The scenes just do not go together. They are very distinctly independent of each other and because of this, the characterization is weak, amateurish limit. The scene at the bar with the girlfriend, the scene on the farm with the hippies, the scene with Big John and the chef screaming at each other were worthy of recognition. I almost stopped the movie during these (terrible) moments. <br /> <br /> The filmmaker's lack of experience is evident throughout the film. The style, as in the 1970s, is omnipresent. The scene of the intro credit gives the film a commercial aspect for the forces of the order. Then he tries to become a boyfriend movie (Big John and Zipper), then a mystery murder. then a melodramatic love story; etc. A film does not necessarily need a particular style to succeed, but I'm afraid the style of ELECTRA GLIDE IN BLUE has been confused. You can clearly see that the director had no idea what he was doing or what he was going to do with it. <br /> <br /> The film is not a complete disaster. Although the content of ELECTRA GLIDE IN BLUE is almost amateurish, its appearance is extremely (and misleading) professional. The cinematography is beautiful. Each frame is worthy of an exhibition in an art gallery. Or because the first (and last) director was involved in the music business, worthy of an album cover. The beautiful appearance of the film gives more credibility to the finished product than it really deserves. And thanks to the game of Robert Blake (whose character is very poorly written), the film retains a certain realism, even if nothing else makes sense. What is remarkable about the appearance and composition of the film is that it has been copied and duplicated a million times. The intro credits reminded me of something like TOP GUN, which was created 13 years later. The scenes of Johnny getting dressed, with his clothes on the bed, made me think of American Gigolo. Oddly, ELECTRA GLIDE IN BLUE has a very contemporary look, thanks to stunning graphics, even if the story and the philosophy behind it are desperately out of date. <br /> <br /> Thus, ELECTRA GLIDE IN BLUE is, on the one hand, a remarkably underestimated and neglected film, because it obviously influenced many future filmmakers with regard to the look and the composition. Very few films can claim to have achieved this goal and legendary filmmaker Conrad Hall should take full advantage of it. But, on the other hand, EGIB is also legitimately forgotten because its mediocre characters, its confusing story and its confused orientation do not deserve to be recalled.
