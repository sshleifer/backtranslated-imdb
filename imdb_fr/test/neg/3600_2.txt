This comes from an adult who came across the first who was expecting a movie for children and who was surprised at the adult humor that was in the Emperor New Groove. The character I loved most was Kronk, so I was delighted to hear about the sequel (sp) not presenting anything other than "Kronk". <br /> <br /> I just watched Kronk's new groove, it took me two days because I had to close it, I got so bored in the middle. I finally watched the rest of the movie the next day and, unfortunately, the second part was as lame as the first. <br /> <br /> Being a Disney movie, I was expecting some music scenes, but this one was filled with them and they were not fun. The great thing I found about the New Groove Emperor is that it could be enjoyed by a wide audience, from toddlers to adults. In all honesty, Kronks New Groove did not do anything for me or my girlfriend and we both loved the first one. It is really aimed at young children, the comedy is rather childish, the music scenes are not very well done and the plot itself is extremely cheesy. <br /> <br /> Save money and rent this movie if possible certainly not worthy of a second viewing. I was extremely disappointed and shocked by the way this film was assembled. In fact, they managed to make a character (Kronk) not funny in this film, which is amazing in itself. <br /> <br /> Obviously, every opinion is different, but I am very easily amused, I usually like the suites (sp) even when others discredit it, mainly because I liked so much the first one, j needed more characters and no matter the plot, I would appreciate the movie. I can not say as much for this one, I would never have thought of stopping it halfway because of pure boredom. <br /> <br /> Buy at your own risk.
