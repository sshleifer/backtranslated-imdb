It's hard to believe that Oprah Winfrey produced this piece of junk. The show could not even hold a candle to past cooking shows, including emeril lagasse, rachael ray is the most annoying TV talk show ever since Ainsley Harriott had a dreadful kitchen host that I seen, at least Ainsley Harriott has good times and style, this one has no style, she's terrible as a host, the food is atrocious, the writing is awful, the TV is above and the opening credits are so bad that it makes me sick. Now I enjoy cooking shows that have a good sense of style, but that's absolutely nothing. <br /> <br /> This is one of the worst TVs of the year.
