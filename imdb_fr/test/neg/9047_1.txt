A gore snore. I saw this piece of horrible, stinking, worthless, junk at the Cameo Movie House (now the famous Crobar Nightclub) on Washington Avenue in South Beach in 1980 or '81. I was 17, and my three friends and I laughed horrible, raw, trash. The theater was on its last legs and there were mostly drunkards who snored and slept instead. They did not miss anything. The worst actor of all time. These actors deserve the Academy Award for the worst, and I mean the worst acting roles in the history of cinema. Joke was, the theater was showing another Mi Mi Lay (a big name at least!) Stinker ... Barf city. Enough said. If you are under 12, you may have some chills. After 12 years, you snore after the opening credits. It's just amazing that someone spent a penny to make this movie. And to say that it is considered a classic "cult". YUK !!!!
