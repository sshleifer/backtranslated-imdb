Bruno en Petites Couperes by Daniel Auteuil is a middle-aged model of his Pierre in Christian Vincent's separation from 10 years ago. In both films, young people's trust in left-wing ideology and love (mutual metaphors) collapse into paranoia - manifesting themselves as an aggression trapped in Peter's and a desperately comical woman in the most recent Bruno. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately for fans of Auteuil, the actor became dependent on uniform wear (like his compatriot Johnny Hallyday in The Man of the Train Leconte). This is not the case and it becomes rather frustrating as the film moves on. Pascal Bonitzer does not help as a writer / project director. His sequence of episodes covered with a symbolism of connection does not hide the lack of rhythm of the film. I was particularly furious that the incredibly dramatic / romantic Grenoble backdrops were made almost superfluous by a cameraman who shivered visibly in the cold. <br /> <br /> Krisitn Scott Thomas almost saves the show with his female counterpart Bruno, BÃ©atrice Elle stages Bruno's vertiginous contradictions in a character of increasing complexity to the point of becoming surreal. Bonitzer can not stand that, however, and the late plot asks Beatrice to equalize herself in another bourgeois model. In doing so, Bonitzer shows that he refuses the Academy of Oscars to Scott Thomas. <br /> <br /> The submersion of all the characters in the bourgeoisie can be a viable and even tragic result, but in this case it is an escape from the pace. (unlike the brutal and painful denouement of La Separation). A serious disappointment, 4/10.
