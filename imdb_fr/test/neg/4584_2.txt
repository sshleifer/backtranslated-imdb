They took a story dear to the hearts of Edinburgh residents, a true story and changed it as Hollywood had done before. The end result is a film, however, well done for those who do not know the story but are totally different and inaccurate. The original film of this story that Walt Disney oversaw himself was using the dog of the breed that was crucial to this story and did not claim that John Gray had anything special, he was a poor Shepard who had died in poverty at the hostel. If you love history, watch Disney's original for a better comforting story. It's a shame, the actors and the potential was there for a great remake of a classic tale. Read the book for an exact recurrence of the story. And if you really like it, you can visit the real Kirkyard in Edinburgh.
