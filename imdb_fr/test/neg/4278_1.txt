For all those who read this book, Fanny Price ends up becoming his own wife, a beautiful woman ... with a brain. The Touzel seems to take medicine. Terrible game, she just ruined it! Henry is a bit tall for his character. He is also too effeminate. Mary Crawford is brilliant. Edmond is a little too old. Mrs. Norris is hysterical - OK, this casting decision works. Rushworth is also perfect. Yates also seems too effeminate. But, Le Touzel is simply horrible. This is not a good character for her. Poor Fanny! I would recommend this film only because it contains an almost complete textual account of the language used by Austen in the novel. The 1999 version is a lot more fun but terribly incomplete. If they could redo this version with an actress better suited to Fanny, it would be fabulous!
