It's amazing that a film can take so much time and effort while remaining awful. For those of you who appreciate the tedious special effects and inconceivable details in every shot, you will watch this film with wonder. Simply because Predator Island contains none of this. This is a redundant remake of all the horror monster movies of the last two decades. Now, I enjoy bad horror movies, they have a certain amount of humor in the most dramatic circumstances. However, if your goal is to create a memorable work that will be swallowed up in the Worship Hall of Fame, my first suggestion is to find some imagination / creativity and find talent. Oh, and a few more dollars to put in your picture. <br /> <br /> A horror film tradition has been shocking the public with violent and bloody deaths. However, the shock does not hold water for more than a few seconds. In order to elicit a satisfactory reaction from the paying crowd, certain characters, certain identifiable traits, must be developed. I know, you're probably saying that this guy does not provide anything clever to the filmmakers, he's just saying an amateur comment. This shows how much these filmmakers are amateurs. <br /> <br /> Despite the horrors of watching this movie, there was a positive side. Dan Gordon's performance as Chris is magnificent. He is not given anything to work in a scenario and yet, he is able to come out of this movie looking like a star. Of all the actors, he is the only one to believe in what he recites. It not only provides the public with a person we can identify with, but we also have someone we can not wait to see so we can get through the rest of the film. Gordon has a real talent and the ability to do quality work and overcome a huge hurdle - the rest of the cast. Dan Gordon will be a star, hopefully sooner than later. That is, if he can escape movies like this that will hold him back.
