I caught La Bandara because it brought together Jean Gabin and Julien Duvivier, whose Pepe le Moko is a black masterpiece. I'm going to give him some points because Gabin is there, but the clumsy plot, the inexpensive sets and the ridiculous Annabella doing as an Arab princess put the film on my display "to sell". If you look at it, you will wonder why idiots did not build the fort around the well, instead of mortals a few meters away. And why use tin roofs in the middle of the desert? But by then, the pure perversity of the ingenuity that composes the script should make you unresponsive to any later thought.
