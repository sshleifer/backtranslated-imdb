I was watching the science fiction channel when this pile of steaming shit arrived. Although not as bad as Wynorski's "Curse of Komodo", it still sucks ... BAD. Wynorski uses the same island as in "The Curse of Komodo", as well as the same actors and the same house. The effects are top (surprising) but that's about all ........ I do not know what else to say about this movie ....... oh yeah! As in "The Curse of Komodo", the government intervenes and decides to bomb the island! Also .... when I saw this part, I laughed hysterically ... A KOMANBRA !!! (man part, komodo and cobra!). Overall, this movie is shit, even on bad movie standards. Remember that if Jim Wynorski had nothing to do with a movie, avoid falling asleep, repeat: "It's almost over ... it's almost over ..." 0 out of 5.
