I wanted to love this movie, but there is very little to like. It starts with Jean Stapleton and a song by Randy Newman in Iowa (Iowa, I guess), reminiscent of Norman Lear's Cold Turkey, one of the best films ever made, according to people on IMDb. So far, so good. And the idea of ​​archangel Michael living at the Pansy Milbank motel on earth? Well, let yourself be tempted, it's supposed to be a comedy. Ok, so far, so good. But Michael does things that a fallen angel would never do, and that destroys all the credibility of the film. The other characters in the movie do not have much appeal either. Michael brings a dog back to life, and we are supposed to be impressed by that. People make up nerdy country songs. Finally, Stapleton dances with Travolta. Big deal. If she was smart, she would not even be in this movie. When it was over, I thought, "Oh, what a stupid, tasteless, boring, old-fashioned movie, sacrilege!" It's not worth seeing by children or anyone else.
