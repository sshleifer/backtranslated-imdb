The parody genre, which lacks creativity and humor for some time now, is still spit on by hackers without talent. No point, no pleasure, no originality; a few cheap dollars for filmmakers. <br /> <br /> We must do more than simply reference recent films and give characters a double meaning to be satire; making people laugh. Any mound can take a cam-corder, and having friends who act badly in cheap costumes imitate someone. Given that the genre is this time the inspiring sports movies, some lame references have been launched: the jokes are so weak that the characters must actually focus on references in different ways, to make you laugh at hysterical way. It does not work. <br /> <br /> This is not comedy. However, the same old worn-out and sophomoric "jokes" torn from college toilets (even more bland than usual) are all here. If that's not enough, there's a "gag" bus that gets someone to go. So funny, right? In addition, a pathetically poor scene performs more product placements than Michael Bay; again with the same funny results. A piece of music flops miserably. Pity Carl Weathers, once Apollo Creed in the Rocky series, now stuck to such challenging roles as this one. <br /> <br /> Nobody beyond words. Watching a marathon run the marathon would be less tedious than watching this movie. Probably a lot more funny too.
