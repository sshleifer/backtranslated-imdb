I decided to watch this show and try my luck, but I found it boring and, above all, boring ... Dull. <br /> <br /> There is far too much sarcasm and the characters are all boring. there's a lot of talk and the character Lorelai ... keeps talking over and over again ... During the second look, we had the impression of choking the characters, the jokes were not working and the whole thing of love and romance just ruins what is already a shitty show .... I can not believe that this show has survived after the pilot .... This seems to be a show that forces the line "Listen to your parents Â».... There is no real drama .... <br /> <br /> It would have been necessary to remain pilot ..... and pilot alone ...
