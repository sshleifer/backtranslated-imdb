I just finished watching this movie and I must say it was a good movie. I liked some of the good guys and I loved the killer robot, but the movie had some holes in it. <br /> <br /> the names of the people who were there was a little ... stupid ... I think people should sue the director of this film for his lame state at the end ... the first half hour was good but then he dragged on again and again I was happy..it was over ... but I still loved the killer robot and some of the good guys in the movie. <br /> <br /> I think it was the best money I ever spent because do like a stupid B-movie like this and go .. it's a b-movie everyone .
