I have always had this morbid curiosity when it comes to notoriously bad and unpopular films. I've also always liked the "bad, it's good" movies, looking for someone who really loves new children's movies filled with cheese like Catwoman and Thunderbirds (2004). <br /> It turned out that all critics are right about this one. It's a MAJOR flop, but unlike a lot of fiasco, it's not even nice at all levels, not even to make fun of it. It's just a boring grin after another all the way through. <br /> <br /> I had been warned. I did not listen. I'm stupid. <br /> <br /> Do not be a fool, do not waste your time and money on this pile of garbage.
