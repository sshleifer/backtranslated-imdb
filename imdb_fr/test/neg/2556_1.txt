Like the previous commentator of this movie, I, too, found myself in tears during this movie. Sometimes, one wonders how a film of such horror is born. From the first moment our protagonist woke up in his New York apartment to a dream of metros intertwined with galloping horses (which the Irish emigrant did not have that one), it is clear that we are in trouble. And things are not much better. <br /> <br /> In Ireland, in the 1950s, we enter a world where everyone speaks without intonation and exclusively on the theme of the Irish Civil War. Schoolchildren go to school to learn about the civil war. The pub drinkers are divided according to their allegiances of the civil war. Commemorations are celebrated for those who died during the civil war. The city is divided between those who believe we should remember and those who want to forget ... the civil war. Every look and every conversation is full of meaning that goes back to the Civil War. <br /> <br /> The introductory text on Broken Harvest's videoconference suggests that the film is a parable of the problems of modern Ireland. The only parallel that strikes me is that, nowadays, the conversation in Dublin is indeed dominated by one subject: real estate prices. If her intention is to give a glimpse of Ireland's obsession with her past, she fails miserably. It is striking to note that few Irish films have dealt with the Irish Civil War and its legacies. However, it will take a film much more subtle and intelligent than this one to tell us more about the lasting effects of such a traumatic event on the psyche of the nation. <br /> <br /> For American viewers who suggested the film evokes the Irish atmosphere of the 1950s: this is not the case. In the 1950s, Ireland was a hotbed of sexual repression and misery where young people fled en masse. However, there was more than one topic of conversation.
