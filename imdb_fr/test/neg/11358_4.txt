I'm a big fan of zombie movies and it's just a pathetic attempt. I find that the best features of zombie movies are the sense of solidarity and the need to survive. This film puts more emphasis on a vision of the type "it is enough to make it bloody". <br /> <br /> The film was filled with bad action and even worse effects. When the zombies emerge from the ground and shoot the guy, there is blood flowing out of the hole. I did not know that the holes in the floor of the planes were bleeding so much. And the original zombie lady, Kelly or something, posted the worst acting game I've ever seen when she woke up and started to feel sick. I laughed a lot when she died. He deserved it in every way. <br /> <br /> I was a bit puzzled as to why Dr. Kelly could speak after becoming a zombie, but no other zombie said anything because of screaming and annoying cries. And they seemed to kill the zombies quite effectively by shooting them in the abdomen. Yet when Dr. Bennett is thrown off the plane and into the engine, removing most of his lower half, he is still able to live in the end. <I had the feeling that they had changed things to create a "good" scene. When one of the girlfriends bitches (I did not take the time to learn their names they played a useless role) was in the bathroom, she was attacked by a zombie behind the mirror. Was it a one-way mirror to watch Mile-High Clubbers? I have never broken a mirror in a plane (bad luck and all that), but I doubt there's a lot of room behind, with the incredibly confined space of the bathroom and everything else. <br /> <br /> The few redeeming qualities were too little, too late, unfortunately. The film was aimed at flight attendants who smoked, but they felt the need to kill all but one member. And I'll admit that I laughed a lot when the old lady bit Frank's arm and said, "She's gum to death" or something. Honestly, I'm sad. lost my nine dollars on this movie. The fact that I bought it from a miner bought it a bit, but still ... it failed in many ways. Stay with the dawn of the dead and 28 days later.
