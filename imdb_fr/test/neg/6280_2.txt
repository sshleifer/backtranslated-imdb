Although "The War of the Worlds", or "The Time Machine", or any of his works, was read many decades ago by Mr. Wells, I believe they all unfolded in London or at least in England. This category "B" movie ("C"?) Happens in the eastern United States, like Orson Welles, an excellent adaptation to radio 67 years ago. However, this film does not present any of the qualities of the narrative style of the Mercury Playhouse program. Thomas Howell's vote would not be acceptable in most high school drama clubs. I was really embarrassed for him. He was rolling in the grass on the hill shouting "My family, my family" was almost laughable, as was his reaction to his brother's death. Of the three film versions of the story I saw, it was by far the worst, with Gene Barry's 1950 version being the best. Moreover, it was the first time I saw a "machine monster" dripping with sticky saliva, like the creature of "Alien".
