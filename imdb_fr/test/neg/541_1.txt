This ultra-low budget kitchen sink is the kind of film that can only be made in the UK, because anywhere else in the world, a market should exist before a green light is given. Most probably self-financing, it is clearly an attempt to solve important problems, but it ends up undermining its existence in the sense that one must ask who will never invest in distribution and, secondly, whether it will there is no public audit, buy or rent this movie, why would he care in the first place? My opinion may seem unfair to a filmmaker for the first time, but it is the kind of film that only undermines the commercial viability and quality standards that have just maintained a British film industry.
