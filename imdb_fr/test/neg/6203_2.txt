David Dhawan copied HITCH and such an unofficial copy. The film is not even as funny and funny as the original, it's boring, with forced stories like Lara's, having a child and no husband, plus a stupid Chota DON and David trying too to stifle the drama, but the film seems disjointed and boring. <br /> <br /> Songs have just been released, just as romance and all that excludes some amusing scenes of Govinda, the dance before the interval does not deserve to be mentioned are pretty funny but tend to be too long <br /> <br /> The direction of David is as bad as MAINE PYAAR KYUN KIYAA, he needs to change his style or to try something good The music saves grace, some songs are good the situations seem forced <br /> <br /> Govinda looks overweight and seems too loud and screams in the first reels, but he gets in motion and gives the best of himself in the office and in the scene with Salman in his cabin and towards the end. <br /> <br /> Salman is playing fair and his nasal tone plus his dummy play style is a headache <br /> <br /> Lara is preventable, Katrina is fake as usual <br /> <br />
