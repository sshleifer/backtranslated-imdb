The film's satirical website, Dateline Hollywood, joked that "Son of the Mask" was a joke star Jamie Kennedy played in New Line Cinema for her show "The Jamie Kennedy Experiment". If only. And if only the film had been half as funny as this satire. <br /> <br /> "The Mask" was the ideal vehicle for Jim Carrey, a facial adept that appeals to so many viewers; He also delighted men over 12 by introducing Cameron Diaz. So keeping track of both was not a good idea, and you would have thought that New Line would have learned their lesson after "Dumb and Dumberer: When Harry meets Lloyd." But no ... but to be fair, having a brand new cast is in keeping with the original comic (in which the mask went from owner to owner). As written by Lance Khazei and directed by Lawrence Guterman, however, there is nothing in return, apart from a steady stream of decent FX from the usual squadron of homes (Industrial Light and Magic improving the dancing baby " Ally McBeal "and their own" Baby's Day Out ", with Tippett Studio, Giant Killer Robots, Digital Dimension, etc.) and greater complacency towards cartoon fans by making our hero work in an animation company ( responsible for treasures such as "Siamese Popes"), naming his character named Tex Avery, and working in references not only to classic cartoons, but also to real clips. <br /> <br /> The problem is that this last approach does not really work, in part because most of the attempts to get the cartoon to live the action fall flat (especially cars going celebrate) and especially because the tributes to Flintstones, Woody Woodpecker, "Duck Amuck" and especially "One Froggy Evening" show how weak this film is in comparison. In addition, the film fits in the shambolic slapstick alongside a tense feeling (the underlying theme of the story is the family, our hero is not ready to have a son and his nemesis - Alan Cumming in the role of the Nordic god Loki - is far from being the apple of Odin Eye ... and what Bob Hoskins does here as Odin, even after "Super Mario Bros.", it's beyond me, and Kennedy is just not in the same league as Carrey in the shady stakes - although it's not like he gets help from the script. Also note that unlike Diaz, the very cute Traylor Howard (as the mother of the mask's son) does not have much to do; giving him the mask might have helped the film. <br /> <br /> He loses more points for throwing Cumming, Hoskins, Steven Wright and Magda Szubanski; for a suspiciously shortened running time (which would explain some scenes of parcel holes and gaping scenes that seem to be missing); and for an incredibly bad attempt at inner joking when our hero fails to sell the "green guy" concept as an animated television series - "The Mask" has become a lively television series in real life and was far better to follow up than this suite. The fact that it really opened in Britain before the US did not tell you anything ... with this title and "Blade: Trinity", New Line seems intent on conquering the market on terrible sequels with members of the cast of "Two Guys And A Girl". "And then," The butterfly effect 2 "with Nathan Fillion? <br /> <br /> Someone stops it.
