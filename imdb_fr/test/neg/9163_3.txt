When I finally saw this movie recently, it turned out that it was exactly what it looked like at first ... again a Hollywood movie based on a remake of a band established cartoon. Nothing special or memorable. Designed in all ways to appeal to very young children and very young adults, it makes extensive use of comic devices such as farts, poop, and the size of the buttocks of Theodore. <br /> <br /> This movie would bother me a lot less if it was not an obvious step for the Chipmunks. Even their characters I found were changed for the worse for this movie. While in the past each of them had a distinct personality, they all behaved like immature, malignant, ADD children, bouncing erratically on the walls. It bothered me especially to see Simon portrayed this way ... He's supposed to be the smart and serious nerd who behaves like a "straight man" to Alvin's crazy antics. But here, it's pretty much a carbon copy of Alvin. A joke in the movie even implies that Simon * think * only * that he * is intelligent but that he really is not ... and honestly, if I had never heard of the Chipmunks before seeing this movie, I would have accepted. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this film is just another obvious proof of money seizure, and I'm really sorry it was even shot. The fact that it's a "children's" movie does not excuse its flaws ... Excuse a stupid movie that degrades a classic franchise just because it's for kids is insulting to kids, and any kid would deserve something more intelligent than this film.
