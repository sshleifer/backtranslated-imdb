There is so much to say about this film and so little is good! <br /> <br /> The plot has enough holes to sink the Titanic, the characters are completely unbelievable, the monsters are so unrealistic, and I'm sick and tired of seeing movies in which an ex-husband and a ex-wife are thrown together in a bizarre emergency - this happens far too often in the movies and it has become another bad shot. <br /> <br /> I find it hard to believe that anyone would have invested 1 dollar to do this trash, do not worry about 100 dollars or more, it must cost. <br /> <br /> You could make a better movie with more convincing special effects on your home computer! I did not think movies could get so bad! Avoid it at all costs - do something more fun and enjoyable, like getting a tooth or an enema!
