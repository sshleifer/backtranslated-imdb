Dude, is it ugly. Rebecca DeMornay is a highly disciplined police psychiatrist who fell in love with the legendary Antonio Banderas in a wine shop, ponytail and prison tattoos. When she emerges, she really clears herself. Apart from this hot case she has (and we must admit that this case has slowed down), she is a pretty cold fish. Her sick and afflicted father shows up for the first time in years and puts him out. She is also adept at keeping her excited neighbor on the top floor (Dennis Miller) at bay. And there is Harry Dean Stanton, the prisoner, who is trying to trick him into the diagnosis of multiple personality disorder so that he does not get caught up in the secrecy of the serial murders he committed. <br /> <br /> All these people, and maybe more, are immediately suspected when strange things begin to happen to him. Someone sends him dead flowers. Someone does unspeakable things to his cat. (The next time I see a pet arrive in a parcel or be hung in the closet or boiled in a saucepan, I will throw up.) So who does it? To guess. No power on earth could force me to reveal the end, but perhaps one clue will help: the abuses committed during childhood. <br /> <br /> The excuse of abuse is an interesting case in itself, much more interesting than the film. What does "youth abuse" mean? Do we want to talk about sexual abuse? Physical? Both? Why not hit a child's back with a wooden spoon, strong enough to break it? That's what happened to me and my brother when we were kids, in the same way that similar things happened to all the other errant boys in the neighborhood. Sexual abuse? As far as I know, this has never happened to us, although I'm not sure it would have been rejected with any degree of animation. In the Samoan village where I studied for two years, a case of teenager was caught playing sexually with a much younger girl. The girl's family beat him to death. The boy's own family sent him to live with another branch of the family in another village, an exile that lasted two years. By the time of his return, everyone, including the child, had forgotten the incident. (By the way, the little girl we see here is less than five years old, so it's unlikely that she'll remember Dad's nighttime visits, because long-term memory is not really established before that time.) DeMornay's experience that led to his mental disorder can be called "the social construction of trauma". It's not there unless we put it there. Enough of the psychiatric conference. It will be fifteen cents. <br /> <br /> You want a trauma? I will give you a trauma. The film absolutely obliges us to identify with the character of Rebecca DeMornay, from the beginning. Then, when she has her first date with Antonio Banderas, and the score of Pio Donnagio hammers us eroticism, the camera gives us a shot over his shoulder Antonio, the naked torso, which crawls on us with his hairy chest. Now, it's traumatic. Any male spectator feels as if he is lying on the floor in the laundry room of the California Men's Colony in San Luis Obispo. Do not mistake yourself. I do not like Antonio Banderas. It's just that I'm not in love with him. There are not enough naked shots of Rebecca DeMornay's elf body in the universe to compensate for this type of anxiety. <br /> <br /> Here is an interesting way to survive this movie. Instead of sitting around doing nothing, try to choose the scenes that were filmed in Toronto and separate them from those filmed in Budapest. It's a challenge, and can, as far as we know, preserve your mental health.
