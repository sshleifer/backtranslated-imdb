It is a film that has attracted the interest or praise it has simply received for its role of lesbian interest. The performances are usually emotionless compared to better movies in the GLBT interest genre. The suspicion of whether and when family members of partners will say something discouraging about their lesbian relationship will garner all the observable value of the film. The best part of the film is probably the beautiful landscape of New England, although much of the film takes place indoors. It is hard to imagine how a viewer watching this film without trying to assert his GLBT lifestyle or wanting to see the others claiming, even through a poorly realized drama, could significantly appreciate Treading Water. It's a terrible movie.
