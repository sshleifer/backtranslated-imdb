"El Chupacabra", one of the latest films from York Entertainment (disaster), excels by giving envy to its viewer to die after spending two hours lost watching it. This film seems to have been filmed with a spare camcorder normally used for birthday parties. The only reason I could say that was not the case was because of certain scenes where the cameraman's shadow is in the frame. <br /> <br /> Almost every aspect of cinema is in the grip of this movie, and I'm sure of it. that this has delayed the film industry by ten years. The actors are at the limit of the pace, stopping often while waiting for the change of the memory card displayed on the screen. The actor who plays Navarro not only insults and ignores word in his dialogue, but stumbles into the Swiss cheese plot with a narrowed and confused look on his face. Other actors break the wall and show overall the acting talent of a twelve-year-old child who carries out a scientific project in his garden. <br /> <br /> My friends and I are deliberately looking for the worst movies possible, and this one has given us more than we have negotiated. Humorous roles are not funny and the rest are riddled with horrible clich√©s and plots. As a friend so humbly said, this film is the aborted fetus of the industry. I strongly suggest this film to people like me who are looking for these films on purpose, but for all the others, beware!
