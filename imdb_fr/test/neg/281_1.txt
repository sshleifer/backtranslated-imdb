I felt compelled to write about this movie after joining IMDb because I thought it was the worst scriptwriting I've seen in a while. <br /> <br /> The game / direction / other areas of the film are fantastic. I love Brad Pitt with George Clooney. It works. The spiritual joke was still there since the first movie. My question is how in the world have they left this script out of the writing process? I thought that not only was the plot developing like a slug race to the end of the sidewalk, but that turn? (May I call him that) was so stupidly stupid that I wanted to go for a refund at the box office. I have never felt so used and used a movie of my life. Here, I was expecting something similar to the first movie (good chemistry, good acting, good direction, incredible plot), but I realized that they took my 8 dollars and went mocked. <br /> <br /> What makes me still understand is that this film has now reported more than 125 million dollars. <br /> <br /> In summary, I had the impression that this film had insulted my intelligence. I always feel like the only part that the writers focused on was a bit with Julia Roberts acting like Julia Roberts. This film made me sad and angry.
