I like all types of movies, so this is not a hit for the romantic movies of a guy who only likes Matrix, etc., etc. <br /> <br /> I thought it was an ugly film. I do not think there were enough characters to fall in love. They were there for a few days and, as they faced a hurricane and major problems in their lives, Richard Gere and Diane Lane were madly helpless and helpless? It's not realistic This movie did not encourage me to adhere to it and feel it emotionally, and that's something you're looking for in a good script. An emotional link. If anyone can understand that they fall in love so quickly, without real substance, it's the same. You are neither right nor wrong. Different shots for different people. <br /> <br /> Another very incredible element of the film is Diane Lane's very impolite daughter, who became a teenager and was sympathetic at the end of the film. A teenager who is also miserable and exasperated by her mother for not coming back with her deceitful husband will she just have a switch turned on and be kind? This film, in a few words, had big names, but for me it was a big disappointment.
