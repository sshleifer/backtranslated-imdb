A bad movie ... a terrible plot, based on the character of Bolo Yeung, but he may speak about twenty words throughout the film and has only one fight scene - still in good shape considering the fact that He was also in the kung fu classic "Enter The Dragon" Interesting to see William Zabka ("Johnny" of The Karate Kid) in another role in the martial arts.
