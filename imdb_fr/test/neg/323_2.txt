Ugh. Very awful. <br /> <br /> Linnea Quigley is the star, but her character is not important. Who is his character supposed to be anyway, aunt of the little boy? Another user commented on his nudity in a shower scene. Although there was a shower scene in the film, it was a bullet in the head and shoulders. Maybe there are other versions of this movie. <br /> <br /> Quigley, however, has a larger role than John Carradine, Cameron Mitchell and Brinke Stevens. Carradine appears briefly in a monkite robe reciting a vague dialogue. No other character is in the scene with him, although he is a little composed, otherwise there is shot on the shoulder belonging indisputably to someone else. There is also a very bad photo of him in a cameo medallion (it looks like a bad photocopy) and a decent picture of him in a family Bible. He first mentioned Jack-O, or something like that. <br /> <br /> Cameron Mitchell briefly appears on television as a horror host. Brinke Stevens is in the movie he shows "The Coven", in which she runs around a graveyard in dress. Of course, there are more bonus Brinke images in Retromedia's dual DVD feature, Mark of the Witch / The Brides Wore Blood. <br /> <br /> Jack-O: what is it? Damn if I know. A boy is told the story of a pumpkin-headed demon killer, and he and some other children are afraid of a woman they consider a witch for some reason. She follows him home and offers to help her family with her haunted garage for Halloween (put your hand through a hole and sense eyeballs that are actually grapes, etc.). The pumpkin head killer shows up repeatedly to cling to the branches as he looks at people or holds his scythe in front of the camera and pose with it for a while. Sometimes he manages to do more than just stay home, and kills people. <br /> <br /> There are also backtracking in a western family or grasslands, with the little boy also playing with the little boy: his ancestors, I think. I think they're in the backdrop of Jack-O, but I do not know how. <br /> <br /> The little boy is ostensibly the main character, but we learn nothing from him except that he wears glasses, has nightmares and will fight bullies even if he gets beaten. More time should have been spent on establishing his character. I could not have worried less about his death. <br /> <br /> This is not recommended, not even for Halloween.
