The Man with the Golden Arm (the film) is a decent career vehicle for Frank Sinatra, but he fails miserably as a good adaptation of a fantastic book. You always hear about how books are "changed" when they are turned into movies - things are cut out, deafened, etc. Well, you can not even say that they have "changed" anything with the movie - they just told an entirely different story. The characters and scenery are the same, but not the ambiguous description, the depth of the Polish Chicago men and women in the book. As far as the set is concerned, it is nothing more than a game scene, completed by the useless "supporting role" played by players walking too busy in the claustrophobic inner streets. The film is a completely different approach to Frankie Machine and addiction. When this happens, Zosh, Frankie and Sparrow all lose their psychological advantage. Frankie's battery, a modest dream in the book, becomes his passion in the film (probably because Sinatra is a musician). And addiction is treated as a crisis, in a workable way. The acting is correct, especially Louie, who looks like a snake, which is more threatening in the film than in the book. But it's just a shame that this kind of film can be advertised as a classic, next to the book on which it is "based", the true story of Frankie Machine. The film shows that Hollywood can fix everything, without distorting it or adding a happy ending. In this case, they have just changed it completely, turning an important and realistic story into a Hollywood fluff. I'm sure I'm very skewed because I read the book first, so I can not really treat the film honestly knowing how good the book is. In fact, I thought about turning off the film (and I never do it), just to avoid confusing its stupid plot with the beauty of the book. But it's an overestimated movie, and although it's not that bad, the book should go first, as it was the first. And that should have been the only story of Division Street and Frankie Machine.
