Well ... there were some gorgeous facial photos with Marlene's creamy texture, accompanied by her "shocking" bendery outfit (and her "metamorphosis" not to be missed from a human being); but overall, the generally unconvincing plot and dated acting - not to mention the less than captivating tunes from Miss Dietrich's "baritone" voice - have done little to ensure that Blonde Venus has a permanent place in the Hall of Memorable Movies of my mind. Cary Grant - still at the heart of his childhood at the movies - seemed to be trying to "find" himself, while Herbert Marshall was probably nothing, but Herbert Marshall, from birth until the last day of his death. Naturally, from a historical point of view, Blonde Venus was fun to watch, as long as one was able to set aside ... high expectations.
