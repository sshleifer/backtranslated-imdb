It's a lame comedy. <br /> <br /> Here's why: a sitcom between men and women. Ok. <br /> <br /> The husband is a shower bag. The woman is Einstein. <br /> <br /> How original is it? <br /> <br /> Jerry Stiller is exactly the same man as Seinfeld. <br /> <br /> The gags are void. No spiritual one-liners. <br /> <br /> I have enough. Stop that now. <br /> <br /> The last word: stupid. The destruction of the average white type continues on ABC. The worst part? Kevin James is actually a funny comic. He just is not there. Leah Remini is a treat for the eyes, but it's impossible. Wasted talent is the word. Bad sitcom.
