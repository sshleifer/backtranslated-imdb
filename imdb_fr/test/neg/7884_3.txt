A film about a French girl being raped by street thugs. The rape scene itself is filmed in all its gory details with all the male and female organs and their interactions clearly visible to the camera. In an outburst, the victim grabbed his friend's gun (or was it a brother?), Fired at him, and fled with the weapon. She meets this prostitute who has just seen her pimp shot, they team up and go to Paris. A series of insane, meaningless and savage murders ensues, the girls seem to enjoy each murder more than the previous one. A poor guy is shot in the hole ****. There is good sex between the many murders. <br /> <br /> The film is not the most violent I've seen, I would say that Private Saving Ryan probably had more violence. If you are looking for violence, there are many other films. And if it's the sex you're looking for, I'll suggest one. <br /> <br /> I went to see the movie because of all the hype he gave. The film itself is not serious, it's a lot of violence and sexuality, like a portable camera. I was surprised that this film has a 15 year age limit in Sweden. If 15-year-olds can watch this movie, they should also be able to watch XXX movies.
