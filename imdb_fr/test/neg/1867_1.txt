All movies containing "crazy sound effects" must be shot. If there is one thing that I hate, it must be the use of a "whoop whoop whoo" when someone is hit in the head. Ghoulies IV and Hobgoblins when they are at the bar are the only movies I've seen. Pixie is hitting the guy in a red suit with a bottle of beer ... or rather fanning him with a bottle of beer, because she never really hits him with it. Yes, Ghoulies IV is zero. But I have to wonder, did they mean not to move the so-called "Ghoulies" when they are supposed to talk? Their faces are almost as static as the masks used in Trolls 2. Hell, I can make a better construction paper mask, with rubber cement and a handful of glitter. It sucks.
