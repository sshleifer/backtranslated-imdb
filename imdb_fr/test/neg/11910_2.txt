Jack Lemmon was one of our big players. His performances in Days Of Wine And Roses, The Apartment, Some Like It Hot, Missing (to name the first ones that come to my mind) were all worthy of the nomination for Best Actor. His only victory was for Save The Tiger, and it's a shame. He becomes melancholy as a science, but never balances it with the conductor of his character. In fact, he did much better the same character towards the end of his career in Glengarry Glen Ross. <br /> <br /> As far as the film is concerned, Jack Gilford as a partner of Lemmon and Thayer David as a pyromaniac are both a wonderful work of support, the rest of the story is a confused mixture of vignettes, of anxiety and neurotic nostalgia. , and useless moralizer. To be seen once as a time capsule in the experimental direction of Avildsen's 1970s style.
