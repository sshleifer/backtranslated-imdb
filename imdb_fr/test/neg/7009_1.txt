I'm just throwing in this review to show that I'm not crazy - I really like Wynorski's work - Deathstalker 2, Chopping Mall, Against the Law are fast and very enjoyable - just to prove it. I'm not blind, I must mention this, as well as examples of Shannon Tweed's "Body Chemistry 3 or 4", are the ugliest - I have nothing against stretched sex sequences, but Julie Strain's breasts are so You can not help but look at them - which may be the desired effect, but I did not like to look at others - and several members of this cast seem depressed or disinterested - the "erotic thriller" was the worse things to do. get to low budget movies ever, and thank God that their day has more or less done.
