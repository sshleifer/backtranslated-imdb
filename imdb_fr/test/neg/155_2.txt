I'm still waiting for Peter Fonda to start playing. For someone from such a talented family, it's mysterious that Peter Fonda can only play Peter Fonda trying to play against someone else. And, that's the good news of this disappointing dog from an adaptation of The Tempest. We are served by a series of badly connected ideas that only suggest a relationship with the excellent game of the Bard. The setting is civil war and the evil brother of Prospero (here Guideon) looks like a nasty melodrama of the 1890s, with his mustache Snidely Whiplash. I kept waiting for him to go "Uh ha hah!" which would have been a highlight in this sad presentation. No backstage was memorable, and Peter Fonda's lack of expression and wooden body movements prolonged the chaotic story. <br /> <br /> The storm is the bard's statement on the fury of the unfair treatment inflicted upon the man. The only credible character was the Gator man, Caliban's counterpart. Transferrence to the marsh had opportunities, but the framework of the civil war was not achieved. In the end, a very disappointing production. I saw it on video and would advise you, if you want a fix from Willy Shakespeare, save your money on this one. Rent something else, like Branagh, Much Ado about Nothing, or Kevin Kline in Midsummer's Night Dream.
