What could have been an excellent hostage film was totally ruined by what looks like a bored director ... there were so many directions that the film could have taken ... a vampire slash festival was just not part !!! The last 45 minutes. or the film is a waste of time absolutely ridiculous. ... and sex machine ?? ... Are you kidding me! The acting talents of Juliette Lewis and Harvey Keitel (not to mention George Clooney) are completely lost in this absurd film. <br /> <br /> The director ... Robert Rodriguez, known for his other bloody films, including el mariachi, desperado, was once in Mexico, and the most recent city of sin ... really holds your attention well run in the first half ... which suggests that you are about to be entertained ... but then seemingly without reason, and without any provocation, the madness begins ... there are even weak attempts parody and comedy. .. really maddening !!
