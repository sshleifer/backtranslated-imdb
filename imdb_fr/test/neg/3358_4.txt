Action / melodrama of blaxpoitation below the average in which the charming Mrs. Grier plays a private eye that comes to the rescue of his father (Rudy Challenger) and his partner (Austin Stoker of the original "Assault on Precinct 13") whose loan business is under threat. <br /> <br /> I'll be frank - I agree with the few user comments for this film. "Sheba, Baby" has an unsatisfactory scenario, a not particularly distinguished direction, rather entertaining action scenes, and one of Ms. Grier's most obscure side roles (although D'Urville has an important secondary role to to play). Martin, also known as blaxpoitation). I have the impression that this routine film may have been mounted quickly to bring him enormous popularity. <br /> <br /> It was really cool to see Stoker again, although Mrs. Grier did not have such a good reputation. a role - or a dialogue - as she did in other films, even if she does what she does best, and it's playing the role of a sexy and sexy sister on a mission of revenge. <br /> <br /> Non-stop soul / The funk soundtrack is nice, at the very least. <br /> <br /> Mainly recommended to those who wish to see everything in Pam Grier's film repertoire. <br /> <br /> 4/10
