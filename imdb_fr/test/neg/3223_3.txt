Well, I'm a big fan and a disciple of Elizabeth Berkley. I bought this on DVD off eBay for my boyfriend's birthday. We sat down to watch and it was so boring. I do not remember laughing once. It only takes an hour and a half and it seems like it will take forever. Elizabeth is great in this area. Maybe it's just because I'm a big fan of Elizabeth Berkley. If she was not there, I would not have looked at her, but every time she came, my face was lit up. Unfortunately, even Elizabeth could not save this movie. The general story and the dreadful comedy make this movie a movie you'd rather miss, but not lose an hour and a half of your life. It's a very forgetful film.
