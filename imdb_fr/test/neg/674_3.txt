Tyra and the rest of the modeling world need to know that real women like me and my daughter do not care to see all the ridiculous models selling something. Strange places, too much makeup and too much skin is not necessary. Sex does not always sell when you sell to women. It's the same for the horse that stomp on the track, which does not seem natural. People come in all shapes and sizes and they need to have that on the show. My daughter has a crotch of 36 ", is tall and thin and a size 5, I am more average at a size 12. We would like to see both - I can not imagine what something would look like on me when a size 2 the I will not buy magazines anymore because they are one way on this subject We would very much like the series to take into account women of all sizes Thank you.
