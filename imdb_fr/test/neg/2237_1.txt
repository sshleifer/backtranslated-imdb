I went to see the movie because my boyfriend was delighted to see how much he wanted to see it, and how his friends had already liked it. So I arrived with a neutral attitude, without really waiting for the worst. Unfortunately, that's what I got. I could write a 15-page article explaining why it's easily the worst movie I've ever seen. But for your benefit, I will highlight the benefits and innumerable disadvantages. For starters, the acting was very good, especially Christopher Waltz and Melanie Laurent. There were also some lines that deserved a laugh, and some scenes full of suspense. Unfortunately, a good actor, a little humor and suspense is the end point. The whole beginning story could have been great. The family of a Jewish girl is massacred, she hides, then meets the man responsible for his pain and then develops a great plan of revenge. It seems very good. But the movie would not be as "satisfying" for Americans and Jews hungry for Nazi blood. I have no problem with World War II movies or killing Nazis; I saw Defiance and I like it a lot. However, it is the manner and attitude with which our so-called heroes kill. I will give you an excellent example of the kind of hypocrisy that this film oozes. Our gang of thugs ambush a German unit and kill them all, except one sergeant and two other soldiers (no problem so far). They ask the sergeant to disclose information about another German unit. When he "respectfully refuses" to betray the lives of his fellow soldiers, he hits his head with a baseball bat, cheering and swearing as if he were at a football game. They removed the head of this Nazi yaaayy! Now, let's look at the hypocrisy in this scene. Here is a hypothetical situation: a group of American soldiers is ambushed and taken captive by the enemy. The same scenario ensues and the US commander prefers to die rather than betray his fellow soldier. The enemy strikes his head with much celebration. It would annoy an audience if this scene was in a movie. This American soldier was a hero for placing his men above himself and these barbarians brutally murdered him! And the Nazi sergeant? Well, he's a Nazi and deserves to die in the most cruel way possible, right? Coincidentally, the Nazis felt the same way towards the Jews. See hypocrisy? By celebrating the butcher of the Nazis, we place ourselves on the same sadistic level. <br /> <br /> Major Hypocrisy # 2: The Nazis make a propaganda film about a German sniper who kills nearly 300 American soldiers. Towards the end of the film, the film is revealed. Hitler and his cohorts burst out laughing as he watched an American soldier get shot through a window and fall into a fountain. The Nazis applaud as a soldier after the soldier falls under sniper skill. This is supposed to annoy the American viewers of this scene. These diabolical Nazis mock the death of our brave men! Ironically, is not that what we were doing (or were supposed to do) all the time we watch Inglorious Basterds? Laugh the pain of others simply because they were "the bad guys". What would we think if the Native Americans made a successful movie in which they blew bloody revenge on American settlers? Or if blacks made a film glorifying Nat Turner's rebellion? OK enough about the hypocritical flaws. <br /> <br /> I will summarize other reasons for the 1 star ranking. 1) There were admirable characters to see throughout the film. Brad Pitt even tortured a woman by putting her finger in her gunshot wound because he suspected she had betrayed him. This is the good guy? 2) The trailed scenes longer than necessary. 3) Brad Pitt's southern accent, supposedly from Tennessee, is HORRIBLE and quite embarrassing throughout the move. I will stop now since I am 700 words. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it seems that the general population does not think anymore, it just wants blood. And that's why this movie received such a high ranking. I recommend this film for the ignorant or if you are Jewish and you just want to see a beautiful "fantastic justice". Personally, when I finally came out of the cinema, I felt as if I had been scalped (or if I had wished that I had it so as not to have suffered more than 2 hours of mental rape).
