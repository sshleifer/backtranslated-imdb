Even compared to the lowered standards of slasher movies of the 80s, it stinks. The usual group of overexcited teenagers head for a "forbidden" part of the forest, which burned in the 1940s and apparently left only one survivor angry. Fast forward (in fact, you will want to advance quickly in a good part of this mess) until today, where two or three campers are massacred; teenagers follow in their wake, while a semi-worried park warden (a sleepwalker, Jackie Coogan) and his healthier cohort (who spends a lot of time tying his banjo) partially manage to direct our attention from the usual yards . padding mill nature-length film. Finally, more murders - but nothing you've ever seen before. If you want to see the children slaughtered, go for SLEEPAWAY CAMP or the first Friday 13 December
