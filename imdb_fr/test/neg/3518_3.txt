Hungary can not make good films. Made. This is an excellent example. <br /> <br /> First, the term "plot" does not exist in this movie. It's seriously weak. Even though a lot of people were arguing with me about it. Of course, this is a taboo, but that's about it. The possibilities are endless, which could have been really great if they were used, but they almost jumped. I think the whole movie is just an excuse to show pictures, which are the only decent things in this whole bunch of atrocities. <br /> <br /> The acting game is simply crappy. Since there are not many lines, one might think that actors have a good facial expression or ability to imitate, but no. In fact, 86% of the time, they are zero. And that's when they say nothing. If they do not even say a single word, you'll start bending your head and say, "It's damn unrealistic." But again, it's partly the fault of writing. There is also no emotion in most dialogues. <br /> <br /> The edition is sometimes correct, but most of the time illogical and only aggravates the situation. It could have been an emotional impulse, but it seems that the editing here is to place the cuts one after the other. <br /> <br /> Someone, explain to me, why the critics say that this film is a masterpiece. To call it an "art" will not improve it. Sorry Mundruczo, but you failed. To live with. Even if you probably do not care about my opinion or that of any other guy who scarifies your "child".
