This absurd movie was about a teenager "Goodie-two-shoe", who really wanted to be Valedictorian but found her obstacle in the name of a teacher, Ms. Tingle. Katie Holmes, who plays this "goodie-two-shoe", faces the "biggest dilemma of her teenage life" when her classmate comes up with the final exam sample that should help them succeed on Ms. Tingle's test. Mrs. Tingle arrives, catches Holmes, the classmate and her best friend with the sample of her final exam. Convinced that the three of them were considering cheating on the exam, Tingle welcomes the opportunity to ruin Holmes once and for all with allegations that could ruin Holmes' chances of success. And the classmate, who seems to be turning a blind eye to Holmes, has always wondered why she never gave him the time (he is stupid)? Feeling desperate, Holmes and her friends visit Mrs. Tingle in the middle of the night to try to dissuade her from believing that Holmes intended to cheat. The classmate points a bow and arrow at Mrs. Tingle, threatening to do everything to make things go well for Holmes. Mrs. Tingle defends herself but ends up becoming the captive of Holmes and her friend. <br /> <br /> During Mrs. Tingle's captivity under Holmes, they do everything from tying her up and gagging her in her own bed to making her sing with her. false pictures they took from the unconscious coach to bed with Mrs. Tingle. I felt shaken as the children moved into Ms. Tingle's home, eating her food and going through her private work. At one point, Holmes found Ms. Tingle's notebook and deliberately altered the note in her favor, lowering her note of her valedictorian challenge. The end was a childish attempt to bring back the comedy that had been modest at the beginning of the film, resolved by pure irony, burlesque and absurdity. <br /> <br /> This must be the most inconceivable and most devilish Holmes character ever play in his whole life. I wanted to help Mrs. Tingle free herself to really dig a grave for Holmes. She was manipulative, selfish and complicit. She even slept with the classmate despite the overwhelming interest of her best friend for him ... and she did not like him. Whether you were trying to ruin her notes by taking Ms. Tingle's notebook by taking her best friend's man, you might have thought that Holmes would get what she deserved in the end, right? Unfortunately, she gets everything her heart desires, which shows that being mean, manipulative, selfish and moaning can give you what you want. <br /> <br /> Mrs. Tingle was supposed to be the character you did not like. They did not bring me to that point once to believe that she was the woman to "teach this lesson". She was like all the other strict teachers who even gave valid reasons for her resentment towards the next generation. Personally, I felt that his opinions on young people were validated each time by the actions of Holmes and his friend. I was hoping she could be free to call the police and nail Holmes. They kept her tied to the bed, ate her food like a group of pigs, drank the woman's wine, screwed up her personal belongings and we were supposed to believe that she did not deserve to take a bat to each of their heads ? And the classmate must be one of the least loved characters in the film's story. Forget silly, we need a new word for him that is not in the Webster dictionary. He introduced the major troubles into Holme's life, then made things worse when he entered Mrs. Tingle's house, uninvited behind Holmes, and grabbed Mrs. Tingle with a bow and arrows. I was delighted every time Mrs. Tingle had the opportunity to slap him or smother the best friend of the aspiring actress. <br /> <br /> If you are a teenager and want to see when a teenager will be manipulated and hurt can make him understand the world, see this non-comic black film, full of caricature, unintentional.
