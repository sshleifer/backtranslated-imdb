This movie was definitely boring. The acting was ok and the movie looks pretty, the soundtrack is definitely for fans of Kenny G and Michael Bolton. Speaking of the soundtrack, I found it very ironic that a film about the truth and not about the flight decided to use a song in his titles that was a BLANCH RIPOFF of the movie "You can call me Al from Paul Simon. recognize him at all. Is not there something a little hypocritical there? The scene in which was the main kid, where he imitated a game show host, was my favorite. 10 lines? I have to write ten lines on this film to be included? What a scam, I do not think it's too fair to force people to write more than they would to include it!
