The plot for Black Mama White Mama revolves around two women detained in a women's prison in the Philippines. A black and a white. These two women are thrown together in the prison. Pam Grier is Lee Daniels Lee is incarcerated in the infernal women's prison for dancing as a harem. <br /> <br /> Lee's boyfriend owes him some of his profits from drug trafficking. Lee mainly wants to get out of prison to get her father-in-law's money back so she can leave the Philippines and lead a better life. Margaret Markov plays Karen Brent, a white woman from a privileged background, who is also a revolutionary. Karen joined a group of revolutionaries determined to change the corrupt Philippine political system. She was captured by the Philippine authorities and detained as a political prisoner. <br /> <br /> The story takes off when Karen and Lee escape from the prison where they were together. The two of them were also chained to the wrist. By fleeing, they also fight with each other because they have different goals. Of course, they hate being chained. But they also realize that they have to put aside their differences to help each other survive while avoiding capture. If this movie is very similar to The Big Bird Cage, it's a big part of the two-film casting is identical, as well as their location in the Philippines. Roger Corman has always had a steady stream of actors, which he used in all his B movies of the '70s. Besides Pam Grier, Sid Haig, Roberta Collins, Claudia Jennings, Betty Anne Rees and William Smith were also among the many frequently selected actors in Corman's AIP films. <br /> <br /> Like The Big Bird Black Cage Mama White Mama relies on too much bloody violence to be acceptable. Pam Grier embodies in this film her corpulent and usual chick character, and shows her skills as a female action heroine. Margaret Markov has less effect, in her portrayal of the revolutionary Karen. She seems just too fragile and well coiffed, to be a dedicated political guerrilla. With the exception of Sid Haig, like the colorful Ruben, the rest of the cast is unforgettable. <br /> <br /> This movie is of little entertainment value, unless excessive and abominable acts of violence please you. Only the performances of Pam Grier and Sig Haig make this film interesting to watch.
