What can be said about such a pathetic film? <br /> <br /> - Very bad acting! The main actress seems to know only one facial expression: fear mixed with weakness. Like a poor beaten dog ... The other actress (the one who plays evil) looks like Ozzy Osbourne's female double, with a terrible red wig. The other actors are so pitiful that they do not even deserve to be described. <br /> <br /> - There is absolutely no conspiracy. The story begins with possibilities but goes nowhere: we do not know anything about the meaning of "11:11", nor who Rayden really is, except for the simple "she's mean" or "she's a child of Apocalypse "... which is not an explanation. We do not know why the parents were killed, what kind of danger grows up and why Sara was chosen. As the movie progresses, we watch only scary scenes, with bad music. In addition, the end says nothing: we see just two possibilities, as if one of them was a bonus scene or the director's cut ... There is no conspiracy, so no interpretation possible . <br /> <br /> - "11:11", it's full of clich√©s! It's so obvious that I could not help but laugh. For example: deserted library or bathroom scenes, ghost silhouettes walking with a breath of wind, ... there is even the "scary little girl" in fashion as in "Dark Water" or "The Ring". Of course, the main character is bullied at school and looks like a stereotypical gothic girl (black hair, red lips, lean, black clothes). Is it an obligation to make it credible? I do not think so. Sara's psychology is so undeveloped and so typical that it does not make her credible or endearing. <br /> <br /> - Horrible direction: as I said, nothing original, everything has already been seen a thousand times and is used here without a real purpose. <br /> <br /> - There are funny inconsistencies. For example, I do not know if "ghost science", "paranormal course" or what is taught in American universities ... In Europe, this is really not the case: teachers talk about negative energies or use "immaterial" creature sensors. .. ridiculous. Also: how can you watch a film shot in the sixties with a Super-8 camera on a computer screen without spending hours scanning (in the movie they immediately look at it on the computer screen AND how can you, on this old film, isolate a small detail then zoom in and see a perfectly identifiable face? I wonder if the director has ever tried to digitize an old analog movie ... <br /> <br /> Eventually, "11:11" is worth watching if you like to laugh at idiot movies, or maybe if you wish it. falling asleep on her couch ... But it's an expensive way to fall asleep!
