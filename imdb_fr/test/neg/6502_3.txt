Let me say at the outset that I am not a very artistic person and that I do not "receive" new art. That said, this movie is absolutely crazy and, in my opinion, not crazy common sense. Filmed entirely in black and white with a series of closely related stories, Avida is a movie for those who can look at modern art and say, "Wow, I feel the energy and passion of this painting." The only reason I give this film a 3 out of 10 is because I actually managed to laugh at some parts, but mostly to laugh at the sheer madness of the movie. Two of the characters throwing chairs on a lawn, as to what these characters were doing, I have no idea. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.
