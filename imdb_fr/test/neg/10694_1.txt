This film is bad. Not so bad that it's good. Just bad. It is however hilarious bad. I watched it out of morbid curiosity and I never intended to watch it, nor any other Chuck Norris film. If you have to choose between this film and death, opt for this film because it's a master class in the production of terrible movies (hence the hilarity). <br /> <br /> It's a constant depression for me, as I work hard at my job, that some people become involved in making movies and decide to produce things like this. <br /> <br /> 1 of 10. Even better than "Starship Troopers" however.
