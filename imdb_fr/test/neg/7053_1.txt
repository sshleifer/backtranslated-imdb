This film should have ended as soon as the first joke about Bebe's Kids was told. I loved Robin Harris and most of his comedies, but the fun routines were not supposed to be something the whole family could go see. Try to joke about Jerry Seinfeld and try to keep it as long as you can to make a movie. This film had to be interested because I do not find anyone familiar with tweaks or antics. The funniest thing about this movie is the willingness of screenwriters and producers to pass it off as something precious. 1/10 stars because there is no half star.
