Okay, I could only find three reasons to consider this film as profitable given the extremely small budget. <br /> <br /> First there was Linnea Quigley and Rachel Carter. In fact, they gave me four good reasons to look and watch what I did. <br /> <br /> The only other reason to watch is that a lot of movies have been shot on the road. Well, I did not know it before, but I saw a car tag from Orange County and I thought, wow! it was shot in Florida. <br /> <br /> I was impressed by the backtracking of the past and the ancestors of the young child, but that was really it. The murders perpetrated by the pumpkin man were rather lame, with the exception of the biker. <br /> <br /> If you want to see Quigley and Carter, all right, but the Return of the Undead will give you more chills.
