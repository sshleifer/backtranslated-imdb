"House of the Damned" (also known as "Specter") is one of your low-budget haunted house horror movies, filled with mediocre performances and cheap effects. This is a family who inherits an old Irish mansion and, after his move, begins to experience a strange phenomenon and ghostly apparitions, including the ghost of a maiden murdered and buried in a wall in the basement of the mansion. The couple's daughter is then taken to another dimension and seeks help from a group of paranormal investigators. <br /> <br /> The ideas borrowed by this film from the movie "Poltergeist" from the haunted house of 1982 are obvious. I will say that this film has slightly scary footage, but it is sometimes very boring. Playing here is nothing special, the atmosphere is good, the score (which is mainly composed of this dramatic Irish opera) was somewhat annoying, and the special effects of CGI are really horrible. I mean, it was in 1996, you would think they could have done a little better than them. The end where the house was on fire was the worst special effect I saw, very very cheap. But hey, it was a cheap movie. <br /> <br /> In addition, the translucent monster wolf their daughter sees is horribly wrong. And what was its meaning in the film? What does the wolf devil have to do with a haunted house? The special effects here are what really ruined this movie. The game was pretty bad too. I usually enjoy a lot of low-budget horror movies, but not this one. "House of the Damned" is nothing special, consider watching it if you have nothing better to do. But you will probably want to pass it on. 4/10.
