this movie really sucks, REALLY REALLY HARD SUCKS, this movie should be in the bottom 100, but it's so bad that hardly anyone has seen it vote so often for it that it should be both "Manos - the Hands of fate. "I should have post 1 (dreadful), but the reason I put it 2 was for Eve, the city girl who, besides some nudity scenes, I was also thinking of voting for 3, but as they killed Eve, I returned at 2 o'clock. The fact is that such films should not be financed by anyone, since even these have not turned to fame or other productions, "mansalva" and after they have put end to their misdeeds, it reappears, because in the end they shit very ugly. <br /> <br /> FINAL SCORE (VOTE): 2 (for the nudity and performance of the beautiful Eve)
