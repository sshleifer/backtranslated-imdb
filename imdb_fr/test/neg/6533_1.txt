This film is ridiculous. It's a comedy, but the scenario is horrible. All the film is done in low light and you can not understand that it's a comedy. It's really bad cinematography. You really have to sit there and watch the movie to realize that there are some jokes here and there, but anyway, they are all inside jokes between them. It's more like a wannabe drama that went wrong. It's really a very useless movie. Their expressions reveal only the disarray and the disaster that occurs in this way. Unless you want to get bored of your ass, I suggest you stay away from this movie gag.
