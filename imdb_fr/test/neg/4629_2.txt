Sex is one of the most remarkable aspects of existence. This is perhaps the most interesting activity between birth and death. THE DECLINE OF THE AMERICAN EMPIRE studies human sexuality in a dry and boring way. In fact, worse than just being boring, seeing 40-year-old naked women is good, unpleasant. <br /> <br /> I guess having adults as old as our parents talk about sex, but after twenty minutes it stops being interesting. Maybe if the characters were all 20 years younger, the movie would be more visually captivating. <br /> <br /> THE DECLINE OF THE AMERICAN EMPIRE is not worth it.
