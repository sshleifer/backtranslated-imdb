I just can not understand how a fan of Who, or just anyone, could find this hideous, lazy, badly written abomination, even from a distance. It is so embarrassing that it is considered a real tragedy. The potential for this was huge, it could have been great. What a shame that all the acting talents, sets, props, goodwill of all participants were so pathetically wasted by a scenario that should have been burned. <br /> <br /> There is a clear lack of rigorous production and quality control here. Like those Hollywood Hollywood movies (crazy world, royal casino) where the stars pose as another and have fun, which basically means a check for doing nothing. <br /> <br /> I could have written a better one that sends in my sleep. In fact, I woke him up well. I did it in grade 10 in high school and played it with a group of classmates. It was better, I'm looking at it now and the gags are more funny. Steven Moffat YOU ARE A BUM TALENT! What a waste, what a lost opportunity. Makes me want to cry ....
