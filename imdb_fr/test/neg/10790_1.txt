This film, although shot and superbly played, was awful. I felt like I was watching a car accident - although I kept looking, but I really wanted to turn my head. The plot leaves little to be desired, was extremely disjointed, and the end was catastrophic. Although this corresponds to the tone of the film, I hoped to improve this film. I still do not understand what the references to rabies and child bite the fox at the beginning of the film. Fifteen minutes of intrigue that did not really do much. It's really sad to see a movie with beautiful actors and a beautiful scenery marred by such a horrible story. There is not much more to say about this film. Save time and watch c-span. It will be more edifying.
