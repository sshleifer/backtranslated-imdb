This film begins rather promising, but it becomes a little complicated and taken in its stylistic charm. The sets, costumes and music were wonderful, as perfect as possible. But the more I integrated the film, the more I felt that all this effort was made for the entertainment of the director, not for the public. Although I liked watching it, except for a few brief musical scenes, I can not say I liked it. The director shows a great imagination, but if he plays with this film, he does not share it with the public, or at least with me. I did not have the feeling of fantasy and I was not sucked by this universe. <br /> <br /> One of the great causes of this phenomenon was (surprisingly) Zhang Ziyi. You can say that she is trying very hard, but she seems to have been so badly managed that she comes out almost like an amateur. She is a capable actress but she has her limits. I noticed in her play that she had not really reacted to her classmates, a flaw that creates a chemical vacuum. The language barrier in this film seems to have only exacerbated things. She and Odagiri act as if they were on separate planets. She's also not a very good singer, which made me shudder every time she sang, but luckily there were not many scenes of it. Odagiri was OK but does not make a big impression. <br /> <br /> I did not even care about the characters separately. There is really a cruel lack of characterization. The only reason to be interested in them seems to be that their royalties are beautiful. Without the fascinating love story at the center of the film, it's hard to worry about what's going on. The film also makes detours in minor scenes that add nothing to the story and distract them. I had to go back, because after participating in a secondary plot, I did not remember what we were doing in the main storyline. There were also scenes where it was hard to tell what was happening as it was stylized. <br /> <br /> Most of the time, I'm just disappointed because I really like the concept behind all this and that there are many things I like. The music and the dance choreographies are really great. The support benefits are consistently excellent, fantastic both as an actor and as a singer. It's just too bad that the main actors are so bland.
