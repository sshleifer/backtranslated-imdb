Bog Creatures shows exactly what can happen when very enthusiastic people get together with a little money, some knowledge of filmmaking, a motley mix of budding actors and a lot of determination, yet without the knowledge and the skills needed to succeed more. only after a special program after school which is rather mediocre (in a negative way, and not as a good nostalgic way). I mean, it's a quality film for home and student movies, of poor quality, if you want to distribute it for free to your family and friends. Fortunately, I found it in a tray somewhere. Of course, there may be a type of market for this type of product, but it seems that this market exists only by default, because there are many poor B movies. Even more so now. <br /> <br /> The only person I would recommend this move to is the aspiring guerrilla filmmakers. First, I would recommend them to watch the special MAKING OF feature on the disc. See the enthusiasm of the film crews, their hard work, their joy and their high opinion of their own product. THEN watch the movie. Hopefully, within a short time, you will understand what's wrong. Bored, I went through the whole process and the director and the cinematographer clearly tried, but I do not know enough about what they do. They knew enough to have fun, but in the long run, without the necessary skills, they interpreted them as follows: They knew enough to be dangerous. It's like a bad Nickelodeon movie (rather than a more decent movie, I guess). Two or three actors did well, and the cool guy with his tattoo (real or fake tattoo) was probably the best and the most natural, and I hope he will succeed. But their natural acting talent was what was happening despite the bad movie, the bad script and the low principles. Had the director spent more time helping these budding actors develop their characters, he has successfully studied proven camera techniques and lighting principles to better direct his team, and if the script had actually been worked on instead of being written in about a week (according to very indulgent documentary), so maybe it could have been more a movie. Instead, it is a film that has a sense of potential and that contains a few moments (more of the genre than the movie itself), but ends up showing almost every image, WHAT NOT TO DO. If you want to see what a low-budget horror movie can really look like, look at Phantasm or even Laserblast. If you want a glorified domestic movie (no kidding), get Bog Creatures.
