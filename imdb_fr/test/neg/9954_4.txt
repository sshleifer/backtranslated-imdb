Fairly bad PRC that I do not always look with care, and it's no wonder - it's slow, squeaky and dull like a butter knife. The mad doctor George Zucco is at ease again, turning a farmer in combination (Glenn Strange) into a wolf man. Unfortunately, makeup is virtually nonexistent, consisting only of a beard and dimestore fangs for the most part. Without the presence of Zucco and Strange, with the pretty Anne Nagel, it would be completely unassailable. Strange, who would play Frankenstein's monster for Unuiversal in two years, makes an impression of Lenny from "Of Mice and Men", it seems. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 (of Four)
