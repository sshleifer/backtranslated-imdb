What did they think about when they made this really awful movie? <br /> <br /> Arbus, one of the most important photographers and women of the twentieth century, had a fascinating and dramatic life. What did anyone have to make this film, which explains his unique artistic vision, as the result of an adventure (imaginary) with a hairy monster both grotesque and charismatic (played by Downey)? <br /> <br /> In real life Arbus has broken his traditional marriage and the role of women to express themselves. In this film, Arbus is an ultra-sad kid Nicole Kidman whose inspiration is entirely attributed to a devotion "Beauty and the Beast" to an interesting man. <br /> <br /> For this reinvention, the film is really shameful. Apart from that, he is also just dopey and dull.
