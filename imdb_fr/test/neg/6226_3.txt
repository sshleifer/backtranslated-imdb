It's a new approach to comedy. It's not funny. <br /> <br /> The joke says that this is supposed to be funny in itself. <br /> <br /> The story is based on a new French, located in Paris, and the characters have French names. Louis Aubinard, for example ... played by ... Bob Hoskins? The film is also performed by the French Jeff Goldblum and Natasha Richardson. The situations are similar and the characters play like in the Carry-On movies of years ago. <br /> <br /> I think these are also jokes - throw these actors who do not seek in any way to play the French, to make them mumble in the manner of the great English comedy of the dance hall and let all the inexplicable mystery to the public. <br /> <br /> In the department of humor, it is practically the Algonquin round table. The film tries to be charming and offbeat, and I guess these features are pretty fun. Not as funny as Duck Soup or Love and Death, maybe, but funnier than The Deer Hunter or The Battleship Potemkin. <br /> <br /> This is an example of a personal film. He makes no real effort to reach out and share with the audience, but remains true to his principle and internal logic. Although all situations are incredible, they are logical in the bizarre world of the film. <br /> <br /> I usually like this kind of eccentric movie, but I thought it was too slow, it was boring. tedious, and to provide too few pleasant surprises or an authentic spirit. It's simply meandering in a predictable and sophisticated way, and wasting wonderful talents along the way. This must be the low point of the career of each of the big stars, who are all distinguished players. I think it's the biggest waste of talent since The Betsy, and I wish I'd never seen Goldblum and Hoskins in this scene. <br /> <br /> So it's an interesting miss and pass it on hire unless you really have a lot of time to lose. <br /> <br />
