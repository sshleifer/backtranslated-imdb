Ahh, crazy like cheese, exploit, semi-porn, posing as a horror ... This one stars Jaqueline Lovell (sometimes Sara St. James), the nubile star also seen in "Femalien "," The Erotic House of Wax ", and this favorite of the family" Nude Bowling Party ". She is now part of the line of talented cuties playing in soft porn movies. "Head of the family" is actually trying to become a real movie. A scammer and a tramp try to get the husband out of dit-tramp. They turn to an evil genius with broad brains in a wheelchair and his family of unjust idiots, who uses mind control to send zombies to execute his infamous orders. Said-genius has a giant head, hence the intelligent title of the film: it's about all the humor of the film. But basically, it's an excuse to show the many talents of Lovell and Dianne Colazzo (Ernestina). Truffled with some of the strangest dialogues, it can be a flock (what the hell is "plowing oats", anycow?), And just stupid, this title thriller will arouse an attraction for the breasts of the Drive-In theater, but no one else. The MooCow says to avoid what is lacking, unless you are looking for rent at a disgusting party. : = 8P
