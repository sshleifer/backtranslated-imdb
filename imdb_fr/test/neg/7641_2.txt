... I have no choice but to use it at least once during my Respiro exam. Among other things, what defines the claim is, in my opinion, a lack of emotional sincerity on the part of the author. Respiro seems to be made with an intention too artificial and too conscious to be artistic, symbolic, spiritual, provocative, metaphorical ... mythical, even. But fortunately for all true artists, there is no predisposed formula for achieving artistic beauty and depth. Breathtaking natural locations (yes, these remote areas of southern Italy look exotic, even for most other Italians), pretty actors and fun, daring and spontaneous representations of a handful of seductive children. will not raise an unfathomable film beyond a pretty succession of images. Yet this film is sincere and vain, and finally hollow, is an art that succeeds very little, maybe even by accident. I admit that the pompous conceptual end is imbued with a certain visual poetry. However, I believe that this was done in a way that was more due to the beauty of the sea of ​​Lampedusa and the powerful symbolic power of bathing and water (linking it to so many things mythical, mystical, religious , archetypal, etc.) only with the talent of Crialese. <br /> <br /> Valeria Golino is terribly histrionic and affected by her interpretation of Grazia. For a mentally unstable woman from a humble, provincial background, she certainly has a fashionable wardrobe. Her flattering fluttering floral dresses and pretty, sunny beach hair could have brightened up the pages of any summer edition of Vogue. The fact that she is a "crazy" would not have been a fashionable addition to her fashionable behavior and look - that's how her "condition" sounded so deep. Golino's two-dimensional stereotype of the natural and innocent child-woman misunderstood and oppressed by his backward community was tiring and at worst irritating, leaving me indifferent and indifferent at best. I agree with the London commentator who wrote that cinema was very bad for mental illness. Over the course of the entire movie, we never really have an idea of ​​Grazia's Disease and have no idea what's wrong with it (aside from its tedious stereotype of a "free spirit"). We do not know why she receives injections and needs to see a specialist in Milan. This generic way of writing about mental illness is one of the main tell-tale signs of the film's general superficiality. <br /> <br /> Another rather insulting aspect of Respiro is the questioning of its location. I had trouble understanding if this film was supposed to be shot in the present or in the past, as it was intended to make even a part of Italy, certainly backward (by comparison), a dozen of more concise and more primitive than it really was. is. Once again, this feels the lack of depth and total lack of sincerity on the part of Crialese. Some non-Italian viewers will happily abandon the picturesque backwardness, the cliché of the possessive and macho Italian man, as if it were a commonplace. The question I would like to ask David Ferguson, the critic from Dallas, Texas, is this: Is the mentality of YOUR country stalled in the 1950s? No? OK, so why should mine be? Unfortunately for those who still want to see Italy in such an anachronistic way, this aspect of Respiro is actually ridiculous and factitious even in the eyes of this Italian spectator. The subtly incestuous tension between Grazia and her eldest son was as boring and predictable as the routine of Fabrizio Bentivoglio's sexist but loving husband. I particularly hated the scene in which Grazia joined her husband and her friend in a man-to-man joke around a bottle of beer, to the embarrassment and macho discontent of her husband. According to this film, it is not the place of a woman to take part in the conversations of a man. Oh, but our "adorable" "free spirit" is too good for this place and does not understand the oppressive and unwritten rules of the Patriarchate of Lampedusan! Not only does this scene represent something so wrong, but it should be enough to discredit the film's credibility. It is also a bad side of the culture he tries to describe, which clearly shows that it was written without a clear understanding of the place or its population. I would challenge anyone who knows contemporary Italy to say the opposite. <br /> <br /> For a truly accomplished Italian filmmaker, who deserves, in my opinion, to be ranked among the great of the glorious Italian cinematographic past (which, unfortunately, Gianni Amelio, in particular Lamerica, Così Ridevano and his latest film, La Stella Che Non C'è Unlike most contemporary Italian movies, sadly derivative and stagnant, Amelio's is a fresh and creative independent voice Despite my scathing criticism of Respiro, I am now more than willing to believe that the last Nuovomondo de Crialese, currently presented in Italian cinemas, is worth it, so I'm looking forward to enjoying it, even if it does not shock me excessively (given my feelings for Respiro!).
