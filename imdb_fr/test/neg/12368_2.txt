The movie was pretty bad. It's not so much a scripting problem. It's just that the movie is really boring in terms of rhythm. The film seems to be moving at a slow and heartbreaking pace. The story of San Franpsycho is that there is a serial killer who kills morally corrupt individuals (maybe I've read too much, but hey, that's my nature apparently) after the San Franpsycho has killed two people under the Golden Gate Bridge, we present one of the main characters in the film: Joe Estevez (brother of Martin Sheen) as a policeman named Curpudgeony, Bill Culp. Bill is currently trying to track down the killer (seriously, he does not have a name, he's just the killer), and he's trying to force a local reporter named Rita to help him in his investigation, Bill is the hardest stereotype . Cutting cop and he threatens Rita to throw her in jail for obstruction of justice. Anyway, some scenes pass and suddenly, Rita finds a letter left by the psychopath (it's a cold-blooded psychopath!). She changes her mind and tells Bill and her partner Joe to help with her investigation. <Br /> <br /> The film tries to be a murderous thriller, but somehow fails. It's a bit like the movie The Black Dahlia, it tries to be tense but it's amazing in terms of that. The film tries to stay serious all the way through, but there are scenes like the one where The Killer masturbates (obviously a gore porn fan with "ooh blood on her" phrases or something like that) and Joe Estevez hitting the table: "He's a cold-blooded murderer!" I admit to having slipped several times to the film, even though I'm sure it was an extremely serious film. <br /> <br /> One of the only positives of this film is its goal is the fact that I did not pay money to see it (huzzah netflix). And it's sad because I could see good movies in their movies after watching The Damned. Of course, the film had its share of defects, but it was nice. Unfortunately, San Franpsycho has nothing to do. True, his script is acceptable, but it could have been interesting. Instead, you get a murder thriller that fails to vibrate or even has vaguely pleasant deaths. In addition, other critics say that the film has "a fantastic ending that shocks", apparently I was watching a different film because about an hour away, I sort of guessed what was going to happen. The end did not shock me in the least. I would continue to insult this wreck of a movie but I do not think I'll do it. Long story, this film is a boring and uninspired thriller (I use this term vaguely) that lacks the "hitchcockian shudders" that another critic claims to have a predictable end, bland deaths, acting with all the emotion of A wooden board. , and a decent soundtrack. <br /> <br /> I'm sure others will try to defend this with the habit: it was a low-budget movie, they did their best with such a small budget, and all that other no -meaning. But when it comes to the goal, there were very few things for which they could have spent this budget, there were very few special effects, the soundtrack seems to have been recycled from Hood of the Living Dead or The Damned. and it's the same team of these two films. This film really makes me think of another low-budget film that was not good, called Mr. Jingles. Both films are of the same quality, they provide nothing close to pleasure and should disappear quickly in the dark.
