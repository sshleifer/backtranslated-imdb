The revisionist story - which made the wicked Marquis de Sade a semi-heroic romantic - is pretty staggering. But the atrocious acting, the amateur cinematography and the terrible dubbing make this film terribly bad. The only reason to keep watching is that almost all the women in the movie are gorgeous. And, surprisingly, being tortured for days, with your hands tied over your head, does not seem to harm a woman's beauty, hair and make-up. I imagine that producers have mainly shot in Russia, choosing women for their appearance - and willingness to work cheaply - rather than their ability to play. If you decide to watch this because you have nothing better to do, or if you are a film student looking for bad examples, move quickly through all the scenes without nudity.
