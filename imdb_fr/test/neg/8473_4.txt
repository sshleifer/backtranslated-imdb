"I remember waiting to be born ..." <br /> <br /> "The quest for vision that is the American West". <br /> <br /> "We went to see a psychic ..." <br /> <br /> "I'm sure their first reaction is that she's a cuckoo" <br /> <br /> > "... the place is haunted ..." <br /> <br /> "I think there is another dimension here." <br /> <br /> An artist (Marta Becket) and her Husband, many decades ago, left the hustle and bustle of New York to settle in an abandoned town with a population of 10 people in Death Valley. There, they renovated a theater - painting is a very traditional / folk art. And, once finished, she begins to give dance performances for virtually no one. In many ways, this is a reminder of the film by Werner Herzog, FITZCARRALDO or FIELD OF DREAMS - even though AMARGOSA is a documentary about a real person - and not about a mythical crazy man like Klaus Kinski or Kevin Costner. Her husband eventually left - apparently largely because of the lifestyle she chose. She lives today with her ten cats and a burros sanctuary with her new mate, Tom. <br /> <br /> What you think of this documentary depends on your perspectives. If you like New Age ideas and are open to these sensibilities, you will probably enjoy the movie. She recounted how she remembered her birth, her ghosts, her visual quests and her psychics, shook the psychology professor in me and that would certainly be the case for many people. In addition, his burro sanctuary and his efforts to preserve the horses in the desert will no doubt interest PETA and many other animal lovers, although, with my background in environment and biology, I consider burros and horses as a plague. who would destroy the native. plants and animals. So, for two different reasons, I tend to think the opposite of Marta - who is rather a "sensitive" and "sensitive" person. Depending on how you feel about all this, your opinions will certainly be colorful - and I'm pretty sure most people will think she's a genius or a madman! You'll just have to guess what I think. <br /> <br /> In spite of all this, the film is interesting and Marta's life is definitely NOT boring - especially since in recent years people have started in the desert to see her play. There is a precise sequence for her and her unusual little world. Although I'm not as positive as most critics, I can not be as negative as the critics, because this strange documentary has all its merit. I like movies about unusual people and Marta is certainly unusual! I also appreciate his love for his art and his happy life - it's a rare gift. <br /> <br /> I teach psychology in an art school and it would certainly be interesting to show this to the staff - I'm sure we'd have a strong positive and negative reaction to the film - probably depending on the teachers teach art classes or the common core! It would surely be interesting. <br /> <br /> By the way, and I'm not trying to be sarcastic, but when Marta's husband was in business, with whom did it happen ?! After all, they lived in the middle of nowhere and I remained wondering where he would find partners. <br /> <br /> By the way, if you want to see her play and / or stay with her hotel, it can be found at www.amargosaoperahouse.com/. The site is in English, French and German and the hotel rates are quite reasonable, as are the ticket prices.
