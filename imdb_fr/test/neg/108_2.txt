Every film I have PPV'd because Leonard Maltin rented it to heaven blew pieces! Each of them! When will I learn? <br /> <br /> Evie is an old bag that is not afraid to say that she is dying of breast cancer to get by! Laura is an unbearable jellyfish filled with the Holy Spirit (and the protege of her husband)! Taken between these harpies is the silly boy from Medusa who has been urged by The Old Bag to tear us off weeds! <br /> <br /> As I said, when will I ever learn? <br /> <br /> I was temporarily relieved of my discomfort when The Old Bag dumped her head in a sink but, unfortunately, she was not dead. I was temporarily relieved of my discomfort when Medusa was mown, but unfortunately she is not dead. It is a capital offense to torture such a public! <br /> <br /> Without Harry Potter, Rupert Grint is just a pair of big blue eyes that swell almost from their sockets. The setting of Julie Walters (especially the scene where she plays "God") is even more brazen than her character. <br /> <br /> At least, Harold knocks bimbo instead of Maude. For that, I am really grateful. And if you read this Mr. Maltin, you owe me $ 3.99!
