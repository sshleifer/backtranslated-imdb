I have not yet seen the first entry in this series, but fortunately I could still follow the intricate and complex plot, with all its unexpected twists, and I applaud them for the originality of the concepts presented. In case of confusion, I leave no doubt that everything I've just said is coated with pure and carefully nurtured sarcasm, one that flourishes and grows exponentially if exposed to shit like this film. A clear sign that this is not impressive is that it was directed by a visual effects creator, whose only additional credit in this area is a film by Henry Rooker that was not well received. The acting game is at best average, and I challenge anyone not to find ... The Russian accent is laughable and / or irritating to a Scottish computer woman (go, seriously, what's wrong? with this last name?). There are one or two stylization attempts in this area, and they are reasonable. The action is not terrible. Cinematography and editing are good. The music is pretty cool. The language is infrequent, if even that. The violence is bloody enough. I recommend it only to fans of B movies, and I will say you can do worse than that. 1/10
