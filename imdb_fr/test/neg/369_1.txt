I know that Trey Parker and Matt Stone really hate celebrities and falsify them with every episode of South Park (without showing them, then mentioning them) and they love to laugh and joke and make fun of themselves too, but I I felt this fake went too far. <br /> <br /> On the one hand, the most common theme of the "documentary" is that these are meaningless episodes that are useless. Obviously, it's completely wrong if you bother to watch any episode, and the constant "You know, I learned something today ..." is said at the end of almost every episode by the main characters. The creators are also described as pompous and arrogant asses that only care about money, including a scene supposed to be funny but not imaginary in which Isaac Hayes delivers lines for Chef (on the phone) and Trey Parker screaming and screaming. to him to suck and hang up. I guess it's supposed to be funny, but the claim that's made it really makes it cringe. <br /> <br /> The way they interview the employees of Trey and Matt shows the duo as bullies who push their employees to the limit, just for the money, in the end. Completely wrong, of course, and quite a joke, but it's not funny. It's annoying, even if it's just a joke.
