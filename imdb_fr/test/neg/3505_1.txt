I can not believe the positive reaction to this film. I had high expectations for this and I was disappointed. First, they used every clich√© of cheese racism in the book. It was so predictable. For example, as soon as the young Latino arrived, you knew he would be really nice because he looked like a gangbanger. The character of Matt Dillon was played a million times, a policeman hardened over the years and who would see the light to a certain extent by the end of the film. Predictability has barely ended with these characters. A phenomenal cast was wasted on a weak scenario. The moral of the story was PC to the max. There were some clever tips but not enough. The dialouge was sometimes embarrassing. It was not quite bad. I just can not believe that this movie got a high score so far. It was a little entertaining, just a little insulting to his intelligence. I admire what this movie was trying to achieve but it was well below that.
