This film is a window on the British world in 1973 - a world of holiday camps, foxes and birds. In fact, I was at Pontins Prestatyn when shooting the film. It is fascinating to see where I spent my holidays and what world we left behind. The "plot", as it stands, is about Stan and Jack's attempts to turn a job into a summer camp (25 pounds a week!) On one occasion to hunt down young women and liquidate Blakey. The other members of Stan's family join them, and Arthur (Michael Robbins) and Olive (Anna Karen) continue to laugh, as well as Blakey's sheer strangeness, but the idea that young women would see anything Stan (Reg Varney) or Jack (Bob Grant) are just ludicrous. Quite harmless in his day, it is only a curiosity of another time.
