I had never heard of this movie before going to DVD. I was immediately intrigued by everything: the actors, the title, the cover and especially the author. Arthur Miller, you can not go wrong with him, can you? Yes. I did not read the novel, but I guess it was a lot better than the movie. I had high hopes for this film. I love Macy and Dern, and it looked interesting. Unfortunately, this film never really goes beyond the cookie-cutter's messages about racism and fanaticism. If you have never seen other films about this subject, or if you never knew that America was based on fanaticism, this film will perhaps amaze you. Others will probably find it predictable, bland and overall bland.
