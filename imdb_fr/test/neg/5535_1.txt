The Gun is probably the worst movie I have ever seen. The direction of the actors is very mediocre, the dialogues resemble those of a teenager of 13 years, the plot (what plot?) Is another "suspense" in which it is very difficult to enter. Finally, nothing in this film is good. Congratulations to all the speakers and especially to the Montreal Film Festival who presented this film IN COMPETITION!
