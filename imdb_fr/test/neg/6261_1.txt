A film like this makes me appreciate the work of professional actors. I think movie buffs, in general, are a bit too hard on professional actors and are willing to criticize them for the smallest of reasons. Watch some minutes of "Cheerlader Massacre" and believe me, you will change your mind. A raid would be almost a compliment for these actors without talent. But again, it's a Jim Wynorski film. Wynorski is a popular director of these very small budget B movies (after working with Roger Corman many times). The problem with this movie is that it is really trying to develop a plot. And when you have actors who give lines as if reading letters on an eye map, how am I supposed to care? In Wynorski's "Bare Wench 2," he did not try to develop a plot. He just tried to take off in the "Blair Witch Project". It was fun and it was moving. "Cheerleader Masscare" is not fun. There are some compulsory female nude scenes, but they are rare. So, it's not even worth enjoying an erotic level. I must say that the worst scene is where Nikki Fritz crosses a bridge about to collapse. First of all, his character did not have to cross this bridge. Secondly, as the bridge begins to crack, rather than doing its best to cross it, it stands there and acts impotent. And in addition, we do not see the bridge collapse because the filmmakers have done for a budget of 2 dollars! Unlike many horror B movies, this one is really boring. And that's what makes it the worst of all bad movies. Lunk Johnson, who is probably the most natural actor of the film (certainly not half decent), is one of the few positives. He was funny in "Bare Wench 2" and also had fun scenes in this movie.
