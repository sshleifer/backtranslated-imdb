the worst suite I have ever seen. really ugly songs, which is shocking given the fantastic quality of the story and the story of the first movies! what ruins the film for me too is the fact that there is no John Cleese, so Jean Bob could just as well not be there and the new bad guys are awful. it is really annoying to see how this kind of older woman can not string together a simple sentence without repeating her words over and over again. but to be honest, Uberta does not shut up is a bit funny. but the fact was her fiftieth birthday: why does she draw her as if she were 80? I was going to give a 1, but now I think ... I could give it a 2. but the scenario is not as good as that of the first movie. it's the same without the humor of certain characters. Overall, I did not like this film entirely because of the disappointing music, the serious lack of voice: to have changed the voice of Prince Derek and Jean Bob, the new villains, the disappointing scenario, the boring habits of some characters and very simple animation.
