Slaughter Trail is a type B western with great pretensions. But that's part of Hollywood history for some very ignominious reason. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie with its musical score that can only be described as domineering, I feel that what Howard was trying to do was Cowboy singing for RKO movies. They already had Tim Holt, who was a cowboy hero with a picture B as reliable as ever, but he was not a singer. I suppose Hughes saw the money Harvested by Herbert J. Yates with Roy Rogers in Republic and decided to get one as well. <br /> <br /> Terry Gilkyson was a very good performer and a better song The writer was recruited and sang some of his material that was not his best and worse, it seemed that they were in the background. But worse than that, there is this annoying chorus that has sung much of the story and has frankly overwhelmed the actors, the extras, even the horses. Needless to say, Terry has never been a singing cowboy. But he has written classics such as The Bare Necessities and Dean Martin's great success, Memories is Made of This. <br /> <br /> The plot concerns a woman from the inside during a jewel steal flight. That's right, the outlaws who are Gig Young, Myron Healey and Ken Kutnik plant Virginia Gray on the coach as a passenger whom they learned she was carrying precious jewels. <br /> <br /> It's a great act that Gray and Young succeed. Young takes him away from the car like a fate worse than death and they act as they should, within earshot of the passengers' voices, but he slips him the booty. The last place where the authorities could turn if she does not run away with her. <br /> <br /> But when they flee the flight, it is on tired horses, so they stop in a chalet to take some replacement mounts and shoot three Navajos who object. This puts the Navajos on the warpath, it did not help that the brother of the chief Ric Roman is one of the victims. <br /> <br /> This is the situation faced by Captain Brian Donlevy at the fort when outlaws arrive there to protect themselves. The way it all works is predictable, but in an over-productive and over-productive way. <br /> <br /> In fact, that's the problem with Slaughter Trail. It's a simple, unadorned western that has degenerated into something almost grotesque. <br /> <br /> But the real reason Slaughter Trail has gone down in history is that this movie apparently marks the official start of the blacklist. Originally, Howard DaSilva was to play the role of Donlevy and may have completed his scenes when Howard Hughes officially fired him for communist sympathies. His scenes were completely filmed again with Brian Donlevy in mind. <br /> <br /> Given the fiasco that this film has become, I do not know if Donlevy or DaSilva should have thanked Hughes or kicked him in his. private reserve.
