Weird with songs and useless backgrounds. At random, much of the action will take place on stage, giving the feeling of an opera performance. None of this explains why it's such a bad movie. <br /> <br /> It seems like there have not been enough rehearsals or experienced choreographers. The acting game is flat. Even the glittering Ziyi Zhang seems to be waiting for her next move or her next line. You may notice an anecdote on this site stating that she spent half a month in Japan learning to sign and dance. Read it again for 2 weeks and things start to make sense. Even worse are the little kids who seem to be watching their parents in the back of the studio rather than in front of the camera. <br /> <br /> Cheap and cheerful sfx are just cheap. The editing consists of staccato chops sprinkled with slices of nothing that adds nothing but annoyance. Imagine all the stupid dance scenes of the recent Zatoichi - especially the closing routine - performed by your high school theater club with a famous actress who speaks in another language (but you simply do it because she is normally good despite its inadequacy), recorded on a cheap camera and then edited in three times its length without a clever order.
