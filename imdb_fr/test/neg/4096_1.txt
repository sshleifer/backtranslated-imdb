Well, for that abomination of a movie, I did not expect anything good. I find Steve Carell annoying, and Bruce Almighty was very good but there is absolutely no reason for it to have a sequel. In a way, this movie was still below my expectations, even when I did not have one. <br /> <br /> Does anyone remember the Disney Noah movie with Tony Danza? Well, let's just say that Evil Almighty has completely ripped him off in so many ways that the film remains justifiable. In fact, Evan Almighty had the same scenario scheme as Noah, with the exception of a few technical details, it was nothing more than a true copy of a much superior movie that was ENCORE FUN. <br /> <br /> Anything else, did anyone get tired of the stupid, stupid, redundant, one-liners of Wanda Sykes literally in all the scenes? It was completely ridiculous and dragged more and more the film. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that I had already seen the movie ten years ago (Noah), Evan Almighty must be the most predictable movie I have ever seen. I understood the movie in its entirety from beginning to end in the first five minutes and finally realized that it was scamming Noah left and right. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, if you're not sure if you want to see Evan Almighty, and you're already tired of Jonah Hill playing the same role in every film, he likes Bruce. Almighty, and you do not want to see a predictable, dry and unimaginable movie with Steve Carell trying to act like Jim Carrey, so please, do not see that trash.
