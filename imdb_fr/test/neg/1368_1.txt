I saw this film when it was released for the first time in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. I had traveled from Youngstown, Ohio, a distance of about 2 km. 85 miles. I did not know anything about the plot or the players. I had not read any criticism and I had not spoken to anyone who saw it. Believe me, I will never do it again this mistake. I think it was the first feature film shot in the new 3D process. That's what made me go back and forth over a distance of 170 km. <br /> <br /> There was a two-sided queue that stretched (I mocked you) two or two blocks and a half and moving very slowly. I could hardly wait to be seated. If only then I knew what I would know soon, I could have been on my way back to Youngstown when the function was launched. <br /> <br /> At the time of the projection of the first 3D scene, I was already dozing. The novelty quickly paid off and from then on, it was pure agony. <br /> <br /> Without going into the unsustainable details, I can only give the following advice. If you have ever seen the famous film PLAN NINE DE L'EXTÃ‰RIEUR, supposedly the worst film ever shot, it stands in my humble opinion above this trash. <br /> <br /> I do not know if that will happen. never been shown on TV, if it does not know why. If you have the opportunity to see it, do something else. Take a walk, cut the grass, wash the dog, have a rubber hose whip you. WHATEVER. Your time will have been better spent. <br /> <br /> This was my first film review. It could be my last unless a worse movie happens and I do not make a book that happens. <br /> <br /> Bill <br /> <br />
