Sometimes, when I watch this film, I begin to think that the writers of this film were addicts. What's wrong in this film, I'll tell you: Bad Plot, Bad Jokes.Bad Actors and hardcore characters, everything is really bad. <The film is about Pest Vargas, a phony hustler to whom a German hunter who kills people to survive gives $ 50,000 the chance to survive for 24 hours. Now, Pest has to think of ways to think this hunter out before he is killed. <br /> <br /> I know what you think "What is this hell?" Another aspirant, Ace Ventura, who is looking for money. This plot is dull and confusing. It sometimes changes the plot and you lose during the movie. <br /> <br /> Regarding the funny scenes, this film Oh yes, I smile a few times, but nothing laughs. In addition, the jokes are lame and seen before watching Ace Ventura meets Dumb and Dumber but it's bad. <br /> Regarding the development of the character, it's dry and flat. You do not learn much about the main character of Pest. All you know is he's a rogue scammer, but that's all, he does not change his image and does not do a bit of a trick. that he is crazy and wants to go back to Germany. One really begins to wonder why this guy lives on an island if he has money to go to Germany. Hunter's son Himmel is doing better but not much. He's really a coward and he's a snake-obsessed for reasons to the end, he stands up to his father and Pest's side. <br /> <br /> Regarding For example, John Legizomo is so overwhelmed by the performance and does not fit his role, he is out of place for Jeffery Jones who plays the same role as the hunter but gives a stereotyped performance. as well for the rest, or just not used enough, or just above. <br /> <br /> The bad general comedy you'll find for $ 2 at K-Mart.
