Unfortunately, this film withstands about 1% of the hype created by the game in 2004 and leaves a very bitter taste in the mouth. For video game enthusiasts, book lovers and movie buffs, nothing is more disappointing than a film based on an original concept (whether it's a game console or a video game console) who does not care. And not only that, well under the brand. Far Cry, the video game released in 2004 has created such a cult that creating a movie from the content should have been easy and that many players would have flocked to watch the movie. If you are a player who played Far Cry; do not watch this movie. Anyone else who has not played the game; it will always look like a quality B film made / quality B. Uwe Boll, shame your head ... it should have been easy to turn into a blockbuster. The scenario of the game was incredible (think Jurassic Park meets Alien) and yet you still managed to take it and turn it into your own terrible reconstruction of an instant classic. Video game companies need to be warned - if Uwe Boll knocks on the door, lock the door. Oh & Til Schweiger ... I can not wait to see you make up in Inglourious Basterds. What did you think of taking this one? Sigh.
