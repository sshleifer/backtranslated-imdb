This film made for television is about every clich√© you can invent for a film in case of disaster. The only problem is that it is not very well done. <br /> <br /> My brain is always insulted in scenes where Brian Dennehy is supposed to watch a computer screen searching for meteorological data and show it short footage scenes of weather storm ala Channel spots weather. Why look at pictures of the local press in a faded secondary street to better understand global weather conditions? You got me. <br /> <br /> The first two effects of CGI known to man are also disseminated during the first two hours. Watch the tractor-trailer and the plane that seem to have been rendered on a Commodore 64. <br /> <br /> All the prefiguration of this "film" is made with the subtlety of a hammer, the dialogue is forced and I can not think of a nice character that I want to survive in the second half. <br /> <br /> The character I hate the most is the stupid woman whose husband cheats. Maybe if she lifted a finger at any point during the show instead of being a helpless woman standing in the same kitchen all day, her husband would not sleep with the PR representative for an energy company rival. She is so helpless, in fact, I want to put her out of her and my misery. I hope everyone in this "movie" dies in the second half.
