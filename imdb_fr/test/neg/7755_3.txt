It started as a good sketch comedy. The first shows were very good and I was looking forward to a long run. What was really funny is the imitation Mariah Carey and the takeoff of Beverly Hills 90210 with the hair battle. The heavyweight battle Delta Burke vs. William Conrad was also good. Unfortunately, the following shows have deteriorated quite rapidly. The writing became uninspired and oh so predictable only if the series had gained a cult following its young career. Nothing fresh was offered and the recurring sketches were boring. An example is the family of firearms (or the name of the family), which has become a weekly feature. This sketch was not so funny at first, let alone a common feature. An example of a promising start then abrupt.
