I like all the main actors involved in this rather bizarre film. Terrance Stamp, Guy Pearce and Hugo Weaving all proved themselves as some of the best and most competent players, but I could not talk about it. I do not know if it's because I do not understand the way of life or what, but I could not understand this movie. Worst of all, the actors have created some of the ugliest drag queens I've ever seen. I think that was part of the problem, I do not know. I realize it's probably an insult, but I do not know what to call them. I must say that I bought the guys as performers (the correct term?), But the story was just not very good or very interesting either. I would say that I usually can not really appreciate the costume designers, even if I notice them when they are wrong or they are not in their place, but they impressed me a lot. Very creative to say the least, just not attractive, but I do not think they are supposed to be. I do not know if I am definitely not the target audience and I would never go to see a performance given by these kind of performers, but I would not go see a ballet or an opera, so I do not know. If it's your kind of movie, then you'll probably like it, but if it's not skipping it, it's because it's ... well not for most of us. I have just verified that he has won the Oscar of costume and I will say it rightly. I must say that Ebert was not very interested in this film either, although he liked it better than me.
