The casting (and staging) of Undercurrent is more tasteless than inspired by this black clunker that fails from the start. The wooden style of Robert Taylor poses an obstacle almost immediately to the very touched Kate Hepburn and his bad chemical composition from the start. <br /> <br /> The naive and innocent Ann Hamilton (Hepburn) succumbs to the handsome airplane maker Alan Garroway (Taylor) rushes to the altar with him. She soon discovers that there are many things she does not know about him. As Alan moves away, she plunges further into the troubled past and Ann is soon having a nightmare instead of the American dream. <br /> <br /> Undercurrent looks like some Hitchcock plots but Vincent Minnelli quickly finds he's not a master of the world. suspense. Hepburn is not a retractable violet and is hard to sell for a character more suited to the reluctant styles of Teresa Wright or Joan Fontaine. Minnelli never really succeeds in getting Kate to desperately delay Taylor's limited ability as an actor. His attempts appear as a silent Gish while Taylor's vast descent into madness takes on the sense of restraint, of Bela Lugosi. Robert Mitchum completes the mistake as a sensitive brother. Talk about stacking. <br /> <br /> The director of photography Karl Freund provides highly stylized black interiors, but Minnelli and his cast use the atmospheres gently and the tension remains lukewarm. With Minnelli far from his forte (musicals) and the victim role of Hepburn suiting him perfectly, Undercurrent drowns all participants.
