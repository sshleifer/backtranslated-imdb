I do not understand why two million Danes are sitting every week to watch this terrible show. The dialogue is terrible and not realistic. The characters are hollow and simplistic. There is a hard man, a hard woman and a sensitive man. The authors actually say that they modeled the characters according to Greek mythology! Leave me alone! All the characters are of course brilliant policemen. When I watched this show, I had long dreamed of "District Hill Street" and "NYPD Blue". These are brilliant shows, and "Rejseholdet" is an ugly copy. This program is a symptom of the illness currently afflicting Danish television.
