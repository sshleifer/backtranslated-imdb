I like to watch Robert Forster. This is the main reason why I rented this movie. I also wanted to see a story unfold in the middle of nowhere, where the characters could very well compete without distraction. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I found the film dull. I could not be interested in the characters. I could not be interested in the story that seemed to be nowhere. <br /> <br /> After watching this movie for an hour, I turned it off. I will note the film 4 out of 10. This falls well below the mandatory rating of 7 which makes an interesting movie to watch.
