If you're a fan of Pauly Shore, you'll laugh. Otherwise, it's a hell of a mess that wastes a very good talent. A cute student (Carla Gugino) from South Dakota invites her California Shore Councilor to share her Thanksgiving holiday. Outstanding cast members: Lane Smith, Cindy Pickett, Mason Adams and the superb Tiffani-Amber Thiessen. Look where you are walking.
