Irwin Allen, former cinematographer schlock master, skipped VOYAGE TO THE FOTTOM OF THE SEA. Walter Pidgeon, a very old man, who may have died when he played this role, is the commander of an atomic submarine the size of the Empire State Building. Each room is huge and some do not even seem to have a ceiling. You can play bowling and hold an official ball simultaneously in some of these halls. The submarine, called Seaview, is on its first run when hell is unleashed: Van Allen's radiation belt ignites and the Seaview must launch a missile into the belt at a certain time or the world will collapse. under the fire of the planet! Really terrible actors, borrowed on television, accompany the walk. That makes them hack-TV. The worst is probably that of poor Stella Stevens, Barbara Eden, Secretary of the Navy, slipped into clothes too tight, wearing high heels and acting as if it appeared in a film at the beach. Maybe that's because Frankie Avalon is also in the game. Joan Fontaine, almost unrecognizable, plays the role of a visiting physician with a big secret, but who cares? TRAVEL is a really bad movie designed for little kids, but what a child will stay still for endless shots of a miniature Seaview model moving again and again from right to left across the screen in what is obviously a tank of studio? There is not a single scene where we believe these people are actually aboard a submarine. When the Seaview trembles, the actors throw themselves, sometimes in opposite directions. As in the good old TV series STAR TREK, when the bridge is shaking. If I remember correctly, we do not see a fish or a creature of the sea - with the exception of an octopus that hangs momentarily on the submarine, a nod to 20,000 LEAGUES UNDER THE SEA. The octopus, if it were real, was probably about a foot long and it shows. Worse still, when people stand in front of the Seaview's glass noses, the ocean they are watching is obviously a close-up shot of an invisible air pipe spouting bubbles, probably filmed in an aquarium. You have never seen bigger bubbles in your life. You would think that these bubbles alone would break this cursed submarine. Unfortunately, Peter Lorre, an old man, is also in the game. Towards the end, when the missile enters the belt of fire, Lorre enthusiastically congratulates Pidgeon while all the others are still waiting for their replica to start shaking hands and kissing each other in victory. A scene to take if I have ever seen. What a stink. It's not even good to laugh. Paste with SILENT RUNNING.
