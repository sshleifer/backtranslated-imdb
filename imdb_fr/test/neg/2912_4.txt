Let's Get Tough is one of those movies that people will probably regret years later. Filled with jokes and racist jokes about Japan, this story from East End Kids explains how kids want to join the army to defeat the Japanese. As they are too young, they decide to clean the city of these despicable Japs. They find one, throw in fruit (without anyone doing anything to stop them) and he pulls a short sword to threaten them! The cops say to stop annoying him! He is only Chinese! He is on our side! When the children come back to apologize, the Chinese is dead! It's all part of this huge Japanese and Japanese spy ring! Children ensure that it is stopped at all costs! I'm sure everything was fine when it was made (1942), but now, you realize of course that this is clearly the product of his time. Full of stereotypes, German and Japanese. It's funny how the East End Kids have a black kid in the group and he is not spared either. Gee Whiz.
