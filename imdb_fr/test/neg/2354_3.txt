At the time of writing, IMDb rated Alfred Hitchcock's sub-saboteur as 7.3 / 10. Personally, I noticed it less than half. Honestly, I can not say how such a bad movie could have come from what is probably the best director to date. I saw about 10 other Hitch movies from the 30s and 60s. Vertigo is by far my favorite, Saboteur is by far the worst. It's hard to believe that 7 years earlier, Hitch used the same formula in The 39 Steps with much more skill. My recommendation would be to see this instead and avoid that as the plague. It's the only Hitchcock movie I've turned off before the end and I have no desire to go back and see the rest. If you have to watch it, rent or borrow. Do not make the mistake I made and buy the DVD in good faith from Notorious, Rebecca, Vertigo, back window, etc. Even a master sometimes messes up, I suppose. <br /> <br /> EDIT: Maybe I was a little more difficult on this film than I should have been. Ed Wood or Manos is certainly not up to the task, but I feel that I have to give it a low score for three reasons: <br /> <br /> 1) The name "Hitchcock" entails certain expectations in terms of quality. This film delivers some of them, but they are eclipsed by the accursed nonsensical plots. <br /> <br /> 2) I want to make up for the 8+ votes of this movie. . Hitchcock is like the John Coltrane of the administrators. Real fans will find reasons to consider anything from him as a work of art, but the high rating given to IMDb gives more casual moviegoers like me the impression that this film is much better than it it really is. <br /> <br /> 3) I spent $ 18 for this. Maybe if it cost me $ 5 or even $ 10, I would probably be a little less bitter. ;)
