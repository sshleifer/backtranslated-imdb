When Jan Svankmajer lets his imagination slip away, get ready. You'll love dark, heart-wrenching films such as "Alice" and "Little Otik", or gems such as "Down to the Cellar" and "Jabberwocky". These are all great movies that represent the best of bothersome and surreal film. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, when Svankmajer tries to make a political statement of any kind, you are advised to leave room in a hurry. Svankmajer's films in this sense tend to be both teenagers and preachers, presenting caricatures of strawmen repeatedly to express his pseudo-brilliant ideas. <br /> <br /> "Madness," is unfortunately this type of movie. Caricature ideas and characters are as thin as two hours. There are some moments that briefly hold interest, but these few oases are separated by vast deserts of boredom. <br /> <br /> If you find Svankmajer's awful and monotonous short film, "Et Cetera", brilliant and hilarious, you probably like "Lunacy." If you've never seen a Svankmajer movie, start somewhere else.
