I always say, "nothing beats a good movie". And I must say that it was nothing like a good movie! Dull, boring and tedious. It was like one of those bad dreams that never seem to end, no matter how hard you try to wake up. The concept of a film without words does not bother me (for example: entering a fantasy or fantasy world), but there must be something to capture your imagination, not just empty images, as this film is. There seemed to be no character development and he was jumping so fast that it was difficult to discern a story. (Was there even a story?) You could say that the actors were doing their best, but unfortunately, bad leadership has sabotaged the work of all actors. It really looked like a kind of cinematic masturbation ... existing only for the pleasure of the director and no one else. Big waste of time.
