Before I start tearing up this movie, mark yourself - I LOVE SCARLET PIMPERNEL. This story is one of the best romantic adventures ever written. The film with Jane Gray is very good and the Broadway musical is the hottest thing. So, I thought when I heard that this movie was going out, it would be great because it was a BBC movie. <br /> <br /> To my surprise, it was a faint and totally stupid story thatUTTLY failed to capture the beautiful tale. <br /> <br /> There was no thrilling escape with daring disguises. Percy left the room and Marguerite sighed as her husband left her again. <br /> <br /> There remained only one great love that made your heart beat. <br /> <br /> There remained only a confusing conspiracy and many blue sex and violence. <br /> <br /> Pour me! What a horrible movie! <br /> <br />
