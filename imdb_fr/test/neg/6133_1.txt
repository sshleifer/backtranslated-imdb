Okay, first I must say that I suppose it was done by a group of friends with a limited budget. With that in mind, it really should not be compared to the successful features and my rating would be higher. But still ... <br /> <br /> After giving his chance, he nevertheless violated some basic rules of filmmaking, to the point where the viewer and the amateur director in me had fear. A LOT. <br /> <br /> Think: Blair is a witch in a car, but REALLY boring. <br /> <br /> Think about it: you left your camcorder on the dashboard and you registered yourself losing yourself in a park at night An hour later, have it watched by your friends. <br /> <br /> The scariest part (POSSIBLE ALERT OF THE SPOILER ... IF THE TRAP IS POSSIBLE) was at some point, the picture is rewinding and you might think you will have to watch it all over again. SCARY. <br /> <br /> Foolishness aside, it's a great idea for a low-budget film to make a film tonight. But the concept does not make the difference between being really good and really bad, and let's just say it was not really good. There were just too many games where nothing happened. At first, I imagined it was the director's plan: you had to be appeased by a sense of security and really scary things would start to happen. But no. <br /> <br /> I kept looking for good lyrics (and I had plenty of time to think) and I would say the music was pretty cool. And I must give the main woman the merit of being alone to look scared for a very, very long time. But that's all. The actors playing "infected" seemed to make fun of zombie movies. Or they had their motivation from the Bug wearing his Edgar suit of "MIB". There is a good chance that if you watch this movie for a strange reason, it is on DVD or Tivo, so you can transfer it quickly whenever the wait for an event becomes too difficult. <br /> <br /> I hate to be so critical about something, but at the same time I watched a lot of similar movies and nothing was so painful. If they take half an hour and add scary stuff, maybe it's decent. Maybe it will be the director's cup ...
