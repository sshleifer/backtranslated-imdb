This film is awful, incredible. It's a useless bin with a small budget, badly written. But on Saturday afternoon, I stumbled on television, and I remembered one of the most entertaining stories I ever had on television. The wickedness of this movie is epic - maybe not epic Ed Wood, but close. The premise is hysterical (men are forbidden to be too dangerous and imprisoned in football stadiums), the culture of pseudo-dike is strangely strange (there is a clandestine sex trade with women who disguise themselves as men to serve " The "last man" of the title is a pitiful reincarnation of Rocky's Rocky Horror Picture Show, I did not have the chance to see the end, which I suppose was so dripping syrup "What did we all learn from this?" Nonsense, we would like to brush our teeth, but everything in the first two thirds was terribly bad, even if the last third turned out to be a pale imitation of the rest it's still worth it for anyone who kicks out of campy, stupid, b-sci-fi movies without brains.
