I usually like underground movies and anti-heroes but it's a bad joke. I wonder how we can call it a movie. All these people are losers and the filmmaker can not make them interesting. They are not funny, not tragic, but simply stupid and boring. <br /> <br /> Maybe I miss something, but I will not look at it anymore to find out what. Anyone with a camcorder can do better than that ... <br /> <br /> I give it a 1 for originality. All the rest is shit.
