It is a film that was probably made to entertain middle and high school students. Maybe for them it's funny, they can even see something scary. For me, the acting is mediocre, and the plot is poor, there is just not much value for the adult viewer. I saw this film as weak and boring. Sometimes it was possible that the film became interesting but it never really materialized. The creatures look good, but after seeing them for a few seconds, they do not seem to have any substance other than their appearance. Sometimes I did not know if the movie was trying to make another comedy attempt or was it just another horror attempt that was still failing. This movie was not good for me.
