There have been a lot of "spooky" westerns made in the '30s and early' 40s, and while it has a strong start, it is not. Randy Bowers (John Wayne) stopping in a "Halfway House" lounge, finds him full of corpses, the bartender's corpse draped over the bar holding a rifle, Randy's eyes watching behind holes sliced ​​into the player's eyes piano playing "The most beautiful night of the year". <br /> <br /> It was the result of a robbery by the gang of Marvin Black, to get the $ 30,000 Ed Rogers. Randy is an investigator who "works alone" and who loses little time getting caught, escaping (with the help of Ed's daughter, Sally) and literally landing in the middle of the black gang hideout, behind a waterfall. All advance quite quickly. Once again, Randy slows down. <br /> <br /> We even have George Hayes shaved and playing two roles - Marvin Black, the naughty villain, and the Good Citizen, Matt the Mute, who communicates via handwritten messages. Making it play two opposite roles was a good idea, but the writing of messages ages very quickly, even for him, because he ends up not doing it towards the end saying to Sally: "Oh, I'm sick of it " You can find George playing a vile, naughty, naughty double cross in the soap opera "The Lost City" (1934). <br /> <br /> I think it's the only movie "Lone Star" in which the title refers. , or is mentioned in the movie! Sally reaches out to Randy and says, "He's not alone anymore!" Then, they cut their arms and look at the lake. Sally goes with Randy, it seems too abrupt and not prepared enough. Too much time on horseback to escape the sheriff. <br /> <br /> Not bad if you consider everything, but not so great either. I would really give it a 4 and a half.
