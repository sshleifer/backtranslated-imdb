It is always interesting to watch a horror movie after hearing so much praise from other fans. Experience has taught me that one should never generalize the taste of fans in a genre. My expectations of this movie were much better than I thought. <br /> <br /> Children should not play with Dead Things, it's a movie with a good plot that trembles too often to bring it to a successful conclusion. The very idea of ​​a gang of actors staging a reanimation of dead corpses intrigued me. However, everything has degenerated into cinematic chaos. The actors, who for the most part were competent and incredibly expressive, have been offered roles that fail to maintain a consistent characterization. Some of these characters range from ambivalence about the complete act of profaning a cemetery, to frank criticism, to return to ambivalence. It's one thing for the characters to change their heart during the movie; it is another idea to produce an attitude that is too dynamic and circular, which turns in a loop every ten minutes. <br /> <br /> Another incoherent element of this film is the premise. Does the main protagonist want the ceremony to be a theatrical farce or does it really conspire with dark spiritual forces to resurrect the dead? Even with the flaws mentioned above, I would recommend this movie to other horror fans because I believe that only true horror fans will appreciate the dark atmospheric components and may ignore the inconsistencies of the plot. The scene where the dead come out of the grave is made extremely haunted (even by a zombie enthusiast) by the excellent combined use of landscapes and sound and by the large selection of skilled actors chosen to embody the resurrected dead. Current filmmakers should learn from CSPWDT to use audio and video techniques appropriate for mood development. <br /> <br /> In summary, if you are a zombie film completion like me, you have to take the time to locate it and view it. It's a fun watch.
