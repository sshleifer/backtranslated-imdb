Normally, I do not waste my time writing comments on that stuff that I almost forget as soon as I see them, but since I saw this movie yesterday on one of the Showtime comcast channels (346, I think), I decided to make an exception. <br /> <br /> Besides the fact that I loved watching Carol Alt, I can not give any rational reason to watch this movie until the end. I'm always amazed that pretty women are willing to appear in films as horrible as this one, but I guess she thought this film could do better. I hope she was right, for her sake. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, this is a typical riot of laughter, which looks like a video, or just a garbage can, depending on your point of view. Even though there are some decent action moments in this movie, they do not really fit the story as it is. <br /> <br /> The setup, if I remember correctly, involved Carol Alt, a depressed housewife who believes her husband, a policeman, is cheating on her. There was also something about the death of their child in an accident, and she blamed him for that, but before the plot went to nowhere, she shot and killed him. <br /> <br /> The same fateful night, a wounded stranger comes to his door and she tends him to him, and almost immediately his house is besieged by government mobsters and mercenaries determined to capture the stranger, who seems to have almost superhuman fighting skills. <br /> <br /> This same type of material has already had decent entertainment, including in The Bourne Identity Matt Damon, which could have been the case this time too, but this film was abandoned because of poor production values ​​and a lousy scenario. <br /> <br /> This movie really collapses in the end, when the mysterious stranger turns out to be a cyborg (!) programmed to be a policeman. After discovering that Carol Alt had killed her husband, he was trying to kill her! The film has not been particularly good so far, but the end really spoils it by trying to turn a modest action thriller into a chaotic Terminator / Robocop fanatic. <br /> <br /> I also thought that the movie was a little excessive at the end, the crazy cyborg tore poor Carol Alt's eye before he finally bit the dust. What was the purpose of this? Besides, what was the point of anything in this film? This caught my attention and entertained me for about an hour, until the end, when it reminded me that I was not watching a quality movie. It was not even really a second-rate movie, by the way. <br /> <br /> The final scenes seem to allude to a sequel, which, in my opinion, never happened, even though I did not carefully check the web for that. Needless to say, I'm in no hurry to see a sequel to this movie.
