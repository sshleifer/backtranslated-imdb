The plot involves a new hair salon, the hipper franchise, which moves across the street from Calvin's hair salon. Thus, he feels obliged to change and improve his store by buying new things, etc. That sounds really exciting huh. As for the rest of the film, it is largely the same material as that of the first film. The people at Calvin's work stand up, speak loudly and put their mouths on fire and the customers. Once again, Cedric the Entertainer was quite funny, but it sounds more like a stand-up routine than anything related to the movie. And Calvin is faced with another moral problem of taking a large sum of money. He has already shown that he will do the right thing at the end. <br /> <br /> FINAL VERDICT: Nothing new. I do not recommend it unless you think the first Barbershop was the best thing since sliced ​​bread.
