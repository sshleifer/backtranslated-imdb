A film about a mysterious love letter that puts a little town in the ear should be a fun, romantic and casual entertainment. Instead, this film is more about things that are not said and not expressed, so you're grateful for everything you say, even if the dialogue is not strictly speaking. <br /> <br /> SPOILER - <br /> <br /> When the relationship that says the most is the least visible on the screen (Danner and McEwan), you know you have problems. But these two actresses are welcome in a film that screams for some genuine people. <br /> <br /> END OF SPOILER <br /> <br /> Capshaw's task is to create a character from scratch and she has not quite succeeded. As I said above, the theme seems to be repression and I understand that it's an element of life and love, but I do not want to see a film about it either, at least not this one. <br /> <br /> I can not recommend it at all, despite the very talented cast that has to fend for itself.
