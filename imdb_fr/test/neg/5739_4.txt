This turned out to be a rare case of poliziottesco manufactured with UK funding; Unfortunately, the result is not distinguished (except by its extreme inconvenience and approach limit-camp) despite the stars and the director. The first is led by a wooden Franco Nero and an ultra-martyr Telly Savalas as two potential thieves (if anyone is able to believe either actor who generally exudes cool like a crooks duo stupid, he is more credulous than I am!). <br /> <br /> Their "work" goes wrong (ends in murder and struggles with cutlery cases instead of jewelry!) ?? However, incompatible criminals have their dilemma open when they inadvertently "kidnap" the son of a British diplomat (a Lester missed, who even manages to hit Savalas, embarrassed by the trigger, where it hurts at a time given). Yet they never buy it back and their only goal is to cross the border into France; Nero's girlfriend (Ely Galleani, a wasted) accompanies her: soon enough, she has enough and decides to run away while the others sleep; Madman Savalas notices it and, following the girl, kills her. In the meantime, Nero and Lester woke up ?? the first thinks that his accomplices may have doubled him, so he goes on an adventure with the boy in tow; After a brief period spent in the rich property of an old lady (who has nudges at the back totally free of Nero and Lester!), Savalas catches up with them. They continue their journey, where the trio meets a family of German campers: the situation degenerates to the point that Savalas locks them in their caravan and throws the ground in the river ?? although he is seriously injured in the process itself; As a rule, everything ends when the "heavyweights" are killed when they reach the border. <br /> <br /> The film contains most of the typical elements of the genre. search, sadism, violence, prosecution (the consequences of the first flight when the car of escape wreaks havoc in the narrow streets of the city and even disrupts a funeral procession is downright ridiculous), etc. A slightly interesting aspect is that, in the end, we see that Lester himself was definitely (irrevocably?) Marked by the experience ?? experience enthusiasm when an act of violence is committed.
