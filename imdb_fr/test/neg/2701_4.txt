So far, I did not like all Jean Rollin's films I saw, which always bothered me because it is a Euro-trash-acclaimed monument and is extremely popular among chroniclers usual on this charming website. people whose opinions I always appreciate and who I usually share. Apparently, everyone always seems to identify some kind of dark and stylistic shooting marks in his work that are completely lost to me. Rollin's films are incredibly boring, they all present the same basic concept (lesbian vampires in different contexts), the dialogues are incredibly absurd, the wonderful Gothic frame is still underused and the production values ​​are cheaper than the price a bus ticket. In fact, I had already abandoned Rollin's repertoire (especially after enduring "The Iron Rose"), until I learned about "Night of the Hunted". This movie would apparently have no lame lesbian vampire and would be a true horror movie with horrific murders and macabre twists. And the verdict is ?? Yes and no! On the one hand, it's undeniably the most convincing and inventive Rollin film I've had the pleasure of seeing so far (and also the only one I watch without getting drowsy?). On the other hand, there is still a silly movie with absurd intrigue and emotionless sex sequences to make up for monotony. Jean Rollin strongly tries to create an atmosphere of secrecy and suspense, mainly for lack of information and vaguely introduced characters, but can barely hide the fact that he has no real story to tell. The sublime lead actress Brigitte Lahaie and the magnificent threatening musical advice are the only elements that will keep you hooked on the screen. At night, when he was going home to Paris, a young man had to stop for a confused and scarcely dressed girl running out of the woods. Her name is Elisabeth, but moreover, she does not remember anything of herself, of what or who she fled. Her case of amnesia is so serious that she even forgets who has collected it. The next day, she is again kidnapped by an old man and taken to a grim apartment complex where several people in the same strange mental state are held captive. Elizabeth does not know anything, but she feels she has to escape from here. Obviously, I will not reveal the outcome, but I can assure you that it is quite stupid, illogical and far-fetched. Apparently, Rollin realized this too, because the explanation is very brief and quick. There are a lot of too strange and senseless sequences, sex sequences are terrible and filmed without passion, unpleasant makeup effects seem cheap and thrown at random with no real purpose. As said, the partition hypnotise and the perfect body of Brigitte Lahaie creates an addiction to ice.
