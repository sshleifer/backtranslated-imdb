then the second half of this film is hard to follow. I had the first part with the Spanish Investigation, but the film failed for many years with the French government Spain. The film does little to explain what happened, and I do not remember much. So, the movie becomes confused then. The film begins when Ines, the daughter of a rich merchant, is accused of Judaism by the church, more specifically by Father Lorenzo. She is put to the question and forced to confess. Even the wealth of her family can not get her out of prison. His father forces Lorenzo to sign confessions claiming he is the product of a chimpanzee, hoping to release Ines. All that means is to give a reason to the church to condemn Lorenzo, who fled to France. <br /> <br /> Then, the film spends many years and the French Revolution is in full swing. Ines is released from prison. It was a very good make-up job for Natalie Portman to look ripped. She finds her dead family and seeks help from Goya. She tells him that she had a child in prison. Goya organizes a meeting between her and Lorenzo, who is now with the French and in power. It's the father. Goya sees the girl and tells Lorenzo, who decides to send her to America, that nobody will know. But before his plans come to fruition, the British join the Spaniards. Spain regains power and is now persecuted. This part is not well told in the film. It's as if the film shows that it happened during a day. <br /> <br /> FINAL VERDICT: The film is good until it passes many years after the Inquistion, so it's waiting for you to understand what's going on. It became too confusing for me then.
