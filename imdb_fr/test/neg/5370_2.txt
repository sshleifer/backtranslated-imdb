Paranormal State, this show has a feeling almost of "Blairwitch Project". As you go along, you watch a "documentary" which is actually a movie written with a screenplay, designed to look like a documentary. <br /> <br /> My biggest problem with the series is their "forward" adviser to the Warren, made famous by their "investigations" into the Amityville murders, which turned out to be completely fraudulent, only from the police reports on the deaths of the family! (As the eldest daughter was actually involved in all this, to the point of perhaps even helping with some of the deaths!) Then there is the way they constantly jump to blame the demons. Not to mention that the group is haughty about the business it takes. They do not want to help those who need it the most, they just want the strangest cases, which will give them the most pressure and attention. <br /> <br /> These are complete, clear and simple frauds.
