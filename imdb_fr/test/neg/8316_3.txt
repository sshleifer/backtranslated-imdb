We could have done a lot of good things with this film using essentially the same scenery, the same plot and the same scenario. For example, why not plant a seed of Erica's ability before the murder of her lover? Why not develop the relationship between Erica and the police slowly and convincingly? Maybe we have to oppose to Eric's metamorphy another post-event facet, a relationship, etc., that she rejects now? Why not make him hurt an innocent bystander to point out the wrong done by Erica in his actions? <br /> <br /> TBO, on the contrary, exploits the fantasy of revenge at its maximum level, granting only sincere words to those who do not do it at home. messages sent only to allow the movie to qualify as legitimate. <br /> <br /> I'm not a fan of Jodie Foster. After playing in films like SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, NELL and the one in which she plays the mother of a child prodigy, Foster has slipped into a succession of roles in which she embodies the same hardened and harassed heroine who triumphs over wrong . It's a couple of times, but I get too used to its close-up "fight against theft" plan. TBO could have appealed to a younger actress or a more convincing actress who embraces a forty years (instead of 40 years old, playing the role of a younger woman). <br /> <br /> TBO is a film with important actors, funding and resources that manages to get down to junk food.
