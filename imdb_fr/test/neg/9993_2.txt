While reading the script online, I thought that "Capote" needed a fit. I just saw it on PPV, I can tell you that it was not cut, it was a butcher like this poor family! Example: In the script, Truman calls Shawn "Adorable One"; Here he is "Mr. Shawn". <br /> <br /> Fans of this film take off Capote and criticize his entourage (do we really believe that they have thought so little of Nelle, they mutilated opus as an unbearable joke?), they transform Perry Smith in such a sensitive victim, even as he showed he was shipping the Clutters. It is one thing to falsify the facts, another to drop the ball: the executions took place between 12:45 and 1:19 pm on April 14; Truman is shown at the prison 22 HOURS LATER! <br /> <br /> I was totally disappointed by the "acting game". Keener does not even try to look like a native of Alabama. The way Cooper kept shouting "Alvin!", I was waiting for the Chimpmunks to show up! Hoffman does not give us the charming fly, but a pathetic aspirant who sees a horrible act as his ticket for the big moment. When Hoffman complains of being "tortured" by endless calls, I wanted to give him a shotgun so he could serve both of us and blow his brains out!
