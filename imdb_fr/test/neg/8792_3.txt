It is painfully clear that all the efforts in this film have been directed towards cinematography and that he has paid little attention to everything else. The most obvious mistake is the poor dissemination of the entire female distribution. Many of them are very experienced and capable, but they all seemed out of place, and having an amateur director certainly did not help. The story is a very common story of Geisha, and the characters behaved very inconsistently, which makes it extremely difficult for me to connect with the heroine. <br /> <br /> The theme of this film is "modern prostitution", but it was still annoying to see that the main character of Tsuchiya Anna continued to speak as a member of a biker gang while everyone spoke old-fashioned in Japanese for this decor. This film has very beautiful bright colors, similar to the "Hero" of Zhang Yimou, but the viewers can easily say that it is shot in a complex and cheap scenery. <br /> <br /> The two sequences with the inserted songs of Shiina Ringo were really nice, in the middle of the film. In fact, I did not really like his music before, but they are perfectly suited to this movie. Although Ninagawa Mika is a complete failure as a director, she has significant potential in the production of video (video) music. <br /> <br /> I think the story was very clear, the director did not focus on the development of the character, and because Tsuchiya Anna acts unconvincingly as Oiran. If this film had been directed by a famous Jidaigeki director with another well-known actress in Japan, he would have had the potential to become a masterpiece.
