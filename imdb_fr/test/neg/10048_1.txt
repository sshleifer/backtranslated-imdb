The English translation of the title of the DVD version of this movie is "Graveyard of Horrors", but I think that must be a mistake. It should have been called "Cemetery of the Horrible". A horrible actor's act, a horrible editing, a horrible story and horrible music make this movie a horrible film that is best left in a horrible cemetery. <br /> <br /> Horrible.
