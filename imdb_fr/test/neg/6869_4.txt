Visitors is a difficult film to enjoy. It's so slow and slow in the rhythm that sometimes I go away during the movie. I would add that it was about 11 o'clock on a hot sunny day, so you have an idea of ​​how slow this movie is. <br /> <br /> Strange thing, it's not long. At 100 minutes, there are only ten minutes longer than the average in direct video, and fifteen minutes longer than the Darkwolf Superior whom I watched with pleasure watching the day before. It's dragging a lot, enough for you to lose interest. <br /> <br /> When one should not confuse the development of S-L-O-O-O with the atmosphere, the visitors are good enough in action to make the slow pace of things almost excusable. While flashbacks are both inexpensive and boring to complete Radha Mitchell's boat wife, the haunting / extraterrestrial / others are actually pretty scary and effective, especially when her suicidal mother arrives and starts to moan in the night. The perfect note for not having done makeup throughout the store. The single-seater boat is a scary place, and sometimes the film uses all the power of the place and the deserted sea to scare you. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, it's hard for me to recommend you. Visitors. I came out not only with the feeling of watching a movie of 4 hours, not 100 minutes, but also with the feeling of being cheated, while offering many explanations on the hauntings (Mind games? Real ghosts? Aliens ?) Visitors do not choose the one that is defined. Anyone who watched Radha Mitchell speak to her cat and Dominic Purcell covered themselves for no apparent reason with a horrible event unexplained in the past, for nothing? Say what you love about Shyamalan, but at least he tells you what happened, as crazy or stupid as you might think. If you do not watch a lot of these movies, your new perspective will probably improve things a bit, but I found it slow, boring and highly derivative. If you want to scare yourself, there are better places to do it, if you want a smart thriller, there are many who are smarter.
