This film was nil. From beginning to end, it was predictable. There was absolutely no chemistry between Pearce and the Mumba chick. The plot has come to nothing, floating in oblivion. All this made the film hilarious in its stupidity. And I wanted to strangle Orlando Jones, the guy just needs to leave.
