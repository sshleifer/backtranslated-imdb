The wind. Easily one of the worst movies ever made. The only benefit of this kind of useless hint is to see movies like this one get a cast that makes Indian horror filmmakers like me confident that my next feature film will be the subject too. I mean, if this represents the personal horror market, I could make a fortune by saving the waste myself for 83 minutes. <br /> <br /> A complete list of shortcomings in this film would take too long to write. But the highlights are: no history, dreadful actor, horrible cinematography and virtually no editing. The latter bothered me the most. As editor myself, this film made me absolutely crazy, because there was almost no editing. Each scene was shot in a master. They had absolutely no cover. For all those who do not know ... "Cover" records a scene from multiple angles for editing options while editing, making it a desirable viewing experience. Yes, this movie did not have any of that. I even speak of the simplest of scenes. Example: An ordinary conversation scene between two people sitting at a table usually begins with a master who is in the scene and where they are. Then, as the conversation continues, you will go back and forth over the shoulder throughout the conversation. You can even throw a punch or two of something on the table or in someone's hand. Whatever. This is "Movie 101" stuff guys. Looks like these people had no idea how movies work. Each shot was a locked camera. No movement, no cut, no nothing. If I were teaching a filmmaking course, it would be the visual aid of my lesson "What not to do". <br /> <br /> In closing, do not waste your time, my friends. The only thing amazing about this movie is that it has never recorded a cast. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
