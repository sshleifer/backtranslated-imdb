An epic of Roger Corman dating from 1957, in which many characters are found in a valley lined with lead (sic) at the moment when a stock of thermo-nuclear images is triggered. It's the end of the world. Four armed men, two women (an unmarried virgin, another from Las Vegas, who drinks and smokes - guess who goes to the end of the film?) Time passes, tensions develop (or are supposed to become ). Something in the woods eats radioactive rabbits. A mutant monster! Seven weeks of radioactive dust produced "a million years of evolution" (on an already living human). The result is a ridiculously bad monster, who zaps his back, a rubber monster who is strangely afraid of their only source of fresh water. It is raining. The monster dissolves. The two remaining characters, the piece and the Virgin. to repopulate the world when the legend "The Beginning" fills the screen after it appears that the brief shower of rain had washed away all the radioactivity and dissolved all the monsters running "over there". <br /> <br /> The only thing worth noting about this is the incredible amount of "curtains" that reigns there. The excessive use of curtains in the scenography is one of the basic elements of making films for small budgets. It was not expensive. You're done with a montage? Pull a curtain, drop a different piece of furniture in front of you and you'll have a different place in a few minutes without having to move the camera or change the lighting. <br /> <br /> "The game of the curtains" is a skill the actor will be able to comment what happens outside of any building in which it is ("It looks like it's raining", or " Here they are now, and it looks like they have the sheriff with them! ", That sort of thing). To do this, he stands on the side of the window - across his body and lifting the curtain, but along the axis of the shot - that is to say toward the camera - him allowing us to pretend to watch and tell us what is happening off the screen, without letting the audience see that he is looking at the studio wall three centimeters from his nose behind cheap velvet curtains. There was a lot of that in this movie.
