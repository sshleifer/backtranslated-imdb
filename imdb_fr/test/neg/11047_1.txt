It seems that some viewers assume that graphic violence is the only thing that can make the viewer hate this movie. In fact, the violence, both disturbing and caricatural, is the last of the deep flaws of "Oldboy". The characters are one-dimensional, underdeveloped, primitive. Intensity, an obsession and a goal in itself with this director, is served with the least expensive way. Do not confuse a stupid adrenaline shot with artistic value. At the end of the film, it seems that all the cards are exhausted and the scenario becomes almost inadvertently funny in its efforts to find new levels of "horror", to continue to "shock" an audience already numbed by the plethora of Silent "revelations" in soap operas already served in large clusters. It would be difficult to imagine anyone even vaguely familiar with the masterpieces of the last fifty years of Asian cinema be fascinated by this pompous waste. Imagine Homer Simpson hesitating in front of the movie theater: "Should I enter or should I buy five ice cream cones for the same price?" Be smart, Homer, go get the ice cream.
