I am a big fan of comedy. Racial humor is always a little risky but big ones like George Lopez, Dave Chapel, Lisa Lampanelli, etc. are doing fine. <br /> <br /> They do not go too far, do not make the audience uncomfortable or * cough * STEAL JOKES! But I will not come back on it. <br /> <br /> Carlos makes racial humor totally inimitable. His jokes constantly shout at racial humor to the point where it's neither funny nor clever, but it's insulting. I'm not one to turn cold to racial humor. But his execution of these jokes is sloppy, which makes people back in front of his comedy. <br /> <br /> His humor is surpassed only by his stage presence in the contrariety. I have the impression that he is constantly scrutinizing me! And he runs around the stage like a maniac. It only comes as boring!
