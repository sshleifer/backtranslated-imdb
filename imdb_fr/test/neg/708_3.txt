This movie was hard to watch for me. Stan looked very old and sick compared to what I remembered, and Ollie was heavier than I'll ever remember in another movie. The most difficult part, however, was the shortcomings in the screenplay / production where I asked myself: "How did they get from here?" It took almost half of the film before it could double the dubbing of non-American actors - it was also a source of distraction. <br /> <br /> Even if I miss big actors such as Laurel and Hardy - will there ever be big actors like those of the old studio ??? - This film helps me to understand why the actors "withdraw" sometimes at their best.
