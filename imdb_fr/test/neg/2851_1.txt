I must first say that I really like Udo Kier and I always had respect for Armand Assante, but nothing could save this sinking of a film. Udo only appears much later in the film and everyone's acting is just terrible. The script is everywhere, the dialogue is wooden, "the action" is laughable and the plot could be summed up on a dirty cocktail napkin. I really wanted to find something that redeemed in this movie, but I found myself holding my hands in front of my eyes, shaking my head and repeating again and again: "Oh Udo ..... why ???. ... Why ?? ??? .. ". If you are a fan of Udo or Armand, please do not watch this movie. It will only make you sad for them.
