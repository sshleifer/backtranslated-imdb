The Great War breaks out and Daddy is a brave pilot who goes to great lengths to put Jerry in his place. Mom does her job as a nurse. The five children are then evacuated to their wacky uncle in the country, where a secret passage leads them to a mischievous sand fairy and the beginning of a magical adventure. <br /> <br /> Based on a book written a century ago, they no longer make stories like this one. And there is a reason. Men fly planes and authors' books; women change bandages and clean up. Boys lead the way with their compasses and their nights off; the girls do what they are told and play the violin - badly. Big kids with specs are mean. All the children speak in these cut accents, flattening the vowels, primitive but that cultivates a certain economic class of the English people. In addition to Imperial Albion's snobbery and imperious desire, there are holes in the ground that a five-year-old child would not tolerate. I mean literally - my son was asking why his father had disappeared before sunset, why the compass did not fall on him when he disappeared. The film tries to at least target children strictly, until a totally inappropriate and unusual monologue by Eddie Izzard (what a waste of real comic talent) plays on the final credits. British schoolchildren attending expensive public schools in the United Kingdom will find all this whistling. For the other 95% of British families who no longer live in the nineteenth century, the good news is that Wall-E, Ratatouille and Wallace and Gromit are all released on DVD.
