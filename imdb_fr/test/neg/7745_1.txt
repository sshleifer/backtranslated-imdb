In 1990, I saw Kathy Ireland in person. I was at UNT in Denton while filming "Necessary Roughness". Curiously, the voice she uses in this film is not very far from her true voice. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the plot is this: Kathy receives a letter informing her that her father has fallen into a bottomless pit in Africa. She goes on the spot to investigate the site of the death of her father, to let herself be dragged into an underground world at once nightmarish and dystopian, at once fantastic and without fantasies, and populated by rejections of the Plasmatic. This movie is really wasting the talent of Linda Kerridge, who, in my opinion, could have been someone if she had had that important role that suited her. Anyway, the main hero of the story, Gus, is a very lame scam of Mark "Jacko" Jackson. The original is pretty boring to start with, but this guy is really a torture to watch. Finally, the naive Wanda comes out of her shell and ends up wearing a bikini top and a sarong at the end. If you want to have Kathy Ireland in a film with thin clothes, it would be better to be a bikini. Anyway, the movie was bad in every way and rightly put through by MST3K. <br /> <br /> Avoid this one if possible.
