I like science fiction as much as the next man ?? but what was that? Apparently shot on just three days using the surplus film from his previous film, 'Nana (1926)', this short film by Jean Renoir is a confusing futuristic satire, produced with a budget that could not be more than zero. In 2028, following a great war, Africa became the most civilized region of the planet and the old Europe was designated "Unknown Lands". An African explorer ?? played by Johnny Huggins, a black man disguised as a white man disguised as a black man, if you are me ?? goes to the ruins of Paris in his spherical plane and lands outside the lair of a Parisian savage (Catherine Hessling, then wife of the director) and his primate companion, perhaps the most frightening monkey disguise I have never seen. The wild, as part of a bizarre sexual initiation ritual, begins to show the explorer the Charleston dance, which he is delighted to learn himself. <br /> <br /> It does not help the film that Hessling, who was wonderful The following year, in Renoir's The Little Match Girl (1928), is not really a dancer, although the Intensive use of slow motion adds a touch of surrealism to the ceremony. In addition, I'm pretty shocked that Renoir exploits his own wife as a blatant sex object ?? It is not a surprise to learn that their divorce took place three years later! On the plus side, I liked the general concept of science fiction behind the film and the slyly satirical touch of the reversal of racial roles typically typical in stories like this. However, the reason why Renoir decided to dress his black actor like a minstrel will remain a mystery for all time. Stupid, crude and useless, "Charleston Parade (1927)" is a cinematic quirk of one of the most respected movie directors, and perhaps an effort he would have liked to forget. The DVD version came without a musical soundtrack, but I chose a selection of tracks by Dmitri Shostakovich.
