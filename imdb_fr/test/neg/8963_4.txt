**** SWEET SPOILERS _ BUT YOU KNOW PROBABLY THE GROUND **** <br /> <br /> A woman is raped and decides to overcome his anger against all humanity. Oh, did I mention that the rape victim was dumb? This is the problem of MS 45. Thana, the rape victim decides to kill men, but is there a logical explanation for this? The film would surely have been better if we had asked Thana to explain to us why she is attacking a man she meets? There is simply not enough development for this plot <br /> <br /> As you would expect from a Ferrara movie, it's not a total waste of time. it's much better than I spit on your grave and the pseudo-intellectuals will have a busy day highlighting the irony of the woman holding a knife like a penis while Thana embarks on a killing in the end. But the scenario is a bit silly and underdeveloped and prevents any serious comment that the film could have made.
