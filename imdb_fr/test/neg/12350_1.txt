Not a balanced point of view. The director should not express her opinion as a truth. The film has some Fujimori reviews but it still gives him and his family the last words. So few Fujimori critics were informed that it seemed that the only reason they were included was to be able to say that the film offered both views. But this is not the case. <br /> <br /> The film hardly shows one of the massacres of which Fujimori is accused. And that gives him credit for the killing of the MRTA insurgents who took the Japanese embassy. It is well documented that the CIA has planned. There are even pictures of a well-known CIA strategist published on the site by Caretas magazine and other newspapers. <br /> <br /> The fact that the director did not use this well-known information allows us to draw some conclusions: the director is pro-Fujimori and chooses deliberately and falsely to give him credit; the director does not want viewers to notice that the CIA and Fujimori have worked together; or it was simply ignorant because the director is not Peruvian and was not present in Peru at the time of the events. <br /> <br /> The explanation provided by other commentators, that Fujimori is still quite popular in Peru, does not excuse the lack of precision and balanced explanations. <br /> <br /> In addition, the statistics provided in the film for Fujimori's real support are the highest I've ever heard. Most statistics from the main survey agencies are much lower. <br /> <br /> Another point to mention is that the intelligence that played a key role in the capture of the Sendero leader and the discovery of the secret network was carried out by a police force led by Ketin Vidal and his complete autonomy compared to Fujimori and Montesinos. <br /> <br /> The first Fujimori government has seen an improvement in the economic situation (GDP), but this improvement has been financed by the privatization of several national contract industries that are not beneficial to the country in the long run. term. In addition, the gap between rich and poor continued to widen under the Fujimori regime. During his second term, the economy was suffering and there was nothing left to privatize. By the end of Fujimori's second term, the economy was on the verge of collapse. <br /> <br /> When it comes to Fujimori's infrastructure investments, they are lying idle to the paternalistic model. They were created to increase support for Fujimori but did not last long. These structures required ongoing maintenance, but Fujimori did not give political power to civilians to demand new investments. In fact, the Fujimori regime was able to destroy most forms of political organization such as trade unions and grassroots groups and the increase in the number of unorganized informal workers was immense. <br /> <br /> Finally, the director chooses to spend the bulk of the film talking to Fujimori instead of citing cases of massive corruption in favor of Fujimori (the media, business owners, military, etc.) that were so widespread that it was impossible for Fujimori to be unaware of it.
