Has anyone found the plot somewhere in the movie? Perhaps this is the missing thing in this pretentious film-making exercise. It is quite surprising that Gordon says that "a film without intrigue is nothing" ... It is possible that the characters have more to say than the own Wim Wenders. Was this sentence in the original plot or did the actor decide to send a clue to the director?
