The story was disjointed, the acting was not a call that you can catalog. More of a serial driver than a real movie. I wanted to love this movie but I could not find anything that could like it. Anything that made the lost boys so friendly was obviously missing here. Although it was difficult. The hooks on the plot were clumsily placed in the middle of what might have been an episode of Dawson Creek with dark clothing, and the narrative arc was soon gone nowhere. Very disappointing for me. The end scenes were special effects focused on convenience and how the villain of the story planned his whole scheme. Who was he (or she) trying to be a child, did he speak naively? Stay with movies like that from the 80s, when they had more than one idea.
