Two things have changed since. First of all, I'm no longer a kid, and second, most of Seagal's new movies are just awful. This is in my opinion the worst film ever made with Derailed with Jean Claude Van Damme. In this movie, the plot is only an excuse to shoot action scenes appalling and painful to watch. I love action movies, but it's not an action movie ... It's not a movie ... it's a group of annoying scenes that are annoyingly connected to kill the moviegoers love the action movies. I'm sorry but I have no respect for those who loved this movie.He has a serious intelligence problem then.I hope Seagal will make new good movies in the future. Good luck for him!
