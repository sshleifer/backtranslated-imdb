The King of James Marsh is a movie that mystifies me. I can not think of what its meant to be. This is the story of a young man named Elvis, played by Gael Garcia Bernal, who gets a decent discharge after 3 years of service in the Navy, then goes back to his biological father and behaves dishonestly with he and his family. It's really rather sick. Elvis makes his way through the family, seducing his 16-year-old sister Malerie (Pell James). It is rather impossible to identify with anyone in this film from Great Britain. Father preacher and Christian congregation cheerful and dynamic; I could not know if the movie was supposed to ridicule them for their insane beliefs. Or is the target the happy family and we are supposed to think that it is not viable. Or is it just saying that some people are lost and that hell is determined to destroy. It's shallow. We all know that bad things happen; the interesting thing is to learn why but this film simply describes a violence without ever revealing the thought that led to it. "The king" is such a missed opportunity. There are some very interesting questions about honor. the warrior's code; changing concepts of value; honor killings in Indian families and so on. Honor is a very varied concept. But this film adds nothing to the notion. However, Paul the Projectionist did more than his meager role suggests. The DVD Projector showed all the films in a green tint and the only way to fix it was to send it to Belgium. He did it until Christmas. I think these postmen and repairers and Paul went well beyond the call of duty and our reward was this dark movie. But you could see it differently?
