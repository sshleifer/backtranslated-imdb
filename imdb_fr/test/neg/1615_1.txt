Greetings; <br /> <br /> I never thought I would see the day when I would be so disgusted by A movie that it would be a burden to finish it ... I've always been a fan of horror movies, B ' C and C are included. But in this case, it is difficult to describe how a film might not qualify for letters of this magnitude ... <br /> <br /> The film is centered on an undeveloped story, a mixture of folklore with taste. And to top it off, the performance of the actors is debatable. B horror movies generally fall into two categories ... 1) An underrated and underfunded jewel 2) Never mind, it's funny, laugh or money back. Well, this movie is between. I was not scared, I did not laugh ... So, if you really need to see it, you can do it, but I recommend you do not ...
