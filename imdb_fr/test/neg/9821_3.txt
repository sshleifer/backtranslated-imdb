The book gets 10 out of 10 stars ... <br /> <br /> CONTAINS PROBABLY THE DIFFERENT BOTH THE BOOK AND THE MOVIE !!! <br /> <br /> If you've never read the villain of Geoffrey Household, Man Hunt's source material, you'll probably appreciate Fritz Lang's treatment of the story. On the other hand, if you are in my camp and have practically memorized the book, the film will be a cruel disappointment. I assume that you have already read a summary of the story and I am going to complain. Household's little novel is one of the great classics of all-time suspense, tense and sparse, with only a handful of characters to propel the action. Fritz Lang and his screenwriter, Dudley Nichols, feel the need to incorporate the protagonist's brother and a nice floozy, the latter reducing the depth of the story by injecting extrinsic motivation into the scenario where the novel did not need it . In reality, the true culmination of the book was not the escape of the nameless narrator, but his self-acceptance of the true motive for which she was hunting. And it's another thing: if David Fincher and Quentin Tarantino can lead us to the end of Fight Club and Kill Bill 1 without revealing the names of their respective protagonists, why not Lang? "Thorndyke?" From what hat did they shoot that? Which brings me to my most bitter complaint: Household's hunter is so British that he would bleed a Union Jack if you cut him off. But Walter Pigeon, who plays it, is Canadian! He can barely maintain the accent, which is only slightly deeper and more convincing than that of Kevin Costner in Robin Hood. He looked good in the role, and was a good actor for the 1940s, but as a reluctant hero of Rogue Male? Let's look at Sceptered Island for a more compelling version. Remake soon with subtlety and with, please! I will direct it for free ??
