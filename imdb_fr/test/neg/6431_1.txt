11:11 pm Hell's Gate (2004) is another bad horror movie that tries too much to be what it is not. A girl has an imaginary playmate. One day, while playing with her friends in the fields, a couple of fugitives visit her parents and kidnap them for no apparent reason. The girl runs away and hides evil men. Years later, the girl becomes a woman with problems. The losers at her school (who look like repressed homosexuals) display their manhood before her when she rejected one of them. The girls hate her and life in general is miserable for her. A secret from his past visits him. Who or what is it? Why does everyone hate her? What is the problem of his guardian with her? To find out, you will have to watch Hell's Gate. <br /> <br /> The new title makes absolutely no sense. I do not know why people have money to make such bad movies. This film is not even good enough to make fun of. It is a headache that causes a disorder that will confuse anyone who tries to make sense of it. Not worth your time. <br /> <br /> Not recommended.
