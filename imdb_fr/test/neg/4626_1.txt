I saw this on the Sci-Fi channel, so I knew it would be bad to start, but I was surprised to see how bad it was. The effects of CG on the dragon were terrible even for the Sci-Fi channel and the writing was pathetic. I could not tell if it was supposed to be as stupid as a joke or if it was like that. The only quality that redeems this film is that it is so horrible that it's almost funny, especially in the part where the character of Patrick Swayze returns to his father, a knight who retired after losing his legs and who is now bedridden in his armor. to let the public know he was a knight. The majority of the film focuses on a huge dragon egg that turns into a not so huge dragon baby with some of the worst CGI I've ever seen. It was just horrible.
