The frenetic, somewhat naughty, infantile childhood humor abounds in this city dweller who has become a peasant tale. It's not scandalous enough to call upon Will Ferrell's crowd, nor interesting enough to wear the length. The most that I can praise for "His In Law" would be to say that, overall, he avoids toilet humor. The main problem is that all the characters lack heat and Pauly Shore is so abrasive that he is a most inimitable hero. There are a few fun things involving farm animals, and that's about it. The story, whatever it is, is so simplistic and predictable that it gives the impression that "Jury Duty" looks like "Gone with the Wind". - MERK
