We were excited to praise this one after reading a few reviews and found that it had done so well here. Well, we got it at home and could not believe what we saw. It basically comes down to saying that it's written by a perverted old man who could not help but insert his frustrations and sexual fantasies into an anime movie that is really lacking in intrigue and humor. The main character is everywhere ... for a moment, he is like an immature child, the next moment he is mature and intelligent, then heroic, then a perverse stalker. <br /> <br /> The worst is all the sexual content irrelevant. I have no problem with sex and digging a movie that has good sexual energy, but this is presented in a frightening way. The nipple slips, close-ups of the girls' crotch (several times) in white panties or swimsuits. It was totally out of place and it seemed that the person who was writing it was trying to live fantasies through his cartoon characters. <br /> <br /> We were expecting something mature, but we just looked at each other and we wondered what was the point of this thing ... except to move the breasts of the comics and interfere with the dialogue. If you want to see cartoon characters like cleavage and crotch ... it's for you. If you are looking for something else, this movie was empty. The characters and the dialogue were just irritating. <br /> <br />
