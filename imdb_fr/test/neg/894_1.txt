(Spoilers Ahead!) This exact same plot of this movie was made before. This was done during Ferris Bueller's day off! Brands "Bat Man" Houston plays ill. His credulous parents believe him. His sister knows he's pretending, but she still has to go to school! She's crazy. He's having fun with his friends when his parents are away. By the time his parents come home, he is sick again and his parents are never aware of the party. I like Immature better when they were at House Party 3 and still immature!
