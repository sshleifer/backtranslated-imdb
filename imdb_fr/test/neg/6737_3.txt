I hope this was done before Half Past Dead and Exit Wounds because it was rubbish, Seagal was not to blame, it was because of the shitty direction when the few action scenes took place place. The plot was also confusing and just felt hasty, maybe it was put away to take advantage of new Seagals movies? <br /> <br /> 3/10 <br /> <br /> Bring Under Siege 3 and lose weight!
