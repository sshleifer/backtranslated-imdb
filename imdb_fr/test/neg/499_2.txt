You must recognize Cimino's contribution to the cinema. He gave us both the most overrated film in history (The Deer Hunter) and the worst movie in history (Heaven's Gate). And before you start with "It's bad but not the worst," let me explain. <br /> <br /> For more than 20 years, I listened to critics and avoided "Heaven's Gate". In fact, it has not been difficult because you are hardly bombarded with opportunities to watch this film. A few days after watching the documentary "Final Cut: Building and Destroying Heaven's Gate," I came across a $ 9.99 used DVD of the long version. My advice, after 229 minutes, is to search for the most negative criticism ever written about this film (you will find a wide selection) and to imagine that criticism is the devoted mother of Cimino and that she does everything who is in his power to give a positive direction to the film of his dear son. You will then have an idea of ​​all that Cimino has made big mess. <br /> <br /> Although this film is pretty much all wrong, which ultimately tipped the scales to make it even worse (and a classic than zero 'example) is its cheeky deformation of the history. Although the breeder association has sent a group of gunmen / regulators to Johnson County and has a list of targeted names, the facts of an interesting historical event are grossly exaggerated. On the morning of April 9, 1892, Nick Ray and Nate Champion were besieged and eventually killed by an army of about 50 cattle ranchers, and Texas rents weapons that came to Johnson County to clean the "thieves". County citizens then besieged the regulators who were eventually arrested (or rescued) by the military. Women were not actively involved in the fighting, and apart from Ray and Champion, the number of victims was minimal. After all, they were seats and not attacks - and there were no carts of immigrants around the encampment of regulations (the first westerns, on the contrary, were a device for making film and not a real tactic of the Indians). And a few weeks before regulators arrived, a number of Johnson County residents were hanged without trial, including roadside ranger Jim Averell and his wife Ella Watson (whom Cimino resurrects). as his two leaders and even showing Averell alive). at an advanced age). <br /> <br /> There is no greater cinematic sin than the fictional story. If you want to play with historical facts without moderation, change the names and locations to protect unsuspecting viewers who might get away from a movie believing that what they saw really happened. Fortunately, so few people saw this film that the damage was minimal. Maybe it's hard to blame Cimino for distorting the story. Anyway, he could probably escape blame with a defense against madness - the film provides a lot of support. If Cimino was crazy during the production of Heaven's Gate, that would explain a lot of things. But my vote goes to "lack of leadership talent" instead of madness. <br /> <br /> There are good things about Heaven's Gate. You can actually see on the screen where part of the huge budget went; expensive sets - beautiful epic camera shots - clever dance sequences. Isabelle Huppert (a strange casting choice that actually worked) gives a nice and enjoyable performance although most of her scenes are extremely boring (which tends to happen when the director forgets to give the viewer a reason to worry characters). The dialogue is generally sound, although rather ordinary. <br /> <br /> But do not be afraid that this film will experiment with storytelling by mixing carefully designed moments of character interaction with community action blasts that look like historical re-enactments. This implies that there was a method to Cimino madness. "Experiences" is another word used when a filmmaker is so lost in his project that a coherent story is no longer possible. The simple fact is that there is no evidence that Cimino has scripted a scene or attempted control or organization. It's like what he just let his director do on stage and get an infinite selection of colorful shots - 1.5 million feet of vaguely staged scenes. Then he tried (unsuccessfully) to reduce that and integrate everything into post-production. <br /> <br /> The final scene of the battle is truly hilarious, as Babushka carries city cars (perhaps borrowed from a touring company "Fiddler On The Roof") throws innumerable sticks of dynamite on the regulators . Unfortunately, each explosive falls just below the target and explodes safely. Once you see this happening 50 to 60 times, you can talk to the woman (the one that looks like something from 'Grapes of Anger') that puts a huge gun in her mouth and pulls the trigger. This is probably what Cimino's mother did after writing this review. <br /> <br /> So, believe what you hear about this movie since 1980. It's a botched mess, disconnected, badly paced and historically distorted. An interesting example for film historians and a way to entertain those who know the history of the American West.
