Oh man. Movies like that really bother me. If this movie is supposed to close to the truth, then I guess Rommel knew Hitler for a time before the start of the Second World War. In the film, Rommel mentions how Hitler had changed in the past. Well, I can not imagine that Rommel would have known nothing about Hitler's government policy. Rommel must therefore feel guilty of the atrocities committed by the Germans. Keeping this in mind, I have a problem with a film that makes Rommel's life a tragic end. He made his choices and we must feel bad for him? I can not do it Nor can I subscribe to the theory that, if the most competent generals were allowed to wage war, the allies would have had more difficulty winning it. If more competent people were in charge, the Second World War might never have started. From the cinema point of view, the film jumps from one place to another and most of the time resembles a history special with actors from big names playing historical roles. Leo G. Carroll has some good scenes with James Mason and I liked the fact that everyone spoke English without the ridiculous accents. But other than that not very essential.
