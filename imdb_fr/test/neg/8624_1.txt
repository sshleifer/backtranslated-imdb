This movie was so badly played. What was with Jeff Bridges' accent, horrible and incredible. Was it supposed to be French, Scandinavian? The scenario was lame. Have the heroine travel to the grave of her boyfriend by fleeing the character of Jeff Bridges ... You're kidding me? As it is convenient for Jeff to bring his dirty shovel home after placing bodies in his lawn. Do these people just do not believe in calling the cops? Ok ... I'll get in the car with you, why not? DUH! Why was Bridge's daughter obsessed with making her father an affair, is her mother so mean or just dull? I did not see the original, it would be difficult to do after watching this movie.
