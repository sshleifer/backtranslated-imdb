Why do people make bad movies? Did not someone working on the picture know that what they were doing was irrelevant? There is something in this picture that has thrown me off, besides the fact that I found this "film" unrealistic, pathetic and WEAKLY ACTED. I admire them for the test, but the "actors" of the film sometimes seem to be too hard and no character has substance or say anything intelligent. This film deserves zero stars. But I did not have this option, so it gives a 1.
