The success of the original French series "Emmanuelle" (I only looked at the first, which was not so bad considering the considerations that followed) led to a wave of imitations; the Italian counterpart, who even changed the race of her heroine, was much less polite and more exploitative - she descended more and more into vulgarity throughout the series. Incredibly, there were 16 "Black Emanuelle" movies in total, the heroine having even changed the spelling of her name to avoid copyright issues !! Still, Laura Gemser - the main object of desire - has become almost an icon of the first Emmanuelle, Sylvia Kristel (though, personally, she is too skinny for my taste)! Here, she is even presented as "Emanuelle" rather than with her real name - with the director, becoming likewise "Albert Thomas"! <br /> <br /> In itself, the film is of little interest: in fact, it would be better to approach it as a travelogue presenting images worthy of African fauna. As for the sex scenes, I do not know how much the version I looked at was complete, but even though there was a lot of nudity, it was not very explicit - or even titillating ( the scene that has come closest, perhaps, to Gemser - who works as a photographer - and his girlfriend Karin Schubert are turning to each other, naturally without clothes, in the middle of the jungle! The film also features an artist made to look like Salvador Dali but, fortunately perhaps, his scenes do not take much time. The score of Nico Fidenco is typically pop and bland 70s and, in reality, nothing of writing.
