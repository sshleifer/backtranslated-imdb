It is fascinating to see how this title manages to draw the attention of the average viewer as a novelty and revolution (citing some of the comments). Murali K. Thalluri must have said to himself: "Oh, awesome, Elephant ... what a fantastic movie I'm going to try to do exactly the same movie and see if anyone notices it!", Unfortunately he even failed with his scandalous idea. The film turns out to be a complete failure. Considering that he does his best to capture Gus Van Sants' "Elephant" brilliance, it makes him even more ridiculous - a most embarrassing faux-pas for a filmmaker. <br /> <br /> The film begins with the suicide of a student in the bathroom of the school. This scene already shows the delicate skills at play of each of the actors of this scene. You do not buy a single word they say. In continuous, interrupted by short named pieces interviewing children who "live on their lives marry" with each rather scary bit in his simple stupidity on the basis of each worthless monologue. Thalluri wants to present the characters in this way, to give a sort of quick vision of junk food in their hearts ... and fails again. Five minutes later, Thalluri finally shouted, "Yes, people, I stole this movie and, for some curious reason, I'm proud of it!" taking over from Gus Van Sants the most characteristic narrative style of "Elephant": he shot scenes twice to allow the viewer to follow each character involved in a scene of his style and his role in a school situation. Hm, does not that sound terribly familiar to you? For me, this tolerant tolerance had been violated to such an extent that I could not stand this dreadful movie anymore. Shame on you, Murali K. Thalluri, I say! I am particularly surprised that "2:37" has reached the official selections in Cannes from 2006, while everyone certainly remembers "Elephant" (2003) at the same Film Festival a few years ago! So, how in the name of the Lord, was this most outrageous scam shown here? This error leaves me absolutely perplexed. <br /> <br /> Directors like Thalluri use the ignorance of audiences who are not (and can not be completely conscious) of all independent films. As Elephant has little to do with traditional cinema (although it is certainly a masterpiece), few people realize that the story told in "2:37" had already been told! I can not say how this is possible in a film festival of such importance as that attributed to Cannes. It is sad and shameful that such things are transmitted and almost no one sees the real fraud in it. <br/> <br /> 2:37 is only of a commercial nature, worthless as an independent film and (at some level) rather a fake parody of its obvious idol, "Elephant".
