I just watched Fingersmith, and I'm stunned to see the average score of 8/10 for the show. <br /> <br /> Not only was the plot difficult to follow, but it seems that the development of the character was applied randomly. . <br /> <br /> The actors were adequate, but in the process of creating twists, their characters are rendered entirely one-dimensional.

Two stars for tonsil hockey in the previous scene that was at least a little steamy, none for the rest ...
