European films are perhaps slower and less intriguing than American films, but it goes far too far. It also shows a whole lot of incompletely drawn characters doing inexplicable things. It's not fantasy, it's not even surrealistic, it's just clumsy and bad. <br /> <br /> What is the message here? That people in France are pensive and look very morose? Do they like to watch others have sex? Do they scream or spontaneously touch a stranger on his neck? Do not wear a watch while watching this movie, as you will be amazed at the lack of explanation and knowledge over long periods of time. <br /> <br /> It's the story of a deeply troubled "police commissioner". by the brutal murder of a little girl, although in reality, he seems troubled before. He is not only offended by his own personal tragedies, he also seems very slow mentally, behaving very well like a six year old with learning difficulties. He stares a lot, walks with rigid arms like a little child, speaks softly, whispers, his tone, behaves strangely enough in all his interactions (although no one seems to notice or care, even if it is supposed to be the responsibility of the police.) He is not a troubled policeman, not an outpatient. Imagine Andy Kaufman's Latka character in Taxi, but without the humor. Not only is he not credible as a policeman, he is not credible as an adult. The fact that he won an award for this interpretation of his character is really incredible - unless he plays the exact role and the fault lies with the nuts that wrote this scenario. The plot is clearly secondary. Do not expect to see anything like what the police would do if a girl was found murdered. This is not very important, even if the improbability of their behavior is somehow insulting. The problem is that the rest of the movie has no meaning either. This leaves long, close-ups of fields, vegetable gardens, faces, etc. The end seemed particularly ridiculous - totally defended by the events that preceded it - unless you thought, "What is the worst way this film can be filmed?" end? "<br /> <br /> There's a lot of sex and nudity, which is supposed to mean something, you want vaginas, you'll see vaginas, do not worry, it's art. This has a deep meaning, which I'm not sure of, and the protagonist, despite his strange innocence, seems to have some kind of fetish or homoerotic neck. <br /> <br /> Finally, the subtitles are in white and often appear on a white background - very difficult to read a lot of them.On the other hand, there is not much dialogue, so it's not a big problem.There are also very few sounds in the movie, not even the ambient sounds you would expect to hear, which contributes to the emptiness of the whole experience.The old Woody Allen would have had a day on the ground to parody this work. <br /> < It's sad to see that this is an award-winning film, I would hate to see the losing movies. <br /> <br /> Have fun.
