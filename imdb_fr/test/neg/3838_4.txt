I thought Choke had potential, but I thought it could have been a much better movie. There were some interesting twists, but some seemed rather useless. When displaying the background on the two main characters, some seemed to turn out badly. Most of it was kind of useless and did not help the film at all. It was also not Dennis Hopper's best time. However, the main grace of this film for me was Michael Madsen. His performance was excellent. In this film, he almost makes Mr. Blonde look like a nice guy. Overall, it was observable. Yet, I was still thinking that some things could have been done differently. These things would have made the movie much better, in my opinion.
