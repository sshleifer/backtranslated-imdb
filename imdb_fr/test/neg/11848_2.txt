Oy vey ... Jurrasic Park has been normalized. As usual, the plot is very thin, ranging from one-meter dinosaurs that weigh 150 pounds and leave greater traces than they are, to an inexplicable science that uses lasers to keep dinosaurs in check. and poultry trucks that have hens loose in dog cages (I've seen chicken trucks they're all in cages the size of a shoebox). And all this in the first 15 minutes of this disaster of a movie. All male actors are fools (thinking that a grizzly could be free in the desert, constantly abandoning objects to easily kill the raptor) and the female actors seem to have just come from a shooting. model for Fredrick's of Hollywood. The raptor itself is the worst thing since the Hobgoblins (from the movie of the same name), it looks like they had a hand puppet version and a plastic model for the "moving" shots. If you want a good film to sit and heckle like MST3K, it's gold. If you want to make a competent movie and play well, do not watch a Roger Corman movie. While playing, we get a 4 out of 10, some players on this stage have tried. Story gets a 2 out of 10, it reads like a drunken narration session that went wrong. The special effects have a 2 out of 10, I have seen worse, but not much.
