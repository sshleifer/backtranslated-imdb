I watched this movie on video the other night and found myself sleeping all through this uninspired sleep. First of all, one of my biggest problems is that movies like this are called horror movies. It's a thriller! There are no monsters or supernatural. It's just a movie about a twisted serial killer (in fact, there are very few bodies, so it's more of a movie about the executioners and he was able to torture me.) The basic principle of A man who attracts teens to his house At the beginning of the film, online chat rooms could have created a fantastic movie, but it only attracts a pair of teenage girls on the Internet. One of these girls turns out to be the daughter of a local detective and he gets emotionally involved in the case. The film moves quickly from a potentially intelligent sado-masochistic thriller to a boring old game between incredibly boring detective and psychic captain Howdy / Carleton Hendricks, appropriately interpreted by singer / producer Twisted Sister, Dee Snider. Occasional attempts at poetic anxiety about the positive effects of Snider's pain and the like are laughable. If he tries to convince people to subscribe to these opinions through this film, he fails miserably and illuminates them (unintentionally). The staging of John Pieplow (of which Jurassic Women, whose title I will be speaking primarily, was the only previous director's work) was not inspired and there was a problem with the editing that led to the disconnection of the film with some scenes totally independent of the film. intrigue unless the scenario is at fault (which is quite possible). This film, a totally unsuccessful thriller attempt that is a horror film whose only accomplishment made me wiggle at the sight of some graphic body piercings. If you see it in your video store, do not waste your money, but if you need something to laugh one night and Strangeland is on the cable, just watch it. 3 of 10
