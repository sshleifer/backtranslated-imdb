I am a chess player and I wanted to love this movie. The problem is that the content could have been in a 30-minute documentary. <br /> <br /> Many hallway plans were borrowed and Kasparov looked in the hall where he had won the title of world champion. There were other plans by Kasparov around the site of the 1997 match and being told where he was sitting and where Deep Blue was. It just looked like filling. <br /> <br /> Moreover, I did not find it interesting to see in detail where Deep Blue was and to see an IBM technician trying, unsuccessfully, to open it. What would we have found inside anyway - a little grand master? <br /> <br /> Like the recent match against Karpov. I'm not good enough at the professional chess level to know when and where it was. It would have been nice to be told: Was it a unique case "just for the money"? Was it part of the world championship cycle? What was the final score? The knot of the film was the play of the second match. Could IBM / could let Kasparov see "inside" the machine? This is where the focus should have been.
