Leni Riefenstahl would be embarrassed by the disgusting propaganda that Moore tries to call "humor". The fact that this film, and the other prevarications of Moore, attract admirers proves that it is unfortunately possible to fool certain people all the time. <br /> <br /> Let's see if we can attract strangers. Let's see if we can celebrate obsolete factories. Let's see if we can add to the amount of hate in the world. Let's see if we can pretend that we are funny. Let's see if we can get out of isolationist Charles Lindbergh. The only thing Moore misses Lindbergh is a GÃ¶ring medal. <br /> <br /> Of course, in this movie, Moore had a bit of disgust for his boy. In this movie, Moore makes fun of Roger Smith, CEO of General Motors, as an indifferent and indifferent elitist. Moore could do it in 1989, but now that Moore has indulged in indifferent and indifferent elitism, this characterization of Roger Smith has an ironic twist. Who would not really want to be Roger's boyfriend than Michael Moore's?
