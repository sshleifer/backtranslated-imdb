The man kills a bear. The man becomes a bear. The man / the bear meets the bear. Man / bear remains man / bear after meeting a bear. The end. Seriously, it's all the plot of this movie. Yes, I simplified it to the extreme, but you get the picture. I just wish I did not see it. <br /> <br /> The man / bear referred to is a Native American who kills a young mother. And while this may be touching, it certainly does not fail to really draw attention to the potential conflict between the two parties. Plus, there was some abuse of both moose in the movie. But it's beyond our goal. <br /> <br /> Overall, we are far from the mark. Definitely need a lot more to be entertaining. Perhaps more laughs of the secondary characters and more drama between the two main bears. That's what separates bad movies from good ones. "RE"
