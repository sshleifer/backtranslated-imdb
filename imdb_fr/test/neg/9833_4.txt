I noticed that a lot of movies that have been featured on "Mystery Science Theater" have received a lot of mediocre reviews on IMDb. However, some of the films featured in the movies were not so bad and it is unfair to rate a film that received "STD" treatment - hosts making funny comments during the film. Now, I'm not saying that "The girl in the lover's way" is a good movie, but it's not serious enough to deserve her current rating of 2.1 for IMDb. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a meeting between Bix and Danny. Bix is ​​a vagrant veteran and Danny, a young man who seems to have no particular reason for walking around the country. Once they have exploded in a small town, Bix has to rescue Danny again and again because Danny is naive enough - a nice way to say he has the intelligence of a tomato. <br /> <br /> On the way, something is happening Bix, sure of himself, find a nice young lady and try to stay attracted to him. And, in a strange side plot, Jack Elam plays a super-scary sicko wandering the city, scary everyone - yet strangely, the police do not seem to pay attention to anything and nobody does anything about it. In the end, however, when Elam puts the movement on a girl for whom Bix cracks, things go bad. <br /> <br /> Overall, although not a good movie, there were many interesting plot elements in this movie - enough to deserve a score over 2 1. The biggest negatives are a simplistic conclusion of the mystery that is unfolding towards the end as well as the total stupidity of Danny once again. Given the tiny budget, however, it's a small movie to watch.
