"Love and Human Remains" is one of those scenes clearly scripted, interpreted in a obvious way and staged, so obvious that the speed of exit of its artifices and its fabrications exceeds me. No need to explain, this amateur film tries to collect all the intelligent lines, all the misanthropic nuances, all the particular sexual predilections in a single film, without any concern to match the pieces. In short, sensational shit without sensation ... that leaves pretty much shit.
