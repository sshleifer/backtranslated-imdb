This film is nice if you like poverty, public domain films from the first half of the 20th century or if you like amateur cinema. The film combines thrillers from the public domain as well as new scenes in which the "actors" (with the sole exception of Redfield making a scene almost dead on Lugosi Rip, all "performers" are simply awful!) Are trying to interact with archive sequences. The "new" sequence is covered with digitally added streaks of film, as are some old unsatisfactory sequences (?? !!). As far as I know, the plot has something to do with a group of strangers gathered on an island for a read at will (?) This movie, while touting a creative premise like "The dead men do not care tiles ", is a technical and creative wreck. In a terribly long sequence and a sailor wounded on a ship, describes an aborted trip to "Fog Island" no matter what it is! The "flashback" then incoherently combines old images from totally different eras and a totally disparate film quality. Scenes unrelated to 'The Lost World' (1925), The Most Dangerous Game (1932), White Zombie (1932), Bela Lugosi Meets A Brooklyn Gorilla (1952) and some other productions related to poverty. This is done on an incredibly bad voice that seems to have too much room as if the sound was recorded on a cheap home video camera. <br /> <br /> "Filmmakers" seem to think they are paying homage. to the great actors of yesteryear by giving the characters the family name of famous actors (Carradine, Zucco, Ouspenskaya, etc., etc.). This tactic was done cleverly, as well as subtly in "Final Destination" here, it's just heinous! The jokes about Spiderman, Dracula and Superman are weird and painfully insignificant. Even the reference of the lawyer "Dewey, Cheetam and Howe" is very old. She was old and tired when the Three Stooges used it in the 1930s. <br /> <br /> The stock and the audio of the film match scene to scene, and dozens of different sources are used for Lugosi. The final effect is that he seems to be getting older, younger, older, slender, heavy, young and old, minute after minute. Curiously, the film did not use this as a comic side plot and ruined its chances of becoming comic. <br /> <br /> To tell you the truth, it was really fun to watch that late in bed. Maybe what they wanted to happen!
