Already went on Youtube? Well, the definitive question is YES. Do you see the boatloads of ICarly and Nickelodeon? No definitive answer. <br /> <br /> Many people think that ICarly is a banal and silly program, while others think it's the best program in the world. I saw a lot of critics hovering in the head and some giving him a bouquet of roses. In my opinion, Icarly is for kids, but the show is horrible. <br /> <br /> If you have not read the last review, here are the reasons 1-8: # 1: Stereotypes # 2: Goof-up drama # 3: All is idiot (taco truck for example) # 4: Carly thinks she's nice but she's naughty # 5: Anyone older to drink is stupid # 6: Sam is small but strong? N ° 7: No real company N ° 8: Average number of teachers <br /> <br /> N ° 9: The Webshow is too used in 3DFX. Just look on the webshow to understand what I mean. # 10: The webshow also transmits personal information. # 11: Almost every famous thing is insulted. Icarly insults the Japanese race, Solitare, Mercades-Benz and Pac-Man, to name a few. # 12: There are too many recurring jokes (Sam's obsession with meat, Freddy's computer, Gibby removing his shirt, etc.) # 13: Video games based on the series are void. No. 14: Freddy lacks masculinity. Why? It becomes unoriginal. # 15: The show is intended for a female audience. I also hate programs for a male audience. I prefer to be for both sexes. # 16: The words "nub" and "no chiz". # 17: The abuse of laughter tracks. <br /> <br /> The third part comes in early spring! Just in time for spring break!
