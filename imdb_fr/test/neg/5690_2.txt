Let me explain this film in detail ... <br /> <br /> The first fifteen minutes are a showcase for the terrible special effects. I'm not one to nibble about special effects, but you have to understand that if you can not afford good special effects, you should not anchor your movie around special effects. Spaceships launch bursts of color on top of each other, turning into stock explosions, and careening beyond the moons with polygons low enough to be counted with the fingers. You will have no idea what's going on. It will not make sense. <br /> <br /> The second act involves a woman walking in the desert. At this point you will be treated to a dull scenery and illogical and boring fight scenes. Nobody speaks Nothing interesting happens. The objectives of the protagonist are unclear and not very convincing. It lasts about 45 minutes. <br /> <br /> Then, in a montage of five minutes, she sneaks into an enemy base, attaches to a rocket, tries to destroy a weapon of desolation, fails and dies. <br /> <br /> None of this affects the direction the film will take. <br /> <br /> During the last twenty minutes, the girl's memories have been transferred to her daughter, who has remained in immobility for a very large number of years, learning the secrets of humanity . After that, we see the first and last segment of human interaction of five minutes in the film, then the new heroine is forced to choose whether she wants to be part of the material that causes the big bang or not. You know. Because when the universe collapses, you decide if you want to be part of it. <br /> <br /> She chooses yes. BUT THE MEMORIES OF HUMANITY SURVIVE IN A CAPSULE. Maybe we will not make the same mistakes anymore, huh? If you like movies with characters, then this is not a good movie for you. The main roles could have been well filled by any old toy to go up able to stay on the right side while walking in the sand. The whole story is told through a painfully boring narrative. <br /> <br /> The film tries to seem profound by gathering a whole series of underdeveloped science-fiction ideas. There are enough concepts here to feed a number of movies, but in the current state of things, it is full of completely irrelevant details. Two-thirds of this film could have been reduced to a 45-second edit. Instead, the narrator fills the background of a story without ever giving us any reason to worry about what happens to the characters. <br /> <br /> There are good ideas here, but no one is watching movies to see poorly explained ideas. People watched movies for entertainment. This film is not entertaining.
