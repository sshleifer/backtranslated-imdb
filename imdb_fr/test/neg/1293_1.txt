I really tried to give this film a chance, but when I realized that most of the film was told by a group of boring officials who were walking and talking on the phone, I knew it was over. Many of this film also looked like archive footage. It's just bad. <br /> <br /> The cameraman kept the idea of ​​making these quick zooms WITHOUT REASON! It bothered me so much, but I was just wondering why they thought it was a good idea. It does not add anything to a static scene of two people talking. It's not NYPD Blue or a police show or something like that. <br /> <br /> How did they not realize that telling this guy a story from conversations of people in conference rooms and what is not, is BORING? !! Have not they looked at this mess? Anyway, it was just a really boring movie and it seems like the one who did it does not understand how to tell stories in a movie. <br /> <br /> Darn stock footage ... it's just wrong.
