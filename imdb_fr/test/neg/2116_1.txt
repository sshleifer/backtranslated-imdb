I think this film can be described as a badly directed rage movie. <br /> <br /> Joe and Bob's characters were relics of the World War II generation who did not understand very well their children who opposed the war, drugged and listened to rock and roll. But I think their real anger was that the United States was beginning its long decline from the heights where the war had left it. <br /> <br /> "Joe" is himself an Archie Bunker, a low rent, things that made him angry, leading a desperate life, until he teamed up with Compton, a guy who wants to take revenge on the hippies who ruined his daughter. <br /> Honestly, most of the movie It looks silly, the characters are worse than a dimension, they are laughable. Peter Boyle was able to better.
