The film is not extraordinary. In fact, it's an insult to the kind of horror. Nothing is on the verge of fear ... not even near the threshold of fear ... <br /> <br /> It's just another case of "new horror film for teenagers" - Have you already seen one. The first few minutes of the movie and you will know what will happen next. The worst thing is that the script is less aggressive than the last scary movie. It would have been better if it were written in Spanish. And do not get me into jokes and punches. <br /> <br /> Although I give some credit to special effects. But believe me, like any other Hollywood horror movie, special effects and special effects have little or no effect on a horror movie's ability to scare. In fact, it aggravates the situation. <br /> <br /> Between Anita Briem and her sinister location, there is not much to see in this movie.
