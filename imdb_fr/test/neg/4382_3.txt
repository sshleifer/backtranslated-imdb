I chose this film in the local family video for $ 1.50, which was probably the first sign that it was not going to be good. Watching him with 2 friends, none of them even wanted to finish him because of the seriousness of this film. Strangely, I could not stop looking at him. But this film is clearly a case study on how not to make a film. <br /> <br /> The plot is quite simple and sounds good: Chuck Norris has nightmares about a serial killer he's put behind bars. The serial killer escapes and his nightmares begin to become reality again. Assassination in series, Norris, kicking the rotundas ... it sounds like an excellent movie. <br /> <br /> And some of them are pretty good. The flashback scene where a man breaks a ladder with his teeth is intense, a scene where a pickup truck falls off a cliff and is crushed is incredible - and I learned to get out of jail with nothing more than Chapstick, gunpowder and dental care. silk. But there are a lot of problems with this movie. <br /> <br /> A: The publisher is a jerk. When you make an action or suspense movie, you have to keep the energy moving. There are far too many scenes that are not crucial to the remaining plot in this movie, slowing it down and distracting from the overall story. At least 10 minutes could have been shortened, the rate would have been improved and the film would have been slightly improved. Two: The sound guy is a moron. Apparently, someone tried to film most of this film in an area where it is impossible to get a quality sound, so most dialogues are cast, killing the stereo and not aligning with the mouth. In addition, the music is much too dramatic in some scenes. Three: The casting director is a moron. They chose Billy Drago as a psychiatrist. Billy Drago is a great cult actor (from Brisco County, Hills Have Eyes and others) and allegedly fabricated the appropriate serial killer or some sort of villain. His character is so vanilla that Draco's skills are ruined. Four: the writer is a jerk. Two intrigues are in this film - the hunt for a serial killer and the romance between Norris and his pregnant girlfriend. Every time I saw this woman on the screen, I wanted to scratch my eyes. And of course, she never figured in the other plot, making her story completely useless. <br /> <br /> Will I look at this again? May be. But unless you re-do this movie at least a dozen times, you should never. Not recommended.
