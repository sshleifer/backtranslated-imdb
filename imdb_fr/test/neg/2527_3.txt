Although everyone is doing a decent job in this film, I agree with the other comment: it's too loose and scattered, too much like a scenario-free experience with really talented actors. As such, it is not enough to hold your attention. That said, there are some really entertaining moments, including one with Dylan McDermott and a fiery glass of fire that I think all those who were drunk would find as funny as me; the other is a split second with an inflatable dinosaur. Crispin Glover is doing his usual guy twitch fest and it's alright, Harry Dean Stanton is making his usual hazel patriarch (Repo Man, anyone?) Etc. Good casting, not enough to keep it. Some jewels, a few seconds.
