So, I'm not a big fan of Boll's work, but again, there are not many of them. I enjoyed his Postal movie (maybe I'm the only one). Boll apparently bought Far Cry's use rights long ago, even before the game itself was over. <br /> <br /> People who have loved to kill mercenaries and have infiltrated secret research laboratories located on a tropical island should be warned that it is not Far Cry ... It's something that M Boll organized with his legion of schmucks .. Feeling alone on the board Mr. Boll invites three of his compatriots to play with. These players are named Til Schweiger, Udo Kier and Ralf Moeller. <br /> <br /> Three names that have made them so big in the world of cinema. The story goes like that, Jack Carver interpreted by Til Schweiger (yes, Carver is German and greets all the guys who eat bratwurst !!). However, I find that the role of Tils in this film is rather cruel .. People complained that it was not really faithful to the agenda of Carver but we saw the sculptor that in the first person, so we do not know what he looked like when he was kicking ** .. <br /> <br /> However, the story of this film is beyond dementia. We see the evil scientist Dr. Krieger interpreted by Udo Kier and making genetically mutated soldiers, or GMS, as they are called. His top secret research on an island that reminds me of "SPOILER" in Vancouver for some reason. It's just not palm trees here. Instead, we got beautiful and rich lumberjacks. We did not even go far before we started crying (mehehe), I can not continue. If you want to stay true to Bolls' shenanigans, check out this film and you will not be disappointed. most will be nil. <br /> <br /> Some things are worth mentioning, which would imply that Boll did a good job in some areas of the film, such as beautiful boats and battle scenes. Until the entire GMS Cromed / Albinos team comes on the scene and everything makes me laugh .. The movie Far Cry feels scheisse (it's hogwash for the naive) anyway, if you want you let go, go for it. gets a very boring sidekick that makes you want to film him the first three minutes, he is on the screen.
