The DVD sleeve explains the principle: "Three problem teenagers are heading to prison" and "are ready to do what is needed until Captain Greer offers them a contract to work for him - under cover". The movie opens with the definitions of the words "Mod" and "Squad", so you do not have to search them in the dictionary. For a visual definition of "Cool", look for photographs of the original trio: Michael Cole (Pete Cochran), Clarence Williams III (Linc Hayes) and Peggy Lipton (Julie Barnes). <br /> <br /> A black. White. A blond. Once they have defined the word cool. <br /> <br /> The three people who make up Scott Silver's version of Aaron Spelling's "The Mod Squad" are twenty-year-old women: Claire Danes (Julie Barnes), Giovanni Ribisi (Pete Cochran) and Omar Epps (as Linc Hayes). They can not do much with the given material. The portrait of Mr. Ribisi is the most "remote", which means that it departs the most from the initial characterization. Danes is in love with Josh Brolin (Billy Waites), who could be in a new version of "Marcus Welby, MD". You will not believe Michael Lerner dances with Mr. Epps' Linc. He explains: "I'm not a fairy, I just love to dance!" and asks, "Spin me!" <br /> <br /> *** The Selection Team (1999) Scott Silver ~ Claire Danes, Giovanni Ribisi, Omar Epps
