There have been many movies about the American dream. And it's one of them. <br /> <br /> First of all, technically, there are a lot of problems. The sound is bad, I had trouble understanding the dialogs here and there, and the positions of the camera could have been better. <br /> <br /> They really tried to create a good movie, but for example the part where they show how Jonathan gets lost in the dream, with girls, drugs and alcohol, it's very bad made. The acting is also very mediocre on the part of all the characters of the film. <br /> <br /> I had a hard time watching it from start to finish and I could not wait for the movie to finish. <BR /> <br /> If your expectations are low and you are bored on a Sunday in bad weather, watch for it. If you are looking for a deep story with action, then it's not your movie. <br /> <br /> Normally, I would not have to give a score of 1, but 4.5 for this movie. But the reason I gave it a 1 is because of the bad sound and uses of the camera, not to mention the bad scenes cut with nerdy effects.
