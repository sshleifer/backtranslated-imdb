Naach would have won a Razzie for the Worst Film in 2004 (perhaps also in general) if he was global. When it comes to acting badly (aka showing off his attitude / yawning / on (not acting)), Halle Berry is not a match for Antra Malli. While the catwoman had storeline, supposed hot actress in microscopic costume and some action sequences, Naach had nothing at all. <br /> <br /> One of those movies that makes me wonder why IMDb can classify a movie as 0/10. Again, I think this movie does not even deserve a 0. It must be something negative or infinite. <br /> <br /> OK, what about the outline of the plot? He is a generous, arrogant, attitude-filled choreographer who meets a useless idler, without skill, who aspires to become an actor's tale. The story is so short that if it was just a sentence, IMDb could ban me for writing a spoiler. About the story? It's like a group (sorry 2 people for the most part) of people moving in super slow motion. Do not try this movie if you bought a new DVD player. You will end up believing that the DVD is in poor condition or that the DVD player is hit. Not his fault at all. <br /> <br /> In the end, you end up giving some credits to the director. At least he realized that Antra Malli and Abhishek Bachan (at least at that time) could not talk about dialogues convincingly. There was not a lot of dialogue in this movie. So you can at least sleep through the movie, with some annoying noises from these Antra-malli song sequences. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie if you're new to Bollywood cinema. Once you have tolerated this movie, you will be able to see all Bollywood movies and enjoy them. <br /> <br /> There can be no worse torture than 3 hours!
