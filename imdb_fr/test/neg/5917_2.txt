In the 1930s, Hal Roach Studios was at the top of the comedy world with stars such as Laurel and Hardy, Charley Chase and the Little Rascals. Most of these films are exceptional and have stood the test of time. However, a lesser known product of Roach was the association of Thelma Todd and Zasu Pitts (later, Todd was associated with Patsy Kelly, who is equally talented). Despite all my efforts, I simply can not stand these images - they are just not funny. Plus, unlike Laurel and Hardy, there was not an ounce of chemistry between Todd and his two co-stars. Before I think I'm a crank, know that I've seen and reviewed several hundred Roach films as well as many other old comedies. So I know the genre well and, in this genre, this team is among the worst. One of the reasons I think I'm right about the team is that, as a lower-level team in Roach, she received all the scripts nobody wanted. If Stan or Ollie hated a particular idea of ​​terrain, it was often given to Todd and Pitts / Kelly - and it was common. <br /> <br /> In this film, the team is at its lowest absolute level. It's hard to imagine a comedy with less laughter and a more artificial plot. The film begins with Zasu in the jury and Thelma as a defense lawyer. As for Zasu, she's a complete boring jerk. NOT the kindly moronic guy (like Stan Laurel or Lou Costello), but just a totally annoying and squeaky person who is invasive and obnoxious. As for Thelma, she is, as usual, a "straight man" rather bland and, as such, has little to do but reacts to Zasu's rude behavior. <br /> <br /> The plot implies that Thelma defends a client who is accused of selling explosive diet pills. Considering that the pills are very dangerous, when the lawyer asks Zasu to try to swallow one, it just looks stupid. And while they were called "pills," they looked more like giant black spots larger than golf balls. Swallowing them seemed only artificial and meaningless - even for a dull comedy. When they discover that she has swallowed the pill and that she is really explosive, everyone panics and runs like idiots until the end of the film. <br /> <br /> As I said, I'm not a fan of this team. However, even for those who want to love the movie, there is no legitimate laugh in the entire short film! When I discussed this review with my wife (who also saw the movie with me), she thought my score of 2 was too generous !!
