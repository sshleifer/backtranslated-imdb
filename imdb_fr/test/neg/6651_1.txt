This film is absurd. Absolutely terrible. Michael Keaton and Andy Garcia really needed some work to make this movie. The plot is totally impossible to believe! Michael Keaton agrees to give bone marrow to the son of a dying detective, but then escapes. He managed to escape the police throughout the hospital - impossible to believe he would have such knowledge of the hospital. It takes an extremely complicated route out of the hospital, exploding the generators and a pedestrian bridge (why?). And to top it off, Andy Garcia (father of the dying) and a doctor help the criminal to recover bone marrow. The plot is so weird! Perhaps the worst movie I have ever seen.
