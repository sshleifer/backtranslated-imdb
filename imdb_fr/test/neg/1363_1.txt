This disorder begins with a real tank running on a car, interspersed with images of a toy tank. Then comes a family who returns home after a birthday party without saying anything. The unexplained tank and the little talkative family take, I swear, more than 10 minutes of film. Finally, the family sees a car after being in a wreck and decides to report it to the appropriate authorities, to find that the citizens of the city are all hiding in their homes and that the police are hiding at the police station. Interesting? Almost. When the inhabitants of the city come forward because of the presence of the family, we learn that the author and the editor conspire to replace the suspense with incomprehensible storytelling techniques, in the hope that the inability of the public to tell this story. that will happen will cause discomfort to the public. . and it works! ... but not as they thought. I was very uncomfortable with the seriousness of this movie, but I was not afraid at all. Dialogue is composed of things that make little sense. Not in a funny way, David Lynch, but a kind of conversation in which I entered in the middle of a boring conversation. Over the next hour, we learn that filmmakers are trying to make us fear fear by showing banal and boring scenes combined with "what's going on?" typical scenes. <br /> <br /> The plot involves something that looks like old, soft looking people who put children in a trance through the power of Satan and then bring them to a party to play with toys, and even more. sinister intent, and it's up to a group of white men (everyone in the movie) to take up their arms and save the day, and to a blindfolded woman who moans with a drop of a hat. They search for kidnapped children by searching in random places and shouting names of children. <br /> <br /> This is an excellent horror movie for anyone who has never seen a horror movie because that person is scared by the mere thought of Satanism, paganism, Wicca or even Catholicism because of a lifelong brainwashing regime established by the Trinity Broadcasting Network. This represents Satanism as elderly people in Halloween costumes with candles at a party in front of an Ankh. Filled with a priest gushing out completely nonsense invented on satanists, while calling them "witches". The message that anything that is not Protestant can be thrown into the same category for easy condemnation. <br /> <br /> About 30 minutes of film are lost to show mediocre aged actors babbling clumsily enough pseudo-satanic gibberish to make a Goth teen blush, almost always in Old English, and sometimes in Latin, with invented words or not. <br /> <br /> Highlights include a guy who makes fun of the idea of ​​little green men as a solid 3 minutes, a family looks out the window of his car without speaking for 10 minutes in listening to the elevator muzak. A priest studies satanism for 4 minutes with drawings of demons too scary to frighten the crowds of the church. Random plans of dolls. Random shots of children. Paint instead of blood at every chance. Dream sequences at the cinema school level. Introduces unimportant characters who do not do anything before leaving. Sometimes they act as if the nothing they did was a big deal. <br /> <br /> The staging is at best sloppy. An example of a realization includes a scene at the beginning where a man and a woman kiss each other and where the man goes away to look with love in his eyes and where dark red paint falls on his cheek. Looking up, they see that it's not blood, but droplets from a girl's snow cone. The snowcones are ice and colored / flavored water, and would not have produced droplets of the same texture as the paint, not to mention the fact that its cone of snow was a bright reddish orange. Hackneyed writes, certainly, but aggravated by the bad staging. Then there is another picture of the man, the woman and the girl, showing that she is about four feet away, so that the snow cone would not have fallen on the woman, even if she had held him over his wife. face. Bravo, publisher! Of course, acting is blah. The actors' game could be balanced and balanced perfectly between over-activity and under-execution. <br /> <br /> The most shocking technique of the director is to give no motivation to the actors and then to leave lunch under the eyes that shine cameras lament while the actors ridicule themselves. <br /> <br /> Finally, after all this, we come to an end that would have been great if it had been managed by competent people and not by Jerry Falwell. .
