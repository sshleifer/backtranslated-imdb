Well ... I like Patricia Kaas. She is a beautiful woman and an extremely talented and versatile singer. His role in this film is more than competent and from my point of view as to the only redemptive feature of this film. She very gently captures the essence of the solitary singer with a serious gravity problem. However, what I hate enormously in the film is the shameless placement of the products of a large French hotel chain. The other thing is that the story seems to last a long time without really deciding the content of the film and what it wants to be. On a positive note, you can say that the film is not predictable, but you can also say that it is downright boring because of the lack of cohesion. There are some beautiful shots in the movie but you can not help but think that all the parts do not match at all. It's a shame, because Kaas really shines in this movie.
