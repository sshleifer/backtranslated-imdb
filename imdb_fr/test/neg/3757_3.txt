You must give it to screenwriter-director John Hughes. With tremendous success behind him in the vein of unsuitable teen / high school, he has managed to diversify into other areas of comedy, thus finding an excellent ally in comedian-actor John Candy. Candy becomes a better person after agreeing to keep the good children of her brother. it's an infallible formula designed to satisfy both cynical teens and their parents, and it's no wonder the movie was a winner among theater listeners. Nevertheless, Hughes relies almost completely on the charm of Candy to put the scenario aside, and we can end up getting tired of repetitive gags with the front and center of the star. Children are smart in sitcoms, other adults are informal blobs and Amy Madigan is too intense, too excited to play with Uncle Buck's girlfriend. Later, became a television series, which proves worthy that the content was already perfected on television. * 1/2 of ****
