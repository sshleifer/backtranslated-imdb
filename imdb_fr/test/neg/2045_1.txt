What can you expect from a movie directly on DVD? You know what you are doing when you rent this. The quality of cinematography reminds me of reality TV shows. <br /> <br /> Why are they always as close to the actors !? And why are they still centered? There is nothing to watch. (And the actors are as beautiful as that, so it blows.) <br /> <br /> The writing and the dialogue are simply awful. This intro scene with the Brit is hilarious. Just try to listen to these words, they do not make sense, they go around in circles. The lines in the rest of the film seem to come from romance novels and science fiction novels, as if the writers had no idea what they were doing. The characters sound as if they had no idea what they were saying. <br /> <br /> This is a terrible movie. I feel bad for the actors involved in this project. Embarrassing!
