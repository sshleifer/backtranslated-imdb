I just saw this movie. I first saw the trailer and it was beautiful, like all Hollywood movies, they know how to sell.But the movie is almost horrible, the first 30 minutes are interesting, but then ... like almost all new movies explode it. I do not understand why this kid is dead? It's a clich√©, every Negress movie has to kill one, and everyone must become good after death.LOL.I do not understand what the link is. with the film ... And if predictable, you know the end from the first minutes. Nothing new in this film. I saw the same idea 'you've been served' but also ... something new ... it's something like 'honey', but it's not a small difference between them. have no choice but to watch this movie, but be sure is the last option you take. And the choreography is worse than anything before. It's not a must for you ...
