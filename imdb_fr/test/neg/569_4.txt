I liked most of the dialogues, I liked the casting, I thought it was well played. I particularly appreciated the faultless performance of Ellen DeGeneres. <br /> <br /> What did not work for me was: (1) the long affair with the young man (too long, too seemingly out of character for Helen), (2) the cinematic clichés apparently endless, mostly visual but endlessly expressed during re-readings of the love letter itself (its content should have a mystery); (3) a feminist-scholarly young woman and, ironically, a fireworks scene (no wonder it reminds me of the awful How to make an American movie); (4) the "gotcha" cop who smells "dope" everywhere (no cliché either!); and (5) a romantically nauseating small town setting. <br /> <br /> I would have preferred the film to more convincingly explore the source of Helen's bitterness (or even glorify her), to include much more character from DeGeneres, to have eliminated or reduced various intergenerational artifacts, and be a little less critical about small town life. <br /> <br /> If it had been developed as a play, these critics might have been addressed before the material this film, unfortunately decidedly mediocre.
