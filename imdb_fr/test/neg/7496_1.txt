I was ready for a crouching Tiger-style movie and all I got was the worst movie I've seen in years. It was almost as bad as Baron Von Munchhuasen. Dead script. Acting death. All dead. <br /> <br /> Of course, there have been good fight scenes, but the positive side ends there. If this movie comes to your house, go shouting on the phone and dial 911 to say, "Help me please, there's a movie in my house that's going to force people to commit suicide."
