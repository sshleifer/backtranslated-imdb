The only reason someone would want to see this movie would be because of John Leguizamo. I remember the excerpt, and it seemed like another second-rate comedy. But the fact that Mr. Leguizamo played the main role tried to buy him back. His name, whether known or unknown at the time, tried to sell it. <br /> <br /> I was quite disappointed with the performance of Leguizamo. His days on "House of Buggin" (a clone of "In Living Color") were his peak. The limit between madness and idiocy is thin, and we will simply say that Leguizamo crossed it ten times more. He seemed to be trying to be too extravagant and crazy about the camera. In fact, I will say that he has tried too much. The Madcap humor turned into stupidity and the movie was ruined. I can not say I blamed it, if you were given this opportunity, you would make as much effort if you could, right? Your enthusiasm has cost you dear, Mr. Leguizamo ... <br /> <br /> The Pest follows the tradition of any humorous film and plays the "race card", and more. No group is left behind. Blacks, Latinos, whites, Jews, Koreans, Germans, homosexuals and the blind are among the chosen people. Again, things are getting too much and too much is trying to be usurped in too little time. It takes five minutes for the resolution of the movie to return to normal. <br /> <br /> When you have a movie and you go around the plot and reality for the sake of comedy, just make sure it's funny, or all you have is 90 minutes of senseless film. Which would sum up well the "Pest" of Leguizamo ...
