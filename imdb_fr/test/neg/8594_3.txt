The basic plot is good and can be attractive. The music is so good that it has become the main theme of the TV series IRON CHEF (though it is ALWAYS excessive and intrusive in the film). So, how did this movie end up so poor?!?! Well, the plot was predictable at about 95% and the characters were as monodimensional as possible. And the dialogue ?! What person would really get credit for proposing the stupid macho STUPID that is supposed to be a dialogue? You get a lot more realism from most cartoons! The bottom line is that this film has some positive points, but it is so spoiled by clich√©s worn and dialog rotten it quickly becomes tedious. And it's a shame, because firefighters deserve a better tribute than this mess! If you do not believe me, look at the number of gaffes listed on IMDb for this movie - much more than you would expect to find. They did not care enough to solve all the problems. As a result, the film seems rushed and requires rewriting and re-editing.
