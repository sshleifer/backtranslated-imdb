If I did not know better, I would have thought that Resurrection was made in the late '80s or early' 90s, when shit was sold as a movie in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> I do not understand why people like Christopher Lambert. He speaks as if reading memory cards and turns into a fountain whenever he has to issue. It was easily the weakest aspect of the film. The other actors were OK, nothing horrible. <br /> <br /> It's easy to see where the majority of the budget goes: special effects. The murders look pretty professional, but do not make up for the film's monotony. <br /> <br /> I would not go so far as to say that Resurrection is a true copy of Se7en, but it certainly looks like it. . Centered on a religious murderer in a modern crusade, detectives investigating his work must rely on Bible passages and Christian history to reconstruct the murderer's puzzle. The resurrection, however, is devoid of narrative, cinematography, the play of intelligent actors of Se7en ... well, everything that makes it good. Instead, Resurrection lies to the public and uses the Scooby Doo mystery method to surprise him. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, Resurrection was about as bad as I expected. I almost feel bad about criticizing this movie because I knew it would be wrong to enter, but ... sue me.
