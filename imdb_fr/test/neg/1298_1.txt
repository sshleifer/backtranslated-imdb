It may be the worst movie I have ever seen; I gave him a star simply because it's the lowest possible score. Who thought Flood would be a good movie? The director and the actors should be ashamed and then I realized that all this could be part of a tactic of shambolic fear. Only propaganda could be so bad. <br /> <br /> Flood is characterized by the fact that it is appalling and that the scenario of a cheeky formula makes it funny. If only the characters had the same depth as the one created by the deluge itself, they began to scroll noiselessly, without reacting emotionally. <br /> <br /> What is sad about this film is that it could have been so much better, informative, imaginative and tense. Flood has amateur talent in many recent UK films, where more targeted use of funds would have allowed for better entertainment. <br /> <br /> Where was Smithee?
