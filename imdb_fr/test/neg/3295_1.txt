WHAT HAD HE THINK?!?!?! What a sad, talented actor like Michael Rapaport - who stole our hearts from "Mighty Aphrodite" and fascinated us in "Ill Town" - fell to that pathetic level. The writing on this sitcom is the crust left at the bottom of the barrel after its scratch. Shame on everyone involved. There is a tendency: the big actors of cinema which are no longer flagship products turn to television, often with disastrous results (reference to the stinkaroos of CBS and NBC, ABC however a success with "Boston Legal" - writing trendy and nostalgic use of Bill Shatner). Spoiling Michael Rapaport in this "All in the family" scam is an insult to viewers and especially to Michael himself.
