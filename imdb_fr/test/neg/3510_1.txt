I feel like watching a different movie than most of the people I know who have seen this film. It's not really that I found the film offensive or anything, but simply that the screenplay was incredibly amateurish for a movie that had obviously earned some money. I really respected Paul Haggis' work on the Million Dollar Baby script and was bitterly disappointed at how bad the script was. It was clear to me that he was desperate to be the "racist" version of Traffic, but I do not think Traffic is really a movie that is worth getting scammed at first. <br /> <br /> The worst feature of this film is the way it shamelessly films its audience. Does Haggis really think we're stupid enough to demand a shot of white? Do you really need to see the phone book sitting on Farhad's dashboard, with the address circled in black? Can not we be left to do someleaps in logic for ourselves? <br /> <br /> I also had a major problem with the dialogue that was so "on the nose". I've heard a critic say that the quality of the dialogue is falsely high, because even if people do not speak that way, they certainly think that way. It's not relevant. It is the work of a scenario like this to use dialogue to contribute to the characterization and credibility of situations (in this case highly implausible). These characters all speak with the same voice and all they talk about is racism. <br /> <br /> The goal of a film like this should be to promote the fact that the race should not really be a problem in these situations, but by putting it at the center of all the scenes , naturally racist himself? The characters roam their philosophies and memorize statistics on race relations as if they were regurgitating excerpts from the research essay they just wrote. It's absolutely unconvincing and obvious. <br /> <br /> A film must reveal its meaning gradually, without slapping us in the first scenes and never giving up. I can see that Haggis' intentions with this film were honorable, but can I suggest that in directing his own scenario, he was unable to identify and, therefore, overcome his flaws. I really hope that the screenwriter / director will be very careful about the future when he approaches this style of "mosaic" narrative. It has been well done on a number of occasions, but it is very difficult to find a balance between personal and political rights. And Robert Altman will not be outdone in this department.
