I do not understand why some of you (or many) have attributed more than 8 out of 10 stars to this movie. Do you understand that there are lower ratings for a reason? Of course, this can be a zombie with a few splashes, but that's it. I'm not an enemy of zombie movies, but it was horrible. Really, actually, I should call it rather like a soap-zombie, because that's how the actor plays. The production is ... well, okay. Hardly an attempt at plot development, a dreadful action game, stupid effects, clich√©s, and an abrupt end. Go ahead and love zombie movies, but never give that over a 5.0. Honestly though, the only reason you should want to watch this movie is to laugh. Seriously.
