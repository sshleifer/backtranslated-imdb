This film seems to have been created for the sole purpose of boredom. All I hate about movies is present: false sentimentality, extreme corniness, bad kids actors and more abundantly. It ignores the fact that it illustrates the extreme ignorance of American sports fans, many actors claiming that a football in the shape of a lemon. What?! It's a rugby ball. The story follows a group of non-hopefuls who find a new teacher whom they love (who, coincidentally, teaches the class in a short skirt) and who are interested in football. Of course, they are all garbage (remember, they are not hopers) with the exception of a child who left El Paso. Blah Blah, etc., etc., and the children still do not become good footballers, but they are still happy and the non-hopefuls turn into a group of well-trained children. Hell, even adults begin to come; Drunkards are transformed into caring parents, illegal immigrants are released ... moaning. <br /> <br /> This film stars Steve Guttenberg. Now, before you rush into your local video store to pick up a copy, wait a minute. Guttenberg is a crap. No no; let's go, how could this guy be in a movie? I have no idea and nothing in this film gives me an idea. Olivia d'Abo plays alongside Steve and does not impress either. She just seems to follow the movements and look good doing it. Although I have no problem with this last part; his performance does not make the credit of the film. The kids who make up the rest of the cast are as bad as you'd expect from a movie like this. Most of them are disgusting and / or annoying and this does not make visualization fun at all. There is a goat in the movie that plays the mascot and he does a good job; but you would not see a movie for a goat, so do not worry about seeing this movie.
