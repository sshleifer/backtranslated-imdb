Without a doubt, the least of the spaghetti westerns that I've watched lately: basically a low scam of Leone's THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY (Leone) with three disparate characters outdoing each other (and sometimes forming fragile alliances) in their search for hidden gold. Leonard Maltin called it a BOMB. although it is quite harmless, it is also a routine and, inevitably, the three main roles are stereotypes, that is to say without interest: Eddie Byrnes is a bank employee whose ideas concerning the transport of his sound lot by train; Gilbert Roland is the legendary but aging Mexican bandit (his frequent failures in Spanish when he's excited are pretty tacky!) Who, apparently, is still irresistible to women; George Hilton, an enigmatic bounty hunter, tries too hard to replicate Clint Eastwood's Man With No Name. Director Castellari - whom I saw at the Italian Film B retrospective held at the Venice Film Festival in 2004 - was the most pompous of cult film directors! - shows few sincere feelings for the Occidental (on the basis of two above average Franco Nero efforts in the genre, I commissioned his collaboration with Castellari KEOMA [1976] ... I now cross my fingers!) and the film's ironic approach is just as deplorable.
