This movie is supposed to take place in Milford NJ. I know the house she is sitting on, as well as the person. As you can see at the end of the film, she was killed in the World Trade Center incident. I know because I was one of the police officers who helped identify his remains. (She was the only one lost in our area). Nudity in the movie went a bit far. I'm not a prude, but the actors could have filmed the scene with the two women without showing the whole thing. This film is in bad taste and I do not see how his family would give him his blessing. This is an insult to the person on which he is based.
