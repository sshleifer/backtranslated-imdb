As powerful as Phoolan's true story may have been, this book on which this film is based was published before she herself was released from prison and had a chance to tell it. <br /> <br /> It's supposed to be based on her diaries, but she's illiterate. How it works? <br /> <br /> That said, some areas of the film are accurate and the acting is not bad, with some sensitivity. <br /> <br /> Really if this story must be old in a TV series. Much remains to be done in a few hours. <br /> <br /> Read his autobiography. Highly recommended. It's a fantastic story.
