"Ripe" is one of those terrible indies who manage to circulate and give a bad name to the indies. Telling a stupidly incongruous story of twin pubescent sisters who crawl after a car accident that kills their parents and who hit the road while happily stealing from the display, make tears in the eyes of a guy and find themselves in a army station so run down want it (yeah, that's right!). "Ripe" is an almost complete loser who wanders aimlessly as players come in and out of their characters and clumsily end up clumsily ending without finding any credibility anywhere. Not recommended for anyone.
