Woody Allen (I must admit that I was never a big fan) made this quasi-documentary about the life of Emmett Ray (Sean Penn), a jazz guitarist of the 1930s whose star Apparently shone for a moment, then quickly. faded. Penn does a credible job in the role, describing a complicated and somewhat neurotic man (like Allen himself, which may explain why Woody would be attracted to this project) who can not maintain relationships and whose twin passions ) fired at rats at the dump and watched the trains. <br /> <br /> The story is not very homogeneous. In a sense, it is told by a series of "experts" of modern jazz (including Allen himself), who relate their various theories and interpretations of the different events in Ray's life. The end result is an extremely incoherent account of the life of a fictitious man whose creators seem to have given a rather interesting story, which probably should have done a better job with. <br /> <br /> Jazz fans and Woody Allen fans will probably appreciate that. As for me? The best I can give him is a 3/10.
