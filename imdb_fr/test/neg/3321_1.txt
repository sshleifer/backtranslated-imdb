I remember all the hype around this movie when Aaliyah was killed. As a fan of Mrs. Rice's novels, my first thought was, "How can they play Queen Of The Damned without first vamping Lestat?" <br /> <br /> After finally seeing the movie, I can now see how they did it. he. If you have read these books, imagine taking the bloody parts of the vampire Lestat, grouping Marcus and Marius into a single character and removing everything related to the beginning of Lestat (the wolf hunt, his violin play, the vampire theater and Louis, Claudia and Gabrielle), and then in the last 15 minutes crammed into Queen Of The Damned. <br /> <br /> What we lose is a very important part of Lestat's character. His inner agony of having to kill to live, the fact that he carefully tries to choose killers as his victims and his love hate relationship with Louis, Armand, Gabrielle and all the other vampires. <br /> <br /> Another important part of the story is that we are losing the "Story Of The Twins", which is the genesis of Mrs. Rice's vampires. And although I'm sure that cannibalism was too intense to have been shown on screen, they could have done something closer and show us more about ancient Egypt. <br /> <br /> Worse still, we have this love interest thrown between the two Jessie and Lestat. The Vampire Chronicles is essentially an American story of Yoni. For those who do not know it, Yoni is another form of Hentai (Japanese comics). But in Yoni, it's about relationships between gay men, told by a woman. Although I am sure that many men oppose the "cheerfulness" of the characters, they have gone to extremes in this film. Because instead of pursuing the killers by Lestat, he attacks the groupies of young women. <br /> <br /> And the other flaws of logic and scenario are vast. At first, Lestat emerges from a century of sleep, then he asks Marius how he went through the 1950s in red velvet. Marius has no idea who Elvis is and says he slept during this time. One wonders how Lestat knows fashion and music of the 50s, since he himself slept at the same time. And nothing is ever even mentioned about Louis, Claudia or Gabrielle. I think it's a huge shame. It's like seeing "Snow White and the 3 dwarves". <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie I found very bad. The soundtrack was the only good thing about it. Most of the actors were mediocre, the accents pushed me up the wall and all the really deep parts of the book were removed, leaving us only with a hollow shell, a little like Enkil after it was sucked dry. <BR /> <br /> If you want to see a good movie about a modern vampire, get Lost Boys, the original interview with Vampire Interview, or even some old Dark Shadows episodes. That it lies in pieces, with a stake in the heart, garlic cloves around the neck and a vial of holy water in the mouth. <br /> <br /> In closing, remember that before killing Aaliyah, was intended to go directly to the video, no release in room was planned. It is obvious now why it was. It's only sad that someone as talented as we remember him for this movie dog, instead of something that would have really shone. <br /> <br /> I rate this as a 2 on a scale of 1-10.
