OK, the box looks interesting, the opening has great music and originality, everything is OK. But when the movie started ... it's not my first videoville movie, I watched Ghost Lake, and it's very similar to this film, except it's worse here. The story initially seemed interesting, but the film as a whole looks like a film shot by a group of university students, with a special effect that makes me laugh, the blood looks like a mixture of red and white paint, the fire effect on the face of the demon looks like it was done with a program that I could buy in my local computer store. All the film is shot in the day (very good for a movie supposed to be a horror) and there as no gore (1 scene only and it looks so homemade and not credible) and almost no blood (it can be considered a good thing considering the aspect of the blood show) and a demon for the whole movie. The story is not going anywhere, it gives you the impression that it never starts, there are so many useless scenes made only to give the movie the average duration (when the demon looks for the guy in the dogs for about 4 minutes ...) Too much in slow motion. Well, let's just say that this movie is a Z movie and very poor. Any good idea is lost and you get a cheesy movie. It bored me a long time and I'm not the guy who gets bored very easily with the horror movie, man, I like the house of the dead and alone in the dark of Uwe Boll and you probably know the name from the worst director but here it looks too much like guys who want to make a movie to have fun. In addition, for us francophone (I understand English, I prefer to watch a film in my native language), there is the usual bad translation of videoville. In a normal movie, you can hardly see that it is not the actor who speaks (you have to check on the lips, etc.) here, you just have to listen to it and you know it. Very cheesy
