Oh, I laughed so much ... that's all ... an Asian / white family, a disabled Asian boy ... everything a healthy person needs to see in the eyes of the BBC. <br /> <br /> Which tribe: It was a complete insult to me to see this garbage during an episode and EPISODE ONLY. <br /> <br /> When you think about the quality that the BBC has put over the years (Fawlty Towers for example) and then it happens ... It's a disgusting shame. <br /> <br /> Everything is focused on political correctness and is devoid of any mood. <br /> <br /> This comes straight from the bowels of hell: but what would you expect from the far left PCB ... I mean the BBC.
