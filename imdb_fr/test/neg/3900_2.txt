When I started looking at this, I immediately noticed that I did not understand what someone was saying. I edited the volume. With the background noise now booming, I could hear the voices. What do the actors say? Is not the film dubbed? Do they speak Spanish? After some confusion, I realize it was English. At least, I think so ... The incredible Jess Franco has placed the microphones too far from the actors. As a result, we can not completely hear what they say. He has done this before. But perhaps that's the intention of Mr. Franco? By not knowing what people are saying, we are immersed in a mystery about what is happening and we have more visual cues ... Maybe it's just me, but I would have liked to know what happened! How about some tips? The basic premise (I refuse to call it a "plot") is about a young exotic American dancer named Paula (played by Amber Newman) who has a boyfriend who has her invited to a small island owned by wealthy rich people. It's somewhere off the Spanish coast. For this visit, a large cash payment is promised to Paula, which the boyfriend receives. He then escapes from the island to return later. Why? Pay special attention to the scene where the boyfriend opens Paula's American passport. Although her hand tried to hide it, you can see the real name of the actress, Amber Newman, printed under the photo at the bottom of the passport! Anyway, back to "history": there are other gloomy, rich and beautiful people who visit the island, all with ambiguous reasons. We are seeing sadistic games (are they true or false?) And unattractive meal scenes. But the food must be good, as prepared by a fake French chef! There is a young maid who runs naked and never speaks. Is she really mute? And who cares? Of course, all women are mostly naked throughout this movie ... Well, we can at least be grateful that men (over 50 and overweight) stay dressed! In addition to the abyssal sound quality, what has always amazed me about Jess Franco is her incredible ability to shoot beautiful naked women in such a way as to leave the viewer completely extinguished. This film is no exception ?? I needed fresh air after watching it! <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I am pleased to announce that no matter what Mr. Franco can imagine, I am always attracted to women.
