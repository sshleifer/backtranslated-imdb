First of all, I will say that I will be as subjective as possible. <br /> <br /> There will still be some potential critics, so beware. <br /> <br /> I almost never review movies, but one in particular I felt I had to review. This Final Fantasy 7 Advent Children movie, based on the popular RPG (Final Fantasy VII) for ps1, has been in preparation for some time. After years of hype and dozens of trailers (none of the ones I've seen, I've only seen still images), this movie has really excited the enthusiasm of legions of fans who have seen their favorite characters on the big screen. I myself played and finished the game a few times like any good fan, and being such a movie fan, I was rather excited myself. So, I thought, "WHAT CAN I PASS?" <br /> <br /> The film started well in the first 20 minutes, but the situation escalated. This is without a doubt the best CGI animation of the moment, but it will not help a low scenario, underdeveloped characters and indulgent action scenes. <br /> <br /> Here is the story roughly. These three nancy silver-haired leather boys who have nothing to do with the game, are supposed to be clones of Sephiroth (the villain of the game who allegedly murdered all his so-called clones) are trying to kidnap all the kids for any reason. not really well explained, probably to form an army (with children?) They also tell the story of a kid named Denzel, I do not know who this kid is, or what he's talking about, he just looks depressed all the weather. Thus, sephiroth clones are also involved in a kind of schema involving a disease called geostigma, which only affects children, this disease seems to cause boredom and a small discoloration of the skin. <br /> <br /> So now, Cloud must save the day of these guys. Apparently, Cloud and his teammates learned the flying ability, I felt a little insulted by the fact that these characters were flying around a city fighting a dragon and landing there all the time. Maybe if the film was not so exaggerated, then the view will relax and then they will be surprised by something incredible. The real problem of this film is logic. Now, I know what you're going to say: "But it's called Final Fantasy! It should contain these ideas!" Well, that's a silly way of thinking, the game was based on some sort of reality and the movie should follow in that context. The context and the logic in this film are incoherent, I could explain everything, but if I did, I would end up writing the screenplay. <br /> <br /> In addition, some scenes of this film were extremely artificial and banal. like when all the characters in the game appear just in time for their mandatory screen time so as not to disturb the fans. They arrive, they are a bit and have practically no meaning in the story. <br /> <br /> If it's too long, here's the simplest review - <br /> <br /> the benefits - the first 20 minutes top-notch animation cgi amazing decent action scenes <br> /> <br /> the downsides - action too complacent / unbalanced action (leaves the viewer jaded at the climax) plot weak super-human characters = no suspense the j-rock soundtrack / score (what has happened with the orchestra?) Horrible end <br /> <br /> BIG TIME SPOILER- <br /> <br /> Now, the end of this movie really disappointed me. They could have had the really cool and sweet end where the cloud dies and meets Aeris in the afterlife, but after the big battle at the end of the cloud gets shot in the back, a kind of injury by which the ball exploded through the chest. then the cloud has its 100th flashback in the movie and then wakes up in a lifestream pool. (Now I remember the life of the game, but it did not have resuscitation properties, if it did, they could have brought Aeris back to life, creating a completely different story) so the clouds Come back to life and everyone has a party and dives in the pool and we have an ultra punch / life type cheezy moment. <br /> <br /> not that the film does not have its moments. its worth the detour for its visuals. But that's all. <br /> <br /> That aside, it's not really a good movie. it's strictly for blind fans of the game. not for people who care about plot and character and tell stories.
