***** SPOILERS ********* <br /> <br /> This movie was really awful. From the beginning, this woman deceives her employers and slaughters them selfishly. In the end, you see her doing a trade that she learned from the father of her "pupil". I put quotation marks between students, because the housekeeper never really seems to teach anything to the child. She seems to hate her and can not bear being near her. I felt sorry for the little girl who just wanted to be loved, otherwise it was understandable that she was saying and doing outrageous things just to get attention, but the viewer was not supposed to sympathize with the little girl, the spectator was supposed to sympathize with the governess who hated her pupil, manipulated and deceived her employers. I could not do it. It was not the story of a self-taught woman, it was rather a window on the mind of the one who uses others on every occasion without any other thought for anyone outside of her own family. I could not stand the housekeeper! It was a really horrible movie. I only paid a dollar to rent it, but even too much!
