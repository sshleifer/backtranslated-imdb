This film lasted three hours, including advertising, on the History International Channel last night. But it had been three weeks. These are not the inexpensive, stupid and unintentionally funny descriptions of the Dresden bombing. It is not that the film is devoid of almost all the context surrounding the Second World War. It was not even that the bombing itself was often presented as a major inconvenience for a zany love story. No, it is the characterizations without strokes of wood that have sucked the life of the story. Oh, and the fact that if it's possible for a film to be obsequious, then Dresden is that movie. DRESDEN - URIAH HEEP would have experienced it. <br /> <br /> It is especially this last point which annoys. Was the bombing of Dresden a war crime? The makers of this film believe it. But in the generally emasculated way that the Germans approached the Second World War, they can not bring themselves to say it without shouting about "peace" and "no more wars - nowhere", like Mother Teresa. And, which is also typical of German funerals to the British in particular, there is a hard effort to make before "shine", while charging Arthur Harris with the "guilt" of Dresden. <br /> <br /> Did I say someone? Not quite. At the beginning of the film, there is an exclamation of the main character, Anna, with whom we are all supposed to sympathize. "Damned Americans!", She cries, watching falling bombs far away. And a few minutes later, a radio voice sounds warnings about the "American terrorist bombardment" inflicted on the Germans. <br /> <br /> Note the word "terror". Got that? It is really the Americans who are behind the inhuman targeting of German civilians. It does not matter that the American strategy for almost the entire war in Europe is the "precision" bombing of industrial and war-making sites. It does not matter that the British enthusiastically adopted the "targeted" bombing of civilian targets in Germany - even before the Germans targeted the British targets. It does not matter if the Americans bomb during the day, killing more people than the British, in order to hit precision targets, while the British bombard civilians under cover of the night. It does not matter that the Americans, in fact, were involved in the RAF's real terrorist bombing campaign. It does not matter that most American officials, from the FDR to General Dolittle, oppose civilians, while Churchill and his generals are eager to do so. <br /> <br /> No, to DRESDEN, the Germans and the British, With the exception of "Bomber" Harris, we are innocent of a doctrine, was it created, created by perverted Americans . And only the strength and power of a love story between a German nurse and a shot down British bomber pilot can adequately explain the "truth" of the atrocity. About. <br /> <br /> Oh, by the way, for the younger and probably less read readers of IMDb, the first and still the only major literary effort to give a thoughtful voice to the Dresden bombing was the pacifist novel . written by Kurt Vonnegut - an American prisoner of war in Dresden at the time of the bombing. I guess the German ZDF could not find a nice nurse for Billy Pilgrim.
