Well, I thought the movie was 1/10 blah. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the best part is the first 5 minutes of the movie with the nerd or his girlfriend, this is the part you watch for Tho she had big mermaids, I thought it was really a random actor? Damn no, it was not really a model by the name of Larissa McComas, but you already knew it. <br /> <br /> So that made sense, but that was about all the rest of the movie (which I saw anyway) did not care about 4, and did not bother to watch the rest. <br /> <br /> All I needed for C to be satisfied, so 2 of you who just care about what you're going to enjoy
