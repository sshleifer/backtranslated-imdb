OK, little town, sheriff sheriff? Check. The sheriff's hot girl? Check? Boyfriend of the sheriff's sweet daughter, whom the sheriff hates? Check. A real estate developer who eagerly puts profit for the benefit of people? Check. The developer's base accidentally releases a primordial monster, then is pressured to hide it? Check. Do natives warn of mass destruction and destruction if things have not become as they were? Check. CGI amateur special effects that could have been produced by a Commodore 64 computer? Check. Seriously, almost all the clich√©s of your typical Sci-Fi Original movie have been grouped into a classic movie, so bad, it's good. The only one missing is the scientist / expert trying to transmit his knowledge; There is a paleontologist with three students who was trapped in my Bone Eater quite early in the film, but they are essentially extras in the film. And I can honestly say that I predicted virtually all of this; Who survives and who does not survive (although I must say that the exact time of the death of one of the characters is wrong about an hour). I swear I could have done this movie myself if they had given me all the characters. Still, the movie is fun to watch, if only to play MST3K with your friends. If you want to have fun without thinking, it's a great movie to watch. That's why I give him a surprisingly respectable, even if, for all intents and purposes, he deserves a much lower mark. But again, you would not want to watch a SciFi Original movie if you were looking for a movie with real plot, background characters or good special effects, right?
