I was watching this movie and I was getting tired of the idiot plot that was nowhere, when suddenly the story takes a surreal turn and has an actor playing himself. Oh, I laughed. Because it's so funny, is not it? We know that Julia Roberts plays the character of Tess and here they are, in the film, telling the joke: the character of Tess looks a little like Julia Roberts. So, Julia plays a character imitating Julia. As she does well, we'll never know because 99.999% of viewers do not personally know Julia Roberts (and read in Hello magazine does not count). <br /> <br /> And then Bruce Willis arrives! Apparently, he is Julia Roberts' best friend. Well, he's in the movie ... how would I know if Bruce Willis and Julia Roberts know each other or not? I'm not at all interested in the actors' personal lives - I'm just paying my money and I expect them to do the work for which they are paid. Anyway, they start making jokes about the plot in the film where Willis (rather unconvincing) plays the role of a psychiatrist ... the one with the little child ... you know that one ? I do not have, I forgot what it's called. Willis even drops a comment on the quality of this box-office movie - how modest of you, Mr. Willis! <br /> <br /> The problem is that not only are these scenes in vain and horribly horrific, it also reminds viewers that we are simply watching a group of actors strutting and being paid huge sums of money money for very little effort. You see, when I see a movie, I want to suspend disbelief and forget that I'm watching actors - I want to believe in the story I'm watching. When you start to break the stage, in the middle of the film, you make me completely lose the illusion. <br /> <br /> You know that a television series jumped the shark when it started to present celebrities, to play (get up and count the Simpsons, friends, etc.), but this is the first once I see a movie jump the shark. I usually stay away from movies like this one (for example, Scary Movie, The Naked Gun, etc.). The problem is that I honestly never thought that the 11 films from the ocean were going in that direction. What a shame. <br /> <br /> So, with the suspension of disbelief thrown out of the window, and the plot now crumbling in the movie then blocks the vilest joke - the audience actually took place in the past story, and the last 90 minutes of the movie were a useless posture. Yes, it's true: Steven Soderwhatsit and his fellow actors all stood up, showed us the audience and said, "Ha haaa ... you've all been thanked ... for your money!" Then they give us one-handed salvation. <br /> <br /> Well, we're back. In fact, I did not pay to see this movie ... I downloaded the DVD for nothing. How do you like apples? Now, it's a plot.
