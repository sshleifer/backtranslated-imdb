I think it's safe to say that if you only watch standard box-office movies or premium production, do not bother with this movie, you'll hate it. If you are a critical film buff, do not bother. If you like sci-fi movies and you make fun of the ability you have a glimpse into the future, you'll be slightly entertained. It is very obvious that the budget allocated to this project was very low, but what they did with this money is worth congratulating. Some hot fire scenes were pretty bad and the evacuation scenes were terrible, but it's obvious that they had good support from the computer point of view because the scenes of the planet and the extraterrestrial images were quite inventive. The dialogue is hilarious but does not act entirely poor. As far as history is concerned, I'm not sure what really happened to tell you the truth.
