I just can not believe that the people who made and played this movie really took it seriously. The sketches on SNL seem more real. Everything was ridiculously wrong. The awkward shootings, the ridiculous fist fights, the dialogues, the sandy background music and even the blind eye of Bo. If it had been presented as a comedy, it would still have made more sense, but it would still be bad. I can see this as "entertainment" only if you have a room full of crazy kids watching it like it's Rocky Horror Picture Show. Imagine some of the things you've seen on Blazing Saddles, such as Mongo knocking over the horse or the old lady who was gnawing on her stomach. Now, imagine that the producer wants you to take these scenes seriously and understand the essence of this disaster.
