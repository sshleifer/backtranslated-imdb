The year of production says everything. The film is a marauding mess of politically correct left-wing feminist self-appreciation geniuses, of a heavy symbolic variety that seems ridiculous today. Each scene aims to shed light on one of society's burning questions, mainly the role of women in the workplace, the role of women against men, women as sexual objects, consumerism , politics, war, etc. commented by the inner dialogue of one of the main actresses or turning the scene into a surreal joke. I do not remember any conspiracy, nor who were the main characters. This is the kind of film where consumerism is flouted by a couple making love in a furniture showcase while the salesman sells his speech, or where a revealing interview of a theater actress turns into a full striptease act, for "of course" the attacking gentlemen of the press are up to a scorching club audience. Then we move forward quickly, because we need to see the war break out in a peaceful forest, we must see many fiery inflammatory feminist speeches drowned under the (male) breath of car horns or rioting crowds, and of course, we must see the cinema The news of Stalin and all the other usual suspects. You had the idea. But all this does not matter. The film is an unprecedented piece of story for any (male) enthusiast Ingmar Bergman. A bragging film leads Bibi Andersson, Harriet Andersson and Gunnel Lindblom at the height of their beauty makes this criticism completely and just drivel ?? I'm also delighted to see them use their acting skills so generously in a film I never heard about today. It's hard to believe how much Bibi Andersson's face, in particular, has the screen every time it appears. The cinematography is beautifully orchestrated, which often gives rise to an overexposed dimensionless whiteness (?), And you'll never get tired of watching the performers. What an absurdity that a film made with so much consideration for the feminist agenda, tirelessly advocating that women are not perceived as a mere object of desire, has nothing better to offer the viewer of the twenty-first century a parade incredibly beautiful girls. As mentioned, I do not complain. I could see him again tomorrow.
