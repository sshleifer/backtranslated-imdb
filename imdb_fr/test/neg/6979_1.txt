I endured this film just to satisfy my curiosity. It must be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I am surprised that this film currently has a rating of 7.5 stars. The acting is awful, the script is non-existent and the characters are so predictable and hollow. For a funny movie, I do not even remember having sneered once and I do not see how it could be defined as a comedy. Do yourself a favor, get away from these slags and discover more interesting alternatives that would give you a much greater pleasure. Watch movies like vacations or 27 dresses, these movies would offer a much more satisfying movie experience. I sincerely hope that more educated moviegoers will vote negatively for this film, as it really deserves by giving it a more realistic note on which other moviegoers could trust. Come on, let's be fair to all concerned and give the people involved in this film a real reflection on what they have produced - an extremely mediocre image that deserves to be quickly forgotten.
