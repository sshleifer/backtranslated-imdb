Where do I start? The box should have been enough to keep me away from this attempt, but I was taught very early not to judge a book (or a film) by its cover. So I ignored the disgusting graphic quality of the box and still rented it. But common sense should tell you that if they can not make a single still image correctly, how much will moving images be lamentable later? Yeah. They were really awful. <br /> <br /> The actors in this film seemed totally unaware of the shooting of their film, because each expression seemed to behave, regardless of the situation of the characters or the reaction to which they reacted. <br /> <br /> However, a good story can offset the disadvantages of low budget productions. A good dialogue can sometimes lead to a poorly funded attempt. Unfortunately, it was not one of those moments, because the story was as weak and non-existent as the other indispensable elements of a good cinema. <br /> <br /> There are simply no words to say how bad it was. <br /> <br /> Perhaps you could get the idea of ​​my rating of -2.3 / 10 of ... <br /> <br /> the Fiend :.
