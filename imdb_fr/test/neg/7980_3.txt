Produced by International Playhouse Pictures, it looks like it was shot in a dollhouse. Everyone is a liar, everything looks like a dream, a toy without good reason. I'm not saying that everything in movies has to be totally realistic, but such fantastic and incredible things in a movie are way too much. How did they manage to bring these beautiful actors - actresses in particular - to this film? It's good to see Mia again; if we had to understand why her husband wants to kill her, Mia does it well. Not funny, not move, just fake. Stephen Dorff appears briefly at the end, perhaps agreeing to a play, less to a movie, but it's not a play to measure. Terrible.
