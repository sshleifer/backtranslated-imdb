Oh my God ... where to start? "Chupacabra Terror" is one of the worst B-Horror films ever made. This shit makes "Demon Slayer" look like "The Exorcist". Special Note: A horror movie B must have at least one sex scene. Do not even expect a sexy girl in this one. With this inexcusable error, I should start with the full party. <br /> <br /> First of all, if you want to make a movie about Horror monsters, you should spend a lot of your budget to create "monster outfit." The monster in this movie looks like a Halloween costume at $ 10. There is no way that the Chupacabras (yes, that's how it's written) look threatening in the movie. Halloween please !! it looks so cheap it makes me crazy. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the gore effects are the spinal cord of any horror movie live on video Once again, the producers have decided not to spend on decent gore effects, the blood looks pretty fake! Please take a look at the guy who gets cut in half. This is probably the best scene in the movie that lasts about ten seconds, the end is a very poor scene that will not leave you satisfied. <br /> <br /> The acting game is the last thing you should expect in a quality movie. but in this film it's beyond terrible. A group of people without acting experience makes the fool out of it for about 85 minutes. A special mention deserves a blond man with curly hair who tries to convince SWAT members that he is sick. The cough he simulates is insane. He's probably the worst actor of all time in a B-Horror movie, no kidding. In addition, Captain Pe√±a delivers a terrible performance in the first ten minutes of the film. <br /> <br /> The real story behind the Chupacabras is not even told. All you know is that the monster sucks the goat's blood. Why bother with this piece of shit? Plesae, do not even look, even if you are lucky. Not even if it goes on the cable. <br /> <br /> I usually support low-budget horror movies because the people who participate in them try to at least do something "different" from Hollywood, but that does not mean that fans of 'Horror like me should accept this kind of garbage.
