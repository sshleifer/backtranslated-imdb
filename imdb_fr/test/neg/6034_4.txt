This film is pretty bad, aggressive, not well played, not well directed, seems to have a limited budget, poor quality, emotionally weak and disconnected. after looking at the previous reviews, I went to see it, but if you try to compare it with apocalypse now, PLATOON or whatever, you really are off-track. this film looks like an old 60s film purely designed with a distribution of adult Neanderthals, not to mention (or who actually does), without paying attention to details such as shifting turns, low-budget fireworks and all sorts of poorly filmed features. is watchable though, if you want to see it as an early development of the movie document .. do not go back! <br /> <br /> p.s - after all, the guys are fine.
