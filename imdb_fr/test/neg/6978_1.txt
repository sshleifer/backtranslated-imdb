This film is an abomination for all that is worth filming. The main actor surprises his audience by not acting at all. We have to watch nearly two hours of his soulless and bland face. The jokes are all nil. I never laughed once we were on Saturday night, we were 5 to drink a beer, then we made him angry and we could feel all the heat and colors flowing from the room. The film ended and the atmosphere was ruined so we all parted, ruined the night! OK, so for and against. The beautiful surroundings in Hawaii, looks good on bluray. Against worse acting ever; you can say that everyone involved is just thinking about payday. Predictable poor plot. Zero character development. Forced jokes that fall flat. Many penis shots that, to be fair, act better than him and have more charisma. May all the directors of this film hang their heads in shame and not touch their virility too much.
