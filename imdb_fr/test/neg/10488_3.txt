Okay, it's awfully, and I mean terribly, easy to distinguish this movie. Come on, what do you expect from the title, synopsis and actors such as Carol Gilley, Ralph Baker Jr., Dorothy Davis, Bill Thurman and my favorite, Roger Ready. Yes, star B John Agar is here as a sheriff to rid the Texan landscape of a robot-like monkey from a NASA experiment gone awry. The film has appalling performances, frightening landscapes, appalling special effects and appalling lighting. I really do not find anything good to say about this, except that bad movies can do worse by finding something fearsome. It is terribly short and has many moments of involuntary humor. Missed landmarks, missteps, off-screen terror, incredibly stupid score, and of course John Agar trying his best to be the heart of the film with a heartfelt performance in the middle of this mud. The beginning is the hardest part to cross, because it seems like it will take forever for these two teenagers to rediscover their joy of traveling in the woods, in the alleys of Texas, where the great ape will soon feel his revenge for his own way ... yes indeed! Night Fear! Bah!
