Steven Segal has made horrible films, but it's probably one of the best since his career plunged a decade ago. The cast is better than usual, and although the story and the plot are a total joke, at least most of the action scenes are pretty good. <br /> <br /> The plot is probably one of the worst in the history of cinema. Is someone being executed because he stole money? Some types of mercenaries kidnap a judge of the Supreme Court? Their goal is to exchange the judge against the prisoner so that he can know where he has the money? Meanwhile, the execution room is full of hatches and fake floors and looks like a backdrop to one of Cirque Du Soleil's circus shows. <br /> <br /> Then there is the question of prison. Here, the goalkeeper is a homie, played by Tony Plana. The prisoners all have their colors and their signs, and the guards are there to serve the meals and keep the prison clean. Nothing like a group of prisoners who fight and beat guards while the director watches. What happens? The director gives them a severe conversation. He could punish them next time. <br /> <br /> There are many moments in this movie that are good for laughing. However, Nia Peeples looks good, and Ja Rule tries to be an action hero. It is a great pleasure watching the prisoners all "do what is good" and arm themselves to free the Supreme Court judge from her captors. Whatever the seriousness of Half Past Dead, keep in mind that this is the best movie in which Steven Segal has been starring since Under Siege in 1992.
