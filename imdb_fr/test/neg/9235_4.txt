Convinced by the 7.0 points in IMDb, which is very good, I decided to watch this movie. However, I found this film rather boring (about 2 hours) and full of clichés, a little girl who has multiple personalities after a childhood trauma, etc. He's a bit of the tough policeman we see in American movies, maybe too copied. I would describe this film as an ordinary American thriller with a Turkish twist. Unfortunately, I am still convinced that comedies and dramas are the only genres that are worth seeing in the Turkish cinema of clichés.
