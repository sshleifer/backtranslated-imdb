I do not understand jokes. I think that's my problem with modern cinema, or these movies made with millions of dollars in the hope that it will become the next big sensation. Is not it strange ?? people just do not laugh so much, and I think one of the diseases that causes this problem is the movie "Showtime". From the beginning to the end of the credits, there was absolutely nothing, with all the jokes between Murphy and De Niro, with Russo to the glory, with even classic clichés that make the population pale with preprogrammed laughter. nothing in this film that made me laugh. Throughout this movie debacle, there were no invasive physical jokes or calculated mental jokes. Since the beginning, I have not bought the match-up of De Niro and Murphy only for the Hollywood excitement. Throughout the comment, the director talked about the hijinks and laughter that took place during the shoot. where was he in the movie? This falls to two problems? the director really does not have the sense of comedy or the publisher does not understand the value of the film. Be that as it may, they both condemned the hour and a half spent in the Hollywood nightmare "Showtime". <br /> <br /> Aside from finding no reason to laugh, there was no reason to follow these characters at any point in the movie. There was a glimpse of humor with De Niro's desire to choose pottery as a hobby (but the director had to write KILN on the machine for the audience to understand "WHO DOES THAT?"), But that was abandoned and never developed. There was the idea that Murphy was an actor, but apart from this opening monologue, no one would have understood it. He rented a room in a producer's house where he could afford the salary of a policeman? It just has not been calculated, even for Hollywood standards. There was a villain who wanted a big rifle, but the rifle was never developed, and there was no real test of the ability of the weapons ?? even at the end. It has become a bigger joke to laugh at an accent than to remember guns. Where was the TV show in all this? Russo had to get permission from this guy at random at first, but that had no consequence. There was nothing in the middle of this film apart from extra questions and a meaningless dribble. Random characters have been introduced, forgotten, reintroduced and forgotten over and over again. The director and the producer laughed at it, while we, the meager spectator, have to undergo stereotypical jokes and clichés. <br /> <br /> Has this film attracted much interest? Is there a really sinister villain who broke away from the comics duo to bring real harm to the screen? Are there references to pop culture that have not returned to Robert De Niro? Has there been random chaos throughout this movie? If you need answers to these questions, obviously you will not find them in "Showtime". The fact that I move this review question after question only means that this sub-parity (in fact, well below this one) does not fill any quota and does not look anything like the value of the cinematographic world. Of course, there were big names and a real explosion, but there was nothing substantial about it. It was almost as if the director had said before the shoot that he wanted clichés, but not regular shots ?? go with the bad ones. The plot did not have a linear structure. The jokes were boring. The characters were dull and underdeveloped. This ranking is even inferior to the best movies of "buddy friends". I like to give films the benefit of the doubt, but nothing worked in this film. Even Shatner could not save this movie, and he even did his best. <br /> <br /> In general, I can not and will not suggest this film to anyone who has the pulse. The comment only confirms the pathetic nature of the film with obvious flaws, horrible jokes and creators questioning the validity of their work. If creators can not stay behind "Showtime", why should we? I did not want a "deadly weapon" when I looked at it, but I wanted something like that. I understand that "reality TV" and the corrupt nature of the media have been the subject of some criticism, but this message has not been forgotten. In fact, I think I saw "media" leaving the theater first when I watched it. Shame carries his heavy hand with this film and I can not blame him. Murphy used to be a big star, comedy was his middle name (see "Coming to America"), but recently, he seems to have lost his advantage. De Niro obviously wants to get away from an image that haunts him, but doing this kind of film will only delay it further. One of these films is equal to a Scorsese image. <br /> <br /> Ignore this one. I promise that your last movie days are worth it. Oh, what if you laughed at this movie? I am really sorry! <br /> <br /> Grade: * on *****
