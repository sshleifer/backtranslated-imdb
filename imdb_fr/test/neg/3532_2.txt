The stupid government tried once again to create an inexhaustible and indestructible soldier, and of course the experiments went terribly wrong, charging us with a half-man mutant who vomited a lot and squeaked like a little girl every time he was upset. . Lance Henriksen is the honest scientist who immediately ended the experiment knowing it was a military project, but he returns (with the whole family) when he discovers that his beloved guinea pig went on an adventure. "Mind Ripper" is certainly a horror movie to watch, but it is very original and presents just about all the lame clich√©s you can think of (including the plot of which the rebellious teenage father / son is separated ... yawning ). The characters are like wooden puppets, the most stupid things are said and done and there is a sequence of dreams completely useless: coming from the monster !!! There are a handful of interesting bloody scenes to enjoy and some of the secluded spots in the desert are indeed strange. Lance Henriksen is still suitable, even if it is another production of inferior quality, and Giovanni Ribisi surely deserved a better film to make his debut. For some reason, this anonymous thriller of the '90s is also known as "The Hills Have Eyes Part 3". Is it because he treats members of the same family terrorized in the desert? Is it because Wes Craven has been involved again, as a producer this time? Or maybe it's because the monster goes bald towards the end, like the freaky Michael Berryman in the 1977 original? Who knows ... Who cares? Wes Craven probably funded this project because his son co-wrote the screenplay and it's always moving to discover that your offspring are just as talented as you. Not recommended!
