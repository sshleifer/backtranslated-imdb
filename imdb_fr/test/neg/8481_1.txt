(Really contains bad spoilers) So, what can I say about that .... It's a really horrible and horrible movie !! Too much CGI and special effects .... you could say how ridiculous the baby is! ... PLEASE at least go see "Dungeons and Dragons" which is another awful pile of TRASH.Son of the Mask makes Dungeons and Dragons much better !!! Uggg !!!!!!!!!!!! Pure Crap !!!!!!!!!!!! I hate this trash !! I would also say that "Superbabies: BabyGeniuses 2" was also a really stupid movie. Probably as stupid as "Son of the Mask". "BabyGeniuses 2 was as false as" Son of the Mask "and also contained too much CGI !! <br /> <br /> Anyway Yeah ... it was a really bad movie ... just please, avoid it ... do not recommend it to anyone ... please its far too ridiculous .... does not make sense and really bad conspiracy.The baby who pisses on his father was just lame!
