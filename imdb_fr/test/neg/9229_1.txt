Yes, it's me again! Mr. "I'm sitting in shit so you do not have to." <br /> <br /> What are you thinking? Could it be a woman who calls a phone line and organizes meetings with singles in an isolated area? Then his boyfriend in evening dress approaches and cuts his throat with a razor, before they leave with his money? Wow, what a guess! And if I tell you that the cop who is in charge of the case is forced to team up with a sexy DA assistant to get caught with these suckers, what conclusion will you draw? Do you think the sexy DA will go undercover wearing a flimsy red dress to try to meet the drag queen, but will eventually be kidnapped and will have to be rescued by the maverick agent? (who has already surrendered his weapon and badge) ZING! You get 10 points! <br /> <br /> Frankly, this movie bored me to tears. Why do people insist on doing this kind of garbage? It's a waste of time, time, and yet they still continue .. filming a movie that nobody talks about. If there are any features that use it, there is the fact that it has some of the prettiest ladies I've seen in a movie for a while. I hope they spent the meager salary they earned with a lot of botox and colic irrigation. They would look great on the cover of Vogue or on the roof of a car in a bikini. They should just let the professionals act (like Shannon Tweed). <br /> <br /> Speaking of future careers, I met the manager the other day. He prepares a delicious chicken burger. I must also say that the uniform really suits him. I asked him about 'Party Line', and his eyes landed on the floor before he mumbled something about extra fries. Oh, I guess it did not work very well. Never mind, they let him drive tomorrow! Hurray!! 1/10
