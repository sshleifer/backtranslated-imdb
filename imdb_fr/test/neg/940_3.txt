I was not so impressed by this film, finding it rather tiring and simple. The plot was interesting, a child creating his own college and enrolling hundreds of children, but laughter was rare. The jokes were not really funny and I did not feel the guts. The characters did not intrigue me and I did not feel any of them, not even the big gray kid who was wearing glasses and was trying to get into the group of brothers. It was a good first watch, but it did not win me and it's not the one I would recommend. By comparing it to other films of the same kind, that is to say that American Pie is simply cruel, because there is a film that made a lot of laughs. This ACCEPTED did not succeed in creating a smile!
