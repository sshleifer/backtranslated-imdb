My first impression when I read the synopsis of the upcoming movie was that it was going to be very, very different from the book. The movie trailer says the movie is supposed to take place when Vivian is 19, after the death of her parents in a fire in America. She meets Aiden, an aspiring novelist. Working in a chocolate shop during the day, she must accept that she will never be normal, because every full moon, she becomes a werewolf - a mythical creature that can be compared closely to a werewolf. Most of the small changes did not look so dark, even though I'm a fan of the book called Annette Curtis Klause. I knew it would be different, but I wanted to see it to support the book, thinking that a change of age, a change of setting and some changes of occupation would not have a sufficient impact on the scenario as a whole to make me want to tear my eyes are detached from me and I let myself bleed on the theater. <br /> <br /> The film unnecessarily killed many important figures, including Vivan's mother, Esme, from the start in the fire alleged to have killed her father. I pushed that aside and ventured into the movie, tired and slightly bored. Crossing Romania, the camera angles were correct, the scenery beautiful and the music ... interesting ... but it left me with the impression "Why does Vivian look like this, and why is it Is it a hoodie? "Moving on to the following parts of the film, I must say that I am surprised that the script writers appeared to support incest in a certain way and rather than stick to the relationship of character of the book between Vivian and Rafe, the leader of the band The Five became his cousin through it (surprise!) Aunt Astrid, who, in the novel, was the harsh and hated rival of Vivan's mother and, let me add, no relationship to one or the other. <br /> <br /> To the top Out of distortions of character, Gabriel had become the leader of the pack and was obsessed with the fact that Vivian was his companion in order to fulfill a non-existent prophecy. Not only was his physical appearance completely inferred from the description of the book, but he was also apparently Rafe's father. Yes, it's true, it's a pretty little incestuous knot of tight wolves. <br /> <br /> The little things that bothered me were scenes like hunting in the forest. There was a redhead who stood out from the rest of the crowd, the one who "kissed his enemy" before his prey was released to run and be chased. Why was she there? Why did she look like Astrid? I guess my mind is not big enough to understand why such a character had to exist in the movie without any explanation as to WHY it existed other than to kiss pretty victims. <br /> <br /> I loved how the Amoeba was completely cut from the movie. I loved the legend of Aiden's past, between the supposedly dramatic scene where he told Vivian how his father wanted him to learn to defend himself, then beat his father "in self-defense" to make him look like to be such. a tragic character. <br /> <br /> The characters of the 180 are very funny when they are completely useless. At the end of the film, I felt as if someone was touching the novel, scribbling half of the list of character names, making some links here and there, mentioning that Gabriel was a fool, Vivian was in love with Aiden, he fears her when he discovers she is a werewolf of legends, and that "someone" is "killed by a silver bullet" and that there is some sort of happy ending because Vivian finally feels accepted by someone who loves him very much who she is. <br /> <br /> I gave this film a 2/10, because the shots were relatively correct, and the cast could have been worse, but for the realization, why make the jump werewolves in the air in human form, as if they wanted to fly (with their arched backs and their penchant for jumping from the heights), shimmer briefly, then fall to the ground like wolves? The only aspects of this film that even made me look at it until the end very sordid and sorry are the wolves, the beauty of the landscapes and the perverts. <br /> <br /> All together, I have to say that to appreciate this film, you have to be ready to accept misconceptions, strange events that are not always explained, incestuous innuendos and who did not like the book or have not read the book.
