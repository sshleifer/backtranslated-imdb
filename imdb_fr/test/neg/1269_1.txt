I was excited about the concept of my favorite comic book hero on TV ... and deeply disappointed by the end result. <br /> <br /> The only "incredible" thing was the crawling wall (despite the visibility of the cable). I did not think Nick Hammond was Peter Parker ... and he was obviously of a different construction than the guy who did the stunts in the spider suit. You could say they were two different actors. <br /> <br /> Certainly, I can also notice in modern Spider-Man movies that I'm watching Tobey Macguire and watching CGI. But it comes from a trained eye and a work experience with CGI. Nevertheless, version 70 could have been better despite the lack of Special FX. <br /> <br /> The canvases were hokey and looked like ropes that seemed to wrap things up rather than sticking to them. And what happened if you gave him a mobile phone with a spider. Hello? This is the people of the web slinger. <br /> <br /> Sorry, I did not want to be so pissed off, but our dear caterpillar deserved better.
