I tried. God knows I tried to love this Swiss cheese from a movie, but the story was too full of holes, some big enough to fit a horse-drawn carriage. The combination was uniform and the characters were endearing enough for you to regret their death, like newly sprayed cockroaches, scattering to die their own death. Overall, however, it was not really very scary. After all, we've seen shocked characters in the background since "The Brood", why at the time where / and it was scary then very briefly. This film has simply never solved the basic points of the plot and it is the work of the writer. Of course, you would expect the director to realize that history did not make sense. As the secret room behind the wardrobe, why did not the bloody ghost die when she received the nails as prescribed in the book they read earlier? Why did the computer say "game over" to Frankie's character while he was living? The list is lengthened increasingly. I do not really feel comfortable recommending this movie because it makes you feel that you have wasted time and that there was not enough fallout in really scary moments.
