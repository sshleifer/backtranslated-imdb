Extremely slow movie.There are great performances from all actors, which is why above 5 points.Surya and Jyo are supposed to be this ideal husband and wife and we show them until you start to ask if you start asking for a story. So one day, Jyo discovers Surya's diary to find her failed love story. This love story is not convincing at all, because Surya is an arrogant elder who always attacks Bhoomika, strikes her friend, yells her in public and despite her terror. she falls in love with him.Even after, he continues to dominate her by using foul language.I certainly could not appreciate the sweet character played by Bhoomika, I do not think that a self-respecting woman will fall into such jerks in real life.So Jyo decides to reunite them and what happens after that is the climax. The story is extremely weak in his characters. An extremely arrogant Surya towards Bhoomika is the exact opposite of Jyo (and no reason is given for the sudden change of character). Once again, Bhoomika, extremely gentle, becomes a great extrovert on her return. if she had become so confident, why did she not try to find her love, for she feared no one.
