But to be a little more specific, I do not think it's as bad as it might actually be. Even if the actors (famous or semi-famous) did not do a very good job. Failing directors? Could the script be too hard for me to say? Anyway, if you're looking for a lot of light weapons and action, this movie is not for you, but they run with a lot of vintage ww2 weapons. It's a little fun :) I guess I could say more, but it does not seem to me that it's worth it. If you are desperate enough or if you are a hackman fanatic, see it differently! <br /> <br /> Live well and prosper
