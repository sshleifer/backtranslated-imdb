After all the hype I had heard about Jane Austin's novel and the various film versions of the book, I was very disappointed with the film. I was expecting a classic drama but it was not the case. First of all, let me start with the fact that I love old movies, especially mysteries and dramas, but not movies for women. This is probably a huge difference, so take my comment with a big grain of salt. I thought the acting was a little excessive, but it's very common in movies of that time. June Allyson was good like Jo but I found each sister stereotyped and determined. There were no surprises or moments too dramatic. I hate writing negative reviews, but the film left me very cold. I always intended to read the book, but after that, it seems unlikely. The only comforting story was between the old gentlemen and the youngest sister. It was a welcome bonus in an otherwise disappointing viewing experience. Once again, there are other people who like this film, I do not belong to it.
