Debbie Boone had a monstrous success with her recording of the pop song "You Light Up My Life;" Didi Conn's movie of the same name, however, was a horribly embarrassing flop. Conn plays the stereotypical and awkward vulnerable girl who is in love with Michael Zaslow, who plays the stereotypical yuppie-wannabe guy. They are betrothed, but everyone knows that Zaslow will not marry a person who is neither blonde nor sexy, so only Didi is surprised when he throws her in the garbage. Needless to say, Didi is quite embarrassed. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, she writes a little song in her spare time, and she has created a song that she finds pretty cool. She calls him - can you guess? "You illuminate my life." She jumps in the car and goes to the big city to sell her song and make a new life. Now I remember sitting in the theater and watching her get in the car to drive into the big city and think, "Thanks, God, we've finally finished the show. Now, maybe something interesting will happen. "And something interesting happened, the credits rolled around. <br /> <br /> Yes, that's all, not only was the film badly played, poorly written and poorly filmed, but The film is really a bad film, and we're not talking about a cult movie here, we're talking about an absolute flop, a real yawn from start to finish, if you liked the song. Debbie Boone, buy a copy, but do not waste your time and money on this movie, it's a movie you'll be happy to miss. <br /> <br /> Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer
