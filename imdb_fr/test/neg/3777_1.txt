The parallels between this film and "Captain Walrus" (an independent film presented at the Team Projection Film Festival in 1994) are so obvious that any praise for "Sally Marshall is Not An Alien" must be interpreted with the belief that it is mounted. about the success of another job. <br /> <br /> In Captain Walrus, two young boys (Geoff and Roger, respectively Dean Turner and Brett Allen) examine the strange behavior of their new neighbor Britney (played by Louise Farley). Looking through their telescope, the two boys watch the repeated visits of a man in uniform whom they call Captain Walrus (played by Peter Sargent). However, in Captain Walrus, the focus is on the useless and somewhat power-hungry actions of neighbor Britney and less on the friendship between the two boys. <br /> <br /> A critical success at the film festival, Captain Walrus's plot has obviously been appropriate and reorganized to give the Australian Film Community another hack at the belt with respect to products for children. Although Sally Marshall is not an Alien, it's a good film and a credit for its producers, its lack of authenticity is lacking.
