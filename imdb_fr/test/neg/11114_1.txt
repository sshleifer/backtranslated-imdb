I watched this movie knowing that it would be terrible, but cursed if it did not create a new and revolutionary terrain in the field of faecal production as entertainment. The plot is Deep Rising with cruddy effects and acting HORRID. The lines in this ... well ... wow, there really is no way to lower this movie because I think the words have not been created in English yet. The sad thing is that the filmmakers really thought they were doing something good. You will not believe your eyes when you see how many films they have stolen without even trying to hide it. There are scenes / plots straight out of Deep Rising, Alien, Jurassic Park, Predator, Jeepers Creepers, and the list could last forever. However, unlike any of these films, it falls short of celluloid stool. The most incredulous thing about this movie, aside from how it tries to be competent but fails, is that Gimli himself-freakin'-self is there. How on earth can they afford John Rhys-Davies but no decent effects, writing, actors or sets? Really horrible ... and not the kind of bad that is good.
