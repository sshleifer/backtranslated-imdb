I recently saw this at the Palm Springs International Film Festival in 2007 and I can not believe it is Sweden's official bid for the 79th Academy Awards to be considered the best foreign film. Producer Anna Anthony last year also received the official candidacy of Sweden for the best foreign film with Zozo. Personally, I was not a fan of Zozo, but at least his production had some interest. It could have been shot as a high school movie project. As a short film, it may have worked, but as a feature film he is as lost as his characters. It is a story of five out of twenty friends who live in a small Swedish town and have no purpose, hope or ambition for the future and like to live in the past of their past childhood. In fact, Falkenberg does not look like an isolated village in northern Sweden. It is a popular seaside resort with a population of towns and villages of almost 40,000 inhabitants, located between two large cities on the southern Swedish coast, GÃ¶tborg and Malmo. The characters are quite nice, but if they were high school students with a dark or confused attitude about what they intended to do with their lives, I would probably pay more attention to them. However, they have long since passed the point where they should plan their care of adult life. If they want to stay in Falkenberg forever, there must be jobs in the tourism or fishing industry instead of just riding a bike, drinking, smoking pots and, occasionally, painting a house. Maybe if they were hanging out with a girl or two in their circle of friends, the girls are totally absent from this film, which makes no sense. Jesper Ganslandt made his debut as a director and co-wrote the film with the director of photography, which I use vaguely with the term Fredrik Wenzel. the acting is not so bad. I would give it a score of 4.5 out of 10, but despite being an Oscar nominee, I would not recommend it.
