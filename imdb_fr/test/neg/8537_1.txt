I do not expect much ghost stories, but I expect a story to make sense! Is it too much to ask writers and filmmakers? When the villain, all of a sudden, becomes a deadly maniac only because a group of crows starts pecking at him, then I have a problem spending $ 9.00 for a ticket! Alfred Hitchcock would be spinning in his grave. Did not someone learn anything in his 101 movie class in college? A good movie originates from an interesting story! <br /> <br /> Here are some of the ridiculous messages from this film: If you have desperate financial problems, move from Chicago to the middle of nowhere in North Dakota. grow sunflowers (I do not make fun of you!). If your child has serious neurological problems as a result of a car accident, stay away from some of the best hospitals and speech therapists in a small, isolated town with, at best, a community hospital. Hire a wanderer to live and work with you, unexpectedly, without checking all references, when you have a teenage daughter, a woman and a toddler. (I'm glad they are not my parents!) <br /> <br /> A city where everyone knows that everything would be easy to miss a triple homicide, just outside the city . And, of course, attribute the madness of the man to a bad harvest of sunflowers! (Something does not grow in North Dakota?) A few days after buying your dilapidated home - with huge vines growing everywhere - it reminds you of Jack and the Beanstalk, a guy from X-Files, like Smoking Man, (I'm glad to see that cigarettes have not had it, I guess it does not inhale!) Will suddenly sneak you while you work to offer you the selling price of your house, plus 15% more, without any reason! <br /> <br /> I think you understand. I have seen so many terrible movies forgotten in recent months, it surprises me! Is it so difficult to make a movie that does not treat the audience like an idiot? I'm glad at least the crows in this sorry movie turned out to have the brain! I wish I could say the same for anyone thinking of making money with this celluloid bin!
