This film lost 2 hours of my time and made me want to shout: "BLADE". Nicholas Stoller writes the film "Yes Man", but says "this" maybe he should stick to writing. <br /> <br /> I am so disappointed because I heard all the positive comments. I was expecting something like an upside down. They say it comes from the manufacturer of "Knocked Up"? why do not I see the resemblance? but for me, it looked like a superficial film and excessively thematic. I am so disappointed. In fact, it's not bad if you think of it as your medium-chick movie, but this "guy in the band" character just gets on my nerves. <br /> <br /> Maybe I was not doing enough watch out for the movie, but yes, they have some fun lines and scenes, but I did not feel the originality. And the end makes the film a little better. At least, the end is not a boring cliche.
