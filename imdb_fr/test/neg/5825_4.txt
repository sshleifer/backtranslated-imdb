I do not understand the many good reviews here. I found the photography and the beautiful scenery, and the two main actors attractive, but there is not much else to recommend this film. The false accents of the South and the poorly written dialogue are the most boring. These do not sound like real people to me. While it is refreshing to show men exploring various forms of sexuality without the usual labeling and stereotypical traits, most of the story is unmotivated and unreasonable. The only thing that makes sense is Griffith's responsibility to his aunt with mental illness, which is obviously exaggerated by Karen Black. Lee is an interesting character who would have been more convincing if his dialogue had been more natural and his motives clearer. Yes, I understand that he is a wanderer, but his actions as the film draws to its hasty conclusion make no sense. This film is worth the detour, mainly because it gives off a pleasant atmosphere, but it is slow and deeply imperfect. A serious rewrite and a better edition could have recorded it, because the premises and the narrative of the story are promising.
