With horrendous movies like this one even being considered even less as being done, it's very easy to see why Hollywood has such serious problems with bad conspiracies and worse ones all the time. being laughing their ends on "black" jokes, the "mackerel" look and the "Bling". It's so incredible and exaggerated that it even exceeds the mark "Too bad, it's funny again" and that I found myself immersed in "totally embarrassing for anyone involved". very sorry for every minute I lost on this one. I want to get my time back! <br /> <br /> Spare yourself, do not pay attention to that. The only reason I even give 1 point in the note is that 0 was not an option.
