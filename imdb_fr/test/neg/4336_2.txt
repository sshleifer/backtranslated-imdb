You talk about annoying snoring. This movie of 3rd quality bikers put me to sleep as soon as the opening credits appeared on the screen. The shame is that the cast included many actors, including George Kennedy, Karen Black, Leo Gordon, Richard Lynch, Lance Henriksen and William Forsythe. <br /> <br /> Take off from the classic Western High Noon, this is essentially the story of a former green beret of the US Army (Henriksen) who is trying to help him rid a single horse-riding town. a bunch of scary bikers. <br /> <br /> Everybody tries, but the script is at the primary school level. Sad to see Kennedy, winner of the Academy Award, in such a scenario after his outstanding performance in Cool Hand Luke. <br /> <br /> If you have trouble sleeping at night, it would be a perfect movie movie to rent .......... you'll sleep in no time!
