Tempest is based on the classic Shakespearean work of the same name, but does not look much like its source material. <br /> <br /> He disguises himself as being cerebral as his namesake, but is rather a rough, complicated and hackney exercise in boredom. The original looked at the principle that people have a perverse side, which would be destructive if not controlled. Here, you've just got an uninteresting mid-life crisis nonsense ball that has everything to go into his personal and professional life. He becomes endowed with a supernatural power that he uses to try to control his environment. in other words: to fend for yourself. <br /> <br /> Every few minutes, after something bad happens in his pathetic life, he finds an isolated place and begins to babble saying "Show me the magic!" waving hands and making an expression of "serious concentration". Based on how these scenes are shot, it looks like it's trying to turn bugs into other types of bugs. Turn a spider into a cockroach, maybe, but at that moment, you do not care. <br /> <br /> The story tells of his life with his daughter on a Greek island somewhere, then it is embarrassing. relationship with a girl he meets, one of the darkest novels ever engaged in the film. The story gets bogged down and moves at a slower pace. You are never given any reason to love or dislike people. <br /> <br /> I'll give you a 2 because of the great Greek shots and the semi-optimistic conclusion (although it's not clear if the storm the power has brought this end about or not). The spirit of Shakespeare's work has been much better captured in other films; A notable example is "Forbidden Planet", which gives credit to the loss of control of power. <br /> <br /> As for this "Tempest", its only magic is to cure insomnia.
