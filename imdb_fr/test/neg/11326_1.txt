Years ago, I was deliberately watching bad movies. Somehow I missed this one. No gesture sounds right. No facial expression matches the scene or action. I have never heard such inappropriate music for a movie. During the final scene, I was looking for the car to crush this ridiculous kid - one of the worst kids actors of all time. <br /> <br /> Only one name I've heard of - Wilford Brimley. He must have been very hungry to take this part. <br /> <br /> DO NOT HAVE ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, WATCH THIS FILM !!! YOU HAVE BEEN PREVENTED !!!
