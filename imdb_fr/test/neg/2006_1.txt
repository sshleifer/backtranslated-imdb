Hey, if people thought Ed Wood was a bad director, they just did not see this movie. I mean there were gaping holes in the ground and an underused casting. Special effects of poor quality. I mean, I can not believe this movie came out of a Hollywood studio. A high school theater club could probably offer a better product. I mean they had Erika Eleniak, who is gorgeous Casper van Dien and underrated actor. Their agents should be shot to ask them to sign this dribble, do not read the scripts. I still can not believe this little list was a survivor in the movie. I hit my head all the time, but not a descendant of van helsing, but the last man standing. I'm a fan of vampire movies and it's by far the worst they should bet so they never see the light of day.
