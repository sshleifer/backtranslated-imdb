The only people I would recommend this film to be both blind and deaf, although I'm sure a sadomasochist would take a good shot. This film had nothing; no interpretation, dreadful music, dreadful scenario - only the power to suck the happiness of your soul. You may be wondering now why or even how I managed to sit for an hour and a half of utter futility, and honestly, it's a difficult concept for me. First, I had to paces as the film progressed because I found it extremely difficult to put myself at ease. Secondly, I did it without biting my arm in order to have something with which to beat me to death by phoning friends for moral support when the plot became particularly slow. The problem was that I was getting proud to finish it after the first thirty minutes and that was a fatal mistake on my part. Normally, I like that movies leave you something in the end, but all this was only taken. For mental health reasons, do not watch this movie.
