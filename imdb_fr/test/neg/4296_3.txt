I was lucky to see if a very good movie from the First World War might have escaped my attention - that's not it. John Phillip Law and Don Stroud are both stiff in their game and misinterpreted for their roles. The dialogue is silent or nonexistent; the flight sequences are correct but quite repetitive. Compared to the formidable "Blue Max", this film should never have been shot. Look George Peppard, James Mason and Usula Andress in BM and you'll understand why this movie is one of the best war movies ever made and it's not. Recently released on DVD, Richtofen and Brown is presented as a great "classic lost" 70s. I sold mine the day after my purchase. Do not waste your time or $.
