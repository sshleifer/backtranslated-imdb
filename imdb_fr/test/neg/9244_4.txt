Korine has now established himself as a talented and impressive image creator. The promotional posters of Mister Lonely include all the most impressive compositions of the film (although there is one especially in the promotional material: that of a nun dressed in blue who teases a dog with a stick, surrounded by a green forest under a pouring rain pour down). The first images of this film, from Michael Jackson's double (Diego Luna) riding a small motorcycle around a circuit, are strangely fascinating and beautiful: Roy Orbison's "Mister Lonely" plays on the soundtrack and the images are shot at slow motion. There is also a fun and fantastic sequence in which the same character mime a dance, without music (even if a radio sits like a silent dog next to him), in the middle of a Parisian street; The episodes of Korine in sound effects and jumps that evoke both a sense of uselessness and a tenacious release in the character's dance routine. <br /> <br /> The first example of the nuns segment is also strangely poignant; Father Umbrillo (Werner Herzog) is an autocratic priest on the verge of stealing with nuns and laying food in poor areas nearby. In a scene that is both light and touching, Herzog faces an enthusiastic and enthusiastic local who wants to travel by plane with them to see his wife in San Francisco. As the exchange develops, Herzog draws a confession from the man's confession: he has sinned, and his frequent infidelity is at the origin of the fact that his wife left him. This scene, short and sweet, takes a particular weight after learning its origins improvised: the sinner is played by a non-actor who was on the set when Korine and his girlfriend. were filming - and his adulterous behavior had earned him, in real life, a lasting and overwhelming guilt. <br /> <br /> The film is now a game of chance; a succession of intrinsically interesting moments that add to a frivolous and confused narrative. While Gummo and Julien Donkey-Boy maintain their aesthetic and emotional weight through coherent structural frameworks, Mister Lonely feels victim to the ruthless editing room. Some scenes of the film were cut, which would have allowed to paint more complete images of certain characters, because of continuity errors in the costumes. A result, no doubt, because of the lack of a filming scenario and Korine's tendency to improvise. A particular deleted scene - in which Charlie Chaplin (Denis Lavant) and Madonna (Melita Morgan) have sex - would have added much more emotional conflict to a scene later in the film (I will not talk about it, but he is there to deflate any feeling of warmth or celebration and, in this case, he only half succeeds). <br /> <br /> The two parts of the story, literally disconnected, are better addressed as two totally different stories. with the same allegorical meaning; one compliments the other and vice versa. (This is something to do with the conflict between his ambitions and the reality of the current situation.) But the scenes of Herzog are not numerous enough to deserve their place in the film, so any link between these two Allegorically linked links is inevitably tense. - and the inclusion is retrospectively tedious. <br /> <br /> This is an ambitious step forward from Julien Donkey-Boy who suffers mainly, at least in similar segments, from too many characters in place of the film the length of the race , a defect that would have been even worse if big stars had played against everyone (as originally planned). <br /> <br /> Many beauties of this imagery, as well as moments of real and authentic connection with As for the soundtrack, one has the impression that it would be much better for an installation of art or at a photo exhibition. As an exploration of the mimesis and the nature of identity theft, she would lose none of her powers. In fact, it might be more impressive for me. The loneliness attached to iconic performativity (such as that encountered by both icons and those who aspire to be like them) is captured by images such as the one where "Marilyn Monroe" (a superb Samantha Morton) seduces the camera with a Seven Year Itch pose in the middle of a forest or when 'Sammy Davis, Jr.' (Jason Pennycooke) settles, rehearsal after the dance, his back turned to the camera overlooking an incredible and tranquil lake. <br /> <br /> Such as it is, moments like these, and all those where titles of titles randomly selected Michael Jackson's songs roam the scene by marrying each other in a cinematic story much less touching than it should be. <br /> <br /> (For those who see it, I lost all faith during the egg-song scene, you will know what scene I'm talking about because it comes out like a sore thumb, a kind of a phantasmagorical attempt at the new cinematographic language for which Korine has already been hailed.)
