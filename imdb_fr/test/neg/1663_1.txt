Some weak children unintentionally unleash an evil that has been dormant for twenty years and must reap the fortune that results. The Campbell Brothers movie before this "Midnight Skater" was fun and their picture after "The Red Skulls". "So, why is" Demon Summer "so insane? I really do not know, it's better than their" Splatter Rampage Wrestling ", but not so much that the level of actor in the basement is crazy , and when a "horror" movie is as talkative as this one, it's not a good thing.The story has been put to death in many other movies, so why waste your time with this? here? <br /> <br /> My note: D-
