spoilers <br /> <br /> This film is not action packed; it's slow and boring. It's not funny or exciting, it's predictable and plays on cheap sentimentality and vague patriotism. The special effects are neither imaginative nor impressive. They are noisy and uninspired. <br /> <br /> Actor's talent is wasted in one-liners and desperately stupid clich√©s. These are sprung by characters that they should just call "nice black giant man", "eccentric genius who is about to crack", "square jaw hero who becomes adult", "loose coward of the book" , "Unlucky player who lives by a code of honor, an" impulsive princess "and so on. <br /> <br /> And writing! How many non-dramatic countdowns did they think they could insert in this case? Is a scene where people have to defuse a bomb by cutting one thread or another is considered a fiction? The drama of the last 15 minutes of the film depends on the audience who cares whether a fool can put aside his personal differences with Ben Affleck and say goodbye to Liv Tyler in time to SAVE THE EARTH. All the work is done; we just have to wait a few more seconds for Harry Stamper, the asshole, to throw a few lines of cotton candy. I know that Bruce Willis is a generally charismatic guy, but his Harry Stamper character is an odious nuisance. I thought he deserved the Golden Razzy and he was rewarded for this role. <br /> <br /> Since the film is so long, the plot is so obvious and the dialogue is within everyone's reach, one can not help but notice the inaccuracies. , inconsistencies and ground holes. 800 feet in something the size of TX is less than a pin stitch. Try to walk 800 feet in TX and see how far from the center you are. After all the talk about artificial gravity on the Russian station, it seems to be arbitrary once inside. In fact, gravity comes and goes throughout the film. Does it make sense that someone other than Michael Bay gives these morons one or two shuttles and sends them to blow up an asteroid threatening the Earth? <br /> <br /> The sentimental montages of commercial style phone / insurance / cola were revolting. <br /> <br /> I like action movies. Really. This one is boring, stupid and really stuck on itself. This deserves hatred and contempt, because that's all the most expensive efforts in Hollywood have become: a group of inexpensive shots ranging from one costly explosion to another. Oh yes, all this is imbued with a Neanderthal conservative view of sex, politics, etc.
