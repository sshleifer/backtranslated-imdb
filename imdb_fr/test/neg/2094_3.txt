Not to be confused with the popular Samuel L. Jackson vehicle, SNAKES ON A PLANE; SNAKES ON A TRAIN is small budget, has no actors (strictly speaking), but some visual effects rather decent. An attractive young woman (Julia "Rayanne" Ruiz) does not want to marry someone else's choice for her husband; it is therefore subject to a powerful Mayan curse in which snakes hatch inside its body and slowly devour from within. His only hope of survival is a shaman who lives across the border in Texas. Time is pressing for her; and she is put on a train from El Paso to Los Angeles. In a short time, snakes leave their body agonized by pain and grow rapidly. Passengers on the train are now trapped and will soon snacks for snakes. The final sequence is without a doubt the best of this 91-minute film. Alby Castro, Al Galvez and Giovanni Bejarno also receive credits.
