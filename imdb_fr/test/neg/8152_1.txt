Being myself (a little) independent filmmaker, I really understand what these guys were trying to do and that seems like a good idea. On paper. On the 16mm film, however, it's awful. I did not realize it was done in the mid-90s because the film was so gritty and so bad that I would have sworn it was one of those 30-year-old films in which a porn producer was trying to integrate with the general public. And the sound! Ugh, I do not know what kind of mic they used to record, but it looks like someone is walking on dead leaves throughout the process. I guess I should not judge too harshly, after all, how many feature films did MY company release? None, but I would like to think that we would have at least a good quality of image and sound to accompany our bad actors, authors and directors. A + for idea, F-- for execution.
