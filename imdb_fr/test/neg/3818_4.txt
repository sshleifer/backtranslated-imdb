Let me just give you some advice, if you're going to watch this movie just to see a bunch of inimitable characters get slaughtered in a dozen different ways, then you'll love this movie because everyone dies of a death horrible, beyond the gore there is not much else. <br /> <br /> where do I start: -the characters are not popular with the audience, because there is no story behind for any of them because I did not feel connected to none of them, in fact I did not like any of them, and I was so fed up with them that at the end of the movie, I was looking for the disfigured blur to kill them all. (which he did by the way) <br /> <br /> - beautiful acting; I mean I did not understand him, let's take the Asian guide, for example, he spoke perfect English, and after the sinking of his boat he had a strong accent, and later he spoke English. normal. <One of the worst endings for horror: (if you can call it that) after the monster / mutant man kills almost everyone, he is killed by the last two idiots, or so they thought! the monster / human thing is finally killed when the beauty and the geek stick a pole through his heart / nick (it was hard to say) and probably he died right in front of them (within arm's reach) but later he comes back and kill them (wtf) I mean why he does not kill them just when he was right next to them. Arghhhh! I mean it was too late, it was as if the writer did not know where he wanted the story to go (or he was missing 80 minutes for a few minutes, so he added some later twists to the movie so that people can get 80 minutes of shit instead of 75 minutes. <br /> <br /> What I did not understand is why did not they just kill that damn thing while he was unconscious, but they just went out like idiots and left the only reason I gave him a 4, it's because of the gore that was actually the only thing I watched this movie up to 'in the end, to watch them all get killed., I'm serious)
