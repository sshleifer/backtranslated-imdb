Jack Frost 2. THE worst "horror movie" I have ever seen. Why? 1) The premise is WELL beyond the ridiculous 2) The damn thing does not even have legs to move! 3) He escapes AFTER being completely overwhelmed by Anti-Freeze (first movie) 4) Get this ... He crosses an ocean of salt water to a tropical island to take revenge on the sheriff who hit him on the first on board. movie. 5) "Killer Snowballs". I'm not yet drunk enough to see "Ginger Dead Man". From the writing of this story, Jack Frost 2 has the distinction of being the most stupid movie "horror" of all time. Even going beyond the inanity of his predecessor (if you can believe it!).
