I went to see this movie at the theater and paid for it thinking that it would be at least slightly entertaining. The only thing I liked about it was when Robin Williams crashed against the car at the bottom of the hill and at the end, when he seems to have been killed. Glenn Close was obnoxious and she obviously did not look old enough to be Garp's mother. A mother like Garp reportedly had her children abducted by the Department of Childhood and Family. <br /> <br /> Robin Williams and his icy donut look of benevolent goodness are just too sweet and smarmy for me. He can play two roles: a funny person or a sad, tragic, heart-shaped victim. See Fisher King, Good Morning Vietnam and all his so-called "dramatic" roles. It's always the same performance. Put them all together in a long mini-series. Glenn Close is always a cold fish. Remember the fatal attraction? Would you have an affair with her even on your worst day and if you were single? Did you feel sparks between her and Michael Douglas? Have you ever seen Glenn Close warming up a screen? John Lithgow had the only interesting role. It was when he was playing against serial killers and bad guys. So it was funny to see him transsexual. Garp is for anyone who likes to see movies about sick, abnormal, dysfunctional people who claim that it's beautiful and deep.
