Throughout the 50s, 60s, 70s and even 80s, many war films were produced in the former Yugoslavia, glorifying the heroism of the "Partisans". civilians who surrendered to wage a guerrilla war against the invasion of German forces. Hajrudin Krvavac, who is generally known only in the countries of Eastern Europe, has directed many of these stories of "partisans"; unfortunately, only a handful of them have been exported to the rest of Europe and the United States. "The Battle of the Eagles" is a rare and low-budget look at the formation and feats of the Partisan Air Force. <br /> <br /> Marshal Tito declares that a partisan air force must be formed to fight the German Luftwaffe over the sky over Yugoslavia. A group of former pilots join forces with two small biplanes and begin raiding enemy bases and convoys. Over the course of several months, more and more pilots and planes joined the ranks, eventually forming a formidable air force. Maybe it's history, or maybe it's fable ?? whatever it is, it's certainly not convincing, but big players are trying to make it work. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a well-aimed German air attack against defenseless supporters. The intrigue and intrigue of the plot come together almost immediately, and for a brief moment the audience discovers a series of rather patriotic scenes. Then the action begins and this title quickly becomes a new low budget adventure. All the characters are familiar clich√©s: Major Dragan (interpreted by a well-meaning Bekim Fehmiu) is our patriotic and heroic main man. It takes off with a machine gun on takeoff planes and even takes part in an aerial duel with the villain Klauberg (Radko Polic), a climax quite predictable and corny with a result just as predictable. The rest of the fans are familiar: Ljubisa Samardzic ("The Battle of Neretva") is a Zare, a playboy of choice; Bata Zivojinovic ("Hell River") is Voss, a former traveler coming out of the woods while his country needs him. and Rados Bajic ("The day that has changed the world") is Dalibor, a young messenger who has climbed the ladder to finally become a seasoned combat pilot. The characters and their stories are familiar to all war fans and Krvavac does not try to build on these stereotypes. Distribution does a fair job, and despite the two-dimensional scenario, each player is attractive and fun to watch. Bajic, in particular, has great moments ?? when he takes his first flight as a gunner, and later, when he will be forced to land after the murder of the pilot. The plot is simply a series of air raids against the Germans and subsequent retaliation. <br /> <br /> Krvavac manages action sequences with skill by combining real sequences and miniature effects. Unfortunately, thumbnails are so inexpensive and so false that the transitions between real aerial photography and toy planes are discordant and laughable. Some of the bombing and shelling scenes seem shocking, while the fights involving smaller models, as well as figurine pilots, are simply pathetic. Sometimes the puffs of "machine gun" smoke are so big that the smoke engulfs the whole model. Worse yet, publishers often overlay shots of fighters on real footage. Although planes are usually in a proper perspective, they are surrounded by an annoying glow that prevents any attempt at realism. Bojan Adamic has created an incredibly familiar and boring score. <br /> <br /> "The battle of the eagles" also suffers from a publication in English very poorly edited. To begin, there is a lack of 28 minutes of film ?? cutting the movie from 130 minutes to just 102 minutes. The missing segments were excised without care and the cut seems very sloppy. The musical signals are abruptly cut off and the scenes are dropped before being resolved. In the last third of the film, the story collapses and only some scenes of action that are badly needed can try to preserve its total incomprehensibility. Then there is dubbing ?? All the scenes that revolve around the Partisans are dubbed in English (quite badly though), but several long scenes remain in German, without the subtitling. The film might have been more meaningful if the footage in German had been excised instead of crucial scenes around the Partisans. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, Krvavac handles the sequences well outdoors. There is never a moment when the audience feels like they are on a sound stage. In particular, the bases of the German Luftwaffe are vast, supplemented by dozens of Messerschmitt combat aircraft and costumed extras in leather flying jackets. The landscape is cool and green and Krvavac is not afraid to shoot scenes from extremely wide angles or from far away, simply to express the extent of a battle or a long hike. At the beginning of the photo, a German ambush against a partisan unit stands out, as well as a sequence where Zare and Dalibor escape from an enemy base. <br /> <br /> As it exists in the personal video "The Battle of the Eagles" is just one of many stories about the movement of Yugoslav partisans. There is nothing that distinguishes it from the rest of the culture, and the dreadful special effects and drastic modifications place it a notch below acceptable. Try to avoid this one unless you find a full copy.
