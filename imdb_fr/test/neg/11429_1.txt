Oh that's it! A movie, which is told by people to remind me of the epic "Trainspotting". OUCH, I was crazy to believe that, and OUCH, how it hurt my buttocks after forcing myself to watch this scene from beginning to end. After the first 10 to 15 minutes, I just wanted everything to finish, or at least they could have put some nudity or action or some refreshing house music to make it worth defeating ... with that, I put it in my CD shelf and I hope I will never have to iron it to show it to a friend so eager to see him that he does not want to listen to my warnings.
