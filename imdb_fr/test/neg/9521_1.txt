I was very interested in this film despite the article I read about the director in Tattler magazine. I do not judge films by what the director may or may not have done. This first feature film was very difficult to watch. I found that the split screens were a distraction for the drama in the movie, that some secondary characters had poor performances and that the movie was a copy of several other films I had seen. There was really nothing fresh about it
