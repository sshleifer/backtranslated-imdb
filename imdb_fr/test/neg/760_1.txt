A horrible film; badly written, badly acted, clich√©, disheveled, dross. The premise is so good and the opportunity to inform about black cowboys, but the film is really disastrous. It's a curious mix of a bad 1950s Randolph Scott B film and a bad 1970s spaghetti western. The bad guys are cardboard, the flashbacks are laughable, the dialogue is unbearable. <br /> <br /> Deliberate anachronisms (such as "Victorian" rap singers and modern big words like "motherf **** er") irritate the extreme. <br /> <br /> A Frankenstein monster who died on the lab table.
