While browsing the comments, there does not seem to be much love for this film, and it is not very difficult to understand why, it sucks. <br /> <br /> Now, I'll start by saying that the death of Donald Pleasance (Dr. Loomis) in post-production has had serious consequences for the product. This necessitated a reshuffling of the film's conclusion when Loomis bought the farm and removed what was to be a twofold ending with Micheal swapping places with the mysterious "Man in Black" and I do not mean Johnny Cash . <Br /> <br /> Let's move on to the story. The fifth film ended unsatisfactorily with Micheal Myers escaping from prison with the mysterious man in black. It turns out (aggh) that this man knows the origin of Micheal's evil and is also a colleague of Dr. Loomis named Dr. Wynn. They also kidnapped Jamie Lloyd (played by Danielle Harris in parts 4 and 5 but played here by JC Brandy). Jamie, pregnant, escapes Dr. Wynn's lair. Micheal follows her and kills her. But she had the child so he now needs to find his baby to be able to kill his grand nephew. <br /> <br /> We hear ridiculous explanations of Micheal's evil involving Gaelic curses in bloody lineages and mysterious symbols. A radio show airs from Micheal's hometown for whatever reason, giving Michael an even more unfortunate number of casualties. <br /> <br /> In the end, the film is vague, confused and without direction with a very anticlimactic end. . <br /> <br /> Some scenes of sex and nudity. Mediocre plot, passable effects, good performance, but kills a lot, but lacks motivation. For what was supposed to explain everything, it only caused new questions, made Parts 4 and 5 useless and a bad way for a great Pleasance actor to end his days and his career.
