I went to the movies hoping to see an excellent film based on word of mouth and excellent reviews. the minute the opening sequence started, I knew I was in trouble. the music and the generics tried so hard to evoke the emotion that I wanted to throw up. All I get from this movie are clich√© characters, an artificial dialogue and an emotionless scenario. director / screenwriter Paul haggis has managed to get great reviews with his manipulative and self-righteous handwriting, but that does not deceive me. some performances were good. Don Cheadle is always good. I think Terrance Howard is slightly overrated, but he was decent. ridiculous was way too much on the nose. he should stick to rap. Brendan Fraser was fine. Jennifer Esposito left no impression of this fact. I can not find anything interesting about it. Sandra Bullock is always the same in all the films, she is doing very well. Matt Dillon was very good and I liked watching him work. Ryan Philippe was good too. but as for the ugly scenario and staging - it's actually one of those movies that's so boring that I've taken the time to write about it. I would not recommend this film to anyone, what a waste of time.
