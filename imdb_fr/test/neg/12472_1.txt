Although I watched Sal√≤, I do not know if the feces have a sour taste. If so, this "film" is titled precisely. So much of roughage, so little substance, it is the celluloid equivalent of celery, with the difference that it does not clean the palate. It leaves the taste of time lost in the mouth of the mind, and if I could throw up that film and recover that stretch / expense, I would do it. The detention was more exciting. The director should be forced to wear a donkey's cap and Spirit of Ed Wood Jr. could not save this semi-professional projection of some failure. A waste of time, a loss of spirit. ** Do not be fooled by the tooth of Dominique Swain: good to know she was in the remake of Lolita, less tragic and tastier than Sue Lyon, but not better. However, a previously competent screw turn does not make her a skilled craftsman. You need crafts for that, no shit, that's what this movie is. The reels belong to the girls' bathroom and are emptied until the pipes burst, while the director / Direct-Direct Christina Wayne should do 5 to 10 in the study room. Watch what's going on and pass this class, by (goodbye), forever!
