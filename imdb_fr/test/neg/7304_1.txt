This must be the biggest joke of all time. I am surprised that all the other actors have kept an impassive face. Maybe I'm wrong, but this film gives me the impression that they tricked Frank Stallone and Joe Estevez into acting with a budget of just under $ 40, depending on the cost of those hardware costs the most inconsistent film ever created, and sit back and laugh because Joe Estevez and Frank Stallone were not in the joke. <br /> <br /> If, by chance, they did not joke and were legitimately trying to make a real movie, I'm sorry for everyone involved in the creation. I had a love affair with cheese films, but this movie is so bad that I can hardly watch it. They repeat unnecessary "special effects" over and over again that it is obvious that they were trying to hide the fact that they only shot 30 minutes of film. If I have to watch this film several times in a row, I will club myself unconscious after about one and a half times. Without wishing to offend the great Frank Stallone, I would rather see Sylvester give a finger painting class for 10 hours rather than watching this movie.
