Doll Master is an example of a lousy horror movie, fallen somewhere in space with its two less established genres, a horror movie and an emotional drama. It looks like The Doll Master is doing his best to be a very scary horror movie, but he fails. The sound of moving dolls is similar to Kayako croaking in Ju-On, and the crawlings look like sadako esquire. The killer dolls will remember you, a cute version of "Chucky". But compared to Child's Play, this movie is more superb. But the story seems nothing, the brilliant photos of the camera and the brilliance of the game have been removed because of the plot. <br /> <br /> Do not look at it if you expect big shocks.
