Lance Henriksen has been paid to appear in this video. I hope it was a lot. <br /> <br /> Kristie Phillips, former US champion gymnast, begins as Charlie Case, a gymnast turned secret agent (as it is very common for munchkin gymnasts to become government spies ...) /> <br /> There's a really hysterical opening scene where Charlie's uneven bars routine is sabotaged by a competitor from the Eastern Bloc. The following is one of the most ridiculous waterfall scenes I've ever seen ... and they want you to take it seriously! Do not worry ... she puts her foot down. <br /> <br /> All that follows is a mess, a fucking spy movie. Watch for the first 15 minutes for campy-gymnastics and run for shelter.
