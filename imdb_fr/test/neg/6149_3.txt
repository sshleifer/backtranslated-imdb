But again, what's going on? I picked it up at my local 99cent store for, you guessed it, 99 cents (plus tax). I remember seeing it on video as a teenager and thinking it was a cool movie. Too bad the movie and my memories do not match. Anyway, it's not a horrible way to blow a few hours, and it's good to see vintage Bill Paxton and Mark Hamill. Blah .... Blah ... Blah .... Man, oh man, I can not think of anything else to say about this movie ... (Just fill the space to respect the rule ten lines ...) Damn! How pathetic is this film so bad that I could best imagine five lines of text? In any case, ten lines of text, huh? Hmmm, it's hard to find ten lines when you can not remember a movie you just watched.
