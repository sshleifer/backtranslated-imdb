First, let me start by saying that I am a buff of Laurel and Hardy. I read each book printed about them and saw all the available movies more than once. I even tried my luck once and called Stan on the phone. He was very kind and talked with me for over ten minutes. I followed with a letter, and he replied to me a letter. I still have this letter. <br /> <br /> This movie has some good moments of comedy, but Stan and Ollie are not up to their usual form. Stan was seriously ill during production and seemed even worse than ten years later. In my opinion, all of Laurel and Hardy's films are worth the detour. <br /> <br /> But the ultimate opinion of this film comes from the great Stan Laurel himself. To quote him, "This film should never have been done."
