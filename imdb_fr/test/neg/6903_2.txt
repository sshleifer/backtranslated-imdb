It was so boring! No conspiracy whatsoever! Basically, a diluted version of the Lion King mixed with Animal Farm. Again, no conspiracy at all. Horrible! Worst hour and a half of my life! Oh my God! I had to leave the theater a few minutes just to relieve myself! I may have laughed twice. All semi-funny parts are in the previews. I hate movies like that. Yeah, the movie was pretty bad. I do not know how he got good grades and reviews. THERE IS NO FIELD OR HISTORY! If you are going to see this movie, bring a pillow or a girlfriend / boyfriend to keep you busy. Terrible. I do not think I ever went to a movie and I liked it less. It was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because I would be angry if I had paid $ 7.50 to see this shit.
