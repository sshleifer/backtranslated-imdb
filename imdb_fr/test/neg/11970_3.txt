Jerk hazer Mike and David (Caleb Roehrig), diabetic hypoglycemic, hanging on a wooden cross with this scarecrow, a legendary ghost story. . They get a PD position at Sam who is in shock and sends a punch to Mike who falls on his girlfriend Patty (Kristina Sheldon) instead. To let the poor man hang is his punishment. One way or another, Sam's soul "emerges" with the inanimate scarecrow that comes from the cross to destroy all those who let the poor guy rot. Mike and the gang send the uninitiated dorks to slaughter Sam, but they are the first to receive a blade that hangs in their throats. Mike and his group head for the beach to swallow alcohol, play volleyball and bicker until the scarecrow arrives to end their little party. Sam's substitute brother, Jack (Matthew Linhardt) is supposed to watch him, but decides to sleep with a new love, Beth (Samantha Aisling) instead. So when he gets a message from Mike on his mobile phone about how they let Sam hang on the cross while they were at the beach, taking in the sun and sand, Jack is frantic with fear. Beth's former father is a doctor and agrees to consult him after Sam's health condition, after they shot the almost-dead young man, bringing him to the emergency hospital. Back to the beach to confront Mike because of his negligence (... not to mention Jack's promise to coach Ramsey, played by UFC fighter Ken Shamrock, in the absence of hazing), Jack and Beth will face the same straw-drenched assassin who bounces the others. Coach Ramsey, who was part of a hazing incident that caused deadly injuries, has to deal with demons himself as he informs the group's survivors of what they are facing. <br /> <br /> Babies, breasts and blood..This film follows the basic slasher guidelines. However, this film also features the typical slasher traits of nerdy characters, acting, dialogue and plot. The film shows signs of low budget, especially in the violence, because most of the actual actions take place off screen instead of showing them up close, personal and. What appears on the screen is mainly the result of the killer's revenge: a guy holding his belly, another with a stake (holding the volleyball net of the group) diving through his chest, splashing blood after the strike of a woman on her head, presumably with a big rock, a chick lying dead after the scarecrow hit her with the SUV, etc. There are also dubbing problems where it is clear that the sound of their voice often does not correspond to the movements of their lips .. especially the involuntarily hilarious sequence where Ed (Travis Parker), budding rock star, sings for his friends a horrible song that seems to impress them.
