Bhagam Bhag was a waste of time and money! I wonder if Govinda made this movie? Govinda ... dude ... I'm your big fan, you have to make the right decisions now by choosing a movie? I wonder if he played a role in this film. Govinda's role could be attributed to Johnny Lever. Akshay Kumar steals the show here! Akshay ... Dud U Rock! you have created a space in the hearts of all around the world! Lara Dutta, Tansuhree ... you deserve better. Rawal Paresh is good to his mind! on the whole, there were few scenes where I laughed ... otherwise, I just wondered "heck, did Priyadarshan make such a stupid movie?" Anyway, let it wait and watch the next movie.
