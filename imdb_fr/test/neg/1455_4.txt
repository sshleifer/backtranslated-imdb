Overrated crowd comedy. The director Demme forces actors to pause after a few fun lines to let the audience laugh and not miss the next line. It seems strange - this director did "Silence of The Lambs" - now there is a way to use the breaks! Casting seems off. Mathew Modine, too young for the FBI agent and Pfeiffer's love interest! Dean Stockwell is doing a Jack Nicholson thing with a strabismus, and he gets a nomination for that! Moreover, we have to accept Pfeiffer and Stockwell as Italians? Charles Napier as a hairdresser and Al Lewis as a mafia lawyer are underused with a single trait each - they should be hoods. The score of the song by Chris Isaak is totally irrelevant - best for a movie like "Pretty In Pink". To do the filming again, it's worth it, but with a correct cast and director and the satire will be revealed ... even the "Forgedaboutit" often repeated.
