This film can be described as a very long episode of a very bad sitcom. How much vaguely humorous misunderstandings can you put in a single movie? The notes are misplaced, the bags are replaced, the conversations are misinterpreted, people mingle, the situations are misinterpreted and, somewhere, people are supposed to laugh at something. Writers really have a hard time keeping everything, which makes dialogues really forced. If someone in this film acted like a real person, all that would be solved in about two minutes and everyone could go back into their lives, but they must keep the misunderstandings. From time to time, this film also tries to make you laugh in a juvenile way, but all it takes is that you remember how "funny" American Pie was. The scene with the nerd telling the prostitute (he thinks he is a foreign student) to "eat his sausage" is going on forever, not a second is funny. However, I must give credit to this film: because of the secondary plot about the stolen money, it is not as boring as it could have been. He also laughs here and there, but unfortunately returns to another misunderstood character. Overall, this movie is too lame.
