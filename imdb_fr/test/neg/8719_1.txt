If you have never read the classic science fiction novel on which this mini-series is based, it may be a good thing. Unfortunately, if you are a fan of the book, you probably will not be able to watch for more than an hour or two. All the political plot has been removed from the film, the most important scenes of the book have been removed, the motivations of the characters have been completely changed and the words are poorly pronounced. In the novel, Paul Atredies was an adolescent of political age with incredible political ability and a great understanding of how the world works. In this movie, his head is spinning and frustrated. Avoid this movie at all costs.
