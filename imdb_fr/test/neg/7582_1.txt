That this film was stapled to the wall of a chapel as proof that God is really dead. Am I the only one to have really seen (rather slept) through this "film"? This is the only movie I have ever seen at the cinema about which I regret not having escaped and asked for the refund of my money. And I even saw "Highlander 2: The Quickening" at the local cinema. From beginning to end, Gibson and Downey have absolutely no chemistry. Two non-identical, assembled by circumstances, who end up working together as best friends. The action (the little that there is) is clumsy and as dull as the writer's death's-head. Thank you no matter how deity chuckling at us as he watches our "cinema" that there is no chance for an "Air America 2."
