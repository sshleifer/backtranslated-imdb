I appreciate the effort the filmmakers made to portray the story of Moses and the exodus from Israel and that the film helps viewers to put themselves in Moses' shoes and understand the intense burden imposed on him. . As excited as I was to see this movie, I was very disappointed with the script. (I will leave aside the videography, special effects and artistic abilities of this magazine.) What is most disappointing is the historical inaccuracy of this film and its distance from the historical stories of biblical texts. One of the basic principles of the Bible is that God led his people out of Egypt, and he promised to take him to a land flowing with milk and honey. Not only did he make this promise, but he led his people into a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire at night. He never left them; He has always been visible to the Israelites. The film, however, depicts a God who remains silent throughout the wandering through the desert. This film has changed the essence and theme of the biblical text and rather represents God as a cruel and cruel disciplinary void. <br /> <br /> Moreover, the representation of Moses was just as wrong. Moses was known as a man of faith (otherwise, why would he be such a father figure for Israel in the Old and New Testament, even though Moses is known to be a man of great faith). However, the film describes him as a pragmatic, angry and unsure loner who despises the call that God has placed in his life. OK, I'm going to give filmmakers some creative freedom in Exodus's story ... but it's beyond creativity - it's heresy.
