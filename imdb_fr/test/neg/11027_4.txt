Carole Lombard and James Stewart tirelessly try to breathe a little life and meaning into this strangely constructed film about the tribulations of a newlywed couple. The scenes unfold as if they were divided among several directors, each with a different purpose. Some are Capra-cute, some are screwed, some are melodramatic and some are amazingly black. There is even a long sequence of adventures, when the plot suddenly focuses on a small plane crossing a snowstorm. It's hard to say which scenes are the most incongruous, while the film as a whole has such an erratic tone and the scenario is not entirely believable. Only film students or film fans have an interest in being visited - some smaller parts, such as Judge Doolittle and the intrepid pilot, are also played very well.
