One of the worst movies I've seen so far in 2009: history hesitates between a silly thriller and a silly comedy. <br /> <br /> As nothing happens, the void is filled with long and boring dialogues. does not mean anything! <br /> <br /> The distribution is famous but brings no emotion, if not to advance the room! <br /> <br /> And this is happening in a lush seaside hotel that looks very dark. In comparison, that of "Shining" is a carnival! <br /> <br /> NB: many users think that it is located on the CÃ´te d'Azur! They are wrong! It is not the south of France (Nice, Cannes) but quite the opposite: Cabourg and Normandy, to be simple the landing beaches! That's why the sea is as gray as the sky and there is no sun!
