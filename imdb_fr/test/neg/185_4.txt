Do not mistake yourself. I really like the "martial arts genre" and I am more and more surprised by the number of movies like this one. This one is one of those, and it's not even close to being one of the best. With Mathias Hues, I thought it would be good. He can not save this movie though, and to be honest, he was not very good either. Do not pay attention to what others say. The fight scenes in this movie are not good at all. I really know what I'm talking about, because I've seen so many movies like this one. There are also many scenes that have absolutely nothing to do with the plot. I guess they added this only for the movie to last a little longer, in addition to showing the villain like, uuuuuuh ....... bad (as we did not already know).
