*** SPOILERS! *** I sometimes wonder what makes suite producers think they need to explain (and thus destroy) the mysteries behind Horror's iconic movies. The original "Hellraiser" of 1987 was an absolute masterpiece and probably one of the scariest films ever made. The sequel to 1988 "Hellbound" is also a fantasy film about Horror, although I personally did not like to know how the viewer was able to get general information about the Cenobites, some of the most terrible villains in the movie. horror. The third part, "Hell on Earth" (1992), was already a disaster. Its manufacturers have obviously found it necessary to add a dose of humor to Pinhead, a previously incomparably terrifying leaden cenobite (a stupidity typical of the 90s) that has destroyed its fear. This fourth part "Hellraiser: Bloodline" (1996) is slightly more atmospheric than the third, but it diminishes this quality by inventing even more stupid and completely useless "basic information" about the cenobites and the opening of the doors of the hell. <Seriously - did we need to know how are made the mysterious puzzle boxes that open the gates of hell? I do not think so and it is not the only mystery about cenobites that is stupidly destroyed in this film. The setting of "Bloodline" comes and goes in three different periods. The film begins in a 22nd century space station, when scientist Dr. Merchant (Bruce Ramsay) tries to shut the gates of hell forever. When government soldiers disrupt his mission, he must explain his reasons. In the 18th century in Paris, the ancestor of Merchant was a toy maker assigned to build a puzzle box by an aristocrat obsessed with occultism. A demon evoked, the princess of hell, took over the body of the beautiful Angelica (Valentina Vargas). Since the only person who can destroy the portal of hell is the one who built it, the line of the toy maker would be cursed and his ancestors infested with cenobites through the ages ... The film, which takes place in the 18th century, present, and the 22nd century, is really a mess. I admit that the 18th century part has a scary atmosphere and is by far the best part of the movie, but it's also its smallest part. The parts of the present and of the future are rather weak and filled with stupid and unworthy elements. The highlights of the film are undoubtedly the formidable makeup and effects of gore, the lovely Valentina Varagas in the role of demon, and Pinhead (Doug Bradley), who, despite losing some of his goosebumps, remains threatening . scoundrel. This is an almost offensive idea for "Hellraiser" fans, however, that Pinhead is supposed to be defeated by a ridiculous light show. Overall, "Bloodline" is not a complete disaster, but it is an unworthy series of a series that started so brilliantly. Even director Kevin Yagher was visibly embarrassed because he preferred to be credited with Alan Smithee. Overall, this is only recommended by Pinhead-Fanatics fans, and most of them will probably be irritated by a further decrease in the goosebumps of their favorite demon. All others are well advised to stick to the brilliant first and the excellent second part of the franchise "Hellraiser" and avoid all others. The makeup effects in "Bloodline" are terrible, but almost everything else is disappointing. My rating: 3.5 / 10
