The glorious Edward is on the rise when his supervisor tells him that he can drop these dirty Swedish theater films and climb the stairs to the splashing and bloody department. Excited by his high expectations for the new type of movies he will soon publish, he asks all kinds of questions about the salary, his workspace and his lunch break. Well not really. Edward may be just the opposite. A quiet and stuttering guy, besides, he had glasses. Except when he's crazy. I guess it created a much more scary atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Evil Ed is a Swedish film, but a magical force appeared on the good actors and turned their lovely Swedish accents into American stereotypical voices. I guess that's one of the skills an actor needs these days. The actors play is very wooden, as they are inflexible, non-foldable (well, what are you really waiting for?). On top of that, the movie has a scrambling techno theme, sounds like its type. In any case, it only worsens the experience of the film. Since I've been pretty tough against this movie so far, there will usually be a break point where I will reduce the level of happiness. But there is really not much to say. The plans look good, but somehow 'Hanz' spelled coffee on it and partially destroyed it. That's how I watch this movie. If the film ended when Edward was taken to a mental institute and they had rearranged the parts where he went mad and killed people, the result would have been much better, but that's just my radical vision . I would also like to see more footage from the loss of members movies. <br /> <br /> There are also illogical things to discover in this piece of film. Let's say that the actors are really American and live in America, why would they then work on a Swedish film, like Edward did? And also, this delivery man, why does he never use the doorbell right next to him? Instead, he goes tapping gently on the door. Good old Edward really has good ears to hear all this as he climbs. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this film had its moments, it's just a pity that there was not so much. But that does not mean I would not recommend it. It's a pretty cheap movie, buy it. It's almost like I see a motive for the price and the movie. On another side; If you like watching dubbed movies more and more crappy by the second, it could be computer science. My verdict would then be a solid one.
