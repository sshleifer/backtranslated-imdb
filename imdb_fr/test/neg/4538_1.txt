It was a terrible short film that was trying to be funny, but not funny at all. Say at a film festival in Chicago. That's what the title says and I just was not there at all. The bad narration was what did it. If you rewrite it and turn it again, it "could" work. This attempt fell in "the hole". Horrible film.
