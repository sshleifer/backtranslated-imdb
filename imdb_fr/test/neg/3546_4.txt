Matthew Aldrich. It's a name worthy of memory. It was the individual who took the keys and created one of the worst scripts of all time. Cliche. Predictable. An insult to the intelligence of the public. <br /> <br /> Is he the only beneficiary of the blame? Of course not. Renny Harlin took that awful excuse for a screenplay and made it a movie. Sam Jackson and Ed Harris read it (or not) and chose to play it. Guilt abounds. <br /> <br /> This is the Denise Richards scenario. There are not enough Razzies in the universe to recognize how horrible this writing is. <br /> <br /> In all fairness, the profession of Samuel Jackson is incredibly new and the way it is presented is very creative. but at the end of the day, it's only trimming. Nice toppings. <br /> <br /> Pack it the way you want it: writing waste is always a garbage write.
