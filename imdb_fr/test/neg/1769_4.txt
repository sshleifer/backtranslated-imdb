Generally, any movie with Steve Railsback in mind is a good movie. However, this film does not fit this opinion. Lifeforce is an under-the-average movie that is extremely confusing at first (reminds me of Star Trek: TMP), but is able to pick things up a little bit towards the end when London becomes Zombie City. A horror / science-fiction mess that is very hard to sit on, though the nude vampire / spacegirl is very easy to watch. This film deserves a rating of 4 out of 10.
