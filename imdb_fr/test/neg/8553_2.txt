A hideous film of women-of-the-cell winds up at the bottom of the barrel of midnight movies, combining a pulpy film with the most terrifying clich√©s of girls in the shower. Linda Blair embodies an innocent woman sent to jail (we learn casually that she was involved in a guy's rollover with her car), facing tough times in the big house with some of the ugliest characters in the house next to Russ Meyer. Blair is continually beaten, beaten, raped, humiliated and harassed. The dialogue is a disgusting four-letter word, and the film leaves no room for its barrage of violence and stupidity. Some viewers, however, see it as a camp classic, although its language may not be advanced enough. * from ****
