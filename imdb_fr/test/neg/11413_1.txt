As embarrassing as it may be to admit, I was appointed director of the production of this film ... my very first! In fact, it was the first feature film for almost everyone that participated. Observe and you can even see me in one of the first scenes as an aspiring assassin, called ... "Cely" (my last name). <br /> <br /> Entitled originally "Hostages", this image was changed to "Another Son of Sam" by the producer-director who wanted to take advantage of the serial killer in the newspapers at the time. Nothing could have helped. I do not even think this picture was good enough to be shown on "MST 3K!" <br /> <br /> The film was shot mainly with a collection of old Mitchell cameras and the first manual Arriflex cameras. In fact, the shooting of the helicopter during the hostage's siege was filmed with my own Arri of the Second World War. The photo was shot entirely in Charlotte and Belmont, North Carolina, in the mid-seventies. Most of the "stars" were local TV channels, and the rest of the team was just inexperienced or credulous enough to believe former guitarist and producer, Dave A, to Adams' adequacy illusions. <br /> <br /> If you like to look at this kind of photo, you might like the work of another North Carolinian, the legendary Earl Owensby. <br /> <br />
