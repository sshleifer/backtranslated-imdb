It was the first feature film for just about everyone, including director Teck Tan, and therefore deserves to be hailed for its success. But this film was clumsy in his direction, preacher in his style, exaggerated in his game, and too politically correct. The plot was everywhere, preventing any aspect from developing. Gangsters are involved in the story, although I do not know what their presence has added to the film but to make it even more unrealistic. They could have been completely left out and the movie would have been better as a result. <br /> <br /> The plot tells the plot of a young Chinese of Malaysian origin who returns to his country after studying in the West. His studies brought him back with the skills he thinks he needs to realize his dream of leading a rock band and putting it on the top of the Malaysian charts (a rather juvenile place). The beginning of the film suggests a conflict with his traditional father, but once the gangsters are involved, this part of the story is left unceremoniously. <br /> <br /> The film tries to take advantage of the amazing ethnic diversity of Malaysia, but unfortunately, the way these aspects were filmed seemed to be terribly artificial, or downright predatory. There is a beautiful scene of Malay women doing a beautiful traditional dance on a beach, but the way the vision is integrated into the plot seems forced and unnatural. <br /> <br /> The acting game was somewhat amateurish, and the male role was particularly unconvincing. The main Malay female head was a notable exception, leaving the most positive mark. The film also has an openly gay character, and although it is a little caricature, it provides some of the most fun moments of the movie. But the film was barely a notch above a television soap opera typical of local television. Unfortunately, this film, which is not at all offensive, has been banned in Malaysia. 3/10
