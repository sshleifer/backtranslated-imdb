I'm sure I'm in the minority (I know I'm one of my friends), but I found this film long, boring and free. The fact that the role played by DENIS LEARY is the most likeable character (the only other time I liked it was in "A Bug's Life"!) Says it all. The character of Rene Russo was annoying and Thomas Crowne himself was flat and stereotyped. Saying it was two-dimensional can be a bit generous. (No, the scenes with his psychiatrist did NOT help make it real.) <br /> <br /> Except for two wonderful scenes (both involving the cape of the museum and WITHOUT those of Ren√© Russo ), the movie was at home watching TV golf.
