Full Disclosure: I was born in 1967. At first I was surprised by the premise - after all, if you were a teenager in Reagan's age, a trip backstage would not disappoint you. Pop Rocks, Atari and Rock Em Sock Em Robots? I loved them, not * despite * the fact that they were clumsy, but * because * they were clumsy and stupid and fun. But when VH1 decided to make the series "I Love Last Tuesday", I knew it was enough. Goes Hal Sparks has nothing better to do than read from a teleprompter how Slinkys are idiots? (Wait, let me check ... hmmm, no, no, it seems he does not know it.) Snarky, the ultra-hip and hapless posture has its place, but enough!
