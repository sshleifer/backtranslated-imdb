A vehicle for Michael Caine. It's pretty well written and there is play to play but it's really a mess - not funny enough, not scary enough. It's a modern and flaccid cockney thriller. <br /> <br /> I like the principle: even in the morally refracted hinterland of East London, people do things for the right reasons. A surprising result in the first fight against Caine's old school, encouraged by Billy Shiner, inflamed his paranoia. The second half of the film makes him run shadows to face the disappointment of the outcome of the first. <br /> <br /> My biggest disappointment was the absence of director John Irvin to improve the relationship between Shiner and his lieutenant / filial substitute Frank Harper. Harper, a Briton, Tom Sizemore, understands his role well, while those around him seem to have ignored it. Pity. 4/10
