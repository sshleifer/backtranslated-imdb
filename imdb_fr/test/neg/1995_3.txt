After being almost killed by a big dog, a stray cat said to himself, "Why can not I be a skunk, so everyone will leave me alone." She looks around the case and finds an idea: white paint, black paint and cheese Limburger and garlic ...... hmmmm. The next thing you know, we have the forerunner of "Pepe The Pew", even though in this caricature she is still a cat, she is a disguised skunk. <br /> <br /> The cat also benefits from its new stinky skunk status and takes full advantage of it. He's a happy and happy guy now ..... until a real skunk (with the imitated voice of Charles Boyer) shows up! <br /> <br /> I enjoyed the fact that the cat puts on a Bugs Bunny outfit. However, on the whole, I have never been interested in these French characters taking off, finding the dialogue stereotyped excessive and not really funny, so I give only a "fair" note. I do this a point, however, for morality at the end of the story.
