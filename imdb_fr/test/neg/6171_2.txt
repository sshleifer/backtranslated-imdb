I am so disappointed by this film that I can not express it. I was so excited when I started watching this movie to see Mickey Rourke all in leather and that kid from Third Rock From The Sun behaved as if I were a psychopath. I thought, wow, it's going to be a winner, damn style 'Natural Born Killers. And it improved. The quality of the production was excellent, the staging was great, the acting was great, the cinematography was excellent, and the plot was, well, the plot, well, what QUESTION? About halfway through this film, I pulled my hair and shouted, "What's going on?" and I mean that literally? Nothing makes any sense whatsoever. Nothing. Nothing. Nothing. Aaaaaaahhhhhhggg !!!!
