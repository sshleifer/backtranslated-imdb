My brother-in-law and his wife brought the film one night to watch a video. That should have given me the first hint that it would be horrible. It was. From the first to the last time, this film is terrible. It does not even register as movie "B". Maybe an N or a P. One of the 5 worst movies I've ever seen. From rubber raptor-on-a-stick to corpses in the car that still breathe to the lines of horror beyond, this movie is not worth watching if you received it for free. <br /> <br /> Ignore all of this - unless you want to play Mystery Science Theater with your friends, it will provide you with good ammunition.
