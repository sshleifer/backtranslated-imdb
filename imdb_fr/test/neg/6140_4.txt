I had the privilege of seeing this powerful piece on Broadway with Kathy Bates in the lead. I only saw another piece in the 1970s and 1990s that had an emotional impact comparable to that of this piece. I was really looking forward to seeing the play become a movie, but I was very disappointed to hear that Kathy Bates would not be back in the movie. At the time, she was not well known on Broadway and producers had to feel like it. star power, I guess, and instead throws Sissy Spacek. Sissy did an adequate job in the lead but was in no way compared to Kathy Bates. I like Anne Bancroft, but she seemed too young for this role. The plot of the film was true to the play. Anyone considering suicide should watch this film to realize the devastation of those left behind.
