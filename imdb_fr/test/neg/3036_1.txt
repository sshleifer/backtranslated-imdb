Sorry, this movie was made for the TV movie. Are the rest of you drugged when you watched? I thought hair, makeup and characters were mediocre in 2 dimensions. The story is dubious, especially since all the main characters are dead, or almost. I think it's not well played either ... what was happening with this hair on the main character of Turtles? He looked badly stuck and his legs seemed about to fall. It did not appear that anything new was revealed in the group's history and in the way members had met other groups and others. Frank Zappa looked stupid, Mum Cass and the Beatles too. They were designed to look stupid and ridiculous. Other members of the band, like Jim Morrison, Donovan, also felt like they were stupid. It's terrible, if that's how you remember those people. It's a poor history lesson about music, it's fictional.
