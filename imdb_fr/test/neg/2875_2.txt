I really like Salman Kahn and I was really disappointed when I saw this movie. There was not much conspiracy and what they had was not so attractive. However, Salman looked good in the movie, looked young and refreshed, but worth the price of this DVD. The music was not bad it was pretty cool. Generally, Indian films last at least two to three hours, but it is a very short movie for an Indian movie. The American actress who starred in the film is from the hit TV series Heroes, Ali Larter. His game had a lot to be desired. However, she looked good in the Indian dresses she wore. The whole movie did not have much to be desired and I hope Salman will do a lot better during his next movie. Thank you.
