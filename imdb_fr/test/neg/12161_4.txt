I went to see this movie because it had been recommended to my wife and she wanted to go there. <br /> <br /> We were both trying to watch our watches well before the end of the film, to see how much we had to endure. It's been two hours and six minutes. It is divided roughly equally between the battle scenes (about a dozen of them, all more or less interchangeable) and the development of the plot. <br /> <br /> One would have thought that with the subject being the son of a minor tribal chief who conquer half the world, plot would have been relatively easy. There is a lot of raw material to make a good story. However, the writers have completely puffed. We have no real story. We instead get a Hollywood version of the story. <br /> <br /> What supports the young Temudjin through his long - almost endless, in fact, or at least they seem to the spectator - tribulations? Why, the love of a good woman, of course. <br /> <br /> How does he get out of prison? Well, an old monk, who recognizes his innate goodness and greatness, goes across the continent to bring this good woman a talisman that symbolizes Temudjin's love for her, making her fall dead just close enough to her let him find him as he is there. , talisman in the hand. And of course, she goes away and, having (inexplicably) been rich and powerful, saves her. <br /> <br /> How escapes chains? Well, he goes to the shrine of the great god Wolf Tengri (or a name like that) and Tengri releases him by magic. Yes Yes. <br /> <br /> Why does he want to become the Mongol ruler? The wolf god again, apparently. Temudjin goes to ask for advice, and - surprise! surprise! - he gets it. "Lois," he said to himself. "The Mongols need laws, good simple laws." Damn it, it was impressive. <br /> <br /> And finally, how does he win the decisive battle against the more powerful forces of his rival? Better tactics, of course, but also thanks to the help of the good old wolf god who sends a storm at the height of the battle. All the troops tremble under thunder and lightning (the Mongols are afraid of thunder, you see) - but not our Temudjin. The troops, completely impressed by his courage, acclaim him king! <br /> <br /> I do not know what drives people to continue producing this kind of waste. The funny thing is that it is interspersed with realistic realism: a lot of milk, dirt and violence. It's as if the producers of this film wanted to get things in order so that viewers do not realize how some of the big things are childish. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of violence in close-up: slashing, impaling, drops of blood, splashing blood, blood clouds - the blood guys have had a good time, actually. Despite the realism, it is impossible to take seriously. <br /> <br /> I have to mention the ridiculous final battle scene of CGI. How can anyone think that these things seem realistic beyond me. They do not do it. Oh, and everything is shot in the standard Hollywood style: breathtaking panoramas for spectacular scenery and super-close Stedicam scenes for battle scenes. And the standard Dolby sound effects of shots and shots and the constant hum of low frequency to maintain tension. <br /> <br /> A little tedious. <br /> <br /> Avoid.
