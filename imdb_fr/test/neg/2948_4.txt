The film begins with Reeve (Ekin) and his assistant fighting the same vampires. This scene is probably the best of all the movie. The rest of the film is unfortunately corny, very unrealistic and a Buffy scam against the Vampire. The end is also painful. <br /> <br /> Some moments, such as the scene where Gypsy and Helen (played by the beloved Chinese twos duo Twins: Charlene & Gillian) are fighting over a stuffed teddy bear, are particularly shady. The story is also lame, they would surely have offered something more scary than a book called "Day for Night". <br /> <br /> Some good parties though. Jackie Chan and Anthony Wong make the film bearable with their comic roles. However, good things end there. Charlene and Gillian (Twins) have never been able to play well and disturb you. The role of the "friendly but twisted vampire" was unfortunately confided to Edison Chen, a pretty boy without talent. <br /> <br /> Rating: 4/10 -
