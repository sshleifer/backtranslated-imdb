It is true that the film is a little interesting, but the execution leaves much to be desired (a bit like the Blood Orgy of the Leather Girls, I spit on your grave and Born in Flames, all superior). I do not think it's not porn, but porn in the eyes of the viewer: if it works like porn for someone, who do I say he / she is wrong? I was rather puzzled by the statement in Winkimation's generally thought-out criticism ("Such a shame") that "for once we see the faces of men when they arrive." A few years ago, I occasionally published independent reviews for an adult magazine and I remember seeing a lot of men's faces when they came. I think this is probably more common when the movie is one of the few "stars" of the male porn (and especially when the latter is the director). Although, unsurprisingly, I can not refer to any particular title, I know there are cases in Ron Jeremy's work, uh, uh. I do not know either that I would agree that a man necessarily shows a vulnerability in front of his face when he comes.
