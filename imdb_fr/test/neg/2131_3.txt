I wish I had something more positive to say about Devil Fish, but honestly, I can not say much. I can not even come up with a lot of these "so bad, it's good" moments. The devil fish is just old bad. The plot is completely derivative (Jaws, anyone?), The acting game is wooden, the characters are irrelevant, the special effects are beyond the bad, and the score is boring. Add to that the seemingly inept direction of Lamberto Bava and you have a smelly movie. I think however that the biggest sin of the film is its lack of budget. It does not seem that Bava had a lot of work with him. In 1984, the Italian film industry was declining ?? especially with regard to genre films. The funds available for Bava were very likely very meager. The film is like Devil Fish using special effects never had a chance to be good. This is not the only Italian film to suffer this fate. A number of Italian films made in the mid-1980s whose ideas and concepts far exceeded what could reasonably be expected given their budget limitations. <br /> <br /> That said, and considering the many weaknesses of the film, I can not bring myself to give a score lower than 3/10 to Devil Fish. I even considered giving it a higher rating, but I can not because I realize how bad a movie is. Why do not I give a lower grade? It is difficult to explain. Despite the many problems encountered in the film, there is something about Devil Fish that I enjoy inexplicably. This could be as simple as my love for low-budget, tacky Italian films. My taste for cinema may be horribly wrong, but I appreciate what I like. <br /> <br /> The treatment of demon fish by Mystery Science Theater 3000 is actually very enjoyable. I rate Devil Fish 4/5 on my MST3K rating scale. Guys make fun of the movie's many flaws. A very clever observation appears very early in the commentary when Tom Servo notes, "It's not because you can edit that you should do it" ?? highlighting one of the many weaknesses of Devil Fish.
