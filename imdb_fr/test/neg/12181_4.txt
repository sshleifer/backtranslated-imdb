First of all, I've been a big fan of Bronson since the late '70s. I've watched all the movies he's made on the big screen since "Love and Bullets", which was ironically the beginning of his end in as a big star, star of the Hollywood blockbuster. <br /> <br /> I was hoping everything would be fine. for him, that he would make a very good film in the 80s, but that never happened. And I do not know what he was thinking about when he signed with Cannon Cheapjack and director J. Lee Thompson for most of his latest films. <br /> <br /> "The assassination" gave me some hope when I saw that Peter Hunt was running in place of Thompson but these hopes were quickly disappointed. First of all, the movie looks incredibly cheap, as if it were made for about $ 3 million, minus Bronson's inflated salary (I heard he insisted for $ 5 per image, which is probably more than the rest of the budget for all his Cannon films). The scenes from the White House were filmed on the VA site in West LA - I took the bus when they were shooting. Well done recreating the white house, but no one thought of taking out the palm trees? Guess not. <br /> <br /> Second, the support cast is really bad. Ireland was dying of cancer and yet it was not bad, but the horrible Asian woman who played the role of Bronson was typical of Cannon's talent at the time - nonexistent. I would really be curious to learn how she got this role. I can not imagine a worse actress for the role, plus she is 40 years younger than Bronson! The story is not that bad and it's something bigger and better budget studios did later (Eastwood's "In the Line of Fire" movie and Costner's "Bodyguard" movie) but the way it is presented here is really sad. I wonder if they could not afford to do more than one or two shots per shot. None of this is credible. If the secret service men really behaved like the key cops in this movie, the presidents would be leaving every few months ...
