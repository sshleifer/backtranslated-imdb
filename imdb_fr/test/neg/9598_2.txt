An involuntarily hilarious walkie-talkie melodrama with Kay Francis as Countess Balakireff, who runs after all. At the beginning of the film, she rejects the stable boy for being too young before leaving for the driver! The English set in which she settles is so cliche that it's ridiculous. Basil Rathbone is an Italian violinist with a Chico Marx accent. "My violeen, as I have never played again!" "Patreecia, my baby is cold!" It's camper beyond belief.
