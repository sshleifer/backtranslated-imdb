This is one of many American attempts to redo an old classic British TV show, more famous than this one. From what I see, none of you said or even acknowledged that you knew there was a television called Secret Agent Secret Agent. The secret agent's first secret agent featured the great Patrick McGoohan (The prisoner, Braveheart, Zebra ice station, The Phantom, etc.) is a man who was chosen to be the first James Bond, but he refused it because McGoohan was a very devout man and he considered that James Bond's bed swings and violent manners were contrary to his values. <br /> This show was done in black and white, and it's a shame for those who have not seen it, you miss a lot of things. The character that Mr. McGoohan played in "Secret Agent Man" was called Drake and, once this film was finished, he went on to the very popular, albeit sometimes bizarre and controversial, television series entitled "The Prisoner". The character he played in "The Prisoner" was an agent whose identity is not revealed. He has been kidnapped and transported to an island where he does not know where he is or who is responsible for the kidnapping. What he knows is that his captors want to know the reasons for his resignation from the British secret service. On this island, the population has no name, but it is designated by numbers and the number of Patrick is assigned to "6" It has been claimed that his character of prisoner was in fact the same character that he had played in Secret Agent Man, but McGoohan himself challenged it. <br /> <br /> Of course, there is the famous theme song that the first Secret Agent created. It was written by Johnny Rivers, a famous pop musician of the '50s and' 60s. From what I read, some of you actually think that the song comes from THIS version of the series. You are very wrong about it. It was Johnny and it comes from the original television series, so let me help you clarify the facts. For those of you who complained about the series being stupid, well in England, it was actually called "Danger Man" and in the United States it was renamed "Secret Agent Man". For a so-called stupid name, the series went pretty well. When it was broadcast for the first time. <br /> <br /> Of course, this current show has nothing to do with the original, no main character of this kind is called Drake in this one, and I guess they did their best to make this show their version of "Secret Agent". But it uses the redone version of the original theme song, so it tells you that this series was indeed supposed to be a redone version, though still inferior, of the original series.
