I have seen a lot of bad movies in my life. Date Movie. It was bad. But that ... it's just ... it's not good. House Party 4 is the worst movie of all time. It's that simple. It's basically Ferris Bueller with blacks. Oh, and it's not funny. It's horrible. So horrible. Chris Stokes may be a BET superstar, but he's an idiot. He can not write a comedy. Or a horror movie. I like to talk about him as a black and less known Uwe Boll. Except that Uwe Boll's movies are awfully horrible, if you know what I mean. You can invite friends, go to Alone In The Dark and have a good time laughing and having snacks with your friends. Chris Stokes is like that, except that if you invite friends to watch House Party 4 with you, no one will laugh. Not even the black partisan guy or the illiterate jock. I'm serious, I did not laugh once in all this movie. The acting is terrible and the film looks like a bad independent film. What was the budget for this movie? 5 damn dollars? I mean, what's this mess? This film is really bad. Do not waste your time with this shit. It's disgusting.
