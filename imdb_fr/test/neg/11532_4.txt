I thought it was a movie to watch, be it a very predictable film. There were some good stunts that gave a good dose of excitement and suspense to the story. However, we had to suspend his credulity several times for the plot to work. For example, despite the loss of their transfer cable, couplers and harnesses when the pilot manually retracted the landing gear, they fortunately found a spare part on board the aircraft, with the Caribbean. Depending on the plot, drilling a hole in the ceiling of the vault would disable the alarm system in the vault when the system would be reactivated (I do not see why), according to Daltry, the battery powered drill would be unable to break through the vault On the ceiling, they had just had a hydraulic drill with hoses and fittings adapted to the equally convenient take-off points of the aircraft hydraulic system above the roof. Since the aircraft is equipped with a closed hydraulic system, it is difficult to see how this could be accomplished without affecting the control systems or at least the triggering of hydraulic pressure alarms in the cockpit. By accepting this in the interest of the plot, it takes them several minutes to drill a small hole in the top of the vault (the tension will allow them to drill before the FED arrives to check the false alarm), but from the moment the vault was closed and before the FED walked a few feet to the second security door, they dug a hole in the vault's roof, large enough to cross. We can accept all theses and other inconsistencies for a good thread. However, what has spoiled the film is that what seems to have been an effort on the part of the writers to examine what was previously a fairly predictable end killed by the two heroes (if we can call them fangs of heroes) Ketchum & Brooks one was shot down and thrown from a 747 to 10,000 feet, the other wiliest sliding along the cable between the two planes the nasty Daltry with one hand managed to unhook the cable carrying the weight of an adult man with atmospheric pressure of several hundred kilometers per hour urging him to drop. And yet, in the following sequence, these two people, without any explanation (as tenuous as they are inviolable), miraculously survived 100 000 feet and had time to set up a complex scam to get the money. The only comment about them about Sophie's survival was that her brother was a bad move. Do not expect an Oscar nomination for this one.
