As a member of the US military service, believe me when I say that this film does not describe the emotional state of our soldiers / sailors / airmen / navies coming back from deployments. <br /> <br /> That being said .... <br /> <br /> This film is a big pile of smoking clich√©. It's terrible (except for the little girl), the background of the character is weak and laughable, and the plot is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> This film is so bad that I created an account with IMDb to prevent anyone Half a brain less. <br /> <br /> Canadian screenwriter / director Francesco Lucente should be really, really, really ashamed of this film. If he does not agree with US foreign policy, he should write a letter to the US government, and not punish the English-speaking world as a whole with a monumental shit movie.
