If you had asked me a month ago how this movie was, I probably would have left almost all that aside, but I'm a fan and like any fan, I often visit movie sites when Super Troopers is out. DVD release and has been hooked yes it's a hard site to stay, but the good ones are normally like good families, they stand together. What a story this comedy company / troupe has been able to encourage people to come and see movies around the corner, at universities, wherever they can and all for free and after all, to develop an excellent fan base after a few more years. decides to close the website that helped them and was created for fans, but the worst thing about it .... They did not tell them anything. They just decided they were better than us. They want new fans, not the ones who helped them get to where they are .... you know the same fans they had prayed years ago. Despite everything, they came out of the best movie with Super Troopers and drew everyone's attention and thank God for that, because after that they were completely nil. Good for you, the means to integrate the general public, remember that when you realize that your material is not so good and that you have more new fans, it is you who cracked the originals. THE FANS DO YOU WHO ARE NOT THE OTHER. Never burn your bridges
