This film did not do justice to Mr. Bachchan. He is a great actor and I was very disappointed with the movie and there was not much intrigue. It's a fact that this is the first movie I'm disappointed with. It starts with the fact that she comes to his house with his daughter and he is a photographer. He takes pictures of her in the garden where she falls asleep. He is a man of sixty who has nothing to do but take pictures of this girl. The film does not make sense. The whole film tells that she is pursuing him and that she tells him how much she cares about him. Then his daughter falls and he has to take this girl with him so that she does not get bored and her daughter finds out. I just did not think this film was up to Bachchan standards. It's better than this movie. I always saw him as a remarkable person, then I saw him in this movie and I could not imagine him in this film. The film did not interest me at all. I could not wait until the end of the film. And you either.
