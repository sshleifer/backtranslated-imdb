There is not much to add to what others have already commented, the film fails so badly that it should not, it has no depth in the planning of the heist and the characters are so incredible. <br /> <br /> One thing That made me think that even though the rest of the band is trying to remove the pins from the doors of an armored truck, because there is no another way to open it, the guy inside the truck, with great ease manages to remove the floor of the truck that has a hole to be able to get out, and then come back, without being noticed by anyone, because no one could to think that he could come out of there or even better, that they could have entered it. <br /> <br /> Promising but not quite there.
