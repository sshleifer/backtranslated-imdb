This film is about a party organized by the high school "scary girl". By illogical of this kind of films, she gets permission to organize the party in a house that was once a crematorium, a dubious place long closed and closed. Apparently, the history of this property is one of the secrets of this city that is best left hidden among people although the legend is whispered among the young. <br /> <br /> Why was this crematorium closed? What has really happened there in the past? <br /> <br /> I like these supernatural-type kill-kill-kill movies, as long as they contain something that has not been copied from a hundred other movies. The highlights of this film are a robbery "7-11" distracting the cleric with a striking sight, the changing clothes scene of the "good girl", witness of his younger brother, the eventual end of the naughty neighbor who hates the holidays, the scene of spooky shimmers and the concept of running water as a barrier against the supernatural; The best part of this film takes place when the sponsor of the party owned dances before BAUHAUS in front of the fireplace; this scene rocks.
