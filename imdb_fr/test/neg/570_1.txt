Do not waste your time. The plot is dragging, the characters are wooden and without interest, the motivations of their actions are completely indecipherable. I was waiting for the "romantic" or the "comedy" and nothing happened. Worse still, the love letter is not even romantic, but it seems to have been written by someone desperate to meet a deadline. Did I mention that the "plot" we saw after 15 minutes in the movie was "smart", which means it's meant to shock, but given the Hollywood mindset, does not do anything such and is rather vague. <br /> <br /> This is not even worth the $ 2 to rent. Do not bother to see him.
