For what it's worth, it's a pretty decent Road Runner drawing, though it's a bit short (just under 6 minutes). The gags are at best adequate, the animation is competent and the new restored DVD Master looks nice. However, that's where the qualities end. Let me tell you a little bit of history: In 1958, following a labor dispute, WB obtained a bunch of canned music that would be used in six of the cartoons of the year. <br /> <br /> There is only one sentence to describe the music of this short film, and it is "it has 4Kids sound". I use this expression to describe music that has absolutely no correspondence with the onscreen action and that gives the impression of having been recorded by an orchestra composed of members of a cover band of Sonic Youth . The music of this short film seems desperately frozen and incredibly odious, especially if one thinks that some scenes of this short film (namely the piano trap) would have worked better with little or no music. <br /> <br /> I did not do it. think a WB comic would be ruined by awful music (even Lava's scores are not that obnoxious), but since the comics are not that remarkable anyway, it's almost painful to watch with this music. It's a bit like the episodes of Doctor Who in the '80s could be bad anyway, yet still unassailable thanks to the incredibly awful music of Keff McCulloch (who sounded as if he had pressed the demo button on each of its 5 Casio keyboards at the same time). <br /> <br /> I'm going to make people call me crazy, but I'll easily look at one of Larriva's caricatures on this subject. At least, the boxed music was generally synchronized with the action of these.
