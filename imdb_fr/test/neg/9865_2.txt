Yes! This film was just bad in every respect: casting, effects, boredom, excitement and, of course, fantastic and we all know that the four heroes of it were a little more colorful compared to the new ones, but it remains Come on, a fantastic boredom like this was really a silly trash that I knew nobody would want when I see it, I mean surely with this budget, about 3 or 4 GOOD movies could have been made, but no. I'm just glad the new version of this year shows everyone how fantastic the four should have been with a good story. An awesome cast, like Jessica Alba, one of my favorite actresses. If not, it would have been totally forgotten, but fortunately no. The new was great when I saw it with my friends at the movies, but this fantastic old storm must go away.
