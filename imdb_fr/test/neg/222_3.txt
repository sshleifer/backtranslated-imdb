I went to see this movie today, with the hope that it would imply a story that is at least half intelligent. I was extremely disappointed because that was not the case. The intrigue and decisions of the main character were so exaggerated. I was hoping for a film like Dog Day Afternoon, but I got something totally unacceptable. In fact, I found myself completely hoping that the "hero" would be eliminated and I almost got out of the theater on several occasions, when it should have happened but did not. Heist movies are not supposed to be good movies, and this one has tried to be exactly that. Every two minutes during the second half of the film, I found myself saying "not at all". Without telling the whole story, it was an armored car guard who was out of money and whose house was about to be seized. He was invited to a robbery and only agreed to back down once the action started. Low.
