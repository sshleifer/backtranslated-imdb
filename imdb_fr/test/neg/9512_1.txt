Well, every turn, but I thought Gibson's Hamlet was the most horrible translation I've ever seen ... as subtle as a paper bag and as inspired as a call to telemarketing. The only reason I watched the movie until the end was that I had the hope that it would improve or become unintentionally funny. No chance. <br /> <br /> No lack of respect for the secondary cast or Zefferelli's staging, but nothing can compensate for the rumbling of the main character. I saw Hamlet well described as an African prince, an animated lion, a brutal warrior, a romantic poet, etc., etc. But in my humble opinion, this portrait was only an abundant lack of spirit associated with most weak hams.
