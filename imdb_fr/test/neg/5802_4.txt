First of all, I would like to say that I really enjoyed this movie. However, that said, I can not say it was a "good" movie. I went to the theater with rather low expectations (something I learned to do). I'm glad I did, because the plot and development were not stellar. The jokes were humorous. But I was in the right state of mind to enjoy it. <br /> <br /> I was not the only one. In fact, the whole theater laughed loudly. I did not hear anyone complain after the end of the movie. I even saw a guy fall from his chair laughing! But again, I have to warn you, Grandma's Boy is NOT a high quality movie. It's a funny movie (even if it's not serious), and if you choose the right mood, you'll really enjoy it. Oh, and do not take the kids to that.
