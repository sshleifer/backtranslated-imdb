When the movie started, I felt it was going to be something special. The work of actor and cameraman was undoubtedly good. I also loved the characters and could have developed empathy with them. The film had a good atmosphere and a hint of fantasy. <br /> <br /> However, over the course of the film, the plot did not appear on takeoff and unfolded scene by scene. I was unable to understand the connection between the stories. All I could see was that the characters collided from time to time and only references to bottled boats. Without this connection, I just had some unpublished news. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised that it's going so well in Cannes
