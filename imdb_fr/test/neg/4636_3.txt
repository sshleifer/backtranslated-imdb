Here is for example the number 87 358 of the anti-biblical bias of Hollywood, so typical of them. <br /> <br /> Ray Liotta's wife did it early and the women are interviewed for the housekeeper's post. The first person interviewed is an old-fashioned person (dress, manners, speeches) who immediately sets strict rules here, stating that "there will be two hours of Bible study each day". <br /> <br /> It is said, of course, to make believe that reading the Bible is the worst punishment you can inflict on someone, especially a child. Once again, the Bible is likened to stifling and petty people. This woman is of course sent back immediately. <br /> <br /> Naturally, the liberal black woman (Whoopi Goldberg - who else?) is the one who is hired and here she saves the day! <br /> <br /> Yawn.
