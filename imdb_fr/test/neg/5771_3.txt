I certainly expected more after seeing the list of actors, but WOW! <br /> <br /> I think that a director for the first time could have done a better job with this project, and the fact that a veteran like John Buechler managed to do it without end. In one way or another, the budget allowed them to gather a host of actors from the list, whom they managed to embarrass for an hour and a half. The unknown actors were simply awful, less Steve Wastell doing decent work like Axl. The story is so bad that there is really no mention to make. The overall value of production seems to be standard, with above-average camera work, if you can survive through the "slo-mo" scenes of God-Awful and the painful sequences of "person on fire". I knew it would be stupid, I did not know how stupid it was, and unfortunately, it's past time that can never come back to me. I guess if you really like bad "B" movies, it might work for you, but if you care about any story, it's just awful ... a total waste of time.
