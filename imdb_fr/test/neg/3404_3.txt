I watched it AFTER seeing "Death Tunnel" (this is without a doubt the worst movie I've ever seen in my life), so you can understand that I rolled my eyes when I saw the directors and producers of this cinematic gem be in charge of it. First of all, I thought that the director and the producer were the same man. They meet both Kid Rock and Dawg, the bounty hunter. I watched the TAPS survey, and I'm not skeptical. I think TAPS is the closest way to a scientific method on the ground. It was cool and credible. I think they are haunted. <br /> <br /> But this, like the commentator mentioned above, comes down to a trick. Okay, but the "investigators" and the "group leaders" seemed to make a nice penny and invest money to know if they were haunted or not, so when they have whimsical stories, I have to take with a big teaspoon of salt. <br /> <br /> As mentioned by another person, I could understand what they wanted to see me in the photo about 50% of the time. The rest of the time I could not tell anything. Also, without any context for the photos - time of day, type of camera, humidity in the room, dust particles (75% of which are the orbs), weather conditions and other factors, I can not accept them . I can not help but think that some could be tampered with. <br /> <br /> Why would this group keep the numbers of the door? Vandalism? During the TAPS investigation, they also attempted to retrieve the death certificates of these nurses and found only one that was deemed "accidental" (people did not want to officially proclaim suicide). Yet when one of the guides mentioned this, he said "yeah, and his suicide marked." It was really like the guides of the haunted houses, here in October. <br /> <br /> However, I liked the interviews with the patients and the staff of the old hospital, which really gave him a personal touch. I am also happy that they mentioned that the staff had the best intentions in the world and was not a gruesome guardian. These were not the best methods, but that's all they had. They were desperate to stop the disease.
