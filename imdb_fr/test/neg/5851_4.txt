RAT RACE's ads seemed too young for me to enjoy, but as my boyfriend loves this movie (and the soundtrack), I finally let myself go and watched it with him tonight. I make him watch movies by David Lynch and all kinds of obscure indies (I recently imposed URBANIA), so I had the impression that I owed him a Hollywood Hollywood product. <br /> <br /> I did not want to hurt him. feelings, so I saved my dog ​​for you. Yes, RAT RACE has its moments, but it pissed me off. Let's start at the beginning. RAT RACE was marketed as a "family film", so I was a bit surprised to discover that the first scene was centered on a porn movie. (I can hear it now: "Mom, what does AFRO WHORES mean?") This scene has no other purpose in this movie than to stuff something into a PG-13 movie. <br /> <br /> And while we're still on the casino segments, it's handy that all the characters play, in the same amount of time, the slot machines that contained the gold coins. What would have happened if they had not done it? Would these millionaire players sit around waiting? And how did they get these gold coins in slot machines in the first place? <br /> <br /> But I'm creating a point of intrigue that is necessary for the survival of the film, so I will continue. About Whoopi and his long lost daughter: They meet for the first time ever, but they do not talk to each other all the way through. Why make their relationship so complicated? Could not they just be, for example, a mother and a daughter on vacation together? Why this case concerning a long-standing adoption? And why portray the girl as a hard-driving career woman chained to her cell phone who never needs to contact her company again? Did the scenario just forget this sub-plot and this character trait? <br /> <br /> This illustrates the main weakness of this film: the characters are incoherent and interchangeable. it's exhausting when everyone is equally crazy and without identifying features. And another thing: the events are not plausible. Oh, of course, the characters can do weird things, but the characters themselves have to be believable. Take THE NAKED GUN (another Jerry Zucker movie) for example. Frank Drebin has quite exaggerated moments, but everything he does is theoretically possible in his world. (Jane is also funny, but it's different, which makes all the difference.) A RAT RACE character defying the laws of nature by jumping on a high-speed train destroys all likelihood of the film. These are clearly not real people, so why should I care about these people? <br /> <br /> Another problem I have with RAT RACE is a moral problem. The characters get their modes of transport almost totally by flight. I know, I know, it's silly comedy, and the same actions did not bother me fifteen years ago when I saw MILLION DOLLAR MYSTERY, but RAT RACE broke many laws and bothered me now. And I will not dwell on the whole sequence of sabotage at airports, except to ask if the writers have not taken into account the real implications of such action; Was this scene amusing before 9/11? <br /> <br /> I will pass over the unpleasant remarks about the heart, the drugs of his family and the Nazis (whose accumulation and performance worked better in an episode of "Seinfeld"), and then complain about the act. Rowan Atkinson started boring and ended up unbearable; I do not know when I liked a comic character less. And the three Oscar winners need new agents. Whoopi did better, but she did not have much to work on (she loved the copper perm and the purple lipstick); The part of Kathy Bates was acute but fortunately brief; Cuba, was ... oh, man. Cuba, baby, please send your agent back! After INSTINCT and CHILL FACTOR, this is your third strike (be glad you did not see PEARL HARBOR or SNOW DOGS) - it's time to return your Oscar for Best Supporting Actor of 1997 to its rightful owner (Edward Norton, for PRIMAL FEAR). An actor of your stature has no business running half naked in the desert and being controlled by a travesty imitator of Lucille Ball. Do you read even more the scripts of your movies, or do you put in a bag and draw your next project at random? <br /> <br /> There are other little things that bother me (how did Grisham and the prostitute get so much loot?), but basically, RAT RACE is little more than your lot basic types of characters hindered by arbitrary obstacles leading to a rather disappointing and inexplicable end. They give money to charity? What kind of end is this?!? Yes, it's the "noble" thing to do. It does not matter the probability of a cross sell / license of Smash Mouth whores (did they ever say no to selling?) To hold a benefit concert in the middle of the New Mexico desert, but who would honestly do such a thing? Yes, they say it's the trip, not the destination, which is worth it, but there is no trip without destination. If there was an example of a happy ending, that would be good. What a disappointment to finish a film that, despite my lukewarm reproaches here, I enjoyed some parts of (I admit I had fun with the cow and some of Lucy's tricks, as well as the character at the perforation of the tongue, the word struck me a wall, but it became my favorite). <br /> <br /> But as far as my friend knows, I found RAT RACE quite funny and charming. <br /> <br />
