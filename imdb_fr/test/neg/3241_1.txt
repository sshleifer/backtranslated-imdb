No word can describe how horrible this movie is. It's as if the director had literally taken it from a roll of film and sent it to the public. <br /> <br /> The action in this film is horrible, The plot is so stupid, and the death of each character is ridiculously bad. Some stupid scenes include Akshay Kumar taking out a pistol to kill a hologram (yes, a hologram), Akshay Kumar carrying a bazooka around the city, Rajat Bedi being beaten by a badly animated skeleton, Rajat Bedi and Siddharth, penetrating in Monisha Korella (How did they think it was simple?). In addition, I would like to emphasize that the animations are absolutely terrible. The scene that supports this statement is the one where Kapal has the bike and wins the glasses. The shopping work seems to have been done with Microsoft painting. <br /> <br /> The best parts of this movie are with Sunny Deol. This man is so strong that it makes even God feel frightened. In one scene, he literally opens a prison door by stomping on her. Chuck Norris's round has nothing to do with it! It is even so powerful that it can fly from London to India in 10 minutes! Overall, this film is perhaps the least well-built movie of the universe. If you had to watch it, watch it for the hilarity that ensues (BTW, this movie is supposed to be serious)
