Saw this one in a preview yesterday and I must say it was terrible. After the credits, I said to myself: "Hey, with this cast, it will probably be very good" This is not at all what happened. <br /> <br /> Predatory grumpy blade, terribly simply drawn characters (maybe except a little Mrs. Lara) and an end one could expect 10 minutes in the movie. And even worse, he misused a delicate theme (disabled people) for high-level jokes and mostly without taste, without ever touching the surface of the problem. The disabled person with whom the film sympathizes the most is the one who pretends. What kind of message is this? And the film has no idea of ​​the end, it basically boils down to: "I love you, no matter you acted like an idiot". <br /> <br /> In summary: Super casting that must have been terribly annoyed to register for a terrible movie.
