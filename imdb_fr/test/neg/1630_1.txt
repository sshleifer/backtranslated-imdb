I saw this one on the late, late, late show, while MST3K only glittered in Joel Hodgson's eyes. I had the privilege of seeing him without knowing how bad it would be. I did not know that a woman with an arrow in her chest could run "to the end of the earth" in about an hour and a half (thank God, her father had given her precise instructions) and then take days to find it. the castle with help. I did not know that a barbarian sword could run into the forest and create a hanglider and flash bombs in less than 30 seconds. I did not know how much a film could be disjointed. <br /> <br /> It's a bad thing for kids, a very bad thing. If you like bad movies, go for it.
