This film is terribly bad. You can say that all actors are embarrassed to be associated with such a terrible movie. There are obvious budget constraints but with a little thought and attention to detail, the film could have been so much better. For example: Take a look at the scene where Mickey first visits the morgue and discusses with his friend the pathologist while the murdered taxi driver is lying on the slab. You can actually see the corpse breathing! What, could not they afford to hire a half-decent extra that could hold its breath during a 2-minute scene ?!
