It's a spectacularly bad movie, but it's the rare kind of nastiness that's endless, breathtaking! I wish to add to the other comments on this film. <br /> <br /> The "rock bands" on the plane look like three lean drunkards of casual workers wearing bad wigs. <br /> <br /> the serious problem of continuity with the stuffed tiger for a child: it turns into a lion, a leopard and back; it's dirty or clean depending on the shot. <br /> <br /> * SPOILER! The stuffed tiger turns into a real animal to save the child (and the writers)! <br /> <br /> The sight of little Jimmy floating in a coffin on the Amazon, clutching his stuffed tiger and moving away from him, will remain permanently inside your memory. <br /> <br /> Listen to one of the most inane sound effects of all time: when the priest goes in search of Jimmy, the guide calls for his monk's robe as payment, the priest falls on one knee in a moment of resigned contemplation and there is the sound of a bell, not the deep "BONNNNG" of a church bell, but the "ding" of a bell of a boxing match! <br /> This is an absolute pleasure to watch.
