Luscious Candace Bergen as the first Victorian beauty, kidnapped by Sean Connery as the devilish sheikh of the desert! How can you go wrong? How? Oh, let me count the paths !!! Earthy, primitive, Sean Connery is just the right man to tame a fragile and classy beauty like Candace. . . Well, disappointing in the role. Indeed, instead of talking about the real problems ("you are a woman ... I am a man!"), He must babble nonsense about "the will of Allah" and "the wind blows fate through the desert. "John Milius, a director better known for naked men and brutal military force worship than for what is sensible (or interested) in conventional human relations, has an exasperating way of cutting his lovers out of desert whenever it seems that Candace could be kissed. Instead of watching nature take its course with two fabulously attractive people in a picturesque landscape, we are treated endlessly (and I mean endlessly) plans of Brian Keith showing his walrus-sized choppers and delivering sermons on the joys of being Teddy Roosevelt. I have nothing against Teddy Roosevelt, but watching him test his new rifle or make speeches about the heroic death of a big bear just does not excite me as the love affair between Candace Bergen and Sean Connery. . . if it had really begun! What is strange is that Milius spends most of his time creating characters and scenarios without resolution. Candace's two grandchildren in history both have more time on screen than they have. There is no humor, no chemistry, no sizzling, nothing that happens to him in the desert. Unless you find it funny after weeks of galloping on horseback, his hair is always perfect. <br /> <br /> The only "real" moment in history is when, late at night, Candace Bergen shakes her little girl from deep sleep on soft cushions and says, "we have to escape . " The little girl turns around and, without wasting time, answers: "But mom, I was sleeping!" This line summarizes what is really missing from the story. No danger, suspense or sizzle in the basic story of a lady farmed in captivity. She (and her children) are so comfortable and well cared for that it is hard to believe that anyone is worried about their fate. <br /> <br /> Notice that if Candace had herself said the sentence, it might have worked better. . If the tension came from his enjoyment of his captivity (or his pleasure of being in Sean Connery's arms) and his guilt over the problems caused by his kidnapping, then the story would have been tense. But Milius makes a strange assumption that the public is just as angry that he does not know if Teddy Roosevelt will have the chance to prove his manhood three thousand miles away. In the end, the pretty lady and her children no longer seem to matter to him. . . and as they are at the center of the story, everything seems rather dry and endless. . . like the burning sand of the desert.
