Ok, I'm really in King's stuff, but it's horrible. Throughout the film, I'm waiting for the main character to do something profound with his new youth and his new power. I can tolerate the worst movies because anything is better than watching a movie cut with commercials. but that takes the cake. I gave it a 2 and I would never recommend it to anyone.
