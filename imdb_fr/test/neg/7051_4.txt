It's about taking a fairy tale too far. The Enchanted Cottage portrays Dorothy McGuire as a "terribly ugly" girl and Robert Young as a disfigured pilot. Long story short: Scarface wife Spinster, after which their love transforms them miraculously (lighting, cosmetics and elimination of false scars), into beautiful people - a magic change that they attribute to the enchantment of living in a house on board. sea ​​that has been home to generations of newlyweds. <br /> <br /> If the story ends there, it's okay; it would be a fable with a proverbial message: beauty is in the eye of the beholder. But that advances, reaching the reality. When Mr. and Mrs. Scarface greet their audience, it is a painful shock to them to be home again. You see, they only look beautiful to each other ?? a situation in which the public is well prepared, because all the secondary characters have lectured that disadvantaged people really need to reduce their expectations and find other ways to be happy. You know. Take hobbies. Spinster makes cuts on wood, for example. Scarface plans to collect driftwood. <br /> <br /> Drama writer (Arthur Wing Pinero) and filmmakers have no confidence in human nature. Their message is: you are either ugly or pretty, and no pretty person would ever like ugly. Even worse, ugly people obviously need to imagine their lover as pretty. The reality will not do the trick. <br /> <br /> One wonders what Elaine Mason saw every day when she looked at her husband, Stephen Hawking.
