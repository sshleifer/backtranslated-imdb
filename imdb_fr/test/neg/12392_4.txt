Big Blank Point was really a movie below average. His hit man theme is very dry and looks more like a romantic comedy than a thriller. The acting is very normal. The performances are extremely embarrassing at times with many characters who seem very "eccentric" and who really pissed me off. Reunion and "Wow, I have not seen you in 10 years! The element is extremely old-fashioned and many scenes hang around, especially towards the end of the meeting and when the characters review each of their former classmates greeting them. It just seemed very tacky, useless and poorly executed. <br /> <br /> The role of Dan Akroyd as a "rival" assassin is very thin. It only appears once at the very beginning and all at the end in a "final show" which is enormously excited but does not hold at all. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is also very mediocre. . Most of the songs in this movie are straight out of the 1980s and, with the exception of two or three of them, are very bad. Hearing duff songs on a rather dude movie only adds to the negativity that surrounds this film. <br /> <br /> I could go on and on and on saying that the little things were annoying and just very bad, like the very rare action sequences. it came and went very quickly, the lack of development of the character and the poor construction of the whole in this department, half of the time you forget that the character of Cusak is even a successful man because the element is so nonexistent. <br /> <br /> Even comedy thinks it's funny; but it's not. I did not laugh once during this movie. Of course, I may have smiled from time to time, but my only real positive feeling is when I realized that the movie was almost done! <br /> <br /> Please, do not waste your time with "Grosse Pointe Blank" despite the high IMDb ranking (but very incorrect). I've seen movies that are better than this movie that have a lower rating on this site, which tells you that there are better movies on the market. Just do not bother with this one.
