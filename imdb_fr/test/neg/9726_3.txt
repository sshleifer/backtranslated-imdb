If I had to present this idea of ​​film to big Hollywood fools, I'm sure it would look like this: <br /> <br /> ME: "Four boys in a private high school are good friends, AND they are witches . "<br /> <br /> Hollywood:" It looks like "craft". <br /> <br /> ME: "No, no, I said four boys, not four girls." < </ html> "Hollywood:" It always sounds like "The Craft", just with boys instead of girls. "<br /> ME:" OK, but there's this fifth unknown boy coming in scene and he wants more power. "<br /> <br /> Hollywood:" Still little difference, because one of the girls from "The Craft" also wanted more power. <br /> <br /> ME: "OK, OK ... I'll make these boys part of the group" in the crowd ", they'll be rich AND the school is on the east coast. <br /> <br /> Hollywood: "It sounds original. It does not look like "The Craft", here's a billion dollars. "<br /> <br /> This film was so cliché and uninteresting, even the drama made between Chase and the Ipswich brothers was very jaded.Children, whose main problem is to know what color Bentley they want for their 18th birthday (and their 18th car), do not interest me at all, even if they have powers.All the children of this film seem to have come out of a magazine., and of course, there was to be free male nudity and 80% female nudity just to make you understand how distorted you are.I wanted to rename this movie "The Wizards of the OC", let me pretend that I am This film was completely devoid of imagination and predictable, the last fight was lame and dragged and the end was very anticlimatic, it was a film best left in the floor room.
