OK, I just returned from the channels and caught DW3. I watched it knowing that it would be a junk..But like someone who saw tons of movies, this one is one of the worst movies I've ever seen ... I'm not kidding not. It's so bad that you have to look at it like a serious accident that you can not turn away from. Sometimes these kinds of movies work, for example, the Troma movies ... but watch Martin Balsam and Charles Bronson sound like it's painful ... What's even more funny is that I shot IMDb to see what others have said and it really marks a 4.1 / 10 ??? I can not believe that it has exceeded 1.5! Just as funny, is not it even the pinnacle of this series ... somehow this garbage justified parts 4 and 5? And to top it all, some comments of this type mention that it is the best of the series and its favorite movie of all time ??? Such statements scare me about this world!
