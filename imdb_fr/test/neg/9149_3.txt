Like the beauty of the jungle, Jessica Alba's beautiful smile and stifling looks dominate the film, but alas, these are the only two things worth watching. When, in theory, we should be attentive to the story. <br /> <br /> The plot is thin on the ground and hard to believe. As beautiful as Jessica Alba is, she adds nothing to the spark she has injected into the credible "Dark Angel" series. Since Dark Angel, it seems that Alba has been reduced to a mere powder in the eyes (but what is good for the eyes!), And is the only reason to put in movies. <br /> <br /> The concept of the dormant dictionary is daft and improbable, with little development of character (or character for that matter) to make us want to undertake the 109 minutes of execution time with this world . Despite the short duration of filming, it is always too difficult and time consuming. <br /> <br /> It seems a shame that talent like Brenda Blethyn, Emily Mortimer and Bob Hoskins are wasted in endless narration. barely raises an impulse. This film is seriously missing a tour, an exotic setting, a more than capable distribution, with a beautiful cinematography and a chance to use the themes and dualistic concepts of "civilization". But there are few stories to tell, no drama, no sense, we look at a love story, more a story of lust and woman happy to please men without asking questions. Let's be honest, if Jessica Alba freely allowed you to sleep with her, do you seriously think that you would be able to focus on learning a tribal language? This is where lies the great problem, both in suspension of disbelief, and in which the female characters are limited and reduced. Take for example the fact that Jessica alba's character undergoes the mental and physical tribulation of pregnancy and the birth of her forbidden love, but all we see is that she is lovely and bent for a minute, then Lovely and curvy with a baby the next day. It's sad to see a promising film fail to live up to its potential. I could always write movie flaws, but it hurts me to do it. The film looks good, the premise could have been turned into a beautiful movie, but unfortunately it was not.
