Okay, before we get to the heart of the matter, let's go ahead and avoid the warning: this movie is SLEAZE's "cinematic" definition par excellence! There are films that can really shock or disgust this film and that have MUCH more artistic value than what can be said for this poo of a movie. So what makes it so lousy ?? Let's take a closer look at "Wet Wilderness" for a moment ...... <br /> <br /> Made in 1974 for practically nothing, this "roughie" has no real "plot" as such describing what would happen if a FAMILY went out in the wild to relax and spend a day being accosted by a fat guy wearing a ski mask wielding a machete looking for kicks ..... of the kind that ends up forcing everyone's sex while being systematically murdered by masked creep. People who are sensitive to incest themes are invited to look elsewhere. Then, to really add a level of surrealism or simply show total incompetence for the art of cinema, the "girl" of the group runs away after being forced to have sex with her brother and finds a black guy at random (!) attached to a tree branch ("... this fat slut left me here for 3 days ...") with hardly any explanation !! He is saved ..... or is he? Of course not!! They are captured before they can escape, where our killer forces them to have sex while forcing the mother to join them, ending up with a dead black guy (through a hatchet across the chest) when all is said and done. Then our killer forces the girl and the mother to give him a blowjob when one of the women seized the machete ........ and the film ends abruptly !!! Just like that! No warning, no tense ends ... it's just finished. Now, it might be that this movie ends properly (honestly, I do not know), but I only saw the extremely crude version of Alpha Blue Archives. Their version seems to have the end completely cut off, or that's how it ends. If that were intentional, then in Movie-Making 101, I'm sure there's a basic rule about how to finish a movie, but it should not be done that way! Fans of the movie "Psycho" should rejoice in hearing the music of the soundtrack, because it's all along the film! I would be willing to bet that no rights have been licensed or anything. Moreover, even if it is a "violent" film, there is not much left, so gorehounds will not find anything really useful here. No violence is shown graphically ..... only the results (one of the victims is stabbed with a machete just above the vagina area). In addition, sex is one of the biggest sex I have ever seen! What's interesting about this film is that it's too ugly to work like a really erotic porn or to turn around anyone, except those who tend to like sordid, mean and ugly things, but not violent enough to create real notoriety among those who seek. for something really brutal like "Cannibal Holocaust" or other movies like that. The only "notorious" thing about this steam pile is that violence was added to an adult film, a concept that was quite new at the time, especially when you consider that chic porn was fashionable and that Grindhouses that populated 42nd Street were playing things like this. to a group of the most jaded porn mavens. It was not and it's not at all "mainstream" porn. <br /> <br /> If you were in a film school and there was a "do not do" list, this movie would be: a shining example of this lesson! This cinematic failure shows what happens when filmmakers with brain disorders are given a "budget" (in this case, probably about $ 142 ..... it looks like it!), Ignore all "do not do" and turn them into "to do" "..... yes, this movie is so bad !! One last thing: those who are offended by racial epithets are also encouraged to look at something else. Black in the film constantly suffers verbal abuse about his color and the murderer is obviously racist, but there was NO politically correct in the early 70s. I'm not sure that a film like this can to be done today. <br /> <br /> To be honest, this will not "shock" anyone or anyone's passion, with the exception of those who attack ugliness. The sex is so ugly and mundane, it's hard to look with a sense of eroticism, so if you're have the opportunity, thank God for the fast forward button! The "game", if you want to call it that, is at best amateur (I mean, it's even bad for PORN!) Without any reason to worry about anyone or anything! If you have to JUST see it anyway, then download it because you will really feel like a stub if you buy this. Some things are just that worthless ..... and "Wet Wildernes" is. The only thing more unpleasant than watching this movie would be watching this movie sitting in a movie theater and watching other people who were watching it too and suddenly feeling in danger. Probably not the largest collection of thinkers and intellectuals in society. But if you're up for a stupid and yet SLEAZY porn video, try your luck. It's 54 minutes and yet it's MUCH longer! Crackheads would like that! Again, there may be something wrong with me looking for that in the first place ...... LOL! Caveat emptor, sleaze-lovers !!
