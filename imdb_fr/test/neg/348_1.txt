Okay, by the time you read this, I might have stopped crying. This movie was so horrible that it was pretty vexing. The creatures are a little cute, but the only good thing about the movie is the growing attachment among the prisoners and guarding them after being stranded on this sullen island. Even seeing Barbara Bach with her tousled hair was not profitable to buy that piece of shit. She walks around with a whisper that I have never used my voice in front of a breath that does not wash when one screams a bloody murder. (Hey, the ruler was so cute but I'm still not reassured.) This is a beer scam crying the good island of Dr. Moreau. Poor Richard Johnson, who was born for better things, is just mean as bad. I mean, how can a bad guy be bad? (Ask Richard Johnson) Joseph Cotten tries not to seem embarrassed when he stumbles over his cameo appearance. In the name of all that is holy, do not rent this damn bomb.
