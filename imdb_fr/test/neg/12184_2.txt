Early in his career, Charles Bronson forged close partnerships with several directors, including J. Lee Thompson and Michael Winner. He also directed two films for Peter Hunt, one of Bond's directors, the first being the decent actor of 1981, Death Hunt, the second being this indifferent political thriller. Assassination is pretty boring if you really know, and in the end, you'll want something a little more exciting and rhythmic, like The Wilby Conspiracy (for example, to which this film looks). <br /> <Bronson sleepwalking through his role as a bodyguard, Jay Killian, to protect the wife of US President Lara Royce Craig (Jill Ireland, Bronson's real wife). Killian thinks that Ms. Craig has been targeted by assassins; she thinks he is a pessimist too protective and paranoid. It turns out - surprise, surprise - that Killian was right from the beginning and that someone is actually trying to eradicate it. The two men go on the run, pursued by the assassins. <br /> <br /> Everyone knows that the wife of an American president is known as the First Lady. For some reason, in this movie, they have renamed it "One Mama"! That's what everyone assumes, but it's indicative of the uselessness of the film as a whole. Most of the film's performances are lazy and the story takes a long time to unfold. If I had to label Assassination in a specific genre, I would say it's supposed to be a "thriller". I would say that with some reservations, however, to say that it is a thriller, it has few thrills.
