This is an excellent example of what happened at Comedy Central after Dave Chapel left. Here is the problem with Carlos Mencia. First, his birth name is Ned Holness and was known until he was 18, when he changed his name to Ned Arnel Mencia. He was born in Honduras, although he acts as if he came from Mexico. He also grew up in the United States. <br /> <br /> I could forgive all that shit, but ... <br /> <br /> He got caught stealing material from other people. Joe Rogan has been his most vocal critic in this way. The Olympics stereotype was an idea of ​​the scam of two Miami DJs. He stole jokes from Bill Cosby. He stole George Lopez's material in his own special HBO show (13 minutes). <br /> <br /> He thinks his work is so original, but Dave Chapel and Lisa Lampanelli have been in the running for years before this idiot (among others). <br /> <br /> This show will crash and burn. The word Beaner can not last that long before it ages. He has not done anything since the first episode. <br /> <br /> "You want to hear a joke?" A Beaner jumps from a fence !! It's funny for 3 seasons! " No. <br /> <br /> Horrible.
