Having just watched Acacia, I see that I agree with the negative reviews. I love Asian and Korean horror and I had high expectations for this movie. Man, I was disappointed. Looking at this, I kept telling myself "surely they are doing this to catch me off guard later", and for a moment, I was expecting something ingenious. However, I slowly realized that the movie was really so bad. It's the cheapest money on the Asian horror market I've seen so far. <br /> <br /> The basic story may not even be so bad, but the way it is filmed seems to be the most laughable plot of all time. The tree as a "scary" device might be suitable if it is used intelligently, but everything the filmmaker gives us gives us different shots of ... yes, a tree, again and again. He seems to hope that the tree will do all the work in its place in terms of tension and accumulation, but it gives the impression that this is what it is: shots of a tree. For God's sake! <br /> <br /> Slow climbs can be very effective, and a film that gives the viewer some glimpses of what's wrong can give good scares, but not Acacia. Of course, we see a child on a tricycle disappearing at the corner of a corner and, again, significant shots of the tree, from above, from below or from the side, but these scenes are not just not scary. They feel foolish, especially because you realize that the director scares them. They just are not. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, I agree with some of the other commentators, that the characters are ridiculous. In particular, the character's "descent into madness" is laughable. However, what really breaks Acacia is the terrible edition. It's hard to see why the scenes were cut together as they are, but it's bad and it kills any spark of interest he might have had. It also makes me feel condescending, because I can see what they are trying to achieve with that, but I can not believe they think I would fall for such cheap tricks. <br /> <br /> There are many Asian ghosts. movies, and a lot of bad ones, but it's by far the worst I've seen. They must have reviewed the list of "what to put in ghost movies", and check them all, but in the end they forgot to add the actual movie.
