"Flashdance" meets "Meatballs III" or maybe it should just be called "Meatballs IV". This is my friend Wesley's favorite movie, largely because he always has something to say about JV's cheerleaders. As someone has already said, "That's good, more than Well, but as you get older, you have to diversify - whether you like it or not, society demands it. " <br /> <br /> "Gimme An F" Mary Ann, the greatest cheerleader of the cinema, played by Beth Miller, looks like a sweet Alicia Silverstone before her reign "Clueless". Wesley hates Miller's other film, the horrible "Teen Wolf Too" directed three years later, in which she plays a capricious southern belle, like the character of Martha Smith in "Animal House". Personally, I admire the palette of Miller because the two characters can not be more different and it is convincing. <br /> <br /> Anyway, Mary Ann is a naughty novice cheerleader from Moline (a member of the "The Lucky Ducks" group) who comes to Camp Beaverview for cheerleading classes. She befriends Jenna (Karen Lee Kelly), the leader of the girls' training, named "The Demons". Jenna becomes protector to Mary Ann after her main rival immediately displeased Mary Ann. <br /> <br /> Later, Mary Ann has a crush on Tommy Hamilton, the chief instructor. Tommy spends his summer fighting the dilemma of having to grow up and move on, which is a problem because his only skills are teaching cheerleaders and setting up elaborate dance routines in the shower. , to the delight of viewers passionate about this kind of things. thing. Phoebe (Daphne Ashbrook) is Tommy's girlfriend who has been suffering for a long time. She has a well-adjusted attitude and an experienced perspective. She even tolerates Mary Ann's flirtation with Mary Ann, confident that she will not take advantage of young Mary Ann. <br /> <br /> These four characters are strong and their relationships have an attractive charm, but the cast is almost as weak as the material they have to work with. Which is a shame because if they had brought a real comic relief to the production, it would be a decent movie. Jennifer Cooke plays Pam, a social climbing and finally very energetic instructor who is pursuing with the money-hungry owner of the camp, Bucky. And there is another couple with something for the characters of "Mad Max". Since nothing is very funny, there remains only a beautiful half-romance and some superb dance routines. <br /> <br /> We try to create suspense by slowly leading a final competition, but unless this is your first movie experience, the result is never in doubt. And there's a story of some of the Japanese businessmen Bucky wants to get money from, but it's not going anywhere dramatically or comically. <br /> <br /> Again, what do I know? I am only a child.
