H.G. Wells turns. No doubt about it. <br /> <br /> Really, it would have been a sci-fi / decent adventure movie, if it had not been based on a classic novel and directed by the author's grandson. I kept hearing that it would be the definitive version of the novel. The result was a pathetic and simple bastardization. <br /> <br /> The novel is a great science fiction story, but many people miss it when they read it (probably because they read it at a very young age) is it full of social commentaries . Eloi and Morlocks are a satire of class distinctions of Victorian England and the general message of the film is that ALL, DECENT AND DEGENERATE, a satirical attack against Victorian complacency and their belief that their civilization would last forever. There is no love story, no romance with a beautiful Eloi woman ... In the novel, the Eloi are childlike beings three meters tall, endowed with a mental capacity that is not not much higher than that of an animal. The temporal traveler befriends a woman of Eloi, but it is clear that he regards her more as a domestic animal. Be that as it may, she is killed before the end of the novel. <br /> <br /> This film first tries to give us a totally stupid story as to "why he wants to travel back in time." The serene romance and the lessons he has to learn are enough to make moviegoers vomit. <br /> <br /> The journey into the future is punctuated by a future disaster. OK, not bad, but it would have had more punch if we had been allowed to see that humanity degenerates in general, as in the book. I think it's more of a reflection on the time, because George Pal's version triggered a nuclear war. <br /> <br /> The general history? Ugh. A total distortion of the novel. The Eloi are too competent and warlike. The Morlocks are too smart. The UberMorlock is an embarrassment, and there is no installation. He shows up just in time to be killed. Yawning. <br /> <br /> Samantha Mumba is fine. Guy Pearce is one of my favorites but he often seems confused and suffers. (He would have broken a rib while filming this.) He also looks unhealthy and too skinny, as if he was sick for a long time before taking this picture. <br /> <br /> A sad and sorry version of the movie the classics of the world. H. G. Wells deserves better .... MUCH better. <br /> <br />
