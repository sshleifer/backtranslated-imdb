Let's see: what are the benefits of watching Piranha, Piranha? Well, if you've never seen anything with Venezuela, there are many images of Caracas travelogues and the countryside (and the jungle side), as well as the various indigenous peoples in the country. work and recreation, as well as many Aboriginal peoples. wildlife. If you like William Smith, he plays a bit like a jerk (as he always has). <br /> <br /> And that's about it. If it was not William Smith, it could probably be considered a fundraising film for Save the Children or another organization that benefits the "third world". The only time you really see the title fish is during the opening credits. No mutant killer fish as in Roger Corman's Piranha. You would think that with twice the fish in the title, there would be twice as many monsters feeding on the characters, but alas, this is not the case. <br /> <br /> The story begins with a photojournalist and his brother Coming to Venezuela to tell a story about one of the last untouched places on the planet, but their motivation is quickly changed to a desire to find diamonds , which are apparently quite numerous there. <br /> <br /> There is not much to do. real action or danger in this movie. What could have been an exciting motorcycle race is blunted by the mass of scenes of landscapes and animals that are inserted to draw the duration of the film. There is not much more action until the last fifteen minutes of the film (which probably indicates how long the film would last without the whole travel story). <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the only ways a movie can really be a bad movie is to be boring or incredibly stupid. Piranha, Piranha certainly qualifies for this old badge and is very close to the second. The only reason I will not give it the "1" is that the added footage is more interesting than the rest of the movie.
