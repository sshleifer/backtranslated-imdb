Many people have said it was a good movie with Hoffman offering a great performance. I went from suspended incredulity, agitated boredom, to almost going out. there is no there. <br /> <br /> Hoffman does everything possible. he is committed to performance. but sometimes he plays an affected man who looks like an affected actor who nibbles in the scenery. <br /> <br /> There are no other characters in the film than Capote that are so much more than placeholders - Nell, Jack, Perry, Shawn, the sheriff are all one-dimensional dimensions. <br /> <br /> yes, the film shows the manipulative, smoothing and dishonest sides of the hood. it shows them so many times that I started to wonder why - do the filmmakers think that everything needs to be clarified? and even? and even? he often refers to the genius of the hood but does not show it. it shows him surrounded by fans and flatterers but never convinces us why. <br /> <br /> but my goal is not to deconstruct the film. I'm sure others will have other interpretations. for me, it was a two-hour film that seemed like five hours.
