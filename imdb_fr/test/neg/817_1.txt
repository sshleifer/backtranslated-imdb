I say that. If you want to see art, you go to an art gallery. If you want to see a movie, you go to the theater. Trying to mix art and film is disastrous in "Where the Heart Is". An interesting casting is totally lost in this embarrassment. You like Dabney Coleman, see "Short Time". You like Crispin Glover, see "Bartleby". You like Uma Thurman, see "Kill Bill". Above all, if you like Christopher Plummer, see "The silent partner" because his character here is a terrible embarrassment. In fact, all this production is embarrassing. Of course, the human work intrigues for a few minutes. So make a short film, but do not subject your audience to useless absurdities, pretending to be filmed entertainment. - MERK
