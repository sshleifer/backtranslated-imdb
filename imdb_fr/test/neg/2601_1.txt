it is the most overestimated show on television. I think people keep looking because they think they should, because it's kind of a cool show to watch and talk to your friends the next day at work or at work. school. it is rare that it really provokes anything but a little laugh and never causes irony or thought to the public. each joke is interchangeable with "punches" that seem to be drawn from a hat. the total lack of originality combined with the even more shady turn it has generated (see: American dad) makes me doubt the intelligence of an audience that continues to keep this horrible show on television. I do not give any point to a member of my family and god have pity on his soul ...
