I would have liked to know what to do with a movie like this. It seems to be divided into two parts: action sequences and personal dramas on the ground. He follows Ashton Kutsher through the lifeguard school, guided by Master Kevin Costner, then to Alaska where two spectacular rescues take place, the last of which resulted in death. <br /> <br /> I must say that the scenes of La plage seemed to me so stereotypical in many ways that they should be encrusted with geese. A typical fight in a bar between the guys from the navy and the coast guards ("pirates puddles"). The old costner Costner who, as an old bar seller tells him, is "married to the Coast Guard". The older leader who "continues to try to prove to himself that he is still nineteen years old". The former neglected woman on the floor to whom Kostner made a farewell visit. The seemingly sadistic demands placed on swimmers by the instructors, all in pursuit of a more ambitious goal. The talented young man was handicapped by a troubled past. <br /> <br /> The problem is that we have seen everything before. If it's Kevin Costner here it's Clint Eastwood or John Wayne or Lou Gosset Jr. or Vigo Mortenson or Robert DeNiro elsewhere. And the culminating scene has shamelessly drawn elements of "The Perfect Storm" and "Dead Calm". None of this is cool and none of the old characters and stereotypical situations are treated with any originality. <br /> <br /> It works best as a kind of documentary of what's happening in the swimmer's school and what might happen next. even that is a little weak because we do not get a lot of instructions. These are mainly personal conflicts, romantic relationships and tensions related to washing. <br /> <br /> This is unfortunate, because the US Coast Guard is a rather noble group, whose official mission is "the safety of life and property at sea". In wartime, he is transferred to the Navy Department and serves in combat roles. During the Second World War, the Coast Guard even managed to have a medal of honor in its ranks. <br /> <br /> But again, we do not learn much about it. We do not really learn much. The film is transformed into a succession of visual displays and not too much. Disappointment.
