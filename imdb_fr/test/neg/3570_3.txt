I agree that the movie is not the best I have ever seen, but I would like to mention that the actors representing Tommy and Jimmy Dorsey were the real brothers of Dorsey. As actors, they were wonderful musicians. The film, based on their famous split, would have been better if professional actors had played the roles. Many films made during this period benefited from the popularity of Big Bands. Most of the time, the films were not very good because the musicians are not professional actors. Most of the audience did not go to see Tommy or Jimmy Dorsey play themselves; they went for the plot and the music. I have never been a big fan of Dorsey, but the music is good even today. <br /> <br /> I have to comment on a previous post about the actors who played Mom and Pop Dorsey and whose accents would be considered extreme by a Dublin audience. Arthur Shields and Sara Allgood were actually Irish actors, both born in Dublin. You may remember Mr. Shields as Reverend Mr. Playfair in The Quiet Man and Ms. Allgood as Ms. Monahan in Cheaper By The Dozen.
