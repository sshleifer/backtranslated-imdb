A few years ago, I saw The Scent of Green Papayas from the same director. My feelings about the two films are actually the same: beautifully shot, but terribly slow and boring. I saw this film in preview and I left after half an hour. I could not stand it anymore. How can we make an interesting film about people who are constantly telling themselves how happy they are and how perfect their lives are .........? I had a fantasy about a forgotten American, G. I., still wandering in the Vietnamese jungle, who did not know that the war was over. How he would suddenly appear in the movie and begin to empty his M16 characters from the movie. The red of their blood would make a nice contrast with all the green plants of the film ........... So, I was not very caught by this film! It is time to leave!
