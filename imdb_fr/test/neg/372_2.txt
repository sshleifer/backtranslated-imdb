I did it about 8 minutes in "Steel Frontier" before turning it off. Then, greedy for the punishment that I am, I looked a little more the next day. Today, I had to iron a stack of clothes and so I decided to finish the film. It was his own punishment. Here's what I do not understand: Robert Rodriguez and Shane Carruth each spent $ 7,000 on their first feature films and created two remarkable films. Yet here we have two directors who probably have a lot more money, and they produce a huge pile of steaming shit. Let me see if I can understand the logic: "It's" Road Warrior ", but it's like a Western future, we'll have the cheapest" actors "we can find, we'll write my script to my Cousin having a mental challenge, we will spend our budget in a series of explosions, we can not lose! "<br /> <br /> Seriously. I do not think even the guys from MST3K could improve that. But if you insist on watching it, I recommend you get drunk first.
