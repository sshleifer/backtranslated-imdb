I guess if you like snowboarding, you might be able to enjoy beautiful landscapes and beautiful figures. but that's all the film has to offer. the plot is non-existent, and all the jokes present in the film were not funny, even at the level of sympathy. I also hated the characters, the lead actor (Adam Grimes) did his best, and for a comedy like this, there must not be much, but surrounded by so many other bad actors, he had no hope of making this film good. . but I should not be too hard on them, because I know they may have great skills, but with a scenario that I could have written in ten minutes, whatever their skills, they were hidden and hidden for fear of appearing in this movie. . my advice is not to look at it, I would never have done it!
