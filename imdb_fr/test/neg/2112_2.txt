How on earth can you have such fantastic actors in such a miserable creation? It's one of the most stylized rubbish I've known for a long time. Not only is it badly written, but it is a product of bad management and editing. Cinematography is so horribly manipulative and unoriginal and editing is confusing. The ideas underlying the plots (cloning, toxic waste, climate change) are all good at the start, but the production / management team takes them as a gulf of dirt, as we see in an episode. And this is a scientific series? I'm a doctor and all I can say is that the science in this movie is a shit, almost embarrassing to watch. I felt really bad for the actors involved because they were all amazing.
