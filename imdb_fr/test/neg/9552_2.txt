I just saw this early this morning on the Fox Channel quite by accident (my dog ​​woke me up) - I had seen it years ago and I thought I remembered it pretty well. As a child, I enjoyed it. But now? As commented on another poster, many of the reels were out of order, and although it was disorienting at first and it was strange, it seemed to match the production - which was just awful became surreal and amusing. The music numbers for what I thought was the "big" fundraising show ("you're in show business, I'm in show business, most kids are in show business, let's put on a show") go out of nowhere BEFORE all the discussions on the show, then disappear without applause in completely independent "straight" scenes. The main man's girlfriend shows up, spits lines and lines of dialogue, then disappears. I was half awake and I loved every minute of madness.
