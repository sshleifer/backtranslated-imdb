This film is incredibly poor. It was on television when I watched during an action scene and I was laughing at the macho cheese dialogue, waiting for Leslie Nielsen to appear. It took me a few minutes to understand that it was not really a comedy, it was supposed to be taken seriously. Do not forget that someone actually wrote this film and worse - other people funded it and gave it the green light. <br /> <br /> Rutger Hauer obviously does not read the film scripts before sign, either that or he has very bad debts to pay. <br /> <br /> Strangely, this movie is so poor that you find yourself watching it, wondering how it was financed, and how a TV channel must have paid money to have the right to the broadcast. The dialogue between heroes and wicked trying to get away from the sky is particularly painful. This dialogue seems to come from an instrument of Texas Instruments "Speak & Spell". <br /> <br /> The Hollywood slot machine is worse. It's funny anyway.
