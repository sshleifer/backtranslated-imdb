Minor spoiler possible <br /> <br /> This is not a very objective criticism, but I found this film horribly depressing. Like a lot of Russell T. Davies' work, he asks more questions than he can answer. His best work (Bob & Rose, Doctor Who) is a hope against all odds and perseverance even after an apparent defeat. These edifying themes seemed strangely absent here. I guess the fact that I think about it a few days after watching shows the quality of the program, but the resolution was too dark for my taste. <br /> <br /> However, I do not agree with the critics I read complaining that the end felt "nailed". I think that each conclusion flows logically from its principle and that the end represents a solid personal conviction that has perfectly solved the main theme of the series. Although I never really questioned the progress of the events, I felt that many things could have been developed. I also read that it was originally designed as a four-part series instead of two, and it is possible that the truncation damaged the completed part. However, these defects appear everywhere, in sequences and themes sometimes rough or sketched. <br /> <br /> To his credit, Davies is absolutely not afraid to write big, and you have to admire the boldness and breadth of this project. The premise he addresses here is the subject of movies or novels? It is a courageous and ambitious thing to tackle this problem through television. Highlights include Christopher Eccleston, who is positively hypnotic in the lead. For me, it was and remains the best reason to watch. The representation of Messiah's humanity was brilliant, stimulating and engaging, and it paid tribute to both Davies' writing and Eccleston's play. I also thought that the description of the reaction of the modern world to the Second Coming was right. <br /> <br /> So two stars, simply because I personally wish my entertainment to be entertaining. I would rather be high or at least distracted by my fictions. I have a real world around me ?? as filtered by CNN or newspapers - if I choose to be horribly depressed. There are certainly less subjective reasons for judging this article, but I fear that my judgment in this matter may be overshadowed by my emotional response.
