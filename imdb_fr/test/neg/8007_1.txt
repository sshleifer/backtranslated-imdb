Does anyone want to explain why someone would like to make a "British neo-black" detective film with an almost entirely American cast? The accents spoken in this film are terribly awful! But quite in harmony with the performance in wood, it is feared to make a match to fire the actors. <br /> <br /> Really, what kind of gross disgusting, stupid, cynical is it? Even neo-black films have a character that you feel or want to feel, even if they are miserable and doomed; they have at least some decency towards them, a feeling that what they have done is bad or that an apparently good plan has worked badly, and that they are in any case responsible for it. <br /> <br /> Not in this disgusting stew. These characters are putrid and betray themselves and the public. <br /> <br /> Also note that they have a low life - very well, there is nothing wrong with that - except that they seem to live a life of luxury. For a so-called movie about desperate little thieves, the main theme is: boredom. All this is terribly dull and flayed, so know it. So we are going to snatch some people or maybe murder them and go get fucked in a luxury hotel. What ambition! <br /> <br /> This muddy mess is full of all this mess: boring and uneven stimulation; predictable action sequences that are not; banal and incoherent scenography; editing and editing of television cameras made for the wrong reasons; forgotten score; and a total lack of imagination or innovation in production and production. <br /> <br /> Absolutely incredible, we can not love anymore, and for less devoted spectators (or masochists) like me, absolutely unassailable. <br /> <br /> There are other unpleasant things I would like to say about this unpleasant movie, but they would not print them here. In other words, you can probably find something more useful to do with your time than watching this movie - just about anything, actually.
