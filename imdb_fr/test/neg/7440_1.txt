It's unfortunate that they do not have enough confidence in the original to take advantage of it. <br /> <br /> But "RoboCop 2" takes the great ideas, imagination and characters of the original and replaces them with all the stereotypes that the suites have to offer. <br /> <br /> The initial advertisement was cute and so was the scene that follows (recalling the beginning in "Guys and Dolls"!) but apart from a flash of thought here and there, it's a movie that is a slow and dirty battle in the middle of nowhere. <br /> Ideas are introduced and then abandoned, interesting characters of the original have little time in front of the screen, most new characters (Cain, Juliette Faxx) are so boring that they would not stand up movie, and then there is the tone. <br /> <br /> In the blessed original, Paul Verhoeven knew how to navigate with the kind of attitude where, if you ride the attitude and sensitivity of a good pulp comic, even the most violence repulsive would be fun. Kershner (although he has made a sequel to "Star Wars") does not do it. And scene after scene makes you cringe, look away or just give it away. <br /> <br /> And what's going on with RoboCop ?? It should be the main thing here, right? But there are whole scenes in which he does not even appear, and the scenes in which he finds himself are so half-witted and sarcastically written that you do not know or that it matters little whether he is half human or half-cyborg - since it's all boring. . <br /> <br /> Never have I seen such a quick fall of grace. Why is Hollywood doing such bad things? On purpose? Why; did the filmmakers have a bet? <br /> <br /> One star only for "RoboCop 2"; the effects are good but the story does not even try to match them.
