This film had an excellent base, and could have been a fascinating look at racism, attitudes towards women at work and men-women relations in England at the beginning of the last century. However, this has simply turned into a soppy love story. But what was worse was that the love story was totally incredible. The acting was mostly poor, the direction confused, but especially the script and history were nonexistent. The only thing I liked about the movie was its darkness before electric lighting. I really had an idea of ​​the little light that a candle extinguishes.
