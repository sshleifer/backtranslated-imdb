"Marathon" has a very interesting principle, excellent ambient sounds and beautiful landscapes. Unfortunately, the film, apart from these aspects, falls flat. For a woman who tries to solve as many crossword puzzles in a day, she spends a lot of time staying sulky and not having a headache. I think the film shows more work than his work on these riddles. Moreover, although I understand the point of showing so many landscapes, there are just too many. The film is incredibly boring and blurry. It's not worth buying, renting, watching TV or watching in any way imaginable. I lost interest so quickly that I'm not sure why I watched the whole movie.
