Following Dylan Moran's star of the charming misanthropic bookstore in the surreal sitcom Black Books, I could see his comic potential begging to be used in the theater or in larger cinematic avenues. This first big-screen release in a leading role (he had a cameo like Rufus the thief in Notting Hill) had promised, but as Steve Coogan's live vehicle, The Parole Officer, has too many wrinkles that should have been corrected. pre-production. <br /> <br /> The plot is so complicated that I will not bother to repeat the finer details (the scenario asks each character to do it for us), and the laughter comes from the blog of show business. Michael Caine is a pompous who directed a production of Richard III - an update of the Nazi occupation (one of the few authentic laughs, a satirical move by Ian McKellen), in which everyone makes the Hitler salute to every time he goes on stage. . Convincing Dylan that acting should be a conceptual act in itself, the two conspiracies are to steal money from harmless gangsters by making them play prowess. The confusion ensues (both on screen and in the audience), there is a romantic sub-plot between Dylan and the daughter of one of the gangsters blah blah blah and Dylan has to dress up oddly and make fun accents. Michael Caine delivers some choices, and the timing of Dylan's cartoon is in the money, so why is not it good? It has a certain charm that can be expected from Film 4, but there is also a precocious little girl who acts as a compass in a confused and irrelevant plot - a no-no writing on screen 101. The exhibition illuminates everything else. You just want to see Moran and Caine play each other like you did in the beginning, but when they are together towards the end, the couple lost their charisma. <br /> <br /> The actors are a fun, although disappointing effort. If it were to come on TV on a rainy Tuesday afternoon, have yourself to yourself. Otherwise, you'd better watch your old Black Books videos or rent Withnail & I.
