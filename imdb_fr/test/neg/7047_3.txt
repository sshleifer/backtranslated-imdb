Why bother to see this movie? This is probably the worst career award of a big movie star since Clark Gable's risky role of an Irish patriot in Parnell. <br /> <br /> It is inconceivable that Bergman chose both this film and its lucrative career director in Hollywood where she was able to choose among the best scripts and directors proposed at that time. For starters, there was no script to work with except for a few notes. Then we are supposed to believe Bergman polite as a poor refugee willing to do anything to be released from a refugee camp, including the marriage with a poor Italian fisherman she does not even like. I read where Anna Magnani was the initial choice for this part. If that was the case, it was much more meaningful than placing the luminous Bergman in such a proletarian part. But since she was in love with her director, common sense has gone off the window. <br /> <br /> She will live in this poor village where men have to struggle to pull a lean from the sea. A place she hates obviously and where she is not in her place. <br /> <br /> Her only friend is the priest of the village who knows that she is not made for the life of the wife of a poor fisherman, but who says to him For love, she must repress her true feelings of disgust and accept the poverty and despair she encounters every day. In addition to all this, there is this volcano always about to explode and drown in hot lava. But as a real heroine, Bergman revolts against his misery by declaring war on just about everyone in this monotonous film. She even tries to seduce the priest of the village, in a scene that could laugh if it was not so pathetic. Since her poor husband has to lock her in a room to prevent her from running away, she is forced to use her body to bribe a married man and remove him from the island. For her, no sacrifice is too great; no man unapproachable if he is willing to help him escape the island and his misery. I will not bother to tell you how it ends The end of the movie without script is as plausible as the rest of STROMBOLI. I even remember (seeing him on TV late at night) that he had two different purposes! So be warned if you feel brave enough to sit across this gigantic turkey and catch the bad Bergman. This led to her fall to Hollywood for the next seven years and she was sentenced for sleeping with her manager while she was still married to Peter Lindstrom. None of the films she made with this director (whom she married later) is remarkable, except as evidence of a career gone crazy. I am not joking. It's pretty embarrassing. <br /> <br /> - - SoundTrack
