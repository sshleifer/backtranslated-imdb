The greedy land baron in the small town of Prairie City, in the west of the country, is asking all pastoralists to leave their land, using intimidation tactics and arson to drive them out; it seems that the city is swimming at the top of the oil and when a Swedish farmer refuses to leave, he is mown down by the Baron's rented pistol. The farmer's marine son arrives soon, slowly realizing what he is facing and trying to rally the rest of the residents into battle. Another story of anarchy in the West, with everyone under the thumb of the villain (who naturally holds all the cards). Derived and uncomfortable sometimes to watch, with a long wait before our stoic hero finally recover from the shadows. The shy Swedish accent of Sterling Hayden is a big problem, although it has a solid and friendly presence on the screen and almost makes the picture worth watching. Director Joseph H. Lewis starred most of the scenes like a televised Western, and Gerald Fried's thick soundtrack is useless, although Ray Rennahan's rich black and white cinematography is excellent. . Independent production broadcast via United Artists, the film has a bizarre beginning (beginning with shots of the final, followed by shots of the middle section of the film), but it has a certain needle power that certainly convinces the viewer on the side of Hayden. ** from ****
