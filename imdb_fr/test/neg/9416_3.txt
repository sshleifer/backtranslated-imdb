Mario Van Peebles tries to follow the path Jean-Claude Van Damme and plays the role of a renegade robot soldier who goes away AWOL to preserve himself, but the government will not accept this impasse, then, among the simplistic plot Van Peebles protects villagers from rebel forces and defeats an upgraded version of himself in this disappointing film. This blatant scam of Universal Soldier (which is so much more fun then) leads nowhere. The main problem is that the film is incredibly inert. Van Peebles is just waiting around and there is just not enough kicks in the ass to warrant a viewing. On the other hand, the film looks a bit like a competent version of ROTOR although, since this bad movie was hilarious, it only produces occasional laughter in its ridiculously unconvincing action sequences. . In addition, as for R.O.T.O.R, the narrative makes no sense and the film is basically boring. In addition, the bad guys are disappointing and the film needs an action scenario because the content is too dull. In all respects, Solo is a very weak film. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 on 4- (mediocre)
