After choking the number one number one scalp, the border Bruce Bennett (as Daniel Boone) seems, at first, to give the impression of wanting revenge; but, he really wants to make friends with the natives. When the sad-eyed Indian chef, Lon Chaney Jr. (as Blackfish) also loses the first son, it becomes harder to eliminate misunderstandings. Apparently, it was Republic Pictures' attempt to make for his movie "Daniel Boone, Trail Blazer" what Disney Studio had managed to do with "Davy Crockett, King of the Wild Frontier" (1955). <br /> <br /> The "The Song of Dan'l Boone", whistled and sung by a group of children in a wagon, did not follow "Davy Crockett" from Fess Parker to the Hit Parade . Singer Faron Young (as Faron Callaway) does not interpret the title song (perhaps wisely); he sings "Long Green Valley" and makes a good impression as a blond boyfriend for Boone's daughter. But the Spanish actor Freddy Fernandez is the most valuable player of the film. In a cute scene, Mr. Fernandez reminds Mr. Young of the name of the character ("Susannah") of whom he is supposed to be in love. <br /> <br /> **** Daniel Boone, Trail Blazer (10 / 5/56) Ismael Rodriguez ~ Bruce Bennett, Lon Chaney Jr., Faron Young, Freddy Fernandez
