I watched this movie a few months ago when it first appeared on Blockbuster shelves. This is officially the only movie I wanted to cancel watching. Let me start by saying that I like "B" movies. I consider "Ice Pirates" as one of the best comedies of all time. I will also note that I am a writer and that I met the director / scriptwriter of this cinematic wonder. <br /> <br /> Evaluating the acting game: If I had to choose a brilliant place, I would like to point out that Dion Day had a remarkable debut as a player with his role in this film. For those who do not know it, Dion is a boxer and not an actor, so we will forgive him his lame death sequence. Why does not he shoot the rifle he's holding once? Budget? To highlight the bad game, it would take pages, so I'll stick with The Egotistics, Ryn Baskin. Ryn (which seems to be a name chosen in a comic book because it sounded good) has a maximum speaking time in this film, probably because he was a producer. Its appearance is quite correct, but its delivery evokes memories of SNL ripping soap operas. I guess he could not do the same with what he wrote for him, but the blame is partly his. <br /> <br /> Special Effects: This is not my specialty, but for a low-budget film, I guess makeup and the gun game was acceptable. It did not bother me, but it did not impress me either. <br /> <br /> Script / Direction: Oscar for Best Screenplay is not an option, I think Gerald Nott will never win. Not only is the plot rudimentary, but the dialogue is flat and elevated. I understand stylized hokee-ness, but it was just bad writing. What bothered me most was theft. Nott has stolen scenes, shots and facial hair from Viggo among a host of other films. The scene where Russel Crow walks in the Gladiator Wheat Field, whole sequences of The Good, The Bad and The Ugly, that sort of thing is not enough for me. I will choose not to comment on the filming because I do not know what it takes to get a good shot, etc. ... <br /> <br /> Conclusion: do not rent this movie, do not even pirate it. It's far too bad to waste time. Good reviews can be entirely wrong after meeting Gerry. It seems more than likely that he publishes them himself.
