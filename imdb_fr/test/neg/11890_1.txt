I had to watch this film for my Reigonal Global Geography class. This film is what is wrong with America today, instead of finding the best way out of difficult times or difficult situations, we would rather complain about someone else's fault. This film crosses the fall of Flint, Michigan and blames it 100% on General Motors. In doing so, Moore strives to ensure that General Motors executives are bad guys simply because they do their job in a capitalist society. Moore films several evictions throughout the film and never even asks once if the person is deported following a layoff from GM. Moreover, he never interviews the owners of filmed tenants. Moore strives to twist historical events to adapt his political agenda to this pure propaganda film.
