You know, I really have a problem with movie listings. I read Maxim magazine some time ago and they had a list of the 50 greatest B movies of all time, and knowing me, I of course have to watch them all and write them and write them reviews. That's why you see movie reviews like Gator Bait and Barb Wire and Coffy on my list. So I noticed H.O.T.S. the other day at the video store and recognized him as one of Maxim's 50 greatest B movies, and I decided to rent and check him out. My only consolation is that I rented it because I recognized it from a list of B-movies, so I already knew it was going to be bad. <br /> <br /> Given the type of film it is, I can not say that H.O.T.S. is a total failure, since it is only a T & A film from the late 70s, and never claims anything else. The only place where he moves far away from his goal is in a ragged secondary plot involving two ex-cons. Who have hidden a lot of money stolen from the house that the so-called H.O.T.S. move in, because this subplot has absolutely no place in the movie. Despite the fact that the rest of the film is too, this secondary plot is completely superfluous and useless. <br /> <br /> The story is based on a couple of rival sororities within the beloved FU, which exists as one of those universities that contains a total of one sorority until that the offspring make their own snobs in the other. Help Out The Seals (HOTS) is a sorority supposedly based on seal assistance (the subplot of seals does not really belong to the film, and little attention is given to the meaning of this name. here and there throughout the film). <br /> <br /> It sounds weird, but there is actually a scene that impressed me a lot in this movie. A photo that impressed me, should I say. Towards the middle of the movie, one of Pi's daughters, the rival sorority, pours alcohol into the punch, pours some of it into a glass and drinks it. Curiously, what she does while drinking alcohol reminds me of something Charlie Chaplin would do, which really brightened the movie. Obviously, nothing in this film is comparable to what Chaplin has ever done, but this single shot has increased my score for the movie from 2 to 4. <br /> <br /> Overall, however, the movie is exactly what you expect, a lot of people are running around looking for excuses to undress (I liked how the garment at the end of the football game was removed one of the girls' ideas.) Riiiiiiiiight ?? ), and not much thought is put into much else. At the beginning of the film, for example, there is a scene in which two girls of Pi prepare a hot sauce in the refreshments of a restaurant H.O.T.S. part, being accidentally caught in an incriminating photo (the girl taking the picture did not realize that she had photographed them at the time), although the photo never appears for some reason later in the movie. <br /> <br /> I've already seen movies like this one, it's a bit like Gator Bait, but without the violence and the rednecks and Coffy was not far away. Even Barb Wire is pretty much the same, with a bigger budget and more silicon. Fortunately, the list of Maxim's 50 B movies contains only a few more comedies, because, while these mocking teen movies are entertaining from time to time, they are as bad as occasionally semi-nude scenes, after watching HOTS I think I decided that I like bad horror movies better than bad comedies. I'd rather watch a lot of terrible actors pretending to be afraid than pretending to be funny.
