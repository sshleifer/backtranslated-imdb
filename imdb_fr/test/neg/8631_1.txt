It's the scariest movie ever made in Hollywood. It is an edifying account that explains how to take a European masterpiece and suck life until it becomes a dry shell like an insect carcass on the windowsill. Scary because it reveals the real functioning of the Hollywood world: ignorant money generating slags. I wonder how many great movies could populate the corridors of my memory if the Hollywood process had not prepared them for a forgotten mediocrity. Cry for the murdered children! See Spoorloos or read The Golden Egg, if you dare, because they will come back to you forever in the moments of inactivity of your life: when you walk in the street and you see a poster "disappeared"; in car parks of ordinary appearance; when you hear the Tour de France on the radio; and especially when you think "what is wrong?" wearing a perforated sock on a perfectly ordinary day. <br /> <br /> If only I could give him a zero.
