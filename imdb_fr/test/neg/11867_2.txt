Meh, summarize everything for me really. Boring story, tasteless dialogue, boring action scenes (HOW do you do something like a boring fight or shootout, do you really have to try to do that?), No real characters, etc. Just boring. Snipes is a talented actor and physical performer, but none of this has appeared in ANY of his work on digital television, when it was possible to give the audience a product far superior to the one he was used to. Imagine a decent scenario with some strong characters that you care about and a damn explosive action, fights, shootings, and so on. How can it be so difficult to manage? My personal opinion is that the main actors in the productions simply do not care. There is no evidence of enthusiasm for what they do. Look at Snipes in the first 2 blades, Passenger 57, Rising Sun, New Jack City, Demolition Man, etc.? Impressive and intense performances, complemented by decent scripts (if not always remarkable), good support casts and a perverse action. <br /> <br /> None of this is evident in any of these versions so far, which is a real shame. The distributors slap Wesley's face on the cover, knowing that viewers will see them because they have not yet realized that they have not seen him in the rooms for nearly two years. <br /> <br /> I would love to see Snipes working with someone like Isaac Florentine who really knows how to make the most of a digital TV production and working with Alpha Stunts, who are simply the best gamers 'action. Together, they would all make a fantastic team and a Snipes action vehicle that we would all be proud to see. <br /> <br /> The detonator is nil. It's not as bad as The Marksman, who chews, but it still sucks.
