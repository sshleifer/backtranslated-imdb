The back of the DVD of this film praises: "Chey is the Quentin Tarantino of Christian Films". This is not so much an insult to Quentin as it is to Christian films. This film is badly written, played and edited with an aimless intensity. The scenes unfold in a confused and unrealistic way and are interspersed with beautiful time-lapse photographs. Flashbacks, fades to gray, stills to indicate the time (unimportant in the story) are all performed for no apparent reason other than giving the movie more cinematic credibility. The camera is random, some pretty crane shots are cut with ridiculous montages that have no meaning. A mediocre blockage and light leaves the viewer wondering who is talking to whom in many scenes. Oh and the sound is terrible. The special effects were decent and fortunately limited. But all this is only technical. The film fails to engage emotionally. The dialogue is so wrong and the actors seem to have read it only a moment before the camera rolls. The story ... the things that happen in order have no motivation behind them. The characters have trouble grasping a dimensionality. And the characters must take a stand on Christianity and faith in each scene. Queue Mr. Night and engage Christian movies not to force the characters to pronounce the name of Jesus Christ in each scene for the film to be Christian. Goodness! Please, do not try to show this to your unregistered friends with expectations other than laughter.
