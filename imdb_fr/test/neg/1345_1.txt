Imagine a film quite the opposite of Lawrence of Arabia, instead of having an exclusively male distribution, it presents an all-female cast. Instead of being located in the barren deserts of Arabia, it is located in the expanding metropolis of New York City. And instead of being one of the greatest movies ever made, it's one of the most useless, boring and forgettable. <br /> <br /> The film is about Mary Haines (Meg Ryan), wife and perfect mother, the envy of everyone else in her social circle Manhatten high society. She is painted like a woman carrying the weight of the world on her shoulders, despite the fact that she needs to live with a nanny and a cleaning lady to deal with her only child. But I do not want to be too harsh with her, Mary does all this by adopting a "do-it-yourself" attitude to the stylist work that her father has entrusted to her. This idyllic way of life can not go on forever and things are starting to spoil in a very real way. <br /> <br /> Mary's husband cheats on her and her father fires her for not working hard enough. She is naturally naturally upset and falls a little down. <br /> <br /> But Mary needs to bounce back for her impressionable little girl and herself. She does this through rehabilitation, hair straightening and the creation of her own clothing line. surprisingly good for this kind of film, not a montage. Marie succeeds; his daughter loves him, his mother loves him, his friends love him and her husband decides that he loves her now. She decides to take back her unfaithful husband after realizing that it was her fault, because she did not love him enough. <br /> <br /> The film has a grace that saves is that "all men are hurting" road.
