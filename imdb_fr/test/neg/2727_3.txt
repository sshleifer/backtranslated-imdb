It's moments like this, I'd really like to be a more avid reader of Clive Barker's literary repertoire, because very little is worse than not being able to fully understand a movie of this caliber incredibly " visual". Based on the new "Cabal", the story of "Nightbreed" features a huge amount of sumptuous and strange creatures and scenery in an underground society of demonic ghouls. A normal guy becomes tied to the strange world, called Midian, through his dreams and his psychiatrist forces him to believe that he is responsible for a series of horrific murders of families in recent months ... Thinking that this was true he was retiring to Midian. - located under a rural cemetery - where he is reluctantly accepted. The shrink, however, is right because of Homeboy with a devilish ploy to drive out the community of Nightbreeds ... <br /> <br /> Wanting so much to love this movie, I was very disappointed. Unfortunately, I did not read the story. Barker's fantasy world and his goal and all those monsters were terribly confusing and the premise was painfully uneven. I understand how the final cut was diced and even the moderate disgust of Barker Show for the entire product, but I just did not "understand" it. Although it is crucial to read the story, I think it should at least be translated into a film so that it is still understandable for those who are not familiar with the literature. If "Cabal" is as complicated as this movie, Barker treats a dead concept. I could not help but get bored a bit after a while, especially when things started to get more and more ridiculous (I realized how bored I was) - like a departing police department without fear waging war in Midian as happens every week! Nobody seems to think that the idea of ​​immortal monsters is a bit ... strange. I loved the visual effects and all that was crazy about Midian, especially this porcupine lady and that big SOB head ... Definitely an epic movie when you consider the huge amount of effects and a morbid decor convincing. David Cronenberg fulfills his position as a psychoanalyst with his zippered potato bag mask, but we all wish he did some work behind the camera to help save this pile ... <br /> <br /> > So, if you have a taste for Clive Barker's material and fully understand what Midian is exactly, why do they show the creatures during the opening title sequence (awful idea!), And why these creatures reside here and how does a punk kid share a telekinetic link to that, you should probably check out "Nightbreed". I will be looking for "Cabal" one of these days and I hope to gain some perspective ... Or maybe I will completely forget this masquerade ... Until then, it's a mess of bad movie built and quite tedious ... Look "Hellraiser" instead.
