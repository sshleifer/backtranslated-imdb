I do not know what to say / think about this movie. This is certainly not the worst of the series (there is still "Halloween 3"). The style is just very different and it focuses on other elements than its predecessor. He tries to explain why Michael Myers panics on Halloween and starts to slaughter. Well, all that stuff about Michael Myers being cursed and the devilish sect was a pretty good effort, but I did not buy it. None of the other titles in the series have attempted to give whimsical explanations. <br /> <br /> The film contains a lot of gore. In fact, it's ordinary carnage. If you have not seen the other Halloween movies, you will probably like this one for its blood content. But for a true Halloween fanatic, this sequel might be too different to be considered a good one. The suspense has been transformed into terror and carnage (exploding heads, you understand). <br /> <br /> The end (theatrical break) is simply awful. Michael is stabbed with a needle, then with a pipe, then again, this time with more needles, then a little louder until the head loses his head (where did this green thing come from? ). Basically, it's nothing more than $ 5 million worth of waste. <br /> <br /> There was a good thing though: Michael's mask! <br /> <br /> Dedicated to Donald Pleasance, a real shame. <br /> <br /> My rating: 4/10
