I saw this on French television today and I was very disappointed! The film starts pretty well, but nothing is elucidated and in the end, we are no more advanced than at the beginning. As for seeing the husband for the murder of his wife, it is simply not plausible. You need hard evidence to convict someone and a minimum of evidence. In this case, there is none at all, so it's just not plausible. Remember the old saying "innocent until proven guilty". The fact that a woman disappeared without a trace does not prove that her husband killed her. So, I really do not know what kind of talk this movie was trying to make. The result is totally illogical and incomprehensible, no incriminating evidence is revealed to the viewer. Frankly, looking at it is a waste of time. After all, a movie must be entertaining .... that's totally wrong with this one and I suggest that it be irrevocably written down in the trash it belongs to!
