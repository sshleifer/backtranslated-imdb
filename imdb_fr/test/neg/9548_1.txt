* Criticism mentions spoilers * <br /> <br /> I rarely make user comments, but it's a movie that I have no problem to slander. This film stinks, and its mediocre rating of 6 and a half stars is probably too high for such a pulp. The Bone Collector is not at all the same movie caliber as Silence of the Lambs or Seven, despite what its advertising claims. This is a perfect example of how not to do a thriller. The rhythm of this film was extremely slow. In fact, I left about 10 minutes halfway and returned to the exact scene with exactly the same character, without any progression (I refer you to the part where the character of Angelina Jolie discusses with Denzel cut hands of a corpse). The film is not at all scary, but tries to compensate for this with a secondary plot of love, although the characters of Angelina Jolie and Denzel Washington are sexy. Of course, what you get is something like the mentor-student relationship, as the brilliant epic Silence of the Lambs with Hannibal Lecter and Starling shows. However, even that is inefficient and I was personally looking for the villain to kill. Denzel to avoid chuckling laughter in between. With such a crappy film, I almost expected a movie ending or some sort of spectacular situation to happen at the end to give the film some merits such as mediocre films like Arlington Road and Scream. Anyone with a 4th year education can see the end how will be solved (a situation that mimics Alfred Hitchcock's rear window). The clich√© that the murderer explained his motives was not very inspired, but the reason was so ridiculous and stupid that it made me throw up latte on the screen. On the esoteric level, I even think that the intention of the murderer was completely lost while Denzel is happily recovering from his failure against the proverbial "chess game" and recovers his animal project, Angelina. <br /> <br /> If you are a movie fan with original ideas and really dynamic concepts (like me), you will not appreciate this movie. If you have not attended a single movie of your life and want to catch up with every Hollywood shot (the last shot of a tramp banging on the window of someone other than the murderer, the ridiculous serial killer who has a special relationship with an investigator, the 'horrible woman who tries to fend for herself in a man-dominated squad, aka SOTL), see this movie .... but even then, her pace is too slow and you you would be bored.
