The most complacent film I had the misfortune to rent <br /> <br />. Unassailable. Much of the film is obviously improvised, and not good. Looks like Toback took the first shot of everything <br /> <br />. The film becomes good for a few minutes when <br /> <br /> Robert Downey Jr. introduces himself, then goes to hell again <br /> <br /> very quickly.
