I'm desperately trying to stay awake watching the movie Solomon Kane. I have about 20 minutes left. If things get better, I'll come back here and I'll let you know, but I doubt that will happen. Solomon Kane seems to be based on the video game Dark Watch and seems to match the video game Legacy of Kane, but unfortunately neither is true. I hear that this film is based on comics, graphic novels, detective novels or something else that I have never heard of, but in any case, there is nothing original about this extremely boring movie. The atmosphere is stolen in movie 300, which was not terrible in the first place. The tedious overwork takes itself so seriously that it is almost hypnotic, and to be clear, I say it badly. The plot is virtually non-existent: a violent man who tries to be non-violent meets a friendly family, a friendly family is murdered, a violent man becomes violent again. All characters are stereotypes from Waterworld or Book of Eli or The Hills Have Eyes, or whatever, just choose another apocalyptic and spooky witchcraft movie you've seen and you're done. Someone, somewhere, they say, here's how to make a film: use a blue filter so that everything seems mysterious, add many shots to the slow motion of horse hooves splashing dark puddles, add snowflakes hovering around two boring characters other, and oh yes, the rain falls dramatically so as to distract from the fact that nothing is really happening, and do not forget the black silhouettes that are walking towards us, the flaming fire behind them, and a lot of lit torches , and of course fuzzy fight scenes for We do not know what's really going on because we do not have the budget for the bloody special effects, so just introduce the sound of the metallic rattling and, oh, by the way, do not let no character live long enough for the moment. public to understand them, understand them or sympathize with them, and cross your fingers, hope that fans of sword and witch movies will eat it, even if it's a complete doo doo, and go straight to the video, do not go GO. . .
