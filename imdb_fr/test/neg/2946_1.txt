Now, can you really call that a movie? I knew that some movies that the Japanese do are good only for this evil? I mean, I fell three times in this movie. No horror at all, a tiny comedy per cent (0.2-0.5). The action just admit there are some but the scenes are poorly filmed, the actors are pathetic. None of the actors did a good job in their own role. They were not convincing. The script is so terrible. I mean, this movie can be awesome, REALLY, but for the '60s (I'm not 100% sure.) I recommend NOT to see it unless you want to get bored as much as I do. I can not understand that this film has its rating. IT'S MORE, MORE, MORE EVALUATED !!! This is a personal opinion of course. I do not want to offend anyone but who could love that shit? So I hope it helps someone to NOT waste a bit of time "enjoying" this movie. Nevertheless it is your choice!
