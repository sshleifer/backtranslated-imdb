I was not impressed by the graffiti artist, despite his artistic appeal (also called low-budget improvisation). There is little dialogue and at least for me, I was disappointed not to give more credit or promote the work of guerrillas like these. Instead, it was a story that covers a familiar territory. Two guys who basically do little more than tag buildings become friends, brand partners and end up experiencing a relationship. They seem opposed, rather uncomfortable together. Few things are explained about their background and the events between the two young men are going at a rapid pace (though, that I understand it because it only lasts about 70 minutes). There has been an incalculable number of conspiracies and similar productions in recent years to the point where the independent film sphere begins to become just as saturated with this particular story, at a time when the general public is saturated and more. <br /> <br /> Much of the film can annoy the viewer who needs an immediate dialogue and purpose. The main figure of this story (at least extensively) runs his routines virtually without dialogue, without insight and with nothing else to transport the viewer. And, for a short film, I wish they could get to the bottom of things much faster. That, aside from the typical plot, annoyed me. However, there was something about a glimpse of the daily habits of at least two graffiti writers, even though most of the time was rather unoccupied. <br /> <br /> Recommended if you're tired of shit and donation Do not worry about an independent photo and get interested in this form of urban and underground art. But, you really have to look at it for yourself, as it seems to be one with a more acquired taste. For more recent independent graffiti-based films, see Transit.
