This is the "Battlefield Earth" of the mini series. With a few exceptions, it contains all the disastrous ingredients that have condemned this film and will follow it to the grave of the turkey cemetery. These are both adaptations of books with an infinite number of pages that have been turned into total disorder by a screenwriter and a director (in this case they are the same person.) Who clearly do not know what they are doing. have both an aspiring messiah who will not really deliver, as a hero (played in this case by a guy who looks like Mark Hamill but unfortunately the strength is not with him.) and a group of stupid villains who like betray and ruin life for each other, they both contain stolen scenes for better productions and they are cheap productions that try to appear expensive with computer animations (often poorly done). The exceptions that further compound the problem are the terrible work done by the lighting specialist, who does not even have the skills to turn on the light in his own living room. This camera work that sometimes has no reason to be inclined. Fashion "Battlefield Earth" but mostly flat like a pancake, this desert game extremely cheap and too small that contains only a pile of sand in front of a background painted in desert, which turns very fast very old because it appears in almost every scene and the costume designer's bad idea of ​​trying to emulate the fashion craze of the "fifth element" with the addition of the most ridiculous hats ever made. Silly moments to remember: 1. Each scene with members of the guild, who looks like an observer of MST3K but with a silly hat. 2. Irulan presents herself at the party dressed in her butterfly dress (Why butterflies? Was it the one with stuffed parrots in the pudding?) With a matching hat, as well as two guys with swollen hats. 3. Paul the comedian standing up. 4. Baron Harkonnen is overworked, shouting "I am alive". 5. Each scene with the backdrop as it is newer matches the foreground. 6. Every scene with Fremen's false religious cermonies, especially the cermony "of the water of life". 7. Battle scenes where the same guys are killed multiple times and the same things explode again and again. It's a lot more, but it's a 1000-word limit, so I'd better stop before I get carried away.
