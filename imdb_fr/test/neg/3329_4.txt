Some movies are just ?? unlucky. These are movies that have obviously flourished with a lot of goodwill and a handful of potentially great ideas, but that simply did not have the budget and / or professional actors and team members to make it happen. "The Strangeness" definitely belongs to this category. You really want to like it, but even the most tolerant and unworthy horror fanatics of the 80s will have to admit that the film barely reaches the level of mediocrity because of its cheap atmosphere, its effects of clumsy motion and its impenetrable cinematography. "The Strangeness" has a rather original plot and setting (okay, it's similar to "The Boogens" but I sincerely doubt that director David Michael Hillman deliberately stole an insignificant comrade, an 80's film B) and that players deliver enthusiastic performances are all misinformed. A meeting of amateur speleologists embarks on an expedition to explore the infamous Gold Spike Mine. Many years ago, many miners died here mysteriously and the place has since been abandoned, but there is supposed to be too much hidden gold to stay closed forever. Shortly after their descent into the mine, members of the group meet one by one the slimy sovereign of the Gold Spike mine; a Lovecraftian monster with tentacles and an incredibly old fashioned way forward. "The Strangeness" is a boring and incompetent mess difficult to follow due to the total lack of lighting. The characters are uninteresting and the mine remains a mystery because the only lighting effects come from the helmets of speleologists. There is very little action or horror to be experienced in the first hour, but director Hillman cleverly grabs the attention of viewers by showing pieces of the monster at regular intervals. As soon as you see the tentacle of the monster for the first time, you are condemned to remain vigilant until the end. The creature is made with stop-motion effects, which I usually adore and adore, but here they look extremely weak and pitiful. The person in charge of the special effects should have paid more attention to the work of Ray Harryhousen. The sequences of the death occur largely off the screen and there is very little suspense throughout the film. A horror movie with such a setting should enjoy a claustrophobic atmosphere and unidentifiable sound effects, but "The Strangeness" lacks all of this. The biggest asset of the film is undoubtedly the beautiful appearance of the blonde actress Terri Berland. She looks like a speleologist as much as me to Mother Teresa, but she must look great in her white top and beige pants.
