Of course, you can see crazy people, but if that's all you're looking for in a movie, you'll save more time on youtube. I just paid a dollar of redbox because I saw the name of Val Kilmer. Bad movement. The plot did not thicken, the dialogue was of poor quality, the characters little developed at best. Someone said that cinematography was ok but do not expect too much. This film moved very slowly and ended without grace. Blacklist. I spent a good part of the movie wondering if an event or a color scheme was symbolic. In reality, I never rewound to understand, because nothing was explained at the end. No twists. He also left many questions on the subject. I absolutely did not want an answer. One of the worst movies I have ever seen.
