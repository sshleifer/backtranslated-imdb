The TV show was slow and the "offbeat" characters were sometimes irritating. Only by the miracle of rapid advance that I was able to cross the first 2 hours. <br /> <br /> The writing indicates that it's a kind of comedy / mystery but I have not seen much either. <br /> <br /> If it really resumes after the first 2 hours, thank you to let me know, because I doubt that I look at the rest without recommendation. <br /> <br /> This review is supposed to be without spoilers so I will continue in a wave, non-spoiler, fashion. I found the two main characters uninteresting and unfriendly. I found myself asking, "Would a normal adult do that?" The man with the hedge trimmer looking out the window was irritating and when the male contact interacted with him, he looked pathetic. Would a normal adult bear a person as irritating as him?
