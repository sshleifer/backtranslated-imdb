Not really that movie ... a stunt rider or a stock-car racer has a car in flames at the beginning of the movie, goes to the bar, is approached by a gang of bikers who ruins his chances with a very pretty lady, offers him a job, he goes home, refuses, the police ask him to accept their departure !!! What is being played is a very boring little movie in which the hero does not do much and a gang of bikers who can kill and for some reason the police can not blame them for a crime. I do not know why the biker did what she did in the end, but hey it's a bad movie, we always have scenes that make little sense. I'm still trying to figure out if I misunderstood when they said the hero of the play was a stunt driver. They may have said stock driver because why would a stunt rider be in the race and I do not think it would be so rare that a stuntman crashed. The actors are bad, and all the bikers are pretty annoying and the hero is a bit incompetent ... really this movie is not packed but it's the holes.
