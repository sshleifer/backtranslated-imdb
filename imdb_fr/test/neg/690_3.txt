Although Humphrey Bogart was featured in King Of The Underworld, I'm willing to bet he did not thank Jack Warner for that. In fact, this film was a hollow crown. <br /> <br /> The King of Hell was supposed to be a remake of Paul Muni's film, Dr. Socrates, but since Humphrey Bogart was in the cast, the character is written more like Duc Mantee in the Petrified Forest. . He even has an English writer in the person of James Stephenson. <br /> <br /> Kay Francis and John Eldredge are two married doctors and Eldredge performs a tricky operation on one of Bogart's henchmen. Bogey is a man who appreciates the good work done on his behalf and gives Eldredge $ 500.00. There is more of where it comes from if he plays his cards correctly. Eldredge, who has a gambling problem, sees a good way to get undeclared income. <br /> <br /> But when he is killed in a raid on the gang hideout, it is also believed that Francis is involved in the law and that the American Medical Association, no matter how much it protests his innocence . It's not good and she and her aunt Jessie Busley settle down in a small town to get away from notoriety. <br /> <br /> Of course, notoriety and Bogart and a traveling writer Leslie Howard, like that of Stephenson, meet her all. again. But Kay is brave and resourceful to say the least. <br /> <br /> The character of Bogart was ridiculous, it is not surprising that this poor man was asking for better roles. He is a gangster who kills people without mercy and kicks his henchmen just to laugh. He is preoccupied with his image and therefore takes away the writer Stephenson to write his autobiography. Of course, he admits enough to burn it in the 48 states. And then let Francis Francis surpass him completely, hard to believe that he was the king of anything. <br /> <br /> Decidedly one of the most minor works for one or the other of the stars.
