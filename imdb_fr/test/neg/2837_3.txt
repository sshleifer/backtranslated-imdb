... Brian? what on earth were you * when you signed up to do that? <br /> <br /> I saw him recently at a festival, which was greeted with laughter. At the time of the credits, tears ran down the faces of many spectators. <br /> <br /> The plot is an awkward merger of 'E.R.' and 'The X-Files'; cynically intended for the television audience that it is possible to obtain without being sued. The sequences involving the kidnappings are hilarious - the two scenes staged by Yuzna "floating from the bed" and the pathetic plastic extraterrestrials of "Screaming Mad George" provoked bursts of mocking and incredulous laughter. <br /> <br /> Boiterie, camp and stupid. My only hope is that it's an aberration. As terrible as "The Return of the Living Dead 3" was good. <br /> <br /> Steev
