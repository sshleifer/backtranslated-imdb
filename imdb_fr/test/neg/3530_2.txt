OK, let's see ... a handsome young stranger is new to town and walks on the sidewalk. He meets a pretty girl, meets the heinous leader of the local hip-club vampire youth club, is dared by them to follow them into this cave, enters into a conflict over this pretty girl, an epic fight ensues ... < No, it's not Lost Boys, although you have a hard time making a difference, because I think even some of the carnival music is the same. (Do you have to pay royalties for sampling a movie?) Even the end of this stink is torn from Lost Boys. The makeup is below average, even for a low-budget thriller, the characters are one-dimensional, and how many scenes "Oh, I had this horrible experience" of teenage anguish does she need to 'a movie? The humor is flat and stupid, and all the rest is sadly predictable. Yawning. <br /> <br /> The only thing scary about this turkey is the promise (the threat) of a sequel, an idea that will hopefully be guaranteed to all distributors in the country.
