This film is worse than "the door of paradise" or the "plane 9 of space". I do not know why he even had an Oscar, he should have had a million raspberries, just like the public who came out or did not show up at the start. The hospital was a financial failure of the highest order, but I am sure that the elites of the intellectual class of leftist intellectuals said that the American public was far too plebeian to appreciate sharp social commentaries when they saw it and beyond. and on. George C Scott, in one of the most naive and embarrassing roles, alongside aging sex-symbolism, Diana Rigg, spends much of the film trying to break in a more and more jaded way as part of a stupid plot. Poor old George is helpless and he has just been crushed by the event, but after much vulgar talk between him and Rigg, he rapes her several times on a beautiful night in a filthy and disgusting hospital in New York, who looks so disgusting that I would not want dying pet rat treated in it. There is also a sacrilegious dialogue with junk food thrown here and there, with a lot of chatter too. He concludes by describing the misconception that unusual stress without physical effort always leads to cardiac arrest. I never want to see a minute of this awful movie again.
