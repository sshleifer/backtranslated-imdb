Brown's thesis is that a good dose of Roman Catholicism will solve all the problems of life. A little proselytism does not bother me, but it sometimes becomes a bit ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Some actors have played the role of Father Brown over the years, Kenneth More and Barnard Hughes are good examples. Alec Guinness plays it in this film and does it well, but you have not seen much demand for future films by Father Brown. <br /> <br /> I suppose that if you are a convinced Catholic, everything goes perfectly well. It is far more important to catch the thief and convert him to your religion than to see him brought to justice. <br /> <br /> But that's what it was asked to accept here. In fact, there is a preliminary story before the main action of the film. Guinness in secretary's costume is caught trying to recover stolen items that one of his parishioners, Sidney James, allegedly used during a robbery. <br /> <br /> That's the story he tells the local cops and, of course, it's something James told. entrusted to him so that he can not break the confessional. <br /> <br /> Let's move on to the big game now. The master thief Flambeau, played by Peter Finch, stole a cross that was entrusted to Father Brown and that would have belonged to Saint Augustine at the time. But Father Brown is more interested in the return of Flambeau to his faith than to see him brought to justice. So he misleads the police so that he can accomplish his mission. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry but all of this was too hard for me to swallow. Father Brown, I would hate to say that it was guilty of obstruction and that he should have been arrested. And he had no obligation to reveal anything about what he knew about Flambeau, the man had not come to see him as a penitent in search of absolution and spiritual advice. <br /> <br /> Author G.K. Chesterton, a well-known Catholic layman in his time, finds all this very reasonable. His logical conclusion is to replace all police forces with an army of priests. <br /> <br /> Guinness borrows from his own Reverend Ascoyne D'Ascoyne from Kind Hearts and Coronets and Barry Fitzgerald in Going My Way to create Father Brown. Admittedly, Brown is much smarter than the other two. There is also a little Colonel Nicholson in this performance. In The Bridge on the Kwai River, Guinness also played a character whose rather strange interpretation of the rules made him lose sight of what was important in Nicholson's situation. <br /> <br /> Father Brown is an entertaining guy when he solves mysteries and makes the authorities look stupid. We liked that Cadfael did it in a medieval setting and the American public loved Tom Bosley's father Dowling a few years ago. <br /> <br /> This film should have been entertaining.
