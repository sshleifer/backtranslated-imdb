this film is not so good ... at all but it's good when you want to laugh, because it's pretty ridiculous :) it contains a lot of mistakes and it's nerdy. I had this movie for Christmas 5 years ago, but for some reason, I never gave it up. I guess I just like it for a rainy day even though I only watch it once a year. It's a very 90's movie so it's really fun to see how everyone dresses and behaves. This film is good for a young person ... even if I think about it, I did not like it very much when I was 12 but it's just my personal opinion. the movie was really predictable. I wish he had some extra twists, but I guess he was trying to be a good movie for everyone to enjoy. I think it was appropriate for the whole family but Hallie's dress was a little modest but certainly appropriate enough for family gear.
