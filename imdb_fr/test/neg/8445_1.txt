ATTENTION: I advise all those who have not seen the movie yet not to read this comment. <br /> <br /> If you plan to watch this movie, do not do it! I warn you ... this movie is terribly boring and basically horrible, not the kind of horror movie to watch. I took this Piranha movie for another Piranha movie and when I noticed that I had made a mistake, I still decided to watch this one. I wish I would not have. This film is so horrible and so intolerable in every room that I could not stand to let anyone say that this movie was half decent. On the one hand, this film should be called A Boring Speech on the Desert instead of Piranha. They only show piranhas once! At the same time, the sound of this movie is so badly understood that I only fell asleep 20 minutes later. In the end, my mouth was wide open and I gloomily stared at the white screen of the television. It's a VERY poorly directed and poorly filmed junk that I was afraid of having brain dysfunction after watching it ...
