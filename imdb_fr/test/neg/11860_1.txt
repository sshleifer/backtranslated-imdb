There is a difference between a "movie" and a "movie". A film, whatever its quality, is ready for public consumption. A movie is what a group of friends get together over a weekend with a camcorder. As a spectator, I have seen many examples of both. <br /> <br /> On September 19, I attended the screening of the film "Donnybrook" by writer / director Jon Satejowski. Now that I've read the script and seen two different cuts (a raw cut and the "finished" product) of this piece, I can safely say it's a movie. And a student movie, to that. It is, for lack of a better word, competent, that is to say that the director was able to push a recording on a camera and capture moving images. Visuals are, for the most part, static and unimpressive, and dialogue scenes are reduced to generally long shots, with little or no close-ups to allow the audience to relate to the characters. I understand that this is a modest budget film, but some visual talent would have been appreciated and would have kept the public interest. <br /> <br /> Of course, independent images have been published. shown that limited camera work can be overcome with a captivating story well written and a sharp dialogue. Steven Soderbergh's "Sex, Lies and Video" immediately comes to mind. This film, however, has neither one nor the other. The main story is weak and fuzzy. If the main plot is Davie trying to fix his relationship with his father, I think this film misses the point. What I've learned is that Davie's main aspiration is to "change the face of rock'n'roll". However, we see very little activity on his part to show it. Although there is a sequence of dreams at the beginning and an impromptu performance at the end, all we seem to have is scenes of Davie listening to music or playing the guitar casually. We are simply told that Davie has played a lot of shows, but we never see him in full rock mode. Next time, SHOW does not tell the public. Anyone who has taken a creative writing course knows it. In addition, Davie does not look like someone who would have been powerful at the time of 1970s glam rock; he seems to be more at home in the early days of rock'n'roll, pretending to be James Dean's less talented brother. Meanwhile, the rest of the cinematic events seem to come at random to rather clich√©d characters, and the story lines, which have little or nothing to do with the thin main story, are evoked and dropped with frequency alarming Terry's father). If I want to see a movie with this kind of random build, I'll consider watching "Napolean Dynamite" again, a movie I could barely get through for the first time. <br /> <br /> Regarding the dialogue mentioned above scenes, I guess I should mention that they are rare and extremely far apart. Is it too much to ask the characters who speak? I do not think it is. When the characters speak, they are short and agitated sentences; collections of such intelligent questions, furious grunts or extravagant explosions. These characters just do not behave like normal, rational people. By working with materials like this, it's easy to understand why there's only one good performance in the movie, that of Al Hudson, simply because he poorly imitates Sam Elliott for his passage on the screen. A good director, or at least a man ready to take on the challenge of a feature filmmaker, would have been able to detect these problems and ask the writer and the camera to correct them. However, since Satejowski is so close to the material, he simply does not see it or, if he does, he does not want to take the necessary steps to fix it, as this would undermine his creative vision. Being unable or unwilling to deal constructively with criticism is the mark of a fool who is indulgent and misguided. Ask Rob Schneider. <br /> <br /> In the end, we still have a group of mediocre students who imitate the incredible "Garden State" by Zach Braff, combined with the incredible "Velvet Goldmine", two films much more worthy of your time. <br /> <br /> Now, before the cast or crew gets out of the word job to take me for this exam, let me offer it to you. The best I can do is to congratulate Mr Satejowski for having the ambition to make his own film and present it to an audience. However, the hope that this film is taken up and distributed is simply a misleading vision of greatness. It's a student film, nothing more, nothing less. If the film holds a promise (and let's face it, at this point, it's not going to come from acting, writing, or directing), it's this: If, SI, people associated with this movie are arranged, so, please, learn from this movie, put it away and use the lessons learned on your next attempt; do not attack your critics, nor ask a friend or family to do it for you. If you are able to do it, the next film may deserve to be distributed, deserves to be called "film". <br /> <br /> I am your audience and I am ready to watch.
