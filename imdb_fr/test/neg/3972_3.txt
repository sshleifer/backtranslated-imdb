I would say this first ... the film would have been a science fiction classic of the 1970s if it had been performed much better. <br /> <br /> That said, let's take a look at the plot ... it starts with Peter Graves (or is it Clarence Oveur?) who comes to the presidency and then cuts in an idyllic environment like on a university campus bursting with authoritarians wearing clumsy caps and helmets and delayed athletes acting as if they were perpetually 8 years old. shows a guy who is apparently going to America to organize a party, then taken to a medical laboratory where he is drugged, packed in a plastic bag and prepared as if the doctors were putting vegetables in bags for packaging In fact, it is put on the ice so that doctors can extract the organs they need. <br /> <br /> He then goes to another doped man, thinking that the place where he lives is a little strange after a can of beer (of all the possible field instruments) that he finds in a river makes him look suspicious (fucking those beer cans!). He and some equally stupid lovers of his love feel that they have to get to the bottom of things, so he has her stay here as he escapes through what is basically a large university administrative building with some evidence that he discovers on the way about cloning. ..and how he is part of it. <br /> <br /> He escapes his controllers after being shot. An old journalist allows him to find his "father", the man from whom he was cloned. It turns out he is a clone of Peter Graves' brother. After discussing what to do with him and his testimony, he returns to the institution to find his girlfriend (who has been lobotomized meanwhile to be even more stupid, harmless and ready to lead a talk- show according to the SOL team). He is captured and stored in a cold store, as is his belated friend of Nazi construction since the beginning of the film. <br /> <br /> At the same time, a confrontation at the home of the Graves brothers caused several deaths, including that of Graves. The journalist and his wife are killed during an exciting conversation with a bomb. It seems that the conspirators have won to some extent ... <br /> <br /> Next, Peter Graves proves to be able to survive and survive. He is defeated with a metal poker by the miracle of the cloned games and gives another vote. for me "as the journalists face it about cloning. <br /> <br /> Certainly feed MST3K, but at the bottom of the spectrum in terms of the general order.
