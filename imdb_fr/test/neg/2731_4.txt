For science fiction fans, it will be better than anything that is likely to go on television at any given time. that's about the best you can say. Good points; The spread and sense of humor are less crazy than usual in such films, the plot is consistent and uses no magic mystical revelation. Bad points; writers try to do good scientific research, but their direction and production fall (for example, a drilling mole using overheated drilling equipment breaks to the surface with nary a boiling bubble or cauldron), the characters are snapshots and the unfolding plot is pretty standard stock. OK for an evening of the kind too tired. but do not expect a major edification or even discussion points really.
