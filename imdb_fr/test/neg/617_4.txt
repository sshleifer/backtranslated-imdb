"Felony" is a serial movie. No doubt about it. <br /> <br /> Of course, if you take a look at the composition of the cast, you may have high hopes for its entertainment potential. This film is filled with all the actors of wonderful characters with whom you grew up, those with faces you recognize immediately even if you probably do not know their names. It is amazing that the filmmakers have managed to bring all these people together on a project, almost as if they had decided to make a meeting of actors of films of series B. The distribution includes even some actors of first order: David Warner, that most people will recognize in Titanic (though my favorite role is Jack the Ripper in "Time After Time") and Lance Henriksen, whom many remember as bishop in "Aliens". These two actors have done an excellent job during their long career and have made some very good films. <br /> <br /> However, as impressive as this group of actors, their talent is never fully manifest on the screen. The writers of 'Felony' spent a lot of money putting together a dream team and then missed out on their golden chance because of one important factor, the common denominator of all B-series movies: a silly storyline. <br /> <br /> We start with a stupid premise. The villains are filmed for a horrific murder and they tirelessly pursue the film crew to acquire the videotape and destroy the evidence. But honestly, why bother? During the time needed to find the film crew, a thousand copies of this tape could be created and distributed to all law enforcement agencies and all media. Criminals do not seem to realize how futile their efforts are and speak as if stealing and destroying the original videotape would solve the whole problem. Stupid ... but I guess if the bad guys were so logical, there would be no movie. <br /> <br /> Then there is the dialogue. Sometimes it's stupid, sometimes clich√© and sometimes incredible ... everything you expect from a B movie. Of course, I always thought that good performance could overcome a lot of weaknesses in the material. This distribution includes actors who are really capable of producing good performances. Although a number of cast members are not at all good actors and have achieved the B-movie status rightly, it is hoped that the strongest part of the cast will be able to infuse of life in their parts. However, it is disappointing to see that few actors in this movie really seem to take it seriously enough to give it the best of themselves. There is not much obvious inspiration in these performances, but again, it's an uninteresting scenario. Now, I'll admit that some of the most colorful actors of the cast manage to add a little spice to the production of their lines, but honestly, even the very good actors that I mentioned earlier seem for the most part disinterested and not involved in the film. history. <br /> <br /> Speaking of history ... even though the acting had been of a caliber enough to make the dialogue a little less corny, he still would not buy "Felony" from the fact that its author makes the ultimate faux pas of low-budget action film scripts: a plot with as many holes as a block of Swiss cheese. You can watch this movie a hundred times and you will still not know how everything is going. In order to create suspense and leave the viewer always puzzled, the author writes all kinds of surprises and unexpected twists in his scenario and ends up in a puzzle, but when you reach the end, you will find that there is many pieces. it does not correspond to anything and to those who miss. I admire a good thriller that lets me guess, but creating twists that exist just to confuse you and that are not compatible with the rest of the story is amateurish. There were so many things that were never explained that I felt extremely frustrated in the end. If you decide to watch it, get ready to be confused. <br /> <br /> I did not even mention all kinds of nonsense about this movie, but I will not worry about it. The funny thing is that despite all that I said, I must admit that I can not give 1/1 stars to 'Felony'. Although I do not know exactly why, I found this film rather nice. Foolishness can be fun sometimes if you feel like it. In addition, I really like some of these actors and even if their performance is somewhat dull given their talents, I still had a hard time seeing them. <br /> <br /> Now, I realize that I noticed this film from the point of view of a serious moviegoer. It is quite possible that I completely missed the point. It may be that the intention of the filmmakers has always been to make a series film. Maybe the stupidity is quite intentional. If that's the case, and if I had to evaluate it that way, I should say that "Felony" is a classic of the kind of ironic action movies. B-movie fans will love seeing all of their favorite actors in a movie, get some laughs from the script and be entertained by the good dose of guns, explosions and chases.
