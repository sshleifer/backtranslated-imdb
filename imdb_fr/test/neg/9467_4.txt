The title lines of this review are the first lines of the theme song of this film, a wonderfully insane parody of the song (in my opinion horrible) "My Favorite Things" from "The Sound of Music". And this little fun detail is not the only aspect that makes "The Body Shop". "Doctor Gore" (1973) to recommend to my fellow Gore / Trash fans. The film, created almost entirely by JG Patterson Jr., who was producer, screenwriter, director, and lead actor of the same name as Dr. Gore, is nil, but it's definitely fun too, and everyone involved , probably Patterson in particular, knew about it. that they were not exactly a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Dr. Brandon (Patterson), a famous but totally crazy plastic surgeon, loses his beloved wife Anitra, a model, in an accident. With his hunchbacked assistant Greg (Roy Mehaffey), he now removes beautiful young women to build a new perfect and perfect wife ... <br /> <br /> "Dr. Gore" is probably a movie of the genre " so bad that it's good, "but it also has qualities that go beyond the ridiculous ridiculous usual. Crazy science has always been one of my favorite horror topics, and in fact, it's also one of the coolest subjects for ridiculous Gore Trash movies. Obviously with a minimal budget, "Doctor Gore" pays tribute to "Frankenstein" films, including James Whale's masterpiece "Bride of Frankenstein" (1935), and looks like the first Troma / Herschell film Gordon Lewis Gore, such as "Blood Feast" (1963) - only that it looks a lot cheaper and sadder. Obviously JG Patterson's motive was not just to make a fun gore movie: being a rather ugly and weird type, his role as Dr. Brandon gave Patterson the opportunity to kiss with two hot young women, hardly dressed (who would end up as body part donors in Dr. Brandon's lab). <br /> <br /> Most of the gore is actually quite well done with regard to the very small budget. The dialogue includes extremely hilarious lines ("Understand that, it could be the door ... and put on a coat so they do not see you're a hunchback."). In addition to the aforementioned theme song, "Doctor Gore" also includes a wonderfully ugly country group appearance "Bill Hicks and the Rainbows" - my new favorite band, NOT. For the rest of the film, I wondered if Bill Hicks and Roy Mehaffey, who plays the hunchbacked assistant, were twins or even the same person - they both look alike and have two obese guys with red beards who look like to that. weird in a movie would be a huge coincidence. Other than J.G. Patterson, most cast members have never made other films. This is the first movie I've seen among some of Patterson's. Unfortunately, the man died of cancer in 1975. <br /> <br /> Overall, "Doctor Gore" is a film that is certainly not suitable for everyone. In fact, it's total shit. But it's also fun and recommendable for my friends who are fans of strange and cheap camp stuff. The dictionaries should show a screenshot of this movie under "Trash Flick".
