A superb cast, a fantastic CGI monster and a brilliant script. If this film had any of these things, it might not have been one of the worst films I lost an hour and a half. Infinite chimpanzees with endless typewriters have not yet written the complete works of Shakespeare, but along the way, this has appeared in their wastebasket and has been turned into a movie. You can tell the actors to regret signing these contracts with every word they whisper directly to the camera. The CGI is extremely amateurish and might have created more tension if the cast had been attacked with the Sinclair Spectrum on which it was created. I wanted to love this movie, it contains pretty appearances of Gil Gerard and Walter Koenig, so I was expecting a fun horror movie that does not take itself too seriously. He's actually trying to take himself seriously, but it's as much fun as going to the dentist. Do yourself a favor. Do not watch this movie, you will encourage them to do more.
