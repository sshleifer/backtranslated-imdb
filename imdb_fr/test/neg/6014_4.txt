If she had not been married to the producer, Jennifer Jones would not have been the obvious choice for the female leading role in this tragic story of a case between an American soldier and an English nurse, in the context of World War I. Her British accent is not perfect, and in the 1950s, it was unusual for a big romantic star to go see an actress in her late 30s, as attractive as Miss Jones, especially when she was several years older. than his main actor. There were a number of beautiful and young British actresses in Hollywood at that time, such as Audrey Hepburn, Elizabeth Taylor, Jean Simmons and Joan Collins, all of whom could have been more convincing in the role, but Miss Jones had an important attribute that they were missing, namely a marriage certificate bearing the name of David O. Selznick. In this case, the film turned out to be such a turkey that they were probably thankful not to have it on their resume. <br /> <br /> The film tells at length the story of the romance between Frederick, an American volunteer serving in the Italian army as an ambulance driver and Catherine, a nurse of the British Red Cross. After the Italian defeat at the Battle of Caporetto, Frederick is wrongly accused of being a German spy and sentenced to death. (The film paints a very harsh picture of the Italian military justice, it seems that Italian courts martial have the power to pronounce the death sentence after a trial of thirty seconds without hearing any evidence and without allowing the accused to be legally represented or to speak for his defense). Frederic managed to escape and cross the border into neutral Switzerland accompanied by Catherine. <br /> <br /> Hemingway's novels have not always been a hit when they were filmed. Howard Hawks managed to make a good version of "To Have and Have Not", a film that is considerably better than the book he relies on, but that's because he largely ignored Hemingway's plot and turned the film into a remake of "Casablanca", located in Martinique rather than French Morocco. As in the 1943 version of "For whom the bell tolls", "A farewell to arms" is too long and inevitably slow. It's also a bad idea. Jennifer Jones never gives life to Catherine. As for Rock Hudson, his supposed Christian name might be unfortunately appropriate. It could be as solid as a rock but as impassive as one, and in this film, his Frederick seems to be an imitation of the big stone face. Despite the passion and emotions inherent in Hemingway's plot, the emotional temperature is always too cold. The photo is of little interest, apart from some attractive views of Italian and Swiss landscapes on postcards. Not surprisingly, it was not a success and his failure ended Selznick's career as a producer. 4/10 <br /> <br /> A blunder. Shortly before the battle of Caporetto, an Italian officer declared that Russia had already concluded a separate peace with Germany. This battle began in October 1917, at a time when Kerensky's Russia was still fighting alongside the Allies. The Russian revolution took place only in November; it was only the "October Revolution" of the old Julian calendar. The new Bolshevik regime signed an armistice with Germany in December 1917, but a separate peace was not signed until the Brest-Litovsk Treaty of March 1918.
