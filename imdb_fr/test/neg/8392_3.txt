Paranoid Park talks about Alex, a 16-year-old skater who causes the death even accidentally of a security guard. As the movie progresses, Alex discusses small issues such as the divorce of his parents and the sexual heat of his girlfriend Jennifer (played by Taylor Momsen that you can see now in Gossip Girl) while he is consumed by guilt. So far, I've only seen one Gus Van Sant movie, Elephant, and I can assure you that he kept all his manners while doing that one. Once again, it crosses the limits of time. shots of people walking ... Maybe you like these shooting techniques, I know I do not like them. The plot does not seem satisfactory ... it's almost too simple to be explored for so long. The feeling I get (as with Elephant) is that Gus Van Sant is trying too hard to make an "artistic" film that makes him lose substance. In addition, Gabe Nevins was pretty bad as Alex. There is a difference between looking insane or detached and looking like a robot. If you are a fan of Mr.Van Sant, then look at it, otherwise skip it. <br /> <br /> 3/10
