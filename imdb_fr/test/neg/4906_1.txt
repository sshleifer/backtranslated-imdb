I respect Mike Hodges and love Get Carter very much for his dark outlook, but The Croupier seems to be a particularly dull drama for ITV. <br /> <br /> The game reserved, cold, is not only the prerogative of the main character. this extends to the entire cast, which means that there is nothing that contrasts with Owen's character. <br /> <br /> None of the characters evokes the slightest feeling, apart from boredom. The end of the film is also at best messy. <br /> <br /> The work of the camera, etc., is pretty good, but if you want to see Hodges' best watch, get Carter, do not bother with this uninteresting and unimaginative trawl. emotions he was covering better 20 years ago
