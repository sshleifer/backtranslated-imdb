I had the North American premiere of this at the Chicago International Film Festival. I was more than disappointed. Because of the atmosphere in the audience, I was not the only one. <br /> <br /> The film takes a long time to reach the conflict, then refuses to solve it, choosing instead to tell us the story "To be followed". Is it a spoiler to reveal that a film has no end? I consider it more of a warning. At best, it's only half of a movie and not the good half.
