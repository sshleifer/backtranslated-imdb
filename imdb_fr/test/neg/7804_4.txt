Anupam Kher is an excellent actor. He started at 28 years old at SARAANSH, at 28 years old. <br /> <br /> He now turns director with OJJ <br /> <br /> The film has a good but regressive scenario <br /> The theme is dead and the character of Urmila has looking too good while the pieces of Anil-Mahima and Abhi- Tara are too sudden then forgotten <br /> <br /> The film moves with turtle and starts to drag but there are several good scenes like all the conflict between Anil-Fardeen and Abhishek where Fardeen says to sell the house <br /> <br /> Abhishek gets caught for a crime and Anil shouting at him <br /> <br /> The highlight is too much long <br /> <br /> Anupam director shows potential, but still has some way to go Music goes well <br /> <br /> Anil Kapoor excels in her game, as always in Fardeen Abhishek's attempts is excellent, it was a turning point, people realized that he could act Urmila does not matter Mahima and Tara are lost Waheeda is good
