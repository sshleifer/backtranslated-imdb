I have already been a big fan of Olsen. I received this film when I was six and watched it almost continuously until the age of nine. Then he stayed on my shelves taking dust until yesterday. I was speechless. <br /> <br /> Mary-Kate and Ashley play Allie and Mel, two 12-year-olds who are sent to spend their spring break in Paris with their grandfather ambassador. Along the way, they meet, as expected, two cute French boys who show them the most fun side of Paris. I guess the two boys were fine, the false French accents aside. <br /> <br /> The plot is predictable and the humor shallow and cheesy. Mary-Kate and Ashley play two shallow girls with too much makeup. <br /> <br /> Do not watch this movie if you do not like Olsen twins or movies for the family.
