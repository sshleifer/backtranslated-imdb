Beethovan Lives Upstairs is a very bad movie. In my world history class, our teacher made us watch this film and Amadeus to compare the two composers or something. We first watched Amadeus and it was a very good movie, but when she made us watch this movie right after, I could not believe what I was seeing. The acting was horrible, the costumes were ugly (those of the little boy were particularly ugly and the girls) and the cinematography was quality z. My friend compared it to a family film without date display in the lower right corner. I understand it was a T.V. movie from Canada and it was probably $ 10, but if it had been otherwise, they could have done better. I've already seen some good movies on T.V. in my day, but it was not one of them. The biggest thing I do not understand is why my world history class can not watch Immortal Beloved or something of the sort. How is it possible to compare composers with the film Amadeus for Mozart and Beethovan Lives Upstairs for Beethovan? It is not possible to do it when it is the choice of the film for Beethovan. I give Amadeus an A- (9 out of 10) if anyone cares to know it, but Beethovan Lives Upstairs gets an F (1 of 10).
