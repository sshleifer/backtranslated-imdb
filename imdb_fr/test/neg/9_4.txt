David Bryce's comments nearby are exceptionally well written and informative, as most of my feelings about DARLING LILI say. This gigantic musical is so special and too blown, too produced and must have caused breaks at Paramount in 1970. It cost $ 22 million! It's just irresponsible. DARLING LILI must have been cleansed by a board meeting that said, "Hey, we got this guy from Pink Panther and that Sound Of Music girl ... let's take that too" and we gave a check in white. The result is a hybrid of GIGI, ZEPPELIN, HALF A SIXPENCE, song and dance numbers of the MGM 40 and a style (daisies and boaters!) So hopelessly out of date to look like a musical porridge, and the drama MATA HARI. The production is colossal, lush, breathtaking, but the rest: the ridiculous romance, Julie looking confused, Hudson already dead, the mysterious comedy and the surprisingly boring songs make this spectacular film irritating. LILI is like a mega musical from the 1940s with some vulgar strands to spice it up. STAR! released the previous year sadly planted and is finally finally appreciated for the great movie is truly ... and Andrews looks sublime, mature, especially in the last half hour ...... but LILI is POPPINS and Dolly Frilly and I really believe killed the mega music frenzy of the '60s ..... and made Andrews look like Poppins again ... which I believe was not Edwards' intention. Together, Paramount had to faint: with an additional $ 20 million in CATCH 22, $ 12 million in a crystal clear day and $ 25 million in PAINT YOUR WAGON ..., they had a financial abyss with CLEOPATRA proportions. $ 77 million related to 4 films with very uncertain futures. Maybe they should have asked Daisy Gamble to see ON A CLEAR DAY ...... LILI was very popular right out of Australia and filmed in 70mm for months, but failed once in the submarines and sticks and that's just never. surfaced after a night with ON A CLEAR DAY as a double Sunday night. Thank God, Paramount had his $ 1 million film, LOVE STORY, and the $ 4 million gangster movie, THE GODFATHER, ready to collect all $ 77 million from the next two years. years ... for only $ 5 million. ... unbelievable!
