I was a little too old for this show I was 6 when he came out. First of all, when I was a toddler, there were some children's shows that were taking place in Sesame Street that I watched and learned from, but other than that, there was not much something else. My cousins ​​are all born a few years after me. Seven years were the first. Barney was a very big part of what they were watching. When I saw this show for the first time, I told my grandmother how he teaches nothing, he just uses magic to fix everything. I was 9 years old at the time, how many 9 years have an idea of ​​what is really going on with a TV show. More and more as I saw or heard what Barney's teachings were, more and more I was telling people how bad the show was. What's funny is my parents who had a young child from the middle to the late 80s, which was me elsewhere. They agreed and said the same thing as me. What is sad about it is that my cousins, who are 13 and over, always agree with what they saw. It's not cheating on creativity, it's not fair to think differently about what someone tells you. Its o.k to fly if the person is not going to know or mind he's gone. Let's be honest with ourselves, Barney wants to make money and teach nothing to kids. The brighter the program, the more likely children are to watch it. Children are stupid, not because they are not educated, but they do not know it better. Then Barney presented a show and the parents bought it. I never thought that TV could affect people like Barney. If you have a kid read a program that teaches them the numbers, do not let them get involved in this show. Barney is like smoking once, it's too much, smoking a few and letting your kid hang watching this show, he's addicted and one day his kids are going to look the same shit and buy the same shit you bought
