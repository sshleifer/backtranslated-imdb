He's playing SHOWTIME right now, but he'll be released as a movie called THREE or released in 2006. Edge pins include a supposed naked body coming out of the waves with his ass. You can have fun finding others. It was a decent video failed, hungry, cold, crazy, but that's about it. And of course that would be a film without sex. The lady has a beautiful body and the men are pretty, but the story is the same as Swept Away or A Savage is Loose with blood. I wonder if the movie studios know that they've had a big bang and have already released this show and they will now release it as THREE. Billy Zane should have worn a lock of hair or shaved his head completely. Juan Di Pace is awesome and there are some good sex scenes. There is a voodoo woman who likes the character Di Pace plays and in real life she is also called Di Pace. Not aware of any link, but probably parent or married.
