OK, no one will confuse this with Citizen Kane, but you must love a movie where women are always topless. There are also some cat fights and some pervert sex. On the other hand, I hope they did not pay too much for the guy who wrote the dialogue. Here is an excellent example. After the death of one of the captive girls: <br /> <br /> "It's terrible, it reminds me of the day of Zenobia's death" "A relative?" "No, my favorite cow." I guess they saved some money on the script and messed it up with great special effects like this plastic crocodile. I will say that it took me three sessions to get through this beautiful work of art, never a good sign. I guess that's what happens after a time when everything is alike. I hope the people who were waiting to rent it did not get too impatient. Do not worry people, it's on the way.
