Comebacks is a parody of inspiring sports movies, and let me tell you it's not a good one. Tom Brady (the director) probably found it hilarious that referencing sports movies (Gridiron Gang, Invincible and even Miracle! At The Longest Yard and Dodgeball-yes Dodgeball!) And throwing sexual jokes would be the most funny since. Plane! Well, he was wrong. They did such a superficial job, you thought it had been written in a week. I found that if a director likes the genre, the film will be good. Obviously, Brady does not like the kind he imitates. This film is a rancid trash that is not worth watching, so do not see it!
