As I ponder Poison for the fairies, I realize that I may not be right with the movie. My rating of 3/10 is perhaps more related to my disappointment with the film than its real quality or its entertainment value. Based on the description of the plot, reviews on IMDb and the rating of 7.6 on IMDb, I'm sure I came across a little-known gem. Unfortunately, it did not help me much. For some reason, Poison for the Fairies almost put me to sleep. <br /> <br /> Poison for the Fairies tells the story of two girls in 1965 in Mexico City. One of the girls, Veronica, is a compulsive liar and tells her friend that she, Veronica, is a witch. The other girl, Flavia, is so credulous that she believes in it and is frightened by everything her friend tells her. It's really about it. In reality, nothing happens and the film drags on while Veronica tries to terrorize and dominate Flavia. One speaker on IMDb described it as "the scariest film in Mexican cinema of the 80s". My comment ?? If so, there were not many horror films shot in Mexico in the 1980s. Another contributor wrote, "Look if you want to be scared." My comment ?? are you sure we're talking about the same movie? My opinion is diametrically opposed to these examples I gave. For me it was dull, uninspired and badly played. The framing of the scene is particularly annoying because the director Carlos Enrique Taboada never shows the faces of the other characters. Veronica and Flavia have long conversations with family members and their teachers, but we never see the faces of these people. It's a boring gadget.
