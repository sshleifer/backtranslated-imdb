Oh dear! Oh dear! Oh my God! <br /> <br /> Saying that movies like this one have been shot and have probably been enjoyed by thousands of people driving cine-in really amazes the mind. As we were innocent at that time. <br /> <br /> To put it bluntly, this film is shit. The hero is so wet that you can hear his wet steps in every scene. My Lord, but he is only one of the many and terrible actors who appear in this turkey. No wonder MST3K chose it. The story, as it is, is centered on a stock-car driver (who is so incompetent, it's really the actor who drives the car) that he abandons and "settles with the bad public Oooooh! Scary things. However, the bad crowd turns out to be the biker equivalent of the Three Stooges and their biker chick bitch. To illustrate how lame all this is, the writers have obviously set their minds on a scary name for the biker gang - if four people can be called gangs, that's it. The result? The gang is called the Angels of Satan! I'm not mistaken. <br /> <br /> Such acting and dialogue, as well as ridiculous scenes, make it a fantastic movie about beer and fries. But otherwise, it's the worst kind of waste. <br /> <br /> As I said. Once, it may have been considered good. But today, it makes you laugh (and cringe) every minute that passes. Avoid it except for good laughs. And make sure you're half drunk!
