this film is a pile of rubbish, and to try to base it, the first is just a joke, the main thing that let me down was the use of the linings of the first film, which had already been said by classic actors such as Sam Elliot can not in any way be reproduced, I mean when Dalton's phones entered the 1st, and he ends the conversation with staying cool, it was great, but when the bell rings, agent DEA goes home and ends the conversation with cool stay he does not have the same ring now the fact really, there are others but I can not be bothered to post them but I hope you'll understand what I mean, they should name this aspiring roadhouse ....... ...
