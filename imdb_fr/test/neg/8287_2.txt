A star from the high school track falls dead after winning a race; shortly thereafter, her older sister (Patch Mackenzie) returns home in time to find that all of her sister's athletic team members are disappearing. Who could be the killer? You may not care enough to want to find out. <br /> <br /> A cheap, cheap, cheap amateur slasher is almost worthless, although Christopher George (a nasty and bold track coach) is trying to give him a lift with an intense performance. Not even the gore deserves to be mentioned. Everything is lame from beginning to end, starting with opening the film on a track meeting montage on disco music and by the casting of EJ Peaker, once co-starring in the movie "Hello, Dolly" as that character named "Blondie"! That's right, "Blondie". It may mean that we are not supposed to take the film seriously, but in any case it is a disaster. <br /> <br /> This is the kind of routine junk that makes the films of "Friday the 13th" look like works Comparison of art. <br /> <br /> The only point of interest is perhaps the desire to see Vann White, his first film, among all people. <br /> <br /> 2/10
