I hope this is not an omen of things to come. HD camcorders are getting cheaper (although I do not swear this is what was used here), so this is the open season for all fans of Scorseses and Tarantinos. to call it a "film" would hurt the industry. The photography is of a level you expect on a family outing to the zoo. I could build a new house with all the wooden actors. What is remarkable is that no one stands out as the worst. They are all equally terrible. Like a whole group of Ben Afflecks. Or Steven Seagals. <br /> <br /> What hooked me is the title. I'm stupid for that kind of thing, like Frankenhooker or Monsturd. Frankenhooker was very bad too, but at least I had a few bursts of laughter and the acting was just bad, not horrible. I can not comment on Monsturd because I have not found a copy yet. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I hope that the authors of this project did not benefit from it. If not, they might be encouraged to try it again. Please, guys, put the camcorder as a pledge and go back to your usual work.
