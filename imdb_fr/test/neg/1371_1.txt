I'm sorry but this guy is not funny. I swear I heard 4-year-olds make better jokes than some of them. "Dee dee dee", for example, is perhaps the worst slogan I've ever heard. This lack of creativity, and making fun of people with intellectual disabilities when you have reached the level of your own show is incredibly stupid on the part of Mencia. <br /> <br /> Although everyone is compared to this idiot for Chappelle, there is no dispute. First of all, they had very different shows. I think that on the whole, Menica's show had on average only 2 short 5 minute skits between her 10 minutes of god who knows what. The Chappelles show was rather a comedy of sketches, with 2-4 skits that occupied the whole show. All that Chappelle does is a brief summary of each skit before and after each. This is where Mencia fails even more. What would Mencia think of having a series that consists of the same stand-up comedy that he talks about in his stand-up specials would be a beneficial idea? Does anyone really want to listen to a little George Lopez was a pioneer years before Mencia, but just dragged beyond belief to the point where he died? The chance of snowflake in hell. <br /> <br /> My point is that even though most people hate this guy for his racism, I just can not stand it for his incompetence. Comedy Central was looking for a minority they could call "controversial" and then let him follow Chappelles' path. The problem is that this guy made it clear that he did not want to be Chappelle. So, instead, he's running his crappy show like a train wreck burning in the ground. Does anyone want to watch a weekly debate on the same content every Thursday, I know I will not do it. <br /> <br /> I can not, however, express my gratitude to Comedy Central. This idiot's show is over. Personally, after watching his stand-up, I do not know how he got his own show in the first place. There are so many more deserving comics like Jim Gafigan, Zach Galifinakis, etc. In fact, everyone is better than this idiot.
