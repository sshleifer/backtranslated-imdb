Too bad, Mike Meyers chose him for his dramatic debut. This film seems to have been edited by a committee that could not decide whether it was a comedy, a drama, a suspense or science fiction. It all begins with being playful, then darkens quickly, and then, in the end, apparently shortly after the death of one of the main characters, the whole family is in the yard laughing at something. It's totally strange and impossible to tie. The acting is extremely uneven, with older professionals grabbing your attention, then younger and less experienced actors who look like a high school play. This film showed me that it is probably harder to make a good movie than what comes out of the truly professional price we see in first-class homes and art houses. It would be a good movie for a movie class to analyze. Terrain, character, theme, coherence - they are all defective or absent from this film.
