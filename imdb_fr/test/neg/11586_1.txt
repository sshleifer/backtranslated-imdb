I just saw this on Showtime ... ewwwwwww, not even fun in a bad movie. One of the most gloomy movies I've ever seen. Plus, the TV reporter in the movie was that annoying Jerri from a past season of Survivor. The only funny thing was that the "secret base" was the home of Fantasy Island (and a million other movies and TV shows, the place is in the L.A. Zone). I really expected Mr Roarke and Tattoo to greet visitors. If Tattoo had been eaten by the snake, I might have given this movie a 2, but hey. Watching people stand there and scream for five minutes while the Komodo or Cobra dominated them instead of running, was pretty funny, especially because you could really say they were screaming just at an empty spot where computer animators would later paint in the monster. I almost fell off my chair, however, during a flashback scene, they brought the cobra or komodo - of normal size - into an indestructible solid steel container with pierced air holes. Would not a metal cage have been enough? LOL! I guess they could not afford to rent a real komodo and a cobra. I have to remember that I rent Showtime for their series and not for their movies.
