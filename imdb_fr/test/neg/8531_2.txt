At least we must recognize that the big horror Hollywood producers are finally becoming smarter and more insightful. Instead of waiting patiently to buy the rights of Asian horror movies and then remake them in the United States, they discovered that they could simply engage Asian filmmakers and charge them to create their all-new ghost story. directly to the United States. It's like killing two birds with a stone; way to go guys! "The messengers" is almost identical to all the other supernatural coolers that have come out of the eastern countries since "Ringu". Translated approximately, this means that it is a boring film, excessively long and completely without gore, but it contains a lot of false alarms and an embarrassing weakness: "did we scare you?" moments. The Pang Brothers (Danny & Oxide) have already created the film "The Eye", extremely overestimated, and it is a tradition for them to build a story with hints and hints to a point where it becomes almost impossible to meet the expectations of their curious. public, but they do not seem keen to change their formula any time soon. And they are also unscrupulous enough to recycle the same old and repetitive ghost subjects over and over again. Worried spirits of the previous inhabitants trapped in the walls of an isolated country farm? The family of protagonists torn by untreated traumas of the past, must first restore trust and mutual trust? Leave me alone! Throw a videotape and a seven-day spell, why not you? Even attempts to blow you up in your seat are too much already seen and will not scare anyone over 7 years old. Slamming doors, filthy dirt and bigger and bigger on the walls, ghostly appearances, noises from the cellar .. The infinite abuse of cheap tricks like this one becomes almost insulting to horror fans. "The Messengers" is about a family on their way to a new life in the countryside as sunflower growers. The family situation is somewhat dysfunctional because a personal tragedy (which will only be revealed later in the film) has caused their youngest son to stop talking and parents to beware of their revolted teenager. Shortly after, children experience a strange presence on an isolated farm, but they fail to convince their parents to leave. That's about the conclusion of the whole movie. Little Ben sees things but he can not speak and Jessica is attacked several times by supernatural forces but no one is listening. The basic premise of "The Messagers" is very much derived from Stanley Kubrick's immortal classic "The Shining", it lacks only the constantly threatening mood and the disturbing tone. The scenario is far too serious, even though it is easy enough to predict the final outcome and the total absence of violence and bloodshed is unforgivable. At least "The Eye" delivered real shocks in the end, while the happy ending of the joy and joy of "The Messengers" is only pathetic. The only positive things I can think of are the beautiful rural filming locations, the right editing and the promising young talent (and beauty) Kristen Stewart. And there is a strange but unfortunately underdeveloped supporting role for William B. Davis.
