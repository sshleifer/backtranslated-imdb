Cave Dwellers, or The Blade Mater, or whatever its name, is in a word: VILE! I saw this on MST and I laughed not only the excellent commentary in progress, but also the inept realization of the film that has been demonstrated. Sunglasses, tire tracks and where did Ator buy a glider? Then they raise some pictures of another film, Where Eagles Dare, as Tom Servo points out. To show how cheap this movie is, look at the scene where Ator and Thong have to fight against invisible swordsmen. Or better yet, look for the giant pipe disguised as a snake that Ator must fight! And what do these scenes in the credits have to do with the movie?
