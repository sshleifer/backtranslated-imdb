I have neither read the book on which the film is based, nor the letters between Vita and Violet. If I was waiting for this movie with any expectation, it might be that the Bloomsbury group (including Virginia Woolf, of which the Nicolson were a part) would be described. This was not the case, which was not a problem for me. What I wonder is how the people behind this movie have managed to make it, in my opinion, so uninteresting and repetitive, and most of the characters flat, despite the matter and very good actors. The script is just not good enough. I agree with the critics of my Finnish neighbor - too many unnecessary sex scenes (but only between women, while there is nothing explicit about Harold's many love stories), too much unnecessary scenes in general, too little information on the background of the characters. It seems strange considering the quality of the production - at first glance, it seems like a really ambitious job, but the scenario is of course the most important and that is where the film fails. <br /> <br /> Vita's relationship with Harold seemed unconvincing to me, although both of them act very well, especially her. The way they continued to declare their unconditional love for each other in a rather sap-like way, I thought, well, just not convincing. It is much more logical to think that it should have been done by letters, as the tmmvds points out, I would also have liked to know where the nicknames came from - the Russians * and Mar - why someone is called he Vita, nicknamed Mar? These may be small things, but it's important to contribute to a bigger picture. <br /> <br /> * I watched the movie with subtitles in English, and where he apparently should have said Mitya, he said rather Medea. This might explain to some extent my frustration with nicknames - I could not understand why Vita should be Greek while Violet was Russian!
