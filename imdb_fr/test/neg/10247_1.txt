This image first appeared on movie screens on June 6, 1980, starring Stephen Macht in the role of Sergeant Thor, Avery Schreiber in Captain Comelius Butt, JD Hinton as Buzz, and featuring the player of the year Dorothy Stratton. The photo begins with the infinite police space wandering in search of criminals, I suppose. This ship is suddenly attacked by an unknown spaceship. Between Sergeant Thor and his partner Buzz as they try to determine who owns the unknown ship. In case of failure, they call on Captain Comelius who asks his crew to defend himself. Enter the magnificent Dorothy Stratton, who plays the role of Galaxina, a robot created by man. Now have some thoughts on this picture. This movie was stupid plan and that's one of the reasons I do not get into science fiction. If you like science fiction, you'll notice that the laser sound effects were borrowed from one of the first science fiction movies, Battlestar Galactica, which aired in theaters in 1978. Most of the sounds The door that you hear in this film came from another 1966 science fiction film titled Star Trek. Now, for the reason I bought this film, Dorothy Stratton. She is beautiful in her one-piece suit. I think her talents were wasted in this picture and she should never have been involved in such garbage. Connie Sellecca was also considered for the role and her talents would also have been wasted. In the single photo, I give this film 1 weasel star and Dorothy Stratton, I give him 10 weasel stars, even if it does not deserve to be put in a film like this.
