it is unfortunate that many other detractors of this film seem to be influenced by previous prejudices. (ie, anger at homosexual characters, thinking French thrillers are bad, etc.) I admit I do not know the novel, but as a movie, after about 45 minutes, I rolled eyes. I hope to be able to explain my complaints in writing with enough eloquence before I'm tired of spending more time on this film during the 2 hours of its duration (2 hours that seemed to be 3) do not get me wrong, I can sit for an hour. and a half of silent movies, epics of 3 hours, I do not have a short attention span, and I'm not so jaded by the MTV generation that I can not appreciate a subtle movie that is slowly building. here is my grocery shopping list. First, the end. yes, there was a scooby-doo-esquire, the character explains everything at the end. Now, I really think that for this film, it was necessary ... the film had so many twists, emotional revelations, new facts appearing and discovered ... a critic has said it well: "..yes, it's a very logical story, but without the very old story (their childhood stories, the relationship between the 3 parents, the relationship between the two lovebirds and the son of the Big Man), this does not seem fair to me. I felt cheated "I won" I could not quote too many revelations that I thought were useless, but according to critics, many people seem to really like that, so I do not want to give in to anything. Personally, I do not support serials. the complexity and the twists, for me, have stifled ANY impact of the final revelations that could possibly have. In the end, I did not care seriously! there were not necessarily gaping holes in the ground; it seems to be able to make a good book. In WRITING, it makes perfect sense, but if I'm supposed to believe that it's REALITY, something is wrong with randomly inserted pieces. Too often, I felt that crucial characters we had never known were introduced to further complicate the plot, increase emotion and develop the mystery. actor I have nothing to say about the realization, huh, not bad, but the plot, and especially its development, SEVERELY missing. sorry for those who felt it was a perfect thriller, but I could not get in there. I gave this 3 simply because I do not want to appear completely unfair and there have been moments of slight intrigue and excitement. <br /> <br /> * MAJOR SPOILER * and I have to mention it .. but when the father makes his revelation to alexander and JUST when you think the plot could not fit in another twist .. "your father did not 'die in a hunting accident' .. I almost died .. when was the father developed or even really mentioned a lot in the back story? !! are you serious!! as the already intricate plot involving characters from all families and their relationship to each other was not enough !!? Does the protagonist need another emotional whallop more than he has already been fed ?! sorry I had to throw such a spoiler, but it bothered me as much as I ever bothered in NO movie.
