Sensational. So my boyfriend and I went to the movie store to rent a movie. I love stupid horror movies, so I flipped through the variety of awful films they had to offer as he went in search of Michael Moore's "Sicko" movie. So I found the worst of them (as I would find out soon). It looked good on the cover and the description on the back seemed pretty decent. The fact that there was a quote from IMDb on this as proof was proof that it would be a bad thing. So the next night we put it in the DVD player and in the first five minutes we were extremely confused. <br /> <br /> The film is totally incoherent, with misplaced time jumps from the past to the future that let you ask for a big 'WTF?' The plot has no coherent story - other than the vague allusion to a local myth about a murder, but it actually only appears in the movie in the last twenty minutes. So, pretty much during the first hour, you have this: random and confusing time jumps; incoherent plot; parents who do not grow old bad game; bad dialogue; a boy who changes hair color magically; and a host of unpleasant characters to annoy you! <br /> <br /> The film moves so slowly that it's a chore to sit and watch. I would rather rub the toilet, honestly. Do not bother with that.
