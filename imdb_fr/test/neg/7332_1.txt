This guy is a real job. An immature boy, immature, in the body of an adult, carrying all the charisma of a rock, he goes to places that most people would only like to visit and do his best to be as miserable as possible. <br /> <br /> Give this job to someone else who really appreciates it. <br /> <br /> I could list an endless list of all the stupid things this guy does in his "episodes", even if I'm just going to point out the worst: Crete. While the locals organize picnics by the sea in his "honor", this clown has the gall to behave like a spoiled and spoiled child. He complains about everything, including the fashion sense of the people who live there. What an imbecile. <br /> <br /> When he went to Sweden, he spent at least five minutes pretending the disbelief of a group of leaders (who probably had better things to do than talking to a weak American, like at work) because they did not think that Abba was horrible. Wherever he went, he raised Abba. That's the kind of 13-year-old thing that is watching MTV too much. <br /> <br /> When he was in New Orleans, he was offended that some restaurants had tastier fries than his, so he "accidentally" spilled wine on them to ruin them . What a strange, emotionally unstable character. <br /> <br /> The worst of all of this is his awkward voice off, where he tries in vain to add a kind of perspective on a situation that he was too thick and ignorant to appreciate. He tries to use all these "big" words to look like an author, but he is in fact only a fictional pretense whose lack of consciousness convinced him that he had something to say. By the way, this is probably one of the positive aspects of this joker's TV show. This will show you, no matter how bad you are, as long as you take yourself seriously, the world will be too. <br /> <br /> Then there is the way he talks with local guides whose English is obviously only rudimentary. He will use the vocabulary of any writer - as he thinks himself - knows instinctively that he will probably not be understood by these people. Does he care? No. The little egoists like this Burundian clown do not use language to communicate; <br /> <br /> Mcg13jthm's opinion on this same page is a perfect example of the kind of mind that Bourdain draws - that of a low-IQ social maladjustment. Observe how the examiner tries to justify the sociopathic nature of Bourdain with simple and childish excuses that make little sense. "Bourdain can complain, but he's going through a lot of things and, not only that, he's been" forced "to do this show, but he's trying to redeem himself." A dolt attracts the dolts and reading Mcg13jthm's review should let you know perfectly if you're the type of person who would appreciate this totally useless and useless show. <br /> <br /> Finally, add a little "equity" to my diatribe, I admit that Bourdain would have been momentarily amusing if I had met him in a bar. But as a TV presenter on a tourism show whose goal is to show the viewer the beauty of other places and cultures, Bourdain is a dismal, abject, desperate, depressing and depressing failure. <br /> <br /> A failure.
