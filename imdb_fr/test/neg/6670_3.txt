As I write these lines, Norman Wisdom is a very confused old man who spends most of his waking days moaning and yapping old phrases in the place of his increasingly suicidal nurse. <br /> <br /> Indeed, by the time you are reading this, he will probably have reached the afterlife and the obituaries will record a hysterical hysterical career of nearly 80 years in the adorable funster in the twisted checkered cap . What most of these obituaries do not remember is that Norman Wisdom had already committed a form of suicide in the late 1960s with this wallpaper of incredible poverty yet strangely convincing for his film career. <br /> <br /> disturbing from the start ?? "Tony Tenser Presents" go the titles. Do you scratch your head ?? "Where have I ever seen this name ...?" Well, in the titles of many of the cheapest and naughty British movies of the 1970s, make your choice. <br /> <br /> Then, it is indicated ?? "A production of Menahem Golan". Oh my God. <br /> <br /> From what I understand, the following is a combination of Confessions of a holiday camp and the last Tango in Paris. Sponsored by the Southport Tourism Board. <br /> <br /> Norman Wisdom is very versatile in his role as Norman Wisdom (or a variation of it) here. Even in the trash like this one, he's never out of shape and keeps you from looking crooked, as he paws and dribbles all over Sally Geeson (clearly crazy). Tony Tenser and Menahem Golan were responsible for real cinematic horrors, but the scene of the bedroom of the film atrocity is reborn. Sally plays very well the role of a lobotomized sex toy. <br /> <br /> I wonder if the young crazy cats that populate the festival scenes of this movie can think of themselves in a quiet moment "Umm?" old Norman + sex + hippies. Get me out of this mess !! "I guess it was a payday for them. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry for The Pretty Things, they probably thought," Yeah! It will do for us what Blow Up has done for the Yardbirds "<br /> <br /> And Norman Norman's career has come to an end.Free his little balls in Southport. <br /> <br /> I went Once there, it was a depressing place.
