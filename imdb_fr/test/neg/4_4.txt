Alas, another Costner movie that lasted an hour too much. Credible performances, but the script had no place to go and was in no hurry to get there. First, we are offered a series of unrelated events, some of which are complementary to the story. Will the scenario focus on Randall and his wife? Randall and Fischer? What about Fischer and Thomas? In the end, no real story of forehead develops and the characters themselves are artificially supported by third-party monologues. The singer explains Randall, Randall explains Fischer again and again. Finally, long after you do not care, you'll learn something about scripting meetings. Three purposes were probably made and no one could make a decision. The final result? All three were used, one after the other, one after the other. If you can stay beyond the hundredth yawn, you can choose them. Despite the transparent attempt to earn points with a dedication to the Coast Guard, it should have failed from day one.
