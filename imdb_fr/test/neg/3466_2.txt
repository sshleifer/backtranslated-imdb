I thought this movie was going to be good. This was not the case, despite the main actors who won an Oscar. I may have laughed once and never heard anyone laugh at the theater. The make-up for Renee Zellweger's pancakes was very inappropriate. Everyone seems to be putting a lot of effort into this movie, imitating the awesome stick, but not succeeding. I think the film may have sounded well during the development, but something was lost in the translation. The crazy years were they really like that? I do not think so. Everything seems a little artificial. Randy Newman's score was annoying. The film is in sepia, like all other movies of the 20s or 30s. There is simply not much originality here.
