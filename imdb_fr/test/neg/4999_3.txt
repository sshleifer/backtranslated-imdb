Okay, I gave him a "3" just because they obviously did not have the money to make this film, but I think he might deserve the "2.3" rating he had when I arrived here. In fact, I help raise his rating, although I've been bored for an hour and a half. I'll save the "1" and the "2" for higher budget shit pieces. At least the makers of "Rise of the Undead" have not wasted so much money. They managed to lose 90 minutes of my life. <br /> <br /> The film is too claustrophobic for me. The entire film takes place in the same building, in dark rooms and corridors. In such a context, there should have been more action or development of the character, but there are only a lot of meaningless discussions. I did not get to know any of the characters. There is a schoolgirl and a gothic babe but we never find much more about them. None of the characters seems really nice. <br /> <br /> Awful film made with a zero budget. No scary special effects. No suspense. Really nothing interesting here, guys. I admit to downloading this from the net. It was free, but I throw it away. <br /> <br /> Sorry for the filmmakers. More luck next time. This one looks more like a soap opera than a zombie movie.
