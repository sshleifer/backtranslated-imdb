I'll give you this: I have not stopped looking, and it's not a business, which is pretty cool. But my inner critic cut it to pieces - I guess I see too many movies. Wooden script, the slang comes out of the mouth somehow without any kind of flow. The edition, already mentioned, is a coincidence. Sometimes, it evokes a good feeling of ghetto, but especially irritating - jerky and offbeat angles, and close-ups very slow. The actors were marginal, even though Letisha had her moments. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure why the public is supposed to care about Curtis. The staging does not help to make you love or even hate it; I just wanted him to shut up and get shot. I did not care about his helpless revenge when it was rolling. The completely predictable end is not credible at all. I do not know why we are supposed to believe that some of the reputable retailers he puts down are stupid enough to fall into the trap of the little scam. "Oh, you just got out of jail and are on probation, here are thousands of dollars worth of cocaine, go get her around the corner for me, now do not steal me, etc." <br /> <br /> A good early sex scene gave me hope, but it was abandoned in the end. The treatment of a rape scene raised slightly eyebrows, although slightly interesting. There are better films of this kind that do not insult your intelligence by trying to get some real realism from the ghetto while looking more like a movie school offer. 4/10, an F.
