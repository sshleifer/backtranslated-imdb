Mom starts the night in the middle of nowhere, in front of what looks like a wooden building in the desert. A van stops and an angry father pushes his slutty daughter Virginia Monroe (Claudia Christian) and leaves her there, but she is not alone in front of the dark silhouette of Nestor Duvalier (Brion James) who watches her near . Virginia tries to make the conversation, but as she crushes a cigarette under her leopard print, her high-heeled boots and high heels, Nestor, grab her by the throat and drag her into the darkness. Nestor then tears his top, turns into a monster and begins to eat his bowels. Virginia is the latest victim of a serial killer who has ripped off Lieutenant Carlo Hendrix (Art Evans) and the LAPD, or at least that's the message that a local TV reporter named Clay Dwyer (Mark Thomas MIller) transmits to its viewers. Clay lives happily with his pregnant girlfriend Alice (Mary Beth McDonough) and therefore her mother Emily (Jeanne Bates) has an available room that she decides to rent out with the pair of 'dark' sunglasses wearing 'Nestor'. Unfortunately for Emily, she accidentally hits Nestor's sunglasses, which reveals that he has strange, colorful eyes. Nestor then turns into a monster and bites Emily into a flesh-eating monster like him. Nestor takes Emily to train her, they find a homeless tramp for the homeless (Rory VanSaint), murder him and eat his guts but Emily's son, Clay, has witnessed all this and he has to choose between doing what is right and his love for his mother who now finds himself a grotesque monster blood-sucker and carnivore! <br /> <br /> Edited, written and directed by Patrick Rand I thought Mom was a pretty awful movie. Looking at some of the other comments on the IMDb list and the genre, it seems that many seem to think that Mom is a horror comedy. Well, I can tell you now that I have not seen anything comical about Mom, because there are none, unless they are very subtle. The only thing I can assume is that people see the comedy in Mom's current situation, that it's an old lady who turns into a flesh-eating monster and that the predictable problems and emotional anxiety that provokes for his son who discovers it. There are no jokes (besides naming a Beverly Hills prostitute (Stella Stevens)), a wacky humor or anything even a funny humor in the movie itself and, as far as I know it is totally played in 90 seconds. So, since there is no comedy at Mom, that means there is a lot of horror, is not it? False, mother sucks and is terribly slow to watch especially after the first thirty minutes of turning Nestor into a monster several times, nibbling Emily, showing him how to hunt for food and Clay discovers it. Until then, mom was moving at a pretty decent pace, had some makeup special effects and was interested me, unfortunately, Mom runs another hour, which is basically emotional shit suffered by Emily's son, the eventual breakup of her marriage and being torn between love for her mother and the fact that she is a flesh-eating monster. This part of the movie is incredibly slow, boring and dull like a dishwasher, though she has the guts to resort to a cliche role reversal scenario in which Clay asks her mother to go to her room and stay there by locking her behind her and put bars on her window so that she can not get out of her room. Mom's script completely ignores the origins of the monsters and we ask to simply accept that this thing exists without giving a single reason why we should, even if such a stupid explanation could have been, I think part of the story of the monster would have helped. Technically, mom is bland and not expensive, although I can not say that it's badly done, it's very average, without anything that particularly impresses, nor anything with which I could make fun of spending time. The special makeup effects on the monster are acceptable, but their use is very fast, flashes and you will miss them. Do not rely on a sophisticated video box illustration like me, the monster is only three times maximum and all these images are in the first thirty minutes. There is also not much coolness, a cut arm, a brief intestinal ingestion, a burnt body and a drill in someone's arm, that's all we have. The acting is ok, but please, Mr. Brion James, what is this risky accent ?! At least James had the good sense to know he was in shit and deliberately chose to get killed early in the process. All the others do not expect anything from the black lieutenant who was also a black policeman in Fright Night (1985), but you can recognize him from Die Hard 2 (1990), he created Mom & Die Hard 2 the same year ?! Talk about opposite ends of the spectrum! Overall, I really can not recommend mom as a horror movie and it's certainly not a comedy for me. Very mediocre, very disappointing and again, I am seduced by the sophisticated graphics of the video box with a lot of still images of cool monsters. Certainly one to avoid.
