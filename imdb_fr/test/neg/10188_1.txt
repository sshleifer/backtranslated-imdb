This film was a major bait. I rented it because of Rebecca St. James, a popular Christian singer. I met her and wondered what she would do in a movie about UFOs. Well ....... <br /> <br /> I think she played in this movie to help a friend or friend of a friend. My first clue that this movie was not what it was supposed to be was when I witnessed the special effects of encounters with UFOs. Nerdy! Over the course of the film, I noticed how the actors were plastic. It was funny as almost everyone in the movie wore solid colors. (There are some exceptions) <br /> <br /> Rebecca was disappointing. She is always found in the house and does not show the realistic facial expressions of the one whose husband has returned to the fold. Did she never leave the house? <br /> <br /> I had to turn off the film several times to finish it. I hope that Rebecca does not believe in the message of this film: believe in what we believe or suffer and go to hell. Jesus spread a message of love and hope. His message inspired others to change OUT OF LOVE, FEAR.
