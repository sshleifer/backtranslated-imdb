I did not like this movie. I rented it hoping it would look like the 10th kingdom. I was disappointed when I discovered that this was not the case. I also found it just annoying. The acting was bad, the characters incredible and the jumps of crazy time. I only recommend this film if you want to see a crazy guy run, but I'm sure there are better movies with the same thing. I can not believe I lost my time on this one.
