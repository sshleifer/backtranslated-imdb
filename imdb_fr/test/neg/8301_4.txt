Although I've watched this movie some time ago on Italian TV, I found it to be a surprisingly tolerable boiler, supported by an international cast of known faces (including a John Cotten confused like the baron) and another euro-sectarian sub-genre film, a plot instead of lethargic stimulation. <br /> <br /> The creature itself looks a little fishy and Cotten is a little too old to be taken seriously. A passionate scientist continues to create life forms from corpses (one would have thought he would have already built up an army and not struggle to perfect his technique) but Ms. Neri looks great in costume and trustworthy Herbert Fux is probably the best stalker / burglar.
