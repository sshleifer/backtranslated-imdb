Every time I go past this show on television, I absolutely and sincerely want to scratch my eyes and tear my ears. It's incredibly horrible. The jokes are not funny, the acting is completely horrible and the whole series is a major disappointment. I hate Charlotte Arnold's guts, and I just want to hit her in the face or stab her with a knife every time I hear her talking. She has no talent, low IQ, a lot of waste for society, and I think she would be of service to the world if she just shut the door and go away for a long time. Please, I say it with all my heart, NEVER WATCH AN EPISODE OF THIS SHOW !!!!!! It's not even worth 30 minutes of your life, and there are thousands of things to do, including killing yourself, that watch this show for half an hour.
