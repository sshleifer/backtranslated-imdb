Absolutely boring, quite predictable and ultimately simply laughable. That pretty much sums up the catastrophe, which is an indecent proposition. Starting from a decent principle, the whole thing unfolds and becomes a complete disorder. Basically, the story boils down to the following question: "Would you let your wife sleep with another man for a million dollars?" Here, of course, the answer is yes because otherwise we would not have a movie. Quite frankly, we would have been better if we had not had a movie. <br /> <br /> Our married (and financially troubled) couple is played by Woody Harrelson and Demi Moore. They go to Vegas to get rich. Yeah, it'll work. Anyway, a billionaire, played by Robert Redford, likes the wife and makes a million dollar offer. For one night with his wife, he will bring them financial security. The day after that night is what the movie really is. Unfortunately, nothing following these events is entertaining. The script is so predictable that you can tell lines of characters before they do it. The performances leave a lot to be desired. Harrelson would do better to stick to comedies, as this attempt at serious acting completely misses the mark. Anxiety is not something he seems able to describe. And it's safe to say that Demi Moore will never have to free space at her home for any Oscar. Why is she still a movie star? In a part that should be full of emotion, she does not transmit any. Only Redford escapes for the most part unscathed. He is both slender and suave and clearly the best player in the pack. But he can not save this movie. Frightful scenario, unhealthy game, frantic pace, no entertainment ... Indecent proposal is downright awful.
