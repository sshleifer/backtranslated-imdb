In the European television industry, movies like this are called "stickers". Television channels buy them and broadcast them because, when they wanted to buy Titanic's broadcast rights, for example, some blockbusters were not really part of the deal. <br /> <br /> 14 Hours is a story of the hospital, its employees and its patients facing the worst flood storm of all time. Unfortunately, almost every scene or every shot, it can be said that it was a low budget movie. <br /> <br /> Newborns are obviously not real, there is no basic action and the worst is probably the doctor who plays. The actors are not credible in their roles: their lines, when spoken, seem much too memorized, as if it were a camera reading test.
