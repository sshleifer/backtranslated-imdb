I almost liked all the characters in this series from the beginning, except Reba herself. She is more holy than you and frankly, a big Bully. And it stinks because she is in every scene and every episode. In recent seasons, Van also becomes improbable, as a parody of his old self. and Kyra walks sneering and miserable. The first 3 or 4 seasons are pretty good if you forget about Reba. Towards the end, it's pretty dark. In each episode, Barbara Jean is stupid, Reba is mean to her, but poor Ole Barbara Jean desperately wants Reba to like it, which allows Barabara to tell Reba how awesome she is. each episode. I think it's pretty clear that Reba has problems with self-esteem and wants to be seen as an indulgent saint. It's really too bad because, apart from her, the series had such potential.
