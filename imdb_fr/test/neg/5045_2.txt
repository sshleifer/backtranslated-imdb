You know this mouthwash advertisement where the guy has his mouth full of Listerine or anything else and he really tries hard not to spit it in the sink? It's an excellent metaphor for this film. I kept looking, although it was really difficult. But keeping the mouthwash in your mouth will leave you feeling mentally cool. This film left me a bad taste in the mouth. I should have spit it out when I had the opportunity. <br /> <br /> The premise is pretty old-fashioned to be fun. For the first time in nearly a thousand years, the Gargoyles returned to Romania and all the priests who knew how to fight and kill these things have long since died. It's up to Michael Par√© and other secret agents to get the light out before the Gargoyles go wild. Unfortunately, the premise is completely lost in poor dialogue and unenthusiastic behavior on the part of human actors. The best acting is done by CG Gargoyles. <br /> <br /> Finally, this film looks like a Van Helsing of a poor man. If you check your brain at the door, it could get you through a gloomy Monday. I gave it 3 out of 10 stars.
