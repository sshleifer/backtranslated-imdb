I gave this 2 a movie mainly because it has a decent cast but the movie itself is just (inserts unusually rude word starting with the sixth letter of the alphabet) -ing useless Its lowest vote was to three. <br /> <br /> A very predictable plot ... Two nare-do-well musicians have no money and a lot of money problems. However, when a friend leaves a bag filled with money (which belongs to drug traffickers), he spends it of course and "entertainment" begins. <br /> <br /> This is not an original idea in this whole film.
