One of the most pleasant surprises of this first 3-band Technicolor short was the name of Maria Gambarelli, a ballet dancer appearing here. I wondered if Blake Edwards named the character played by Elke Sommer in A Shot in the Dark after this now-forgotten performer (although the spelling of Sommer's last name is actually Gambrelli). I watched this video on YouTube mainly to witness Judy Garland's first appearance as we watched her in profile with her two older sisters singing "La Cucaracha". This is the highlight for me who has also shown nice dances (like Ms. Gambarelli's) and a lame comedy between Andy Devine as a great fighter (yeah, no!) And Buster Keaton as the owner of bull that provides one who is obviously a man in animal costume. The only fun part of these two is when they cry - with Buster supplying the handkerchief to "bull" - during the sad part of "La Cucaracha". Also lame was seeing Ted Healy without his accomplices taking care of a hangman who keeps taking Healy for other movie stars. (Healy himself did not know that Zeppo had left The Marx Brothers since he had put "Four" between "The" and "Marx"!) Speaking of a Marx, it was interesting to see Harpo without his wig then he wears a hat to hide his bald head. It was also interesting to see Ida Lupino among the cowgirls at first, although I also recognized Toby Wing for her role in Murder at the Vanities last year (at least when the advertiser Pete Smith identified her ). Oh, and Smith himself was not funny with his wise narration. Other famous stars that you can or do not recognize are also in the cameos and are not all players under contract M-G-M either! The Santa Barbara fiesta is worth a visit if you're curious about Judy Garland's early appearances or early use of the 3-band technicolor.
