Boasting quite good special effects from Rick Baker-esque and Deran Serafian in a small role, this lame Italian film deserves some recognition. Cerchi still has some merit in making gore films, whereas most other Italian directors (Ruggero Deodato, Sergio Martino, Lamberto Bava and Enzo G. Castellari) have turned to smaller TV films. As for plankton, it's half Piranha - half The Thing, with people turning into monsters, raping women and causing general chaos. The film is very difficult to appreciate because of its extremely disgusting, sordid and excessively sexed appearance. Only available in Italian print work floating around.
