I have not seen this movie for years, but the terrible "taste" of Quaid's performance still lingers on my tongue. Some commented how Quaid had Jerry Lee Lewis "thoroughly", but the fact is that he seems to have in mind only the most extreme step. Nobody does this all the time, and the performance proves hopelessly clownish, reducing Lewis to a fancy caricature. The shades of a man's life are lost in the rubble of a pure over-action. <br /> <br /> The author of the book on which he is based (Nick Tosches) is a good writer, who has written several beautiful musical bios. (I especially liked "Dino" about Dean Martin); in the books, Tosches gives us a human being in his own right, both separated and involved in "biz". Quaid's game seems to imply that Jerry never acted like a human being. If people were like that, no one would bother to meet them. When it comes to cartoons, it's a bit of fun, but it's one of the most flagrant and destructive performances I've had the honor to see. Terrible...
