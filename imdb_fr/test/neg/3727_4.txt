OK, if I was in the rental store and someone asked me if the movie was worth the three dollars of the rental, I should say no. The plot was implausible. I came to the conclusion that Keanu Reeves can not act. It can sometimes be painful to watch (although my wife finds it cute). Dan Aykroyd (who is generally great) was even a bit disappointing as a dishonest policeman. On the plus side, the plot (because it is exaggerated) is unpredictable. Cameron Diaz was good.
