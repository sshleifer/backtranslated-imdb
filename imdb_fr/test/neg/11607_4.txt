The big problem I had with this movie was that the character of Lombard was, as another user said, "unnecessarily cruel". Lombard plays the role of Ann Krausheimer Smith, who believes to be married to David Smith, well interpreted by Robert Montgomery, dressed sober yet disconcerted. The film has some fun moments, especially when Montgomery's character strives to find his wife. Naturally, she is annoyed by the fact that marriage is technically not legal, but she does not discover it until three years later. <br /> <br /> Lombard's character seems rather cold in the face of her husband's sincere attempts to court her. Although he is not very skilled in this effort, Montgomery is visibly in love, yet Lombard is as cool as an ice pillar. There is almost no clue suggesting any reconciliation between the warring couple for much of the film, and it's hard to see a kind of comedy - even a black comedy - in this respect. To a certain extent, the film suggests almost a sadistic nuance, with Lombard's character "kicking" her husband's weak efforts. Although we can consider this film as another type of film "The battle of the sexes", the reality is that it is a very unbalanced battle, if: the character of Montgomery, although certainly imperfect, is not flawed enough to make it a typical example of the chauvinistic / misogynist male (Michael Douglas in "The War of the Roses" is an excellent example). In fact, the character is largely effeminate, as revealed not only Montgomery's sharp dress (which probably owes largely to the actor himself, always dressed permanently), but also to his discomfort to attempt - but not to - play the role of a single The only major flaw is his vanity, but this fault does not offset the excessive cruelty of his partner. And nothing indicates that she is trying to instill a jealousy of subconscious love. That's what makes him so cruel and sad. Montgomery's character just looks weak. In reality, no woman would want such a weak man unless he "wears the pants" in the wedding. But again, a woman who wears pants in a wedding would never be so cruel as she has already asserted this role very early. Therefore, the whole theme seems strange. This film is neither a champion of feminism (the character of Lombard shows signs of the kind of independent woman of the 60s, but this idea is soon canceled and the character falls in the 1940s), nor a battle of the sexes ( because the Montgomery character is really a figure of masculinity and therefore a lost cause). <br /> <br /> This film is, on the surface, a burle, but under this varnish, it is really much darker, with sadistic nuances. Which gives its resolution a strange appearance. (Maybe this quirk was all the problem?). In any case, slapstick this movie is not.
