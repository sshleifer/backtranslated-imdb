What can be said of this independent effort beyond the fact that it was filmed with television cameras, and whether by vanity or by budget constraints does not facilitate the visualization of this variation of Romero on a theme. I was constantly reminded that I was looking at someone's school project, at best derivative, at worst cheap. <br /> <br /> Screenwriter / director Georg Koszulinski (who also appears in the film) does some interesting things with archive footage, but it says more about his editing style than about his style of filmmaking, which consists of closeups close to television cameras, which made me think that I was watching public access television instead of a real and honest movie. The story copies and pastes fragments from various sources, including the aforementioned Romero DEAD trilogy, THE ROAD WARRIOR (digging images of a "future" that looks like the past) and THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT. . <br /> <br /> This results in an hour zombie and nothing stalking and devouring humans. (Okay, the "humans" in this case are clones, but that does not change anything.It's the same menu.) <br /> <br /> The year is 2031, and the first group of people that were cloned nineteen years ago began to malfunction, especially in the field of food. Of course, when clones go bad, the first thing they appreciate is human flesh (or, in this case, cloned human flesh). It's not safe to be inside, it's not safe to be outside. It's only a matter of time before the carnivorous ghouls devour our heroes. Have you seen this before? <br /> <br /> I do not mind people gouging Romero, if it's done right, but no new territory is covered in this movie. This is the night of the undead meets the Blair Witch project, filmed with television cameras. What is particularly disappointing is that the jacket of the DVD gives the impression that the film was shot, at least, with a film 8 mm. It would not have been a problem for me if the story had not been so cheap. The film offers a dark vision of the future, in which technology has evolved to the point of making human cloning possible. Should we continue to clone our favorite movies?
