.... You get this stupid scam excuse at child's play! Man, what were they thinking? First, they play with a horror movie Rumpelstiltskin, then they do shit like that. Fariy Tale hate! Honestly, I saw this in my childhood, and it scared me a bit, just because I was under age, assuming Pinocchio would not do that, wah wah wah. But I grew up and I come to think of this: Child's Play, a fairy tale denigrating nonsense, and a lame episode of Tales From The Crypt, or trying to be one at least, with a lame end that was stupid, and a lot of conspiracy holes, and I still do not understand how he was born. Was it the job of a mean Geppetto? After what, after some evil acts, he becomes a real boy who becomes the most wanted of the United States? Personally, I think the concept of the evil Geppetto sounds better, he builds an army of wooden killers and starts a wave of crime, funny. But it's awful, awful, awful, awful, AWFUL! TERRIBLE! Stinky like a shoe, and terrible! He sucked He sucked! If you want killer puppets, choose the killer doll, especially Child's Play, without any conditions. Or if you want a spilled fairytale character, look at Leprechaun, or if you want Pinocchio, watch the animated version Disnet or the live version with Jonathan Taylor Thomas and Martin Landau. >>>>> -10/10 (negative 10)
