This film is so bad that they will not buy it back at my local used CD / DVD store. I only own it because it came in a box that I bought for the masterpiece "Deadfall". The store bought the other two movies that I was selling from the four-disc set, but they would not buy Underworld, and those two other movies were redefined, so what does that say about this movie? So I tried to sell it to another store, which had even bought budget DVDs that could be bought for a dollar in a local store, but they would not buy back Underworld either. This film is bad at all levels and is one of those that came out of the post-Tarantino-clone glut of the mid-90s. The only slightly refundable item is Dennis Leary telling Joe Montegna that he is a "friend." stinky "and calls him" Mister Stinky Friend ". This line is so deliciously horrible that I can not help but quote it at least once a week when I describe a stinky friend. But now that I've enlightened you with this quote, you do not have to worry about watching this movie anymore.
