This is an excellent example of an incredibly bad movie-b. There are worse movies than this one (Titanic for example), but that certainly shares the pile of steamy shit movies. OK, apparently, this was shot in Kansas City, which is why everyone is so lame. The main guy looks like Steve Guttenberg and is even lame! I did not even think it was possible! In fact, he and the main daughter of the movie are responsible for the WORST DRAMA EVER! It's not just because the acting was dramatic, but of course, the scenario was terrible, which combines a deadly blow into a dreadful and absolutely irreproachable drama. <br /> <br /> The scarecrow, lets talk about him. The hiss you hear every time he's around you is stupid, and obviously doubled. Now, his costume, I can not do without it, it's a guy who wears burlap bags and a stupid mask! I am simply stunned. Maybe if your 3 year old had brain damage, you would be afraid of it. <br /> <br /> One of the characters, the symbolic black guy, actually used the phrase "to have a chance to win my red wings" by talking about trying to score with one of the girls of his period. Wow, yes, that's the kind of dialogue you can hope for. <br /> <br /> In the beginning, when the lightly dressed girl runs through the corn, why is she tied up? I'm pretty sure it's not supposed to be obvious, just one of the many obvious mistakes made throughout this 'movie'. Another problem is the bad dubbing for the musical number (yes, that's right), it's all at the beach, and the dorkaziod takes the courage to sing a song and play guitar for everyone, and is so obviously dubbed his funny. Fortunately, the scarecrow answers all our prayers and throws a spear into the man's chest when he has finished singing. Overall, this kind of movie is pretty good. It's one of those movies that makes these people get killed by the killer. <br /> <br /> OK, there's a scene where the two guys bury one of their friends. in the sand, then get up, take out their penis and urinate the guy in the sand. Who do this? Really, imagine him, "Hey, let's bury Joe in the sand, then let's get up and take out our genitals, as if nothing had happened, and pee on him" In fact, it evokes homo-eroticism in this movie, what's that mess? A good part of the beginning of this film consists of the jocks that are held in their underwear in the locker room and the cornfield while they practice hazing. What is that? Traditionally, in movies and in real life, jocks make girls and nerds have none. It does not really make sense, because all the nerds think it's girls and sex, and apparently all sports people think about sports and rub shoulders in underwear, I do not understand. <br /> <br /> Let's go to sex. As someone who watched this movie with me said, "I have never been so disgusted with heterosexual sex in my life" and that's true. If you like crowbars or ugly breasts, this movie is for you. I swear, they found a girl with the smallest tits ever and who's going to do the nude scene ?? Then the ugly old nurse shows her bouncy balls a few times and, man, I just did not want to see that. <br /> <br /> Now, I have to talk about the continuity of the timeline of this movie, which is really weird. It starts in the day, then they all go to the cornfield, and in less than 2 minutes, it's dark, when they go away saying they go to the beach - it's day again , and apparently, they stay at the beach until evening, and until the next day. So basically, these events in the movie cover 4 days, with no characters needing sleep or anything, it's really weird. <br /> <br /> After the main murders that took place, the message "3 weeks later" is displayed. and apparently, none of these people really care to see their friends being brutally murdered! The survivors are literally champagne! And it was then that I realized that the budget did not go to the screenplay, neither the staging, nor the scenario, but the bottle of champagne that we had. <br /> <br /> The end. Stop reading now if you do not want the end to be spoiled, it's really nice. <br /> <br /> OK, then the end takes place in a church and the scarecrow puts his soul into the body of the diabetic child, then he fights with the Steve Guttenberg lookalike, then with a B version -movie of the emperor's power in Star Wars! I'm not kidding, it's so stupid! So, right in the middle of the fight, the soul of the scarecrow jumps into the guttenberg jr. man, and with the last testament he has himself, he impales himself on a cross in the church! It's awesome! Blood, but what's better is that the cross is obviously cardboard! You can see the bottom take off from the ground! Wow, have a good time watching.
