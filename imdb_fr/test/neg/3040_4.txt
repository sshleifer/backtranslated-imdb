The remake of Simon West's 1979 horror classic is a pathetic attempt to bring old-school thrills to a contemporary audience. Camilla Belle, star of the talented teenage girl, When a Stanger Calls fails to even spark a shocked, even surprised face. Bad attempts to frighten the audience range from fuzzy coats that look like people to creating tense music for a cat coming out of the shadows. The plot follows Jill Johnson (Belle), a teenage girl who has to pay a bill to her father via a babysitting service. She is invited to work for the night in a house by the river and think it is a very easy way to make money. But she knows little, a stranger is hiding in the house and constantly harass Johnson by phone. A pathetic excuse for a movie.
