A boring and talented American documentaryist learns of a legendary South African monster, the Half-Caste. Tradition has it that it is a half-human, half-leopard creature, the closest parallel being that of the werewolf of the European tradition. Rather than focusing on the creature, the film follows the meanders of the film crew. There is little action or suspense until late in the film. This problem is aggravated by many irritating characters generating an incalculable amount of even more irritating words. The basic premise is wasted because it is marginalized by the inexplicable concentration on the documentary team. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the director was influenced by the approach of The Blair Witch Project (1999) or The Last Broadcast (1998). Anyway, the movie fails at most levels. Avoid at all costs.
