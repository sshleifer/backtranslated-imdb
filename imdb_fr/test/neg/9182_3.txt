this caricature is not correct, lol. I totally disagree with a lot of things she was describing but she ended on a positive note, but as for me and mine, we will not see this in our home mainly because we fight every day against the stereotypes. A caricature simply confirms what most whites think blacks do like <br /> <br /> The comment one of the little black girls made about caricature was that her boyfriend was so conscious (he was white) that it really offended me Something we blacks take lightly is a state of being that blacks achieve when they realize their true ability.
