An old bat turns into a girl OK after drinking a potion. This movie was terrible. The atrocious act. The work of the camera made me turn my head. And it contains the longest and most painful striptease that has ever been filmed. Piero Vivarelli should be ashamed to lead this. Eduardo Manzanos Brochero should have been blacklisted just for writing something so horrible. Do not rent this movie, the only exception I can perhaps, maybe if you die and you have less than 90 minutes to live, watch this movie you will feel like it will last forever and that you will ask the Grip Reaper to come a little earlier. <br /> <br /> My note: F
