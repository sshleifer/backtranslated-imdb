The characters were as unoriginal as it hurts. The skinny little computer geek, the funny African American with stupid typing lines, a cool white guy with a compassion for cars and the handsome leader who ends up with the pretty girl. The actors are mediocre at best. Norton's Ecsept doing a really good job as a villain. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie is also stupid and a total waste of time. This is a group of spoiled boys who use the world as a playground, where each safe of a big house holds them with food on the table. I mean, why work for a living when you can steal people? <br /> <br /> AND, .. Who does the f * bother with the traffic lights in a big European city?!? And in the middle of the day FRIGGIN!? Think of all the damage and do not say the dead among innocent civilians. What about all ambulances and fire trucks? <br /> <br /> I did not create ANY compassion for the main characters and, in good weather, Mr. Wahlberg had his bloody gold or not, I could not do less.
