If you're not a fan of the 80s and you need to be a particularly strong fan, or one of the two main characters, nothing in the movie to recommend. <br /> <br /> The story, as others have said, is dull, almost after the fact to the basic notion of the characters and the idea of ​​making a slightly manic comedy. I watched it for about an hour, hoping that it would turn around, that there would be a twist or that it would go up a gear, but no ... It's not unassailable, it's just boring. It goes. It goes wild with crazy snippets, persistent kicks from strange angles, cries of madness, but I did not have a real feeling of energy or manic pleasure, it seemed forced to me. Needless to say, there was nothing to laugh at in particular. A little fun here or there, but nothing more. <br /> <br /> Do not be fooled by the mention of feminism, it simply means that, in this case, almost all the main actors are women. In fact, it's really disgusting ... Two women head, very good, excellent, the drug dealer is a woman, okay, their owner is a landlord, okay, their friends are women, d 'okay, the only other person we see especially who lives in the same building, oh, woman ... I was not on the lookout for that, but after a while, I got the impression that the It had been consciously decided that the film should be screened this way, and it was once again a little bit of a force and disgust. . <br /> <br /> On the plus side, if you're a fan of 80s fashion and culture, there's a lot to see and if you're a fan of Helen Slater, she's fun and enjoyable to watch. There is also screen time for Carol Kane, which is great, but not enough ... <br /> <br /> Overall: 3/10. If you're a big 1980s fan, Helen Slater and Carol Kane, maybe you could reduce it to 5 because of them, although it's still a comedy that's not not funny, but that hinders him considerably. If you are not a fan of these things, you might as well do it because there is nothing else to enjoy here.
