One wonders how FLYNN could have failed so badly during a movie release in 1997 with Guy Pearce in the lead role. It's not often that the casting of someone so famous is so accurate. FLYNN was a box office cheater and did not end up on Australian movie screens ... even after LA CONFIDENTIAL ...! From a dazzling nude scene in the first minutes (presumably from Guy Pearce), FLYNN takes a rather robust and interesting start. Unfortunately, FLYNN runs out of steam after about 35 minutes and with the entrance of Hammy Steven Berkoff in a detour through New Guinea (he seems to want to play the role of Klaus Kinski in FITZCARRALDO) and looks like a TV movie instead than a major biography of the cinema. Believe it or not, after about 70 minutes, it's boring and you're glad to see her again. But such promise! Pearce IS Flynn! But the film provoked a mutiny at the box office and unlike The Bounty, it sank without a trace.
