It's a truism that making a bad movie requires a lot of effort - this one is no exception. <br /> <br /> I am not a crazy lover, but of their surprisingly simplistic vision of the world and their ability to reduce everything that is black or white, as well as events (even fictitious in novels) are part of an agenda with little or no connection to any complexity, irritating to the extreme. <br /> <br /> Wilbur Smith describes descriptively but weaves complex stories that deserve more than what was delivered by this horrible mishmash of a film. <br /> <br /> Sad for those who will never read Smith. They will only have a decent portrait of his Egyptian series, whose exhibition is gigantic. <br /> <br /> Indiana Jones's movies were lively. In an attempt to replicate this by manipulating Smith's novels in this production, one kilometer of country is missing. <br /> <br /> Pathetic with the exception of photography and Art Malik.
