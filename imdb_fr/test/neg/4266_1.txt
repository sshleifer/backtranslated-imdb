The worst thing I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> The film is a pure basket. All things are bad about this movie. The staging, the script, the arts, the cinematography, the casting or something else. <br /> <br /> Can I say more? <br /> <br /> The main character is a boy. He must be about 20 years old, but the actor who plays the role seems to be 30 years old. In addition, he is a very bad actor. <br /> <br /> The montage tries to save him, but with that very bad equipment in his hands, they can not work miracles. <br /> <br /> As I said, the distribution is mediocre, the text is mediocre, it does not help the actors. <br /> <br /> I learned to "do not" make a movie.
