Do you think you've seen the worst film in the world? Think again. The person who designed the cover of this box should be accused of misleading advertising. The cover makes it a good thriller thriller horror. But no. What we have instead is NIGHTSCREAM. A film that makes a "sweeeoooowww !!" noise every time a credit flashes on the screen. The biggest name in the whole movie is probably Casper Van Dien, who barely has the role. <br /> <br /> I voted for this one only because I could not vote less. If I could vote something like a five-thousand dollar negative, believe me, I'd get it. So, for now, I'm going to give NIGHTSCREAM 1/2 * out of 5 just because it ends.
