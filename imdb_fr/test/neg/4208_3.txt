In terms of movie quality, it's not one of them. It's actually the first Chuck Norris movie I've seen and I've been pretty disappointed. The fight scenes are slow and not very varied. Norris simply uses many kicks on all the bad guys who follow him, which makes the fighting rather boring. The film is also quite short, but for some reason, the movie does not even seem finished when it ends. It's a nice anti-climatic end. Still, I watched a lot of bad movies and it's not the worst I've seen. It's worth watching, I guess especially for Norris fans. Nothing like seeing a group of platforms hitting the desert, which, in my opinion, was the highlight of the film.
