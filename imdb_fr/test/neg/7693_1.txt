This film, as the first film of the KSA, should be active for all and show the good thing about them. Otherwise, we see in this as the distribution of Rotana wanting to show religion people in Saudi Arabia as terrorists and stupid actually their no-they are very peaceful and intelligent. About the director is not worse. The grandfather in the film is very young that the father, everyone notes it. And girls who are not Saudi, by the way, show that our daughters are people who seek to satisfy their needs. Hasham was just another piece of furniture when he acted. He did not think of anything until he told his lover that I loved you and shouted at his friend. Do not talk to strange girls >>>>>>> really funny or really stupid <br /> <br /> The Father did not move and only watched this movie. He watched this film as an unknown actor and his only word was "A5zo Al Shai6an". The strange thing in this film is when the girls were installed in the restaurant in the role of the family, the voice behind the young man is talking to his friends "kiss me" many times >>>>> Is this arrived in Saudi Arabia when girls and boys grew up well and Muslim not bitches and adultery. All Saudis have a patriot in his heart will not allow to see this stupid movie
