'Uncle Buck', the big cabbage well played by John (eats a lot) Candy, visits the healthy members of his family for a week to keep two cute kids (Gaby Hoffman and MacCauley Culkin) and a pretty but posh teenager (Jean Louisa Kelly). The shenanigans begin when Buck prepares breakfast, then tries to sleep in a bed of two sizes too small for his airship. <br /> <br /> Generally dull, but riddled with two or three fun scenes, including Buck trying to talk on the phone with his angry girlfriend (Amy Madigan) and meeting a very disgusting clown. <br /> <br /> Candy seems to weigh 600 pounds.
