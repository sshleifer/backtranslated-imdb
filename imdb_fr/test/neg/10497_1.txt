Incredibly, "Vampire Assassin" is far worse than atrocities like "Tequila Body Shots" and "Zombie Nation" - and these movies are terrible. Screenwriter / director / star Ron Hall lacks both charisma and gaming ability, and is clearly incapable of the most basic director concepts. Perhaps the worst camera work I've ever seen in a film: editing, lighting, sound, visual effects, music, and combat choreography. It is rare for two shots to be cut together, and you can not see much in dim lighting. This terrible dialogue is spoken very slowly by an extremely talented cast, which extends the film to 87 minutes almost deadly. This is a really laughable embarrassment for everyone involved. Obviously, fans of terrible filmmakers will want to see it, but it is very difficult to sit, regardless of the level of experience of a bad movie viewer. The fact that Ron Hall thought it was really unreliable is staggering. If you're a filmmaker and you really think it's okay that the initial credits of your movie include some images of the words SLUG before the title appears, remaining from your rough montage, and you apparently can not gather the energy to edit these frames - your standards are obviously so low that they are insulting. I am surprised that Lions Gate / Maple has agreed to release this movie on DVD. Despite the brief appearance of Rudy Ray Moore, this film is a supreme self-indulgence work by Ron Hall - he clearly thinks he's a great actor and must also believe he has superior skills. so incredibly inept that it's hard to believe that he really wants people to see him, for fear of being brutally excoriated as I am doing now. A breathtaking film, incredibly terrible. I am not joking.
