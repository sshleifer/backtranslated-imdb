1st viewed on 09/02/2008, 4 out of 10 (Dir-J.S. Cardone): sexual political thriller that does not really succeed in any of these areas, except very early, where there are interesting scenes of soft-core. The film begins by portraying a couple exploring their sexual fantasies in their work environment or wherever they want. The couple goes on a trip to a retirement home and baths where he meets a woman willing to be part of a group of three and realizing some of their fantasies. At this point, we only know that this couple is well, but we do not know before their return that the fiance is part of a wealthy political family. The man hopes to have the opportunity to get a seat in Congress after the wedding. They then receive a package by mail from an anonymous source containing explicit pictures of their meeting at the bath and their qwest begins by indicating how and why they were filmed, who sent the package, what they want, and how to clear their names. before all this happens. This qwest becomes an obsession that draws them deeper into the most sown worlds and takes them a long time, to the point where their friends and family wonder what they do all day and why they seem in decline . This film is interesting at times, but it drifts into ridicule as it personally looks for the problem instead of bringing in the police very early because of its pride. This mistake, of course, advances the film. The performances are correct despite the unnamed cast, but the craziness of the situation prevails and the film begins to become overwhelming at about halfway through the course. And of course, they add a twist in the end that defies and challenges everything that has happened before (as is the norm these days when they do not know what to do to spice up the movie). It does not help this movie.
