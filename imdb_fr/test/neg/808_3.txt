As a South African living again in South Africa after a 32-year stay in the UK, I am sorry to say that this film is a huge disappointment. The three main problems I encountered in the film were: a) why Swank and Ejiofor - an American and a Nigerian - play the lead roles. This country is full of talent and does not need imports ... b) Gillian Slovo has been trading her Struggle credentials for years. She's a very mediocre writer and even her novel does not stand up to Mr. Hooper's flaccid direction ... and c) Hilary Swank, such a terrific actress, as Million Dollar Baby proves (but it's also Eastwood), here dressed in contemporary New York style wandering freely around the poverty of the Karoo. Where did the client and the director need consideration and sensitivity? Yes, the film is ultimately moving - how could it be otherwise? - but the general mood at the conclusion is one of tremendous disappointment. The heart is in the right place but needs a rhythm.
