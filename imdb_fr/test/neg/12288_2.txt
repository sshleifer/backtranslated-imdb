Okay, I had seen this movie when I was very small and the day we cleaned the closet, I saw it! I thought, "I do not know what this movie was like," so I started to move it forward and put it on. OH MY GOD !!!!! This movie is so bad! I never thought that this movie could ever be so close to my favorite movie, but I laughed, because all the jokes were so ridiculous and ridiculous, it's not funny !!! So many things in this movie were funny, because it was so stupid !!!! This film is far from good. I must say that if you want to watch this movie, it is better not to expect something big and if you have already seen, believe me, I also feel your pain!
