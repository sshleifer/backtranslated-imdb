Filmed in Arizona by a mostly foreign team, "Nightkill" is one of the most clumsy police dramas I've ever seen. Robert Mitchum (wearing a cowboy hat) follows Jaclyn Smith, a widow recently, hoping to find out if she had a role in the death of her husband. Jaclyn's wardrobe is of the Dale Evans variety and her dog is called "Cowboy" ... it seems like someone has really embraced the American myth that all Westerners speak and dress like descendants of John Wayne! The scenario of Joan Andre and John Case might have worked better if it had been approached as a parody; This mystery thriller just plays with director Ted Post asleep at the controls. Do not be drawn to the art of Jaclyn's video box screaming while you shower. She actually takes a shower in this film, but it is not revealing (she does not advance the dark plot of an iota any more). NO STARS of ****
