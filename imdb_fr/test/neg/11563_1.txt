This movie is really bad. Most of it seems to have been filmed either in a park or in a basement. There is a giant spider, but all we see is a leg. Some worms living in a cave are simply cheap puppets with cardboard teeth. And the plot is a bunch of post-apocalyptic mumbo jumbo that makes no sense. All is just laughable.
