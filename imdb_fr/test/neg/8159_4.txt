This film presents an FX sequence of a fairly decent 1936 earthquake. The reason you did not see it was because the audience of the 30's was enamored of "Jeanette MacDonald's photo;" in which the eponymous star made his way through innumerable songs, while the intrigues stopped completely. The FX cross very well time. MacDonald's songs do not, and the clumsy insertion of these songs to show his only typical talent is not good. <br /> <br /> The scathing device of two friends who grow up to become a priest and a thug is begged again through machines (Manhattan Melodrama, The Departed). After 30 minutes, you have already heard the song "San Francisco" three times. Entertainment in the thirties is usually an accumulation of irritation. Only the Grand Hotel of the decade renounces annoyance to the degree indicated in San Francisco, dinner at 8, Little Caesar, Stagecoach, All Quiet on the Western Front, Les Mis√©rables, etc.
