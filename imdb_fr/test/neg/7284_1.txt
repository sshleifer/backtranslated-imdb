The only reason this show did not get a 0 is because it's not available. This show has gone from informative information to sensational claprap. I tried to support this show in its decline, because I like stories of human interest and Primetime had very good stories. Unfortunately, April 21 forever changed my opinion about this program and the unethical news broadcasters that participate in it. ABC has in fact recorded a brutal case of child abuse and then refused to show it until the limitation period has expired and the parents can not be arrested on the charges they face. should have faced. What got worse was how ABC swept the whole incident under the carpet; instead of caring for and looking for real professional help for these troubled people, some pop psychologists have sent severe warnings to the public about how they should not judge these poor angels too harshly. I was really disgusted. I hope this review will prevent anyone from looking at this investigative bin in the future. If so, I will be happy. Nowadays, all you can expect from Diane Sawyer and the good people at Primetime Live are buttocks with celebrity celebrities and covert crime that celebrities praise. Do not lose the hour of your life; you'd better watch an old sitcom on Nick at Nite.
