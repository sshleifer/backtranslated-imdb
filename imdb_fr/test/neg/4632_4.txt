The history and experience of the last twenty years has shown us that intellectuals who talk about sex talk about the most neutral and least intellectual thing, but this was not so obvious in 1986. Basically, the idea of ​​this film is The insatiable characters in search of comfort, safety and pleasure in sexual acts are actually the unhealthy motive that makes them so unbearable for themselves - that they hide with more sex. This motivation is linked to the "decline of the American Empire", as expressed in an interview of the film. <br /> <br /> The idea, then, is that relatively hateful people talk about sex and that this speech is supposed to reveal how hateful they are as people. Arcand continues at least to give motivation and dynamism by doing interesting things with the camera, such as isolating most of the characters in unique frames, revealing their ultimate loneliness and cutting themselves off quickly, showing how much they are more at war against each other. agree. And to give credit to Arcand, it's about what intellectual life is, a constant struggle with other intellectuals to stand out, even if everyone knows that standing out means staying alone. <br /> <br /> But yes, the characters and the action is non-sexy and a little pathetic. I think this film is much more of an aspect of its time than something that must last, which makes it a little old fashioned. It is also the exact type of mental polishing in the dialogue, and references to people like Susan Sontag make house art movies so unpopular with populist entertainment buffs. All in all, I'm going to take it anyway - it has its place essentially among the exact type of characters that are the characters - it's just that it's not really interesting or important to anyone who is not these characters. <br /> - PolarisDiB
