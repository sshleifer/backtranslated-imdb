This horror movie starts quite promising and there was a moment when I said to myself "it's going to be really good". However, it gets rather boring rather fast at the end. The acting is pretty good, as is the place and the story starts pretty good too. The problem, not enough to kill on the screen and an end where the monster turns the tail and runs. I wanted to see more, especially after a very good sleeping bag scene where I thought the movie was starting and was going to become a winner. Unfortunately, after that, the film showed very little monster and the back of the DVD lied because he told me that the desert under the inhabitants was literally animated and that he was able to devour their flesh ... it would have been a film, almost unavoidable situation. It would have made viewers uncomfortable and may have increased tension, but that's what horror movies are supposed to do! Instead, we have very few shots of the creature or creatures, and when we see them, they are mostly on the defensive. Still, everything was not so bad, it just needed more horror, less hunting and more frenzy.
