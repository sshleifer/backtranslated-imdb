Before teaming with Oliver Hardy, one of the many silent comedies that Stan Laurel presented, "Mud and Sand" is a ho-hok hokum. The story is very confusing - though it may be because of modern editing - and the humor itself is not at all inventive. <br /> <br /> Potential intrigues are started and ignored; For example, Stan's promise to make Fillet de Sole pay for what she did to him never materializes. Stan's character does not seem very centered either, but it is a common criticism of his work before he develops "Stanley" of Laurel & Hardy's glory; <br /> I firmly believe that all silent films must be preserved and viewed, and I am happy that it is still available. It's just not a good movie.
