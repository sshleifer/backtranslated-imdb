It is very likely that "Cleopatra 2525" will be of little interest if you did not watch the series when it aired; and I do not think many people did it. But if you're still a little intrigued, it's a place called "Buck Rogers in the 25th century", without spacecraft and without budget for wardrobe or production design. <br /> <br /> In this case, Jennifer Sky plays the role of Buck Rogers (Cleopatra). What one would expect to be a good thing because Jennifer is very beautiful and talented enough; and has a nice comic touch. But a quick look at the promotional material will show that she is a little less fortunate for having a bad haircut and a Salvation Army savings store wardrobe. If you remember how much Jennifer had been looking for where she was during her time on "Xena", her depressed Cleopatra look will be a huge disappointment. With a target audience of "teenagers looking to burn their eyes while watching" hot girls fetish ", it's not a good idea to skimp on the exploitation value of your heroine or her suit. ask why some series do not do it, whether you like it or hate it, Buck Rogers had warmer costumes and much more beautiful stars. <br /> <br /> The other two elements of the are Cleopatra's two associates, Hel (essentially Gina Torres) playing her main character "Firefly") and Sarge (Victoria Pratt - another connection of "Xena" - an extremely wooden version of Natasha Henstridge). a good job in interpreting the character of Cleopatra, providing most of the comic relief of the show. <br /> <br /> Torres sings the theme song, a somewhat lame parody of "In the year 2525 (Exordium and Terminus) "(1969) by Rick Evans, you remember the one that's opens with the words "In the year 2525, If the man is still alive, if the woman can survive, they may find out ..." The series bears the title in order to be able to slaughter this catchy little song although, which know, maybe the title is a tribute to "Buck Rogers" and they thought about using the song later. <br /> <br /> Thus, the postulate of the emission is that the surface of the Earth has been invaded by extraterrestrials called Bailies (not that of the WKRP) and that humans have been driven underground. Our three heroines fight against the Bailies under the direction of a disembodied female voice (presumably) (aptly called "Voice"). Unlike Buck Rogers, Cleopatra is a kind of third stooge, still stunned and confused by her cryogenic sleep or perhaps simply disoriented by her scary haircut. There are many beautiful close-ups of Sky with wide-eyed and disconcerted eyes. Like "Buck Rogers", Cleopatra uses a 21st century common expression and everyone finds it either totally profound or completely confusing. <br /> <br /> Unlike "Firefly", the action is rather a hyper-edited junk of "Xena" which is neither realistic nor particularly amusing. A good thing is that the girls are moving in the "Spiderman" fashion, a kind of canvas sneaking through the tunnels and wells in the labyrinth of their underground world. <br /> <br /> Strangely (or perhaps without budget), these are half-hour episodes and, with the exception of a two-part show, the time lack for subtlety and nuance. <br /> <br /> Again, what do I know? I am only a child.
