Oh dear. it was perhaps the worst film I've seen in years. I mean, do more with the old scenario "woman in the body of man"? it was full of clich√©s, for example, the nerd entering his own sequence, the "boy" getting what would happen to him, etc. I do not call these spoilers because everyone can guess what's going on !! The only thing left to him was Laura Fraser, who gave an average performance. and as for the boy of "dream", it was the wettest action game of all time. even the bad guys were instantly forgotten. <br /> <br /> terrible movie.
