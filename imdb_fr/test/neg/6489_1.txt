the real plot ... <br /> <br /> A group of prostitutes from the post-civil war are looking for alternative housing in FORT BOOM. Lacy Everett and a close-knit family of call girls have been eating dated sausages for days and are planning to move to the former Fort McMillian. Residents warn women to eat more dated sausages. Because there is a vicious arsonist in the area and he refuses to transport them to the property. When they finally reach their destination, they discover that their stomachs are filled with gas after all the bad sausages. They are quick to understand why their new home is called FORT BOOM.
