No wonder many of us hate classical music; and what should children think? With "educative" public relations like this, serious music will soon pass vital support to the morgue. Children know when we talk to them, and this is no exception. why can not someone good do a movie about children's classical music? I must admit that I appreciated the role of the actor who played Beethoven. He approached this role with enthusiasm and balance between the poignant and humorous aspects of Beethoven's character. he obviously did his research. Otherwise, it is a third-rate enhancement of the old ABC Afterschool special format, without the occasional charm of these short films. Sorry for the joke, but it's an important topic for young people, and it could have been well done; I wonder if musicians or filmmakers were responsible? Anyway, the kids are more cute than you think ... <br /> <br /> Medtner
