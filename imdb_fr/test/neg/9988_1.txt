I am currently slogging in Gibbon's "The Fall and Decline of the Roman Empire", so I have everything in Roman's mind. I am not very far from it yet, maybe more than two hundred pages, but the number of these Roman emperors killed is astonishing. I believe I have read so far about fifteen emperors and only Antonius, Trajan and Hadrian have not been killed or at least suspected of having been killed. I was also fascinated by the crazy excesses of many of these princes of Rome. Caligula was not the least practicing. This brings me to see this movie again. I think of the film on a historical basis to the extent that I understand Gibbon's explanation of Rome, as well as other research from good websites and fiction novels about the period. <br /> <br /> My point is that I do not think this movie is what many of its followers think. I do not think that the depravity shown with the sex and the horrible violence of this film qualifies it as precise. The general ideas of the film seem right. Caligula is raised on an island, exiled with his family, and fears he will be assassinated by the more and more insane, strange and suspicious Emperor, Tiberius. He grows paranoid and frightened and can never shake the bittersome nickname that his guards give him, Little Boots, it helps him grow up feeling abused and helpless. After the death of Tiberius, the Senate entrusts the empire. He hopes that he will move away from the squadrons of informants who caused the fanciful death of the former delusional paranoid tyrant, and drive Rome away from the madness in which the dictator had installed him. Caligula begins as a decent emperor, but falls ill, almost dies, and returns from the feverish death of a real monster. His perversities with his sisters begin here, if not before. He killed Macro and many others who were his supporters in the beginning. The acts of madness seemed not to be as much about Caligula's murders as his new way of thinking about himself as a living God. He saw him talking to the statue of Jupiter as an equal condemned him. Anyway, his violent insane excesses would have failed him and three years seem to have been a good race for the successors of Tiberius. Well, the film stays true to these lines as long as it manages to be consistent, which is not common in its entirety, it does it while trying to shock the audience at every turn, in every single scene, the film disgusts you with depravity. from ancient Rome. This film is entirely built on shocking scenes and completely fails. It's too difficult to see successive leaders murder, rape, torture one man to another, for no other reason than fantasy. The representations of violence may be, but probably not, accurate. Murder was certainly the order of the day in Imperial Rome, torture was at the rendezvous. But the director's visions of these deaths and the bored fun of their protagonists, as the audience looks nonchalantly, I just do not see it collapsing exactly like that. The death machine, the stripper, is certainly something you've never seen in movies and you'll probably never forget once you've seen it, even if you'd like it. The wine drinking while the penis is in rope is the same, once you have seen this shame, it is yours forever. These things strike me the fantasies of the director and this porn magnate. They come from their sick imagination and have not proven themselves. <br /> <br /> The acting is pretty good. I actually think Mcdowell is the weakest link here. Mirren is always something to see and here, in her youth, she is wonderful and beautiful. The representations of Nerva and Tiberius are very well done by their respected actors. The film could have done so much better telling stories, it's such a failure that it's just another layer of what it was a pity. For example, he could have given an opinion as to why Caligula went mad, or that he was crazy, paranoid before his illness, and that the fever had broken the mental restraint he had before. It could have shown Claude's weakness and the miracle that he survived Caligula. He could have these things and many other things, but he stuck to his sad nightmares. <br /> <br /> Finally on sex. It's porn. This shows that these sexual acts are committed everywhere in the palaces by many people. Man on man, woman on woman, man on woman. It's sex without passion and disgusting. Sex that if you want to get over it, I very much doubt that you can do it. Both Tiberias and Caligula were perhaps addicted to sex and orgies were quite common, but the visions of this film seem more reminiscent of a Greek than a Roman era. I do not think that kind of acceptance of homosexuality or orgies in broad daylight was commonplace until the strange depraved reign of Elgabalus, and he was killed for it. <br /> <br /> This movie should probably never be watched, if you're curious about it, let it go. This is something, as I said earlier, if you look at this, you will unfortunately keep an unhealthy vision in your mind for many years. I do not think it's a specific historical picture in particular, even if it is historical in its entirety.
