This film tells the story of a depressed man strangely coerced by a distant relative who moves with him to his apartment in Istanbul. As time goes by, their relationship becomes more and more tense until he finally screams at the guest of his house, who is unemployed and does not seem in a hurry to find work. This is the essence of the film actually. The problem is that, although emotionally restricted and depressed people are VERY withdrawn and non-communicative, they are not a very satisfying film. This is because most of the time, he (and his roommate) look in a vacuum without saying anything. I think all those flat moments could have been shortened to make a 30 minute movie - that would not have bothered me.
