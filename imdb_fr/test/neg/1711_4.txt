While traveling with a miss squad for the Miss Galaxy Dispute, the plane piloted by Maximus Powers (Eric Roberts) and Mike Saunders (Charlie Schlatter) crashes into a secluded spot where Noah's Ark is protected by Jurassic pork. As the group struggles to survive, alien monkeys are plotting to use the ark to destroy the human race and dominate the planet Earth. <br /> <br /> I like parodies, but "Miss Castaway" is an offense for the human brain. The terrible story and the special effects are very, but really bad. There are parodies with "Lost", "Castaway", "Jurassic Park", "Sixth Sense", "Titanic", "Planet of the Apes", "The Adventurers of the Lost Ark", "Congo", " MIB "," Perfect Storm "," Austin Powers "," Jaws "," Mission Impossible "," Close Encounters of the Third Kind "," Star Wars "and" Hulk ", but the problem is that most of them are very stupid and not funny. In the end, the trailer is better than the movie. My vote is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Missão Quase Impossível" ("Mission almost impossible")
