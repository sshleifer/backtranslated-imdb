A film of modern fear? Yes, it's .. <br /> <br /> Hippies, pacifists and environmentalists came together to give us a film about fear .. I did not recognize it by looking at it there is only 2 years it was a film about fear, but that's exactly what it is. <br /> <br /> There is no difference between this movie and the movies that the Nazis made about us in ww2 and the same movies we made about them. It's pure propaganda that only concerns those who believe in extraterrestrials, 9/11 plots for conspiracy, false landings on the moon, oil spikes and great environmentalists if your scars penetrate in your homes, shut your doors and fill up for this nuclear winter, as we all know, happens when the bush will incite the Chinese to nuclear war.
