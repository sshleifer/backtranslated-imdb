I am very disappointed because I was expecting a real trip, as promised in the many reviews. The script is very bad with a lot of holes and the direction too. The director has completely failed to develop each violent scene with thrills and suspense. He tries very hard to follow a dream thriller. Therefore, I had to watch how each ball was spent without making sense to me. I always asked what kind of movie I was watching. Second, I did not like the fact that she smokes aggressively one cigarette after another, but the film may have benefited from the support of the tobacco industry. The end is also very disappointing. I do not understand how Jodie Foster could have been nominated for the Golden Globe in this worst role of her life. Jodie, so I really liked the panic room or the flight plan. It's certainly one of the worst I've ever seen. 4/10.
