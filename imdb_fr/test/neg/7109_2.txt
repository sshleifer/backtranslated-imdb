As a fan of Marlene Dietrich's films, I could not wait to see this "documentary". I also got myself reading a rave review after a laudatory critique of national criticism. That should have warned me. <br /> <br /> The film is simply boring and obviously extremely overestimated. You do not even see Dietrich. She is heard in the background, discussing her films and this video. She does almost nothing but complains about everything. What a drag! <br /> <br /> The filmmaker, Maximilian Schell, constantly complains and begs her to go to the camera ... all this in vain. She still refuses to cooperate. After a while, that kind of thing becomes really tiring. With his attitude, why would Schell pursue this project? He should have just told the prima donna to "push her". <br /> <br /> Regardless of what you read, do not waste your time with that.
