Being a big fan of street fighter and thoroughly enjoying the previous movie, Street Fighter II: the animated movie, I'm really looking forward to seeing this one! <br /> <br /> However, it seemed that the film had direction or purpose. Most of the characters I could not relate to and it simply lacked the intense action that made the street street movie as above so superior.
