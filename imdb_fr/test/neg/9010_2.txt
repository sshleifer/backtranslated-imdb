I accept that most of the 50s are not scary by today's standards, but what is that? When you see a title like this, you expect to see blood and a bloodthirsty beast. Instead, we do not receive any blood and a beast that wants to conquer the world or live in peace on Earth .... yes, that's what people wanted. <br /> <br /> The general story is satisfactory. the astronaut coming back to life and being one with the beast ... but the title really kills the film. Night of the Beast would have made the fans happier because there was really no blood to talk about. <br /> <br /> I like the way the movies of the 50s have purposes that leave room for a sequel but never wisely. . This movie is not the worst I've ever seen, but it's almost up. <br /> <br /> 2 of 10
