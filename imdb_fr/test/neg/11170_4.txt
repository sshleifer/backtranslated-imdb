Robert Aldrich's brutal and almost black comedy "The Grissom Gang" is a cover of the 1948 British film "No Orchids For Miss Blandish"; soon, this gang is dispatched and poor Kim is then transferred into the clutches of another dishonest group - gangster brothers of the third rank with sweaty and pasty face and a mother who looks like Buddy Ebsen slipping. At first, Darby (not very brave, and not very smart) tries to escape this slobbering brood, but it's on her. Finally, it is just trying, and that is where the problem of history lies. Are we in the public supposed to sympathize with her? Is his growing concern for the half-family spirit supposed to be heart-warming? They are disgusting characters and morons, and I wanted to see as little as possible. But as the side stories (the progress of the cops in the case and another involving Connie Stevens, the singer Floozy) are rather boring, the director has no choice but to continue to impose these faces sweaty. Soon, Darby, nervous, begins to sweat too, although his scene in the hayloft is carried out with sensitivity and that the highlights of Aldrich are thought provoking, even if they are disorganized. ** from ****
