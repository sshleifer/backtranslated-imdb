I felt I had to add a comment after seeing the gasping breath of the other comment. My unconscious parents took me to see this movie as a child. I was waiting for a normal comedy for Norman Wisdom. Instead, you get this tasteless British sex comedy of the worst kind where Norman (Norman!) Plays a swinger in order to go out with as many birds as possible. Absolutely typical of the genre - badly filmed and misinterpreted, not a semblance of a scenario beyond the worst kind of double meaning, and very vague allusions to "wickedness". And all apparently on this special grainy film stock that is reserved for low-budget British films from the 1960s-1970s. The only thing that is memorable is the enervating thematic theme that trots in my head after thirty years. <br /> <br /> Finally, in the last scene, you will also see Norman naked, running sand and the frozen air. I think that anyway, at that moment, my mother took me out of the cinema. I saw it many years later, and I guess it was still serious. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan or you are interested in the little man and his career, you will apply the '10 feet-bargepole rule' to that. Believe me, you do not need to see Norman Wisdom's back.
