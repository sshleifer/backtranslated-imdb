Having lived in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan (30 km from Escanaba) in the mid-1990s, I was eager to see this movie. It's a pretty promising start, with a superficial understanding of U.P.'s values ​​and quirks. life. But Jeff Daniels was apparently not content with a discreet approach that would have been appropriate given the location and the people. Instead, it introduces extremely raw humor and some mystical / supernatural elements that are extremely inappropriate. Although there is a good movie to do on this region virtually unknown to the United States, it is not that.
