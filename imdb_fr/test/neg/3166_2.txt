It's Valentine's Day and we decided to stay indoors, have a nice dinner and watch this movie in TCM instead of going out. We are in our forties, love romance, and we are both "softies", but this film has just been bombarded for us (it's hard to imagine that it was nominated for an Oscar, etc. The cinematography was beautiful but overall the film is terribly dated.Jennifer Jones's character made so many references to her membership in Eurasion that we started counting and after a while, we laughed every time that she said it, add to that the "theme song" played all the way through the movie and we could not wait until it was over to watch the evening news.
