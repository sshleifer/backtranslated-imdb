Couple having financial problems gets a box delivered to their door. If they press the button, they get a million dollars, but someone they do not know will die. Do they press the button? <br /> <br /> This is a strange film based on a short story by Richard Matheson that has some chills, but is rather messy. The problem is that so much happens that we have the impression that screenwriter Richard Kelly did not know what kind of film he was doing. Is it a horror movie straight out of a supernatural connotation? Sometimes it seems to be the case when we talk about moral choices, damnation and the afterlife. Is this a science fiction movie? Maybe there are a lot of questions about this Mars project. And what are the strange looks that people seem to have as in a big conspiracy? Is it an invasion of the body Thieves or a demonic movie? I do not know, maybe. And that's the problem, there are many questions, most intriguing, but too many. It seems that little has been explained and when we come to the end of the film, things seem to stop more than conclude (even openly). I'm all for making a rich film of themes and points, but the writer Kelly fills his screenplay with just too many things that director Kelly can not handle, or does it in such a way that every theme or topic of the intrigue gets his ten minutes of time on the screen and for these minutes, he holds the court before being rejected. It drove me crazy. Cameron Diaz and James Marsden, who are neither very good nor more likely to not know what to do with equipment that is constantly changing. <br /> <br /> It's an exhilarating mixture that does not work (there are finally too many holes). I came to the end and suddenly realized that I had no idea what I had just seen. I really did not really like it, but it's kind of bad in one case because it's pretty elusive. I would take a pass or I would wait for a cable where it will not cost you anything
