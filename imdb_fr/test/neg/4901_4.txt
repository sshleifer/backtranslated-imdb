Inspired by a true story, the story is full of the feelings of the 1970s, but it is disjointed. This is the story of a college black swimmer who finds himself at Phillie in a closing recreation center located in a disadvantaged neighborhood and somehow forms a swimming team. The film staggers blindly for the first half hour until Terrence Howard, our hero, takes the kids to the pool. At this point, he resumes his game becoming a little engaging, even if he is still shaky. Why did Howard and Bernie Mac have a good story, but the script is mediocre and most of the instructions seem to be to make it look like there is something instead of making us feel anything for the story. <BR/> <br /> This is not the disaster that some tests have proven, but recent sporting stories are suffering: coach Carter, Invincible, Glory Road, etc., who knew at least that at least you had to work with the story to make a film rather than let the audience suffer because "it's true".
