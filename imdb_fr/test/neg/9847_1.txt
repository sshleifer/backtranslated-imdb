This film has attempted to capture the naive idealism that many teenage girls have for fun, friendship, escape, danger, sex, maturity, etc. The problem was that he had failed to establish these things at all levels; that's why he failed to build a decent story around them. I could not understand the meaning of any part of this story, nor any reason to be interested in it. <br /> <br /> This film is not at all an exploration of pedophilia. It is essentially a girl in love with her sister and sister in love with the idea of ​​"men". While the latter tries her love of men, the first tries to win back her sister by "putting herself on an equal footing". <br /> <br /> The plot is weak, the characters are weak and the reality is the same. to an amateur filmmaker (without the sexual substance).
