Wow, I swear it never happened to me before? I only watched yesterday "The Amazons of the Golden Temple" and I do not remember anything about everything that happened in this movie. That's how this movie is brilliant, I guess! Now, I can only remember attracting him because of the incredible DVD cover, showing the torrid design of a voluptuous amazon preparing his bow to shoot at an unspecified target. I often get used to attractive DVDs. especially those of Jess Franco ?? and I still have not learned to resist even after hundreds of terrible experiences. Never mind?? After reading the other comments from users, some parts of my memory came back although I still suspect of confusing this movie with another masterpiece of Jess Franco that I had seen the day before, namely "Diamonds of the Kilimanjaro "(and, yes, that one had a DVD case too.) <br /> <br />" Golden Amazons Temple "opens on a group of hot and white African Amazons ?? I am aware of the contradiction but do not blame me ?? massacring the parents of a fragile girl because they encroached on the territory with the intention of stealing the golden treasures of the temple. Several years and hormonal changes later, the girl returns to the jungle for revenge. She is accompanied by a group of lousy adventurers who are less interested in the act of revenge but who would like to take home gold. The rudimentary premise is obviously secondary to all the presentations of the beautiful feminine nudity and free sleaze. Analía Ivars, Eva Léon and the other nameless Amazons are all regular choices of Franco and walk around with their proudly exposed breasts. You'll do better to look at all these perfect female curves, as the rest of the "Amazons Golden Temple" is a boring and incompetent jumble. There is hardly any violence or action and no less than half of the film is a pure load movie, fragments of National Geographic documentaries embedded in the story and that sort of thing. The gorgeous DVD sleeve would definitely be a great addition to your collection, but opening the box makes no sense.
