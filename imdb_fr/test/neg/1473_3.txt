I love documentaries. They are among my favorite genres of film. Before seeing this movie, I had never seen one that I did not like. <br /> <br /> The basic principle of this film is excellent. The execution is well done. There were times when I laughed and smiled early. Yet as the film continued, it became more and more boring and irritating. It could have been something special if the subject had not been an inarticulate, childish, inept putz. I appreciate his passion for cinema, but leave your moans. If you run out of funds, you may not have as many children or spend so much money on alcohol. You might have gone to film school or at least graduated from high school. Perhaps you should have lived and gained perspective and experiences that could add to your vision. <br /> <br /> There are so many people who tell interesting, funny and poignant stories. To see this type chosen among them is nothing less than coarse. If you want to make a documentary about a filmmaker, why not make one on someone from China or Iran, a filmmaker with real problems? <br /> <br /> Last two questions: <br /> <br /> Who asks a little child to see the Apocalypse now? <br /> <br /> How many times did this guy say "man"?
