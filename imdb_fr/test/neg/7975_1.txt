Please give this one a miss. <br /> <br /> Kristy Swanson and the rest of the cast made terrific performances. The show is flat, flat, flat. <br /> <br /> I do not know how Michael Madison could have allowed this one on his plate. He almost seemed to know that this was not going to work and that his performance was rather dull, so all Madison fans are having a blast.
