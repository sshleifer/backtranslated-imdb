I watched this movie and all I can say is this ... I am not a film student, nor an intellectual who tries to search deeper for everything I do not understand. However, if I did that with this movie, my thoughts would be ... <br /> <br /> Yeah! He's drugged and I can imagine that now ... he stumbled for one night and sat with his friends laughing and saying things like, hey ... would not it be funny if nuns could really fly? For example, if someone fell off a plane and fell freely for a moment, bounced off the ground, got up and left? * crunches * or if the buckwheat gave a bath to the pope? Oh my god, I just do not think about it! Guy! We have to make a movie about it! And then he said to his friend laughing ... Oh, would not it be hilarious if people loved him and called me a genius? So for me, that's what happens when a guy does too much drugs, writes a screenplay and produces a movie. Should I have done LSD to understand what this guy was thinking so I could laugh too? Because I have to tell you that I do not laugh. I yawned and checked the time. <br /> <br /> I think that all those who do their best to find a deeper meaning are hysterical. I had never heard of this director before reading the reviews, which I did because I was furious at having lost the last 2 hours, or no matter how long it lasted (it was 12 hours of life) and I can Anyway, I will never get it back ... I read that this guy is a hero fanatic and he wanted to die of art. What is this thing? So, my point is somehow proven. This guy is not everything, he is an addict, and his film is the proof ... So, stop looking for a deeper meaning. If you really want to understand everything in this film, drop some LSD and sit back and relax, so that might make sense. <br /> <br /> It reminds me of the time I watched The Last Days of Gus Van Sant, another movie I was crazy to watch. I can not help but wonder what the ratings would be for this movie, if it was the same people who looked at it who looked at it. It seems that if the director of the film is completely out of his rocker, or if it is a French film with sex and subtitles, or if it is a cartoon, there will be good reviews, handily everything else is boring and has already been finished. BLAH, bring boredom please!
