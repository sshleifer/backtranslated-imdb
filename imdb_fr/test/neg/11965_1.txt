I would first and foremost say that I'm back from my retirement after writing well-deserved commentary on horrendous movies. Only the film entitled "The Scarecrow Has Become Wild" could bring me back, so I'm here. <br /> <br /> That said, I like to start with this comment. OUCH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This movie was really horrible, I mean I know it was going to be bad. But I did not know that I would spend 60 minutes on a possible 90-minute film laughing at what I thought was a horror movie. <br /> <br /> Let's start with the biggest flaw of the movie (for me is). Ken Shamrock. Now, if memory serves, Shamrock is one of the most dangerous men in the world. Now, if my memories serve me again, he was also in this stupid movie being a stupid comic relief (or that's how it seemed to me). I mean how else do you explain all his lines. My favorite line of all time in this so-called movie was "It's been a long time since it's coming". OKAY????????? The most amusing thing about this sentence is that no more than five minutes before him, he was sitting on the beach and was discussing with the children who were going to die of their death the question of how the bogeyman of the dam could not be killed. So, if he's aware of this, why the hell would he start trying to fight him as soon as he sees it (the scarecrow hiding it). As I said before, it must have been comical, except that I do not think his UFC buddies laughed at laughing. <br /> <br /> Now that I've finished this well-deserved paragraph in the movie. <BR/> <br /> I must admit that I do not remember many scenes and that it's not good since I only watch the movie fifteen minutes ago. So, what I'm going to do is enumerate the top five things that do not go with this movie 1. Usually, when a horror movie monster has its own musical theme, it's not heard by the victims or even by the monster himself. So why were all the people involved in this film able to present this pathetic whistle? I mean, I saw the face of the scarecrow and there is no indication that he was a whistler. <br /> <br /> 2. Why on earth are there murders on a beach? I'm sorry, but the rejected story beaches are associated with festive and holiday feelings. But I guess this horror movie thought it would be so successful that it would change all that. And it was me or the beach seemed to be the size of a living room. I mean, every time an actor or actress ran on the beach, it seemed like they were running in the same place. <br /> <br /> 3. The girl running in the gray jogging pants. It really bothers for the duration of this movie. I mean, she looks so ridiculous. Plus, it did not help her to look like the youngest in the group. I mean what was she like twelve or something. There is no excuse for someone to be so thin in front of the camera. I mean, does not the camera have an extra 10 pounds of weight? What was his excuse? <br /> <br /> 4. People trying to get camera recording deals. Just when I thought this movie might not be easier to win, Gorth Brooks comes and wants to become oh lame. I do not remember the whole scene, but from what I remember, it was not pretty. This guy starts singing this song about something that has nothing, and I do not mean anything to do with what's going on in the movie. The funniest part of all that happens is the way everyone seems to enjoy that. I mean the only person who does not really know how to react to this situation is the "Black Token". And it's sad, because if I'm not mistaken, it's him who encouraged this latest addition to American Idoal. But here's where it gets funny. While this guy is all in his new song or something else. In the distance we see or wicked aka the scarecrow. And the boy looks stung on it. I mean, there's actually a moment when he seems to be really jealous of this guy. So what does he do with this jealousy, well I'm glad you asked for it. He's waiting for the guy to finish his song, then he finishes the guy. I do not want to give the scene of death, but I can tell you this. If this scene does not make you laugh, then nothing on this earth will do it. <br /> <br /> 5. This movie was much longer than I expected. And that did not help that they tried to pull some pathetic twisted ** in the end to shoot another 10 minutes of this movie. I mean I'll admit I did not see the turning point, but it had a lot to do with the fact that I was hoping the film was finished. But no, they had to do, they twist s ** t. Needless to say, when I say this to come, I just turn off the TV and say it, there's no way this movie could have gotten worse. Thanks to my quick judgment, I can say that I will never know what will happen next. But I promise I do not care !!!!!!!!!!!!! The movie is good to laugh, but do not buy it. Just tell one of your friends and look at his expanse.
