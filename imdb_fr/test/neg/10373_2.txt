Being a homosexual man having gone through the period examined in this tedious documentary, I was eager to see how the subject was treated. Unfortunately, the filmmakers spoiled what could have been an energetic and insightful opportunity to shed light on our collective history of gays. This film only concerns the period in New York, ignoring the rest of the country. Although I spent a lot of time in New York at the time, I can assure you there was a gay life outside of Manhattan! The men interviewed here are the same "A-list" queens who thought themselves better than anyone in the 1970s, and found them again in a nostalgic and nagging attitude. The film should have at least tried to cover broader topics, such as race, ageism, the gay "caste system" based on wealth, body image and the rise of "clones", discrimination subgroups within the community, and the ability to grow a decent mustache (which was very important in the 1970s!). Alas, none of this has been presented, and the memories of those interviewed do not differ from those of my own memories. If you were there during this decade, you'll enjoy archival photos and gritty homemade movies from the bars and discos we haunted. If you were not there, this movie will probably be boring. It should have been so much more, but unfortunately it is not. Two stars to jog in my memory ... I still miss going to the anvil!
