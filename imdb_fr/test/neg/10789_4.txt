I must admit that I am at a disadvantage here; when I learn more about a movie from other critics than watching it myself, it's a problem. Although the plot of "The man who knew too much" seems generally simple, the film leaves too many cryptic elements hinder what could have been a satisfactory mystery. By the time we arrive at the scene where a witch-witted woman sets the secret of the "first degree of the ray of seven rays", I did not know whether to laugh or go back to see if I had forgotten something . <br /> <In retrospect, the cryptic note recovered by Mr. Lawrence (Leslie Banks) from the handle of a badger was a clever message, leading to a dentist named Barbor, and finally to Albert Hall, a place and not person indicated by "A. Hall". But despite all the intrigue, the reason why the target of the assassination was eliminated has never been clearly explained. Okay, Louis Bernard was killed because he knew of a plot to assassinate a diplomat named Ropa, but why was Ropa a target? When you think about it, why was the note even written and secured in the badger? Should Bernard refer to it from time to time to remember what was going to happen? <br /> <br /> With his disjointed scenes, "The man who knew too much" is hard to follow and a little disoriented, However, I will give credit to Alfred Hitchcock for this early effort. For perspective, I will have to look at some of his other works from the same period, although this film certainly can not stay with his latest works such as "Psycho" or "North by Northwest".
