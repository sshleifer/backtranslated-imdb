Obviously, many people have really enjoyed this movie, and it's wonderful. It's certainly a very well-intentioned movie, and I appreciate that in a time of heartless or emotionally damaging movies. Unfortunately, the movie has a lot of problems and it was not something I liked to watch. <br /> <br /> The main problem is writing. It's just not very funny. When something tries to be quick or witty and fails, it's much worse than not having tried the mind at all. This film is to a large extent a series of "quick" but gentle returns between adult members of the family, none of them seemingly imaginative or relevant. There are also some central premises in the film that seem too exaggerated in terms of coincidence or motivation to be credible or really effective. Part of the previous story seemed more intriguing and used to decorate the story enough, but it could not compensate for the platitude that prevailed for the moment in most of the film. <br /> <The realization / editing does not support the film well either, although I do not know exactly how. In a way, things always seemed to me rather wrong and the actors were mostly forced to do so. They tried and I have nothing to blame anyone. There were also too many small, unattractive roles outside the immediate family. <br /> <br /> This is not a good rental in my opinion, even though, apparently, a number of people have found it very charming (I'm 38, I suspect that people over 60 years may appreciate this movie more?).
