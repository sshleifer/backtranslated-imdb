I want to believe that all the new horror movies coming out of Japan these days are pissed off and make visualization enjoyable. <br /> <br /> Spider Forest is neither one nor the other. <br /> <br /> It's rare that I've finished watching movies and end up wasting their time, but Spider Forest was an exception in that regard. I was very shaken. The directors of the film have succeeded at one level; Throughout the film, I could not stop because I wanted to see the answer to the mystery that ran the scenario. I could not stop watching. That's why I was so angry when the movie was over ... they dragged me up to 2 hours of boredom for this POC? WARNING: Spider Forest is another of these stories of Japanese "ghosts", although you do not realize you're going there. <br /> <br /> I never want to see a story about Japanese ghosts again. They are fake and artificial. "It's a ghost story" has become like a big rug under which to sweep away all the insoluble intrigues of your story.
