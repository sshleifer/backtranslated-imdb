I do not like this show very much. I mean, basically, everyone at this school is perfect and rich, and I doubt that a boarding school would look that cool. And why do they suddenly allow girls to go to school? Is not that a little weird? Anyway, Jamie Lynn Spears can not act. She always has the same facial expression, which really annoys me. She's basically emotionless and all the guys seem to like her. <br /> <br /> and should not he chase her out and tell him he loves her? it's not so hard! really! None of these shows are true, and she's not "a girl like me" because the majority of ordinary girls do NOT go to boarding school, do not wear designer clothes, and do NOT live near the beach. <br /> <br /> fake fake fake.
