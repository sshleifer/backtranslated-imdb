I sit here writing this review and the film is not finished yet. In fact, I just checked and there are 45 minutes left. But no matter, you do not have to go all the way. I'm just going to write this review and laugh while the movie is playing in the background and stumbles towards some kind of presumably horrible conclusion that I do not care to see or know. <br /> <br /> What explains my hostility towards this film? The characters are not credible. The plot is not credible. The claim of the film is disgusting. Basically, every element of the movie sounds wrong. Obviously, Buscemi thought he had something to add to the dozens of films that have already explored the deeply rooted themes of dysfunctional families and the apparent non-meaning of life. However, Buscemi was seriously wrong, because this movie contains nothing new. He makes great efforts to be depressing, but fortunately no one can really be depressed, because it is obvious that no people like this exist in the whole world. <br /> <br /> What is depressing is knowing that this film has been voted several undeserved awards. Repugnant!!!! Bottom line: Stay away from this worthless movie at any cost.
