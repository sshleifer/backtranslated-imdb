I watched this movie when I was a kid and I thought it was terrible then. Now that I'm older, I found it just as terrible. Universal could have done better than that. They simply decided to make the most money using all their monsters at once. For me it was a low blow. These characters were able to cope with their own movies and the choice of actors was deplorable. Dracula must have been Bela Lugosi, Frankenstein's monster, he must have been Karloff. <br /> <br /> For me, it was the sequence of disastrous sequels of Disney made decades ago, and it was not appreciated. Umiversal started with something great and original, then thought they might please the masses with the schlock, which is extremely obvious in this movie.
