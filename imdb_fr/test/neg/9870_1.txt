It's the worst film I've ever seen in my life. This film goes beyond ridicule, it's as if the director wanted to be sued by the actors for falsely distorting their roles as fantastic, I think the film should have been published in the comic book stores in order to know how you should say, desperate geeks who can not have enough cheese and want to see more and more crappy movies. In conclusion of my paradoxical statements and thesis, I believe that this film had great disadvantages for the future of the contributors of the distribution, with the exception of the character of Jay Underwood, in which I believe it was his best performance , considering roles such as not quite human films in which the story is told it has no character. he can not play, and people have made the right decision not to go see his films, so he probably will not play huge roles unless he launches his career very rarely, but interesting. .
