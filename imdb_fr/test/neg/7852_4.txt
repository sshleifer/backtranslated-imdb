Paul Muni and Bette Davis exaggerate monstrously while the drab pirate studio Archie Mayo seems distracted and unconscious in this provocative racist film that draws its "bittersweet ending" by tolerating segregationist attitudes. Heavy and poorly constructed, the film collapses under its own weight in the first fifteen minutes with an uncontrollable scene that he never recovered. Mr. Muni begins to chew the landscape when the yard howls and howls almost incoherently. . <br /> <br /> Johnny Ramirez is a Mexican American on the other side of the track who, through his determination and courage, obtains a law degree from a school in front of the night. In his first big car accident case, he has shown only incompetence and he is quickly obliged to appear ridiculous by his well-heeled opponents and an impatient judge who recommends him to be struck off. Devastated by the setback, Johnny angrily takes a job in a gaming company where he is befriended by the owner, Charlie Roark (Eugene Palette), who loves his style. The owner calls him on the spot but problems arise with Mrs. Roark (Davis) who also wants a piece of Johnny. She kills Charlie, implicates Johnny and slowly gets mad before he is acquitted and free to be with Wasp, a member of the upper class, who coldly explains to him that he comes from "different tribes, savages" and that this does not will never work. When she runs away to escape her anger, she is crushed and killed by a car. Ramirez sells the casino and returns to his poor neighborhood, thus rationalizing the best to stay with yours. <br /> <br /> In addition to this appalling outcome, Bordertown has a series of poor performances that compliment the general ugliness of the story. . As unjust as his fate may be, Ramirez de Muni is so abrasive and arrogant that it becomes difficult to show sympathy for such a blunder. Davis is no better as a less than faithful woman who shares the same teenage emotions as Muni. Her crazy scenes of Lady Macbeth do not indicate that she was about to become the best actress of her time. Margaret Lindsay as Muni's American dream is cold, isolated and flat. <br /> <br /> Bad like Bordertown (and it's very), it remains an interesting indicator of acceptable times and attitudes. The rest is just a hodgepodge of bad leadership and uninspired leadership.
