This film fails on many levels. The script is the first failure, and as I understand it, if the script stinks, nothing can solve this problem. The plot is boring, after the first 45 minutes, I look at the counter of the DVD and say, "how much longer?" Cinematography is pretty terrible. I do not know how bad the transfer to DVD was, but it looked like a VHS copy. In addition, the sound was bad. I realize that it will not be remixed for the 5.1 version, but hey, it did not even sound like it was in Dolby Stereo, which existed for almost ten years when they cut this film. <br /> <br /> Slipstream was much too similar to Mad Max and Blade Runner for comfort. Due to the lack of decent special effects and the quality of the dialogue, it is extremely disappointing. If I remember correctly, the pointer scene has been in the last 20 minutes, but it should normally be in the first 20 minutes. Most people do not know what's going on until the end of the last 20 minutes. <br /> The music of the movie was excellent in some parts, then completely inappropriate in others. Elmer Bernstien did the scoring, but it seems that someone else had a say, because it does not match the good orchestral score (with synthesizer music.) <br /> <br /> > Bob Peck, Mark Hamill, Ben Kingsley, Bill Paxton were big players. And they did a great job of inserting the little life available in their characters. (Well, Paxton's character was pretty stupid and the whole movie was centered on him, I'm not sure that a heroic conspiracy fits perfectly with the main character who makes the film.) Again, a major flaw of the script. Thank God, I watched this from a DVD service sold by mail, not theater. Overall, a big disappointment for science fiction fans, or fans of Paxton, or Hamill. 90 minutes of your life, you will never come back.
