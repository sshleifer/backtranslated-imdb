The positive reviews on this page are planted by the filmmakers and their friends. This film is amateur in terms of direction, acting, in all aspects. If the BDMI allows filmmakers to dictate what is written about their films, then it's very sad. This film has a marketable principle, but its manufacture is absolutely horrible. <br /> <br /> The film is subjective and everyone has their opinion. But this film is on par with the work of Ed Wood, but without the charm. Think differently shows a bad taste of the highest quality. <br /> <br /> This is not a personal thing. I do not know anyone associated with the movie. I am just a movie lover who believes that the reviews on this page are completely inaccurate and that's why I felt the need to change the balance and give a more accurate view of the film. It is very badly done and the direction is below the number of films. The acting is the worst ever engaged in a movie. The best thing about this movie is the poster and the DVD sleeve. Beyond that, it's not worth the time.
