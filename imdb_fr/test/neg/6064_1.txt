The original Body and Soul (1947) is a masterpiece. John Garfield, Ann Revere, Lilli Plmer, William Conrad, Canada Lee ... and filmed by one of the greatest directors of photography ever to grace the screen ... James Wong Howe. This remake is abominable. Despite the presence of Rod Steiger, Joe Mantegna and Jennifer Beals, nothing has value here and it is unfortunate that this product bears the same title as the brilliant original. Only the name of the main character, Charlie Davis, is the same in both films. I do not think there are redemptive qualities in this remake. I'm surprised Rod Steiger has participated. It may be the only bad movie he's ever done. Maybe he needed the salary.
