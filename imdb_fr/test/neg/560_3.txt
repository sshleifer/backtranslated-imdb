A middle-aged girl, who does not frequent women of her age and is watched by a retired gentleman, invites a seemingly silent young man to his apartment on a rainy day. Nervous and too polite to hide her own sexual insecurities, she is particularly happy when the boy returns home to his spare bedroom ... but not so happy when he begins to sneak out at night. Sandy Dennis is not an unlucky actress, but I guess we'll never know why she was drawn to these sad roles. Inspired by a book by Richard Miles, and as remote as possible from a commercial drama, this stunning material attracted not only Dennis, but also director Robert Altman (whose work is static, at best). The story seems almost like a sexual inversion of "The Collector", a label that may have sold the rights of the film, but that does not turn out to be a good cinematic idea. Even the best movie (Dennis looking for a prostitute to satisfy his prisoner) is not quite right, Sandy acting both sick and indignant (who is this plan?). Michael Burns is pretty good as a kid who uses this sickly, ill-fussed woman just for his comfortable digs, but is treated too timidly by Altman, with lots of napkins and flesh-colored underwear (Altman was clearly not ready for a mature photo with adult themes at this stage). Sandy Dennis has a handful of very good scenes; she does not talk here without thinking, she thinks before speaking, and she is extremely cautious in her actions. Unfortunately, the role itself is disappointing, with an apparent slippage in the mental deterioration that seems to occur off-screen. As such, the abrupt finale is exasperating and the overall results lukewarm. * 1/2 of ****
