Rise of the Undead begins when a massive nuclear-type explosion rips apart an unknown American city. Some people survive in a building by leaning on the door so that it remains closed and protects from malice (!). They have been arguing with each other for centuries, and then something monster is coming out of nowhere and starting to kill them one by one ... <br /> <br /> Written, produced & directed by Jason Horton & Shannon Hubbell Rise of the Undead is terrible. The script takes itself very seriously, but that makes no sense, the first thing I asked myself was whether this huge nuclear explosion going on outside was destroying the entire city, why these people I are they still alive? Why is the building in which they are still standing? Then I wondered when something was going to happen. The first 20 minutes were placed in one room. In fact, it's a bit generous, it's more like a corridor, as the main character claims. It then turns into a Flight of the Undead (1985) with a virus created by the government that turns people into zombies before one of the most abrupt, absurd and seemingly random conspiracies I've ever seen, which makes most of what has just happened a complete loss of time. Then, in the last 30 minutes, Rise of the Undead turns into a strange sci-fi-like thing that looks like something like an energy ball that kills everyone, was I the only one wondering how is this ball of floating energy and where does it come from? of? Going back to what was happening outside, what was the reason again? Oh, it's true we're never told. Rise of the Undead is a mess, the characters are ugly and are not even named, the halfway turn will make you tear your hair out of frustration, the dialogue is void, nothing is explained and there is practically nothing no story here. The last 10 minutes (maybe a little more) of Rise of the Undead contains no dialogue and the movie ends suddenly. <br /> <br /> Horton & Hubbell, director, was obviously working on a reduced budget, the entire movie located in about two bedrooms and three hallways! The photography is horrible, they use annoying color filters seemingly at random and sometimes it really looks like Rise of the Undead was shot on a camcorder. There are no special effects, there is splash of fake blood, but no make-up effect as such. There are plans of the city that are engulfed by flames that look good, but the floating energy creature ball is terrible. At first, there is a confusing shot where two people are sitting against a wall of hallway and talking, for some strange reason, their head is cut off at the top of the screen! We only see the bottom of their bodies from below, but nothing else happens in the frame, they do not move and there is none other than for a strange reason, their head is cut off at the top of the frame when they talk to each other! It's a strange thing to watch. <br /> <br /> With an extremely low budget of around $ 10,000 and according to the IMDb shot in two weeks, I want to congratulate the manufacturers for finishing and distributing Rise of the Undead, but that's where stop congratulating me, otherwise the production is awful and is located in about three corridors somewhere in New Orleans, Louisiana, where Rise of the Undead was shot down. The acting is nil, so I will not dwell on it. <br /> <br /> Rise of the Undead is bad, it looks like a zombie movie, but honestly, it's not, everything is below and I know the filmmakers worked on a small budget but it's not really an excuse for me. Certainly not recommended.
