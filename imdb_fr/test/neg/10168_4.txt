Two years after the making of this movie, "The Juror" is out. Do not waste your time on this one. See "The juror" instead. "The Juror" is essentially the same story as "Trial By Jury", with better acting, better staging and a much more captivating aura about it. William Hurt was not credible as a bad cop, and Armand Assante could not be more like a mafia boss had he dressed her in a clown costume. You were not involved enough in Joann Whalley's character to be so upset by what had happened to him. Moreover, the way she interacted with the jury was neither convincing nor interesting. Kathleen Quinlan's role as a hooker / killer was not detailed enough and frankly useless for the plot.
