the worst film I've ever seen, I did not even watch everything, I just quickly transmitted it to Burt's songs, and then to the end !!! he is the only reason to look at this !! I must admit that I own a copy, because I'm a huge fan of Burt (stop laughing) and I need it for my collection. It would not bother me if this movie came out, I had a nightmare to rent because my local store had only two and fans of all the stars have always beat me, imagine my disappointment when I sat down and that I watched this movie !! THERE IS JUST NO QUALITY OF REDEMPTION ON THIS FILM !!! Absolutely NOTHING WHAT IT NEVER LOVES FROM THIS FILM !!! this movie has become a joke between me and the worst of his companion Burt !! The worst hours of Rob Lowe and a half of my life
