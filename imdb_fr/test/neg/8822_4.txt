Strange and often effective hippie zombie movie featuring Alan and Anya Ornsby's unforgettable husband / wife couple, this movie is not as bad as most movies of the same genre, but just as important as cheese . Includes several cheap zombies, a scandalously campy dialogue, a performance by Alan Ormsby, several gay / naughty tomb robbers, and a weird soundtrack. The woman Anya performs a performance so strange that one has to wonder if she really plays. There are many of the worst images of this kind at the time (look for any Al Adamson movie), but it's not Night of the Living Dead. The director / screenwriter "Benjamin" Clark, is actually Bob Clark, who then created the purile "Porky's" 80s, characterized by disasters related to the exploitation of adolescents. He has just resurfaced after an inexplicably good movie ("A Christmas Story") to return to his terrible habits with "Baby Geniuses". Weirdo Alan Ormsby later wrote the evil version of Nastasia Kinski / Malcolm McDowell of "Cat People". Moocow says you have to watch this hippie horror movie for fun, zombie antics and campy dialogue: = 8)
