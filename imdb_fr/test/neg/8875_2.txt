I did not even watch this movie. Now, I love the science fiction movies of the '50s, even when they are extremely imprecise, but this one just irritated me. On the one hand, a crew member participating in the spacecraft discussions acts as if he or she could have entered the tenth year. Looks like he should be on a bowling league, not a spaceship. Through the window of the spaceship, the crew marvels of the Earth and this breast says: "Can you see Brooklyn?" and another guy says "of course". And the bustier says, "Well, I wonder who is throwing?" Forgive me for a moment, I think my sides are separating. <br /> <br /> When they get up for the first time in orbit, the breast says, "The moon is just to watch! Take me back! See the team getting clogged up and shouting accelerations during takeoff is not one of the best moments of the film. (Maybe the best moment of the film can be identified by a big "END" on the screen.) <br /> <br /> We also discover that they can not open the hatch because "the breast" has greased it before took off.Of course, a space vehicle will be "greased" by a member of the crew, which we will learn more later, never wore a spacesuit before and knows nothing about zero gravity.As Baby Huey, the big cartoon duck, once said: "That makes sense!" The effects of lack of gravity in the space is so painful that it is painful to watch. (Everyone knows that, without gravity, everything tends to go up.) <br /> <br /> How this film obtains it's 6.3 out of 10 stars while the other higher films do not give more points, it's a mystery to me. I really like old sci-fi movies, but this one is unrealistic, and lame attempts at character humor by adding the breast of a tanker at a gas station do not work at all. They simply ruin the film. I think, in retrospect, it's not all the film I hate, but the fact that "the ass" is not so obvious that it's not someone who would be on a spaceship - not even to "grease the hatch". OMG. I wonder if he also checked the fan belts. Maybe if they had left the "bottom" of their trip, it might not have been so painful. Nevertheless, this is only average. I do not know what everyone's crazy about, <br /> <br /> Do you want to watch a movie about 1950s space? "Rocketship X-M" beats all this to hell. Maybe not so much "realism", but a more serious story and less zany characters.
