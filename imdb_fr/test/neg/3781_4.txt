It is very easy to grill, roast, peel and burn this film for all of its flaws. It was made by high school students and teachers and by a whole community. this shows! Of course, I could look at the script which is just ridiculous. A monster created from the garbage of a growing California city begins to eat garbage and take garbage cans throughout the city. Soon, this huge winged beast begins to destroy buildings and even plays the act "The beauty and the beast" with a young high school student. Luckily for her, there's a gang of guys, her old boyfriend nicknamed "The Penguin", and the town got drunk to help her. The management is awful, the values ​​of production are terrible, the actor does not exist and the pace is slow. The film is difficult to pass - period. However, that being said, it is also a miracle of a film if one considers that this thing was conceived by a whole community. You can see all the collective efforts of the players, from the current mayor, the firefighters and the police, to the plans of the region used. I was also really surprised by all the local businesses credited at the end of the film for helping to fund or otherwise contribute to the film. When you watch the film from this point of view, it's really a feat. I did not know anything about it before sitting down and watching it. Now that I have discovered something about it, I am impressed. But make no mistake: I do not have ... NO ... want to get through.
