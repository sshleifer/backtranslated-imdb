WARNING!! This review may contain spoilers. The back of the box is misleading. He tells all this shit about kids telling ghost stories, what they do, but that means they'll all be killed by a killer in the woods. It does not happen The stories they tell are a bit interesting, especially the one with the dog and all that licks, but most are rather boring, monsters in the woods, a dumb girl and the main one, all the movie.
