Ughh this movie is awful. The script is stupid and of course, Chase does not tell Zoey he does not like it !!! Like every episode ... badly never understand Zoey 101 (the series) Also, why the hell does Logan's father act SO so revived. And only on Zoey and Chase What about the other characters. It's always the same thing in every episode that Quinn does and invention, something that does not fit with the invention and brother zoeys always gets involved. If you have not seen it, do not waste an hour watching this video because you will waste your time! SMaybe, it may be interesting for an eight to eight year old, but I think it's even older to watch this movie. But what can you expect from Nick?
