This proved to be correct and seems interesting. However, as attempts are made to create emotions between the characters, it is so inept that it really diverts the horror and is an insult to serious viewers. The story based on "I walked with a zombie" is probably better, though unfortunately I have not seen it yet. "Ritual" looks so exciting and could have been a great movie about zombies and voodoo but in reality it was very mediocre, which is a shame. It's hard to say what's wrong. I imagine there are too many inept scenes and it's hard to believe, for example, the love between Alice (Alice Dodgson and the girl who inspired Lewis Carrol to call her heroine Alice) and the little brother. Absolutely nothing was built between them and in the end they get married. In any case, it looks great, and it was worth a look - but the movie is so badly played. 3/10.
