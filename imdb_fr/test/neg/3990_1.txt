Once again, the posters lied to me. <br /> <br /> The commercialization of this film was in flagrant contradiction with the content; 'explosive'? When I read the synopsis of this film, I expected to see a crowd of grotesque bloodshots and swollen with alcohol, strewn with heroin needles and folded in half by chronic masturbation; in such a "lair of vice" would come the shaven hero, brilliant Gabriel. Instead, the film was the exact opposite of what I expected. <br /> <br /> The first few minutes of the movie showed us that Middletown is a simple little place filled with poor people doing their best, whether playing a bit to make ends meet, drinking to forget the pain or watching the roosters fight (chickens and not in penis) to distract from boredom. In other words, the townspeople were desperately ordinary. <br /> <br /> The only grotesque (deliberate?) part of the play was Gabriel, the Macfadyen brainwashing Presbyterian preacher, whose face is built to suggest a permanent air of bewildered fury. If I were kind, I would suggest that the speeches of the preacher Paisleyite were a spiritual commentary designed to make us despise Gabriel and his faith. Unfortunately, Brian Kirk is so fond of a filmmaker that you quickly despise everyone in the film, leaving the public struggling to make their way through more than 80 minutes of weary, tired boredom. My only respite from this celluloid waste was a game of "guess the accent" smashed round with rounds of "locate location". Are we surprised that Gaybo ends up stealing his brother's child and choking on his father? Of course not; he is a preacher denigrating the Bible and therefore psychotic. All the inhabitants of the city are shocked by the end of the film, but I suspect that they come to realize to what turkey they put their name. <br /> <br /> The Northern Ireland Film and Television Commission has a budget to spend, but there are better projects than this weak company. The only nice thing I can say in favor of this film is that it has succeeded in replacing "Superman Returns" as the worst film of 2006; a hell of a feat. <br /> <br /> v1: 20061114 v2: 20080107
