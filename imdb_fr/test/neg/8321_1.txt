Are we serious ??? I mean wow ... just wow. I think I saw this movie in an old issue of War Journal. It's pathetic, the originality is completely dead, instead of trying to formulate a new idea, what we receive is a gentle reinterpretation of the old plot. stupid and everyone should be fed up with seeing it ... but I guess it's just a rant and it will most likely fall on deaf ears and be absorbed by the sound of a another poop that hits the toilet water like the best western since 3:10 in Yuma ... (wait) ... 3:10 in Yuma! Thank you Hollywood for killing the film as art and for turning it into a commercial dam of neo-pop waste and blatant delay ... wonderful !!!
