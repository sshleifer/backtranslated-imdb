The author of "Prince" manages to take an excellent distribution, a decent story, a mediocre scenario and to assemble them carefully in a boring, monotonous and amateurish mess. Despite a strong central performance of Frank Nasso, the Prince, this disconnected film walks aimlessly from one scene to another, disintegrating painfully hash. The result brings a sigh of relief at the end of tears of joy. A sad waste of time and talent and a good example of how it is forbidden to make a film. <br /> <br />
