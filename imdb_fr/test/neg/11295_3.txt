I am a big fan of Thomas Harris, I have read all his novels at least 5 times and Hannibal's book that I like most.Therefore, the film was my biggest disappointment and I really do not understand why some people here give it. nine or even ten. Their requests are very weak or they have not read the book or both. Even if I had not read the book, I would still consider the film as an absolute average and I would give it a five. The frightening and mysterious atmosphere of the novel does not appear once in the film. When I saw her for the first time at the movies, I fell asleep. Why was Margot Verger, a very important person, totally omitted? Why has Barney been shown as a stupid ignorant whose only ambition is to make money? And most importantly, why was the psychological process Starling finally suffered from the drugs that Lecter applied to him? Not to mention the fact that the end has been omitted too and totally changed? Well, the reasons Jodie Foster refused to play Starling again are well known and I accepted them, though, like many others, I am very disappointed because I identified Starling with her. For stories like Red Dragon, The Silence of the Lambs or Hannibal which has such a psychological depth, it is very important to identify with a character adapted to the screen, but as the Germans say, it is the "snow yesterday. " Ridley Scott has made incredibly good films, but with this one, he does not live up to his name. Jonathan Demme had a perfect sense of plot, characters and their relationship with each other in The Silence of the Lambs, he should have done the same with Hannibal. My only comfort is that I only saw the film twice, it's a long time ago and thank god for that reason, I can not see the scenes of the movie when I read the novel. I am really sorry but I really can not recommend it to anyone.
