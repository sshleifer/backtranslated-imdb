TART is the worst movie I've seen this year. It includes both the Affleck / J.Lo GIGLI bomb and Rob Zombie's borfest, HOUSE OF 1000 CORPSES. I do not know if it's a fair comparison, given that the TART was completed two years earlier and that its budget is probably two times lower than the 1,000 BODs on a low budget. Anyway, the three films suffer the same flaws: horrible scenario, dramatic play, terrible direction. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS *** (even though, honestly, I do not think there is anything to ruin) <br /> <br /> TART is talking about a Group of children from the private school super spoiled. Most of them live in gigantic apartments along the expensive New York Park Avenue, thanks to the finances of their careless parents. The film shines a spotlight on the life of one of the students (Cat) as she discards her only real friend (as frivolous as she was) in search of "good life" with the audience. This of course leads to sex, drugs and music that are much worse than rock & roll. Everything is too dramatic in the way of really bad movies. Cat's first sexual experience led her to pretend to be a tramp and ostracized by her recently acquired circle of friends. her first encounter with drugs almost drives her to be thrown into a garbage chute after her cohorts believe her dead from an overdose. There are no heavy hand messages, he said sarcastically. <br /> <br /> This is mainly what the plot "seen before 100 times" includes. Among the minor and even less intriguing details of the plot is a friend who steals jewelry and trinkets from everyone else, a wild child who lives life to the limit (and eventually falls one night in the East Hamptons) , a British Semitic anti-Poussin who ends his close friendship with Cat as soon as she discovers that Cat has a Jewish father and that his tense relationship with his single mother tries unsuccessfully to make Cat enjoy his privileged life. The thief turns out to be an irremediable lowlife. "The Wild Child" is played as a dim version of one of the Hilton sisters. The British girl disappears from the movie after the breakup. The mother / daughter relationship is considered totally inconsequential until the last schmaltzy scene of the film, where she and her troubled mother have some sort of reconciliation. * Yawn * <br /> <br /> *** END SPOILERS *** <br /> <br /> About the actors and the film crew .... Dominique Swain came on the stage with her role as a minor seducer in 1997, LOLITA and FACE / OFF, very watchable. His performances were strong enough to place on several lists to watch. She was 17 at the time and I hope it will not be the best roles in her career. If she still plays a few roles, like TART, that may be fine. <br /> <br /> I only saw Bijou Phillips in another movie (BULLY) and I swear that his interpretation is that one. one was almost identical to the one she gave here. I do not know if she is incapable of giving varied performances or if it is only a coincidence if her roles in the two were so similar. I guess the first is true. I feel that this woman has very little talent when it comes to acting. Here she is the committed actress to represent Hilton's diluted sister. The fact that she gives such a low performance is incredible given that she grew up with and remains friends with the real Hilton sisters. She's basically playing a version of herself in this film and doing a lot of work. <br /> <br /> As for writer / director Christina Wayne ... I do not know about her other than TART, which was her first, and only, film project to date. With a first effort like this, it is not surprising that his career in show business was short-lived.
