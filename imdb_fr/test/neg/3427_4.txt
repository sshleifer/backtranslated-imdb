I just took "Farewell to the King" on the cable, and maybe it's just because I'm a girl, but I thought it was fancy. The script and direction are pretentious (once I discovered that John Milius was responsible, everything became clear). Supporting actors were not really bad - James Fox was exceptional. The biggest disappointment was Nick Nolte, whom I usually enjoy. Once native, he begins to speak a very rigid and scalded English, and half of the time, he seems rather distracted, as if he had just smoked part of the rainforest premium of Borneo. And then the end - what is ??? Learoyd is on the same boat as The Botanist (by the way, did the botanist drop his girlfriend, or what?) ??? The boat just ran aground aground near a ripe island taken in hand by a mad deserter from the army, a former Anglo headhunter ??
