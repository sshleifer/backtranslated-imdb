I'm trying to find something of value here. The best I can say is that Truffaut wanted to make a film as tedious, painful, puerile, boring, illogical and brainless as the experience of being in love. If that was his goal, he would succeed, but the solution to his exercise was really hard to watch. <br /> <br /> There is a scene that screams for a parody: Belmondo compares the features of Deneuve's face to those of features in a landscape. All I could think of all this time was "glacier", "ice cube", "two isolated fishermen carrying the army surplus on a frozen Lake Minnesota". <br /> <br /> The only other point of interest was the resurrection of Buffoon's Theory of Climate Determinism. The tropics are presented as a paradise, and things get worse as they cool down, heck like the French Calvinist Switzerland. It was a bit funny.
