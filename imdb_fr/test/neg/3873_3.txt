The original title has always seemed to me a somewhat exaggerated definition for a group of vagabonds armed with saddle guns. Again; At least their on-screen presence has been at least underlined by a group of high quality actors who support Yul Brynner. Most were movie stars. <br /> <br /> However; This first sequel was a pale imitation, with a group now composed mainly of players on lists B and C, more mediocre than beautiful. It was a similar montage. Brynner's "Chris" had to recruit another team of armed vagabonds to settle the problems of the Mexican peasants again. Another tyrant was causing them grief. <br /> <br /> The originality and freshness of the first film is now exhausted, this remake has little more to offer. The budget was obviously very limited. This was reflected not only in the distribution, but also in the sub-par scenario, which borrowed much from the previous classic. It was also more than half an hour less than the original John Sturges. Yet we still had a revival of anxiety and morality that made even the first a little turgid at times. However, here there was no decent action, action or location to balance things. Filmiing was less expensive. He failed to convey the wide range of landscapes that made up much of the original. <br /> <br /> In a general way; he just lacked imagination. The first film was a resounding success, and this pedestrian suite was obviously set up as quickly and cheaply as possible to take advantage of the previous success. And that shows. There are many things "made for television" about it. <br /> <br /> Not recommended.
