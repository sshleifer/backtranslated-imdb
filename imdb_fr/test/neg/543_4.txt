I have trouble understanding the purpose of this film. It's supposed to be a comedy but I did not laugh once. The scenario is the one that could have been interesting in a film well done, but as it is about comics, the result is totally incredible (as should be the comedies). The comic series was very random, even after the episodes, and it's fair to say that everyone involved continued to do bigger things. One to avoid. I have also just discovered that comments must have 10 lines. The purpose of these comments is to indicate if the film is worth watching: do not write an essay that springs from it or dismantles it. If you like: Seinfeld, Larry Sanders, Young, Alan Partridge, Arrested Development, Curb, Red Dwarf, then you might want to pass the wire. On the other hand, if you like lame jokes like Friends and Dodgeball, enjoy!
