Resembling cheap sex-free porn, this film is the first in an impressive series of tiny cars from the producer (or, in this case, the director) Geoffrey Reeve. <br /> <br /> And it's a doozy. It's laughable at almost every level. <br /> <br /> Some government agents (I think) are "professionally murdered" in Amsterdam and are an agent of Interpol much less charismatic and generous than those I assure you is not named Louis Salinger ) is sent to investigate by walking a lot to make sure the tax-dodge financiers get their money's worth for the airline tickets to be fired on the spot. <br /> <br /> The strong wannabe-hit Attitudes towards the drug and the depiction of prostitution must have looked ridiculously out of date even before the celluloid dried up, but the scenario is at least very obliging because it explains exactly what is happening regularly in a horribly artificial direlogue ("Have you been followed? Oh no of course. Outside Washington, no one even knows that you are here!") Despite this, the plot remains confused. At the moment a sinister priest resembling Vladimir Putin (no less than Kronsteen from From Russia with Love) comes to the pulpit to deliver a sermon, your brain will go out, which is unfortunate, because you will miss our hero - pinned in the ground during a fight - struggling to reach a wooden board only to realize later that he is actually sitting on a loaded pistol, and shouting "You bastaaaard!" on the murdered corpse of his friend and the go-go boys with tote skin, the morris dancing and the hilarious torture sequence - all of which give great laughter. Only the culminating boat chase impresses. It's an exciting and well directed sequence that really does not belong in this movie. A flagrant anomaly is explained when the credits fall - Reeve has nothing to do with this sequence! Fortunately, everything happens as if nothing had happened, as in the case of the shootings and the shootings in a ridiculous warehouse. <br /> <br /> Unless something as miserable as a Geoffrey Reeve completist exists - and you are part of it. they - I would not care about this absurdity instantly forgotten.
