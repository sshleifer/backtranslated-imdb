The trailer is so disappointing ... I thought it would be a good movie ... What was the purpose of getting women in Hong Kong to be murdered? They could have done it in Paris. And the first half hour: <br /> <br /> -You love me! <br /> <br /> -No, I do not like it! -You love Me! <br /> <br /> -No I do not do it! -You love Me! <br /> <br /> -I do not do it! Repeat the process 100 times ... so ... well, I do not like you ... so I shoot you! : D So here's the reason why piracy is a good thing! Imagine if I would have even given money for this torture! I'm sorry for the time I lost watching it ... the directors should pay me <br /> <br /> for the inconvenience ... The worst film ever seen ...
