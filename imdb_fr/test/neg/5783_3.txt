I'm a fan of good, plausible action movies. And I am a big fan of elite military units such as the Navy SEALs. Finally, I'm a big fan of Michael Biehn. Unfortunately, none of these allowed me to really appreciate this movie at the time. I gave him another chance more recently when I bought the DVD. Here is a quick list of problems with this movie: 1. It's a basic pistol, for example with a virtual video of the SEAL team playing golf with a soundtrack of "The boys are back in town" , which ends with Charlie Sheen makes a senseless pursuit to recover his towed car. <br /> <br /> 2. It's just Charlie Sheen's movie, while Sheen was trying to be famous before she started doing things like Hot Shots. The reports I heard indicate that Sheen was a baby on the set and that it affected the roles and the role played by the rest of the actors in the film. <br /> <br /> 3. Biehn is the leader of the SEAL team, but Sheen rarely obeys him. A SEAL showing the lack of discipline on the part of Sheen's character, or endangering the team as he would, could not have even been able to follow training with BUDS let alone join a team. <br /> 4. SEALs are trained on weapons. Yet, in one part of the film, a SEAL must "understand" how to use an American Stinger missile. <br /> <br /> There are some good scenes in the movie. The early assault entry, Bill Paxton as "God," and some of the images of what was supposed to be Beirut at the time. Overall, this movie is a loser.
