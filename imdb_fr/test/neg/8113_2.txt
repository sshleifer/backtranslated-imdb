A couple of travelers (Horton and Hamilton) fall on the town of Gatlin, where children have massacred adults and are still eager to kill more. Along the way, they are separate and Peter Horton must obviously save his wife from these fatigues, terrible terrible tykes in this very bad adaptation of one of the best news of King. In the original story, King manages to create tension and draw the personality of his characters. However, all this has been removed from production and all that remains is a repetitive boredom that is far too predictable to be so suspensive. The effective ending used in the story is also rejected, which makes the global impact mute. There is an atmosphere and an elegant staging, but no plot can be saved. The children are also extremely unconvincing. <br /> <br /> 1/5 Matt Bronson
