I really do not see how anyone could have any interest in seeing this movie. A woman meets a man, he wants to play games, too, but only until she realizes what she misses. She leaves and that's all. It took nine and a half weeks before Elizabeth (Kim Basinger) left John (Mickey Rourke). She should have left after 30 minutes and put an end to our misery.
