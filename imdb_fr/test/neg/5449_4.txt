The Congo is another adaptation of Crichton's multi-million dollar works. Like Jurassic Park, The Lost World, Sphere, etc., the film violated the book's true meaning and essence. I will do this short and straight to the point. The landscape is wonderful. The actors, well it's the best they can do. The scenario? Try to clutter hundreds of pages in a one and a half hour movie. You get a mess at the end, but the important thing is what matters and Congo falls somewhere below that. There were idiotic moments, like why did the killer gorillas decide to jump into the lava? And Amy, raised by humans, surrounded by humans, can she still bully dozens of great killer apes around her? What is common sense? Which brings me to this. If there was a boring character in every movie, Amy has one here. You see, Amy is that naive little monkey who can talk with a special backpack and a harness attached to her. Good idea, but it gets annoying after hearing him speak. The Congo is worth seeing, and not deplorable, but certainly not a memorable movie either.
