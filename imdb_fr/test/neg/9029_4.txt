The film traces the progress and degeneration of her morbid obsession with her husband, the Archduke Philip of Austria. , known as "The Handsome" (and played in a rather simple way by the beautiful Italian song Daniele Liotti, to his buttered and beefy here). It is a familiar, familiar and moaning story from the late 15th century to the early 16th century. intrigue, betrayal and tearing of the bodice. He dribbles destructive lust from beginning to end. But while Queen Margot manages to make cruel sensuality and intrigue ruthless, pitiless and fun to watch, Juana La Loca does not succeed. It ends up feeling like a big budget soap opera, with below average, lazy or excessive gambling. Liotti seems to be bored and Pilar López de Ayala in the lead role ?? although to be fair she can mature into a suitable talent? Just seems to be trying too much, rocking back and fourth of the two-dimensional cornea looking spoiled to spoil teenage hysteria all the way through. Some of the actors are OK, with the exception of Manuela Arcuri, another Italian pin-up, voluptuous and beautiful, but without "actress" strictly speaking. In fact, I could not bring myself to feel any concern about a character, any more than I felt strongly against one of the so-called bad guys. What a waste of a substantial movie budget! This one, unfortunately, is so much rhetoric and déjà vu, referring to other films of the genre rather than to its source - history - as a source of inspiration. It seems to me that such a fascinating and complex historical era should have been evoked by a much superior filmmaker.
