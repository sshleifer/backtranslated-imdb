Well, I must admit that this movie made me laugh from time to time. OK, but that's not a good movie. Most characters are terrible stereotypes and really unconvincing. Not all of them give excellent acting performances, but some really try, but fail because their characters are badly written. Julia Koschitz is the perfect example: she changes her eating habits from one conversation to another. One conversation, she does not drink alcohol the other, she is allergic to champagne, she feels too beautiful for most people (in fact, she is) but always ends with the "perfect" fit the looks, and refuses to give a chance to some "realistic" guys, and so on ... The end is very old-fashioned, although I like one of the final scenes, when everyone finally stops talking and the director gives us a chance to catch our breath. Shoppen is basically a movie that offers cheap laughter (mainly because it's about sex and relationships, I guess) and maybe even short entertainment. Still, the whole picture is only a big stereotype and nothing is really special about it.
