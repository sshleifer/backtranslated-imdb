This film is not a little bad. It's not even a little bad. It's horrible. You know that you have problems when Charo appears in a movie. She must have had the week off from "Love Boat". George Kennedy, at least he's a player - he tries. In fact, he's fine. And it's good to see Martha Raye. Jimmie Walker is fine. There is a little better game than in Airport '75 but which movie has no better game than Airport '75? What I liked about this movie was that more things happened than many other disaster movies. At least they made an attempt to sub-plots. What really hurts this movie is the special effects - ugh! Not too special if you ask me. This is the kind of movie that at 2 am is really funny if you're having fun with your friends and looking for something to laugh about.
