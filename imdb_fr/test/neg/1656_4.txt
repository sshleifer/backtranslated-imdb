I was so eager to see this movie that I did not really understand how I felt I appreciated it. I'm afraid it's really a yawning festival - every moviegoer I've seen yawned and waved frequently throughout the movie. It's a shame because it's a fantastic story - I'm inclined to think that would make it a better read. It does not help the main character to show his teeth once - it's because of the angle of the camera. As the story unfolds, it becomes easier to understand the dilemmas of the main character. However, the suspense and drama that could have made this film a first-rate movie was completely ruined by the deaf treatment. Dull as a half-cooked documentary!
