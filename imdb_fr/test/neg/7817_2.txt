This is the first time I grab a comment for a movie that I have not seen until the credits. The reason is simple ... you have to warn people: it's one of the worst comedies of the new millennium. I usually stay away from many bad comedies, but I thought it was watchable. An unfortunate decision that was based on other Ashton Kutcher comedies that were (semi-) enjoyable like A Lot Like Love and Guess Who. <br /> <br /> Where these two movies had their charms and their laughs, that and I mean none !!). The acting is horrible, especially the boss. Tara Reid was not surprised, how dare she call herself an actress ?! The premise is thin and the plot does not thicken at all. No problem if you manage to keep it funny and / or sweet ... but as you've probably already guessed, it was not the casting at all! The script felt like the movie was not over yet and I would not even be confused if the director made some rewrites during the shoot. My dog ​​could have written a more coherent scenario, seriously. And he is not quite Lassie either :-). <br /> <br /> Stay away from this tripe, even if you like silly comedies of nonsense (like me). Many will not benefit from this mediocre quality film ... <br /> <br /> I never give (almost) ever one, so ... a 2.
