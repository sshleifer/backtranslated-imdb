If this film were to be evaluated on a scale of 1 to 10, a new filing system would have to be created, which should not even be qualified. The film's plot (if you can call it that) revolves around Charlie (Stephen Baldwin), a former special forces officer, who is targeted by the brother of a man he killed while he was was still working for the US government. If this sounds like an interesting storyline, do not be fooled, as this movie will not deliver what its action story suggests. <br /> <br /> Actor Chris Rock once said that when you see an actor make a bad movie that makes the actor want to send 50 dollars, since the actor must desperately have the money to do such a bad job. After watching this movie, you can send Stephen Baldwin $ 100. <br /> <br /> It seems that Baldwin made no effort to play his role in the film. In the film, Baldwin is forced to run throughout the city of Los Angeles to protect his "honeycomb" (his wife) against the killing of the brother of a man he has already killed. However, throughout the photo, it seems that Baldwin is barely able to maintain a light jog. His casual performance manages to escape any suspense that the film might have wanted to portray. <br /> <br /> If you are the type to love very bad movies and laugh at their faults, this movie is for you. However, if you are looking for an action thriller well done, it would be better to look elsewhere than to rent this movie.
