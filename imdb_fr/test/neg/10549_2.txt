The Toxic Avenger, Part II begins with the startling revelation that after Toxic Avene (John Altamura, allegedly fired during production and replaced by Ron Fazio), rid his hometown of Tromaville of evil, he became a a place where life is good. This meant that Toxie was no longer useful as a superhero and was now suffering from depression and total uselessness (just as directors Lloyd Kaufman and Michael Herz would believe after producing it), Toxie now works as a janitor in the center of 'Tromaville for the Blind'. Apocalypse Inc., an evil chemical manufacturer, is considering taking Tromaville for a stupid and insignificant reason, but must do it to get rid of Toxie. After the evil president's (Rick Collins) first plan fails, he bribes Toxie's psychiatrist (Erika Schickel) to tell him to go to Japan and see his father. Leaving his girlfriend Claire (Phoebe Legere), her mother (Jessica Dublin) and her house behind Toxie go to Tokyo, Japan. Once there, Toxie undertakes to find her father and a woman named Masami (Mayako Katsuragi) helps him in his quest. Meanwhile, in Tromaville, Apocalypse Inc. tries to kill and without Toxie, citizens are powerless to defend themselves. Toxie finally finds Big Mac Bunko (Rikiya Yasuoka) whom he has been led to believe to be his father. However, Big Mac is part of Apocalypse Inc. which plans to destroy Toxie once and for all ... <br /> <br /> Produced and directed by Lloyd Kaufman & Michael Herz, this sequel to the hit movie The Toxic Avenger (1985) basically proves that the first film was a complete fluke, a happy coincidence to combine the good mixture of bad comedy, outrageous violence and bad -ce good movie, The Toxic Avenger, Part II is a charge shit in comparison. The scenario of Kaufman, Phil Rivio and Terry Gay Partington with a load of credits "additional material" does not contain a single fun moment throughout its duration of 102 (director cut not cut). The visual gags are terrible, Toxie crossing Tokyo with a wig and glasses to blend for example, or a scene where he heats a bath with a villain in and while cooking, Toxie throws a load of vegetables and spaghetti, a scene where he plugs electrical wires into a woman's nose, an antenna in her head and a microphone in her mouth, in which a Japanese radio host speaks, a little where a Japanese villain gets burnt nose-fit of fish, a little where Toxie catches a swordfish head and uses it as a weapon, or silly embarrassing and silly facial expressions, a literary guy who has a fish for a head and is turned literary into sushi, the terrible comedy Music & Sound Effects & the whole movie in general is a pale imitation of what made the original slightly fun and memorable. The gags of bad taste are not at the rendezvous this time and the funny juvenile juvenile humor of the first also lacks, it gives the impression of a real step back from the original and let's not forget Troma is definitely a bad thing. There are some bloody fights and some serious and violent fighting, at least in the supposedly uncut version of 102 minutes I've seen, heads crushed with blood spitting bodies, broken faces, intestines, depressed roses in the eyes and thorns wrapped in their throats, torn ears, arms cut off & a very graphic & bloody scene of a man being cut into pieces. Unfortunately, the special effects of Pericles Lewnes are not particularly convincing and happen especially in the first twenty minutes. The acting is embarrassing, as I mentioned earlier. In terms of action, there is a very inexpensive car chase at the end and some unapologetic and frivolous fights using a cardboard ninja throwing stars at some point. As for the horror, there is nothing that distinguishes some bloody pieces. Comedy wise it's very not funny. In fact, The Toxic Avenger, Part II is really bad at all levels. To top it off, it's atrociously done, most of the actors seem to be people gathered at the corner of the nearest street, continuity does not exist, cinematography is a fundamental element. shoot & special effects are anything but. One or two bloody scenes aside, it's a total and simple shit, enjoy watching the original instead.
