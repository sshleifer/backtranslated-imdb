After an intriguing start, this little tragedy descends rapidly into the ranks of pure mediocrity. At the beginning of the film, two women (Heather Graham and Natasha Gregson Wagner) meet while waiting for their boyfriend to return from their holidays. Natasha Gregson Wagner is a beautiful actress and she plays Louise; a cute girl whose beloved boyfriend is a complete artist; the music, the movies you name, it does. As she talks to the other girl, Carla (Heather Graham), of her wonderful boyfriend, it soon becomes clear that the similarities between their two male friends are too ... and it's obvious that the two girls are dating the same guy. Oh dear. Enter Robert Downey Jnr, the handbag that has two girlfriends while a poor guy somewhere must do without it. Downey plays the kind of guy ladies love, but men find boring repulsive; he is basically a mom's boy. The worst kind too; on the phone, rings all the time to the mother, constantly fills her friends with ambitious (though empty) promises, etc. movies such as Jules and Jim. This movie does not work well; mainly because his story is so amazing. Seriously, if two women had just discovered that they were dating the same guy ... they would not stay to talk about it. Another reason it falls is that it's so turgid. The consequences of the situation presented by this film are unlimited, especially with the claustrophobia of placing everything in a small apartment; but the film only gets lost in masses of dialogues; poorly written and poorly delivered dialogue is. The film is also massively exaggerated; it is simply inconceivable that people will act the way they do in this movie after finding themselves in this situation. Robert Downey Jnr is one of the many wasted things in the movie. With Natural Born Killers, he has proven that he can give brilliant and entertaining performances, and that's something this film could do. The two women are not wasted because no one expected anything anyway, but Downey could certainly have been better used. Global? A waste of time. Do not bother, see Jules and Jim or Natural Born Killers instead. This is my advice.
