Before rejecting my post as "do not understand", let me tell you ... I'm one of the biggest fans of Richard Kelly and "The Twilight Zone". Donnie Darko is one of my favorites of all time and I even thought Southland Tales had its good times. I am a huge fan of science fiction. I was very excited to see "The Box", I could not wait for her to come out. <br /> <br /> That said ... "The Box" is terrible. Behind "Drag Me To Hell", it's the worst movie I've seen in 2009. And it just will not end! Whenever you think you have reached the end, another change in the plot and you go to more torture. In fact, I was moaning at the movies at the end of the movie ... I could not stand it anymore. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem with "The Box", no matter how you cut it or try to justify it is that it just does not make sense. Believe me, I "understood", I understood what was happening. But that does not mean that it makes a lot of sense to look back. Take the basics for example. The main couple ... Cameron Diaz and James Marsden, playing Norma and Arthur Lewis. Diaz loses her finances at work, then laments to her husband "live paycheck". Well, sell this Porsche f-ing that your husband drives then !!! They live in a beautiful two-story house in a nice subdivision. Marsden works what seems to be a well-paid job at NASA and Diaz is an accomplished teacher. And yes, Marsden drives a car too expensive. But they live somehow paycheck payday?!? No need to press the button, just reduce your lifestyle at a high price! The film would have worked better if they had shown the unemployed couple in debt. Instead, they are seemingly desperate for the money ... while living what I would call a luxurious lifestyle. As I said ... you can understand what's going on, but that still does not make sense! It's a rare combination. <br /> <br /> There was a terrible scene in a library that, in my opinion, will remain as one of the worst segments in the history of the film (terribly played in passing). It was silly, illogical and inappropriate. In fact, I can not even begin to describe it completely, so I'll move on to a secondary plot that involves nosebleeds and extraterrestrial body ownership. (Yes, I am serious unfortunately). A child is in Diaz's class with a devilish and smiling smile (a grim smile that, apparently, goes completely unnoticed by all school officials). He begins to ask Diaz personal questions, embarrassing him literally in front of his class. No punishment is inflicted on the child ... he was not even invited to stay after classes for an interview! Then Diaz is at a party ... and the same child is part of the hired help ... ironed shirt, apron and everything! I do not know many children owned by extraterrestrials (who seem to belong to the college) who are also moonlit as a busboy at parties sponsored by teachers and school officials ... but we we found one here! (See what I mean ... you can understand it completely, but it still does not make sense ... a rare combo!) Like many things in the movie, the kid comes and goes ... no true explanation about it, not ending with his character. Let's move on ... A lady then approaches Diaz in a grocery store to announce that experiments are secretly conducted and that his family is one of the subjects of the test. Well ... hmmm ... if the extraterrestrials have the powers to control a body from a distance ... and they do not want to help Diaz ... then who took the body of this lady and gave advice to Diaz ? ! Once again ... The lady was trying to help Diaz ... and the extraterrestrials were not interested in helping Diaz ... so who the hell was controlling his body ?! Never explained. Never spoken again. No nothing!! It goes on and on, as it seemed to me, two weeks. It would not end! I wonder if this movie has undergone a massive new shoot at some point. It was badly edited. Diaz's accent was there a minute and disappeared the next. The subplots started but never ended. The many pushbacks of the release date show the problems that producers had with the finished product. It's really a train wreck. <br /> <br /> Go on this one ... it has no redeeming value. 3 out of 10, just because I like Diaz and science fiction! But he probably deserves a 1 in 10. <br /> <br /> Thank you for reading! <br /> <br /> JD
