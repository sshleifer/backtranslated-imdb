One of the worst movies I've seen this year. Everything in the film screams "AMATEUR". For a film set in the 1800s, everyone is talking like in the 1990s. The acting, especially those who play the masters of white slaves, is horrible. After about an hour in this movie, I went out. What a waste of time and effort. For a much better movie on this subject, see Steven Spielberg's "Amistad", by far superior.
