Begotten is probably someone's original attempt, but what we have here is art in its most morbid and grotesque form, so for that, Begotten has my respect, but, to be Realistically, the fact that this abomination is about, but for recording ... <br /> <br /> In the pinnacle of incoherent horror, we start at an unknown time, in an unknown place. From the beginning, we are immersed in the psychotic nightmare that is engendered. A god is apparently depressed and mutilated with a razor. I mean, I'm really trying to put an end to it, it takes a moment (why After this ultra-morbid introduction, something happens, something comes out of the body, say hello to Mother Earth. Well, she's giving birth to one thing, it probably would have been better to stay in the womb, but that's life.

But how would one describe such a boring masterpiece? Depending on your attention span, it should be 1 or 10, no other number would simply make a statement.
