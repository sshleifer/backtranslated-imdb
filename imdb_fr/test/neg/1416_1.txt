How is it possible to make such a bad film with such actors? Have they been forced? The plot has nothing to do with an idea of ​​what would happen if a comedian ran for president. They do not even try to give an impression of that. Just when you were thinking of watching a famous liberals comment on DC's policy (the first five minutes), the film goes out of the way and debuts in the B-movie drama on 1) a computer vote error, 2 ) ordinary malicious trials want to cover the subject with the least original lines in history, and 3) a neurotic but extremely pretty programmer who tries to tell that to the next president. She is soon the victim of the wicked masters of X files of the computer company, which - instead of killing - drugs to make it look suspicious. But when she arrives in Washington, she does not tell him. In fact, the film then goes from movie drama B to silly B-film-love drama. So far, we are so far from the point of departure that most people turn it off. I almost did it. If it could have been an INTELLIGENT love drama, but no! It's not! It's the kind of "oops I'm so nervous that I'm stupid all the time, so please, love me for that," kind of love drama. All with a slow and slow pace, it has nothing to do with the political plot of the film, the plot X-files of the film or the humorous plot of the film. All parcels fail at all levels, which every annoying part of meaningless dialogue reminds you of. The love part must be the result of a decision made when drinking too much "Hey, there must be a dynamic of love between the presidential candidate and the very nice programmer, yeah, it will work! Stay here!" Meanwhile, Lewis Black is castrated and placed in a role where he does not create a single line of Lewis Black. Lewis Black's anger is replaced by a hope of surfacing in the film, which she never does. And Christopher Walken is thrown into a hospital suffering from heart trouble, to replicate the dramatic effect of the heart attack of the president's closest aide in Westwing. Watching Christopher Walken be castrated like Lewis Black in roles that keep trying to look casual and inspired by Westwing, but failing every time like Titanic is like watching a great blue whale die on a beach. It's heartbreaking. <br /> <br /> And then, go into the low point of the whole film: it raises a staggering ethical question and extremely difficult: if Robin Williams became president, knowing that he had been elected because of a computer seed? The American dream and all the good prevails while he gives up the presidency live on television, like the dog Lassie. With the usual patriotic glamor of the presidency and the "so-smart-that-we-are-doing" atmosphere that Westwing has cultivated in abominable abundance for millions of years to come. <br /> <br /> director and screenwriter, Barry Levinson, is now on my personal list of writers and directors that I keep forever. This film should be seen as a symptom of a failing production process, where people (including Barry Levinson) were able to spend production money because of their personal connections and not their skills. It is a project designed to satisfy the wish of people with low qualifications to succeed in their career, and the major players mentioned above have been invited to participate. This is the only possible explanation. <br /> <br /> PS: The voting error in computers was due to the double letters of Dobbs, Kellogs and Mills. Of course, what could be more when writing a script and you can not identify a computer from a dish washer?
