Oh my God! The Beeb family has reached a new floor with this irreproachable act of political correctness, a MÃ©tis family living in Birmingham with a disabled boy thrown to the ground. Whoever ordered these guts should be hunted down and thrown to the dogs. Jasper Carrott, usually funny, is about as funny as stacks in this show and do not get me into a discussion with others. They have the timing and subtly of a nuclear bomb. I only hope that the comedy will be better, but I seriously doubt it with artists like Little Britain and Catherine Tate. I think you'd better get the box set for a decent old comedy like Fawlty Towers or Bottom if you want to laugh. <br /> <br /> BAN THIS RANCH CLEAN SQUEAKY CLEAN!
