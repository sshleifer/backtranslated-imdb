According to the foreground of the meteor falling on Earth, you know that something special is waiting for you. <br /> <br /> Here is an ultra-economical budget film featuring a film about a group of teenagers stranded on a lighthouse island with monsters. The story is trivial and nothing you have seen a thousand times before. The acting is not fantastic but is not completely horrible, but the special effects - of which there are good deals - are at least ridiculous. In fact, if you can read this sentence, there is more than a 50% chance that you can do more credible work by creating the video blast and composition effects in this movie than the directors. <br /> <br /> The Saving Grace of the Movie - If you're in the mood to watch a Z-level movie in a movie - it's always happening and it never gets boring. And if you like to make fun of bad movies with your friends, you might find it worthwhile to rent a dollar. <br /> <br /> And I must say that I enjoyed the opening joke, "This is the most stupid name for an island I've ever heard." Probably the best moment of the film.
