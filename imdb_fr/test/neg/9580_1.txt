I bought the DVD in a big trash for $ 4.99, thinking I had the chance to discover a documentary pearl that would actually show many images of the mountains of Karakoram, and K2 in particular. Moving quickly through the film, I reached the climax where climbers first sighted 13,260-foot Mount Waddington in the Canadian Coastal Range. At least one of the many bozos ready to climb the K2 clearly has no idea what the real mountain looks like - it must be provided by his friend and climbing partner that he would not have been brought in by that one. in a naughty month Mountain. Given that one of the premise of the film is that about 27 people lost their lives on K2, you might think that the asshole in question may have taken a minute or two to explain some basic facts, but the clown seems to think. that preparations of this magnitude, although good enough for the likes of Reinhold Messner, follow him. To be honest, I did not look at everything. What I saw makes me cringe. They say you get what you pay for. At $ 4.99, I was ripped off.
