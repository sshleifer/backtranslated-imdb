In fact, I saw THE EVIL on the big screen. I saw it as part of a double film in the early 1980s (I do not remember the other movie), while I was in adolescence. The film is bad, worthy of the name. Embarrassing bad. The effects are atrocious (you can clearly see the cable pulling the black girl through the ground). There is absolutely nothing scary about it. In fact, I laughed all through the movie. <br /> <br /> History has tried to create this great mount for the climax, when we are supposed to finally see who is responsible for all the evil deeds and we see Victor Buono greasy, which is as scary as it is Twinkie too drunk. Seriously, what were they thinking? Buono, who was a villain in the Batman TV series, is one of the most remarkable actors to ever see the big screen and I just can not imagine anyone being terrified of him. <br /> <br /> EVIL is completely forgotten. now (for good reason) but it's actually a very funny movie and I wish I could see this turkey again, just to see this black girl get shot through the room by an invisible force with this cable very visible.
