As a native Chinese, I can not accept this kind of idea that some people have to die for a "better world". I said "better world" because it's a lie that Chinese people have been indoctrinated for thousands of years! <br /> <br /> I guess most Western viewers may not know Qin Shihuang (the first emperor), the king in this movie is the most notorious tyrant of ancient China. The Tianxia (the Chinese word was pronounced by the king, meaning "the land and the people") uttered from his mouth is utterly false. From there, all the kings of ancient China spoke the same way, but very few did as they said. <br /> <br /> Another fact is that the Qin Shihuang empire lasted only about twenty years ago. it was destroyed by people. <br /> <br /> Well, I like the beautiful scenes of this film, but it does not allow me to accept the idea that people are dying for a tyrant.
