Sometimes, when a film is criticized by critics, you only have to see it to see if it is really as bad as you say, well in this case. I think it was supposed to be a sex comedy, but it was not sexy or funny, I think I giggled once when Johnny Vegas failed to put a roadside fence and that was it. <br /> <br /> The film follows the life of four men who deliver potatoes for a living, each of them has a problem of sexual life; Dave left his wife and is looking for an old flame that had already invited him to do a trio a few years ago. Ferris lives with her mother-in-law who treats him like a sex object. Tolly has an obsession for involving strawberry jam in her encounters. and Jeremy claims to be in a romantic relationship, but stalking in fact a poor woman. <br /> <br /> The tone of the jokes varies from tasteless to "I do not think anyone can write that," an example of the last being when they tell a small child that his father died in a car accident, then for the line of strikes when the boy asks how is his mother, they tell him that she is in a coma. The blame for all this is squarely at the feet of the writers, the actors have obviously made a bad choice by agreeing to play in this film but I did not think that their game was so bad ... not that it was as good as that. Surprisingly for a pretty shabby movie about sex, there is no nudity and sex is never erotic. <br /> <br /> I certainly would not recommend seeing this for a reason other than morbid curiosity, although judging by other reviews, it seems like a love or hate a movie, I guess that would be better watched after a few beers and with your friends.
