The authors know nothing about Russian prisons, the film is absolutely cockamamie, has nothing in common with reality. Nor do foreign prisoners in Russia have a special prison so that foreigners will NEVER live with Russian criminals. The uniforms of this film seem if they were stolen somewhere in Latin America. Prisoners in Russia do not work outside the prison either. Every killing in a Russian prison is investigated; the prisoners kill each other only if there are very important reasons. It is also forbidden to play football in prisons, contacts between prisoners are very limited, no chance of bloody fighting, etc.
