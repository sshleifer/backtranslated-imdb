I saw this one at Sundance and I do not understand why he won the staging prize. It was painfully slow and literally colorless. This is the type of movie that is only appreciated by festival snobs who think a movie will please many people. <br /> <br /> The Sundance jury this year seemed to be making a conscious effort to reward the underdogs, very low-budget films. It's all well and good, but this brothel is like a movie at home. A mini-DV filmed in a gray winter and covered in snow gives a dull look to a dull film. <br /> <br /> Some patterns (snakes) are beaten to death although they add nothing to the story. and have no meaning as symbols. <br /> <br /> Now, everything was not bad. Vera Farmiga is phenomenal in her role as a mother with a drug problem. She will go to places and she deserves it. His co-star Hugh Dillon is also doing a good job. Frankly, there are many beautiful moments in this film, but they just do not go very well together.
