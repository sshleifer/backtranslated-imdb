I caught this on Cinemax very late at night ... there was nothing else, so I hardly had a choice. In the end, terrible plot, slow, loss of good film and time of actors. For short, do not even care about it. Too bad we can not assign zeros to an evaluation; this one is really not worth considering !!!
