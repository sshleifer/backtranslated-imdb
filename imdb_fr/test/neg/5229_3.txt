This film is based on a Stephen King novel in which a mysterious new trader, Leland Gaunt (Max Von Sydow), offers every citizen of Castle Rock the object he wants most - but the price to pay is high for these transactions. Local sheriff Alan Pangborn (Ed Harris) is soon forced to face a variety of brutal deaths and suspicious circumstances. <br /> <br /> Below average for Stephen King cinema: I understand why some people think it's boring. It walks without offering real alarms and forces the viewer to spend time (again) with a group of loathsome losers who hate each other with goose bumps. <br /> <br /> I really appreciate the novel and I do not think so. that this dull film does justice to it. Too many unfortunate changes to an on-screen book are generated. <br /> <br /> Von Sydow makes Gaunt a lot more charming. We are supposed to be afraid of Gaunt at the right time, not amused by him. I also hate that the sheriff's first deputy (Ray McKinnon) is written and described as a fool of this type, fool, of the Barney Fife type. Star Ed Harris seems to have been forced to do this photo by his agent, but professional, he really sticks his teeth in his dialogue. Bonnie Bedelia (as a lover of Pangborn, Polly) and Amanda Plummer (in one of her mentally unbalanced mental roles) come closest to creating likeable characters. <br /> <br /> Yet he is also rude and petty. <br /> <br /> Although I am damned if it did not seem a little cathartic to watch a group of incredible movie characters tear themselves apart. The culmination has good explosions. <br /> <br /> I often give the movies a higher score than they probably deserve, but in this case I have the feeling that I should really be honest and say: 3/10.
