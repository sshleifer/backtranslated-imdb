Perhaps one of the best horror movies of all time, because it's so bad and random, it's a little hilarious and I do not know how to feel about it..meminds of Cabin Fever. There's just something about this kid jumping off the porch doing karate and shouting 'pancakes' which is intriguing. As many people have already described the plot and all I'm going to do is summarize the quality of the film by quoting a quote: "I'm the ranger who will pick you up". yes, enough said? If you are looking for quality or a really scary movie, I do not recommend it. but if you like that kind of movie, then I guess you'd like it. I do not know how, but I guess some people would like it.
