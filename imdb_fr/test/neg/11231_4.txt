A few years ago, I remember reading an essay by a feminist film theorist who briefly mentioned Rosalind Russell. This theorist has written that the "strength" of the "strong women" that Rozzie R. played resided in part in their ability to stand beside their man (even when it was not worth it). <br /> <br /> I thought of this essay after watching 'Crimes of Passion'. <br /> <br /> Kathleen Turner exudes the same strength and style as Russell in her portrayal of China Blue prostitute. She is the object of the affection of two men: the crazy priest interpreted by Anthony Perkins and a boy of bland white bread whose marriage fades slowly. And she will not leave any of her pieces until ... <br /> <br /> I will not give the end - but I will say that this is ultimately the fantasy of Bland Whitebread Boy. Despite Ken Russell's best efforts, he can not hide the fact that this film is essentially a 1940s melodrama for the MTV generation. Except that its retrograde class and its gender policy give these old black and white films a revolutionary aspect by comparison.
