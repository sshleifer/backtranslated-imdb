I just saw a terrible movie called The Sleeping Dictionary. A review of Four Word Film Review (www.fwfr.com) was of course in writing "From A to Zzzzzzzzz". The story tells the story of an English colonial idiot who comes to Malaysia to "civilize the savages" so to speak and ends up falling in love with his dormant dictionary. A sleepy dictionary is a prostitute from Malaysia who speaks English fluently and who teaches British settlers and teaches them her mother tongue in exchange for ... well, the movie never really says it, but I can only assume that he gives her money or something. Needless to say, the film focuses much more on the "sleeping" part than on the "dictionary" part of the job description. Things get complicated for our young hero when the forbidden love story mixes with his culture, his soap opera in the country and his own boundless stupidity in every major decision he makes in the film. the film has some major flaws, but on the other hand, it delivered exactly the two things I praised: a beautifully photographed exotic place and an even more beautifully photographed and exotic woman playing the sleep dictionary, Jessica Alba. My friend told me that this shabby movie was his most beautiful and he was right. She is not a great actress and does not go bad for the Malays, and it's quite obvious that they use a double body for nudity, but who cares? Jessica Alba has that rare face and figure that is more than sexy, but as beautiful as a Vivaldi Violin Concerto or a Rembrandt painting. objectification of the woman, the "male gaze", etc. etc., but I hope you will understand that I do not want to show disrespect.)
