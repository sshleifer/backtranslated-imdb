The hype and resounding success of this film shows how desperate our people are in the face of a good Saudi film. In fact, the huge success of "Tash my Tash" is also a proof. <br /> <br /> I'm not going to start to say how important the making of a film is, because it's obvious to those with half the brain to know how the world has changed. <br /> <br /> And I'm not going to say how much our society needs multiple films to solve many of the problems we have in our country. Religion, politics, women's rights, education, general health, terrorism, law and many others. <br /> <br /> Then come information on the first Saudi film, which should have been a cure for some of our problems. , especially towards young people. Instead, we experienced a bald film. <br /> <br /> Ignorance and naivety of the scenario were obvious. It was as if a 13 year old had written it. <br /> <br /> Now, I heard that the budget of this movie was huge. I would like to know where the money went, huh? The effects were really ugly, the editing was mediocre. The script was "kharabeet". You really do not know what the story is and what the director is trying to do with this movie. <br /> <br /> A note about the actor who played the religious brother, his performance was good, but poorly directed. Another thing with the role of religious friends he had, this is not the way religious behave here in Saudi Arabia! They are not "bad" as this movie wants. In fact, they are some of the most enjoyable people you will encounter with a really unusual way of life, and that should have been in the movie. <br /> <br /> Young people follow religion here because one reason is that young people are the most passionate and the most sentimental. And with the well-formed principles on which religious live, young people follow them. Again, that should have happened. <br /> <br /> We need another "Premiere" with a Saudi writer, actor, director, composer and even cameraman. That they all work with passion on their experience, not just for the money! <br /> <br /> And we should do what Shakespeare did hundreds of years ago, we should include phrases from the Qur'an in the script of the film. While members of our society still regard art as a form of sin, the challenge of a Saudi filmmaker is to change the mentality from this angle.
