Big D.B. tries to keep peace between the settlers and their red brothers. <br /> <br /> Boone (an aging Bruce Bennett) must try to prove to the local Indian chief (Lon Chaney, Jr., appearing to be drunk, usually) that his son was killed by the main idiot of the tribe who was also involved in the trafficking of rifles while no one was watching him. Faron Young sings, even if he holds his rifle like a mop. <br /> <br /> OK Western-adventure directed by two guys, who do not have a lot of credits on his CV, but this movie is not so bad and it has a good duration of 76 minutes.
