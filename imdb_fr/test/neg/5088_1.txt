The River Queen soundman should have been fired. Nowadays, nothing justifies a bad recording on the set. The end result was voices mumbling and cinematography was at best average. The story had potential and I'm sorry for the overseas actors who must have known they were shooting at a turkey during the shoot. It is obvious that the film was suffering from the economic budget syndrome, and the scene where Temuera is procreating inside the house while a battle rages outside is simply stupid. <br /> <br /> I noticed some shortcuts in the Maori protocol, but that was probably due to time constraints, etc. Overall, I was not impressed by this film, the Whanganui River has many beautiful places but this film gives us a cold, dull and claustrophobic image, without beauty. The film needed more sun and better camera angles, less confusion on the screen, better sound recording, and more thought needed to be given to what viewers would see on the big screen. <br /> <br /> We would like to thank everyone who participated in what must have been a very difficult journey. I am very grateful to anyone who can make a feature film. Unfortunately, I did not appreciate this one.
