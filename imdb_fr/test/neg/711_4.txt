Okay, so it's not great either, but only because of Laurel and Hardy's excellence in the past. If the film underwent a complete overhaul, with improved image quality, added a new dubbed dubbed voice and a beautiful background music discreet, this film would really begin to take shape. As things stand, there are problems. People compare it to the age of boys. What a surprise! they were in their 60s and had led a "life". However, for me, they always seemed to have a lot of charm, and although it's not even close to tickling the feet of their classics (I gave it a 4), it's worth it to watch just because it's them. To think otherwise would be imposteux !!
