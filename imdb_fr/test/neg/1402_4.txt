I have just finished looking at this horribly depressing drama and realized that, in the light of such recent dramas, the only ones who might be considered abnormal are those who are least aware that life is tragic. . I would say how nauseating this defeatist and counter-productive conclusion is, even though the relationships and points of view like those presented in this film are in fact based to a certain extent. But instead, I realized that these films made trivial the determination of the great "tragedy" when the same boring situations, the same suffocating and suffocating families and friendships continue to be formed, just after being many times trying to remove past distortions of family life (much of which existed in the 1950s and earlier with aberrations of personality and character still subtle), replacing it with the "reality" of reality. In fact, what we observe is no longer a malfunction, but a normal existence and a set of circumstances that existed from the beginning, but that we may have been ignored before and therefore ignored or at least ignored denied . <br /> <br /> The only problem is that too many movies have tried to make this point. And by doing it in almost identical form. After reading the synopsis of the film, I immediately thought of "Ice Storm". While watching the depressing lack of life of the Travis family, who seemed to endure repeated emotional cries, I immediately recalled "American Beauty". And, in some ways, the interactions between the parents and the middle child, Tim, I drew similarities with "Igby Goes Down." 'Imaginary Heroes' may be a new, perhaps refreshing experience, known to be an honest image of the character who, as we have already said, is often not allowed to exist in family movies (which is stupid to think anyway, seen already seeing this kind of relations displayed in films like 'Ordinary People' since 1980 and which go even further than that). But, for the discerning viewer, these films may offer nothing new. They have in fact become a bit tired of too many filmmakers who may be trying to outdo each other with as much trauma and apathy as they can hold in a family (and here it concerns neighbors and friends). In fact, "Imaginary Heroes", the last born of this kind (I think there have been enough films to qualify it accurately as "genre"), generates so many disasters and surprises in the same family animator. day programs. This is the story of a family that was hurt by the eldest son, a talented and decorated swimmer who hated sports with passion. The youngest son knew it, the father was in the dizziness and was blinded by the pressure exerted by his star son to become competitive. And it is not obvious that the mother and the sister had a lot of relations with the young man. <br /> <br /> Of course, it's no less entertaining (to a certain extent, for those who find this material extremely depressing after a while), and the performances are pretty good, especially Sigourney Weaver and Jeff Daniels. But I hope filmmakers in the future, wanting to add to the commentary on troubled family relationships (which seem to always be white suburban families of the upper middle class), intend to offer something new in the form of material and insight. I would see no distinction (and therefore no purpose) otherwise.
