I had been avoiding this film for some time ... because I considered it an unnecessary payment for a series that should have contained only two parts. But, after reading some rather favorable reviews ... of some IMDB watchers ... I spent $ 1.50 and rented it at my local video store. Do I need to go further ... when I say ... it was a lost 50 dollar. This film is one of the 10 worst films I have ever seen. First of all .... I realize no one wanted to see a 33 year old Macchio in this movie ..... But why could not they have let Miyagi read a letter or something from Daniel-san. .. maybe explain what happened to Daniel ... damn it, they could have at least made a brief mention of Daniel or something like that. But no ... and to understand the scenario already bad ... they added these stupid monks ... I thought the monks were vows of silence ... suppose that these monks barking do not take their vows seriously .. hehehe. The training that the girl followed in the film was hasty and stupid ... and the paramilitary group of young men ... was a confusing concept to say the least ... it was far from being a film of Martial Arts. ..with the girl who only fights briefly in the final scene .... and then she did not even approach the point of being touched, even once ... by the man who was fighting her. ... give me a break ... she would have been touched at least once ... I guess the writers and directors thought it would be shocking to see a girl being hit by a man in that- this. I could go on and on ... but basically ... I'll end by saying that this movie was so bad ... even the girl they chose was not nice to watch (she was sort of " Butch "Looking) .... I can only think of a handful of movies that I'm sitting through ... that compare how bad this movie was ..... DON" T-GAS your time on it .. ........
