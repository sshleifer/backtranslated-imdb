This movie suffers from the fact that for years, Hollywood had no idea how to pack Jackie Chan for the masses. His low-budget Hong Kong films were all fast-paced kinetic thrillers highlighting his incredible skills in gymnastics and his talent for light comedy. His first Hollywood films stuck him in the same movies as those packed for Stallone or Chuck Norris. There is nothing in the character of Chan in this movie that requires that the character be Asian, except that he is the star. In his Hong Kong films, Chan is never boring, the movies succeed one after the other in fast-firing martial arts, but "The Protector" is lifeless. Danny Aiello does not work much with one or the other and the lack of chemistry between the two is probably more the result of the scenario and the direction than the way the two actors agreed. Both were better in the worst movies. The best thing about the movie is Hong Kong's settings. The worst part is the awful way Jackie Chan emerges so pale and dull. It would not be until Canada's "Rumble in the Bronx" that the West would finally understand how to make a good Jackie Chan movie.
