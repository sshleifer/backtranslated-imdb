The BBC and the Arts & Entertainment Network should be ashamed to have imposed this unfortunate production on the world. The acting game is, with the exception of Robert Hardy as General Tilney, amateur at best and extremely painful at worst. The costumes are excessive and have really macabre excesses - was the costume designer obsessed with feathers for women's hats? At the beginning of the 19th century, all the women of Bath surely did not have feathers. The production values ​​are mediocre and the rhythm of the film suggests that it was edited at the last minute, in a hurry and awkwardly. In short, an atrocious film that I had to force myself to look to the end. It's a shame because the producers obviously spent a lot of money on costumes and filming. Compared to the sublime "Sense and Sensibility" of Emma Thompson or the extraordinary production of "Pride and Prejudice" of 1995 or the subtle intensity of "Persuasion" of 1995, this production of "Northanger Abbey" must certainly rotate Jane Austen in her grave.
