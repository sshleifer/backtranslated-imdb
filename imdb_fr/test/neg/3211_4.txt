Take the secret agent / James Bond craze of the sixties, combine some concepts of Fu Manchu, femme fatale, by Sax Rohmer, and incorporate the most absurd revisionism of director Franco. ... "- better known as" The Girl From Rio "in the United States, reminiscent of" That Man From Rio ", which has nothing to do with it Yes, it's happening in Brazil, you have to Sumuru, or Sumitra, is a diabolical version of "Modesty Blaise", played here by actress Eaton with that familiar, familiar smile that most of us first discovered in "Goldfinger". has many close-ups of her looking out of the camera, slowly opening her mouth, probably looking at something uncomfortable (however, she is doubled in her key lesbian scene) .It controls an army of warriors in colorful costumes and runs a city called Femina or something (just outside of Rio de Janeiro?). These concepts, which previously appeared in "The Millions of Sumuru Eyes", look great, but despite some intriguing visuals and visuals, he remains it has the same camper atmosphere of the very dated "Some Girls Do" which at about the same time and which also included an army of women. At first glance, the sight of all these armed women, usually aligned with each other, arouses interest, but after about 15 minutes, you realize that there is nothing else besides the configuration visual. <br /> <br /> The plot follows what appears to be a secret agent, a man, who arrives in Brazil with $ 10 million. It attracts the attention of the local crime lord (Sanders, who makes him an old guy of the Bond type), who sends well-dressed thugs wearing bowler hats to dock him. This prepares everything for a three-way conflict between the agent, the crime lord and the mysterious Sumuru (the lord of the crime wants the secrets of Sumuru). Sumuru also keeps various prisoners in glass cages - this may be one of the secrets. This sounds exciting, but some problems go beyond a slow pace; many shots could have been very close: a shot of an arriving plane, for example, remains on the camera when it stops, as if it had never been filmed before. There is an approach similar to a typical sunset, as if there is something unusual about it. The fight scenes are way below standard, as if the filmmakers were to use the first shots. To add a value of production, there is a scene of the real carnival of Rio midway. I imagine there have been various fiscal problems, particularly in the decisive battle, where dummy sound effects and smoke mask many dummy actions, such as lack of weapons, even real guns. use plastic guns and pretend that bullets are fired and fall without conviction. There are touches of sadism, such as torturing a character for answers, and female nudity, as it was described as soon as certain restrictions were lifted. But above all, you will roll your eyes.
