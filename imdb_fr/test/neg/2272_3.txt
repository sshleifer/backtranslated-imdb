Oh my. Poor Jane must have done the old job. Even taking into account the poor production values ​​for the time (1971) and the format (a sort of mini-series), this is baaaaaad. Whatever you do with Austen, the dialogue should shine (even in this piece, perhaps its most serious work), and melodrama should be strictly forbidden. Alas, not the case with this production. By the time you arrive at Anne's "Frederick, Frederick, Frederick," you'll laugh or cry. You can ignore this one unless you want to visually "collect" all existing movies from Austen's work. However, if you look at it, there are little consolation: the actresses who play Anne's sisters do a wonderful job with their roles.
