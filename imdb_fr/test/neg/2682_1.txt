Ok, wait, let me go on this street, there are actually morons on this site who think it's one of the best, if not the best Halloween suite. I even read someone who said it was as good as the original. Pah, this nonsense, do not believe them, I watched every Halloween and, unlike some people, we know what makes at least a good horror movie and this rain of S is one of the worst movies of horror that I have ever seen in my life. Frankly, if I were John Carpenter, I would sue the person who wrote that or go to his house with a shotgun. Seriously, the Halloween suites are usually almost all nil, two were shit, three were stupid, four is good, five is good five, good H20, resurrection painful. Yet, in many ways, I find it is the worst of a very few suites. Why? Well, let me get into a sort of rant, not a criticism, but a stupid reflection on why Halloween 6 the Cure of Michael Myers is one of the most abominable movies I've seen for a long time. OK where do I start, oh yes the intrigue oh boy intrigues it. Basically, the plot is a mess that contains cults, signs of Thor and other bullshit. It's just stupid, the film tries to be brilliant and intelligent, its amalgam in a way so horribly done. Why does Michael Myers have a reason to kill people? Quite simple explanation, Micahel likes to kill his relatives, that would be enough, but no, we must have a man with black and mysterious cults and signs of Thor and total shit. God, it's so bad that it made me want to cry really, the writers tried to add to the character of Myers but managed to do the opposite. Aside from wearing a mask and a boiler suit <which is of a completely different color besides, Myers is just not the same man as the original or even two, maybe even four. That's another thing, why did Myers become a parody of Jason Voorhes? I thought it was supposed to be the other way around, yet Myers looks so much like Jason, he's just killing endlessly bloody people. In the original, he teased his victims, took his time and the result was much more suspensive. In this, he walks around, hacking people to death. I mean, in half an hour we had equaled the number of victims in the original, it was just ridiculous. Oh and Myers seems to have a very big head, I mean, she's huge and he's gaining a lot of weight. What else is shit, oh yeah, the return of Tommy Jarvis, it's pretty bad, in fact, all the characters in this movie are of course Dr. Loomis. I can not stand the little child, I wish he had, he is really annoying. Our heroine is boring and not interesting. And his whole family is a terrible group of actors. The mother is nil, the brother is bad and the father, I mean, was it his first part or something? He looked like a bad draftsman for the love of gods. He was actually more evil than Myers. <In fact, his death is one of the most catastrophic I have ever seen. I think that even Friday the 13th would not present something so completely laughable. Oh yeah Tommy Jarvis, I do not know the name of the guy, but he can not really act, he does his best to be serious and all that, but I just wanted to make fun of him. I wish he had died if everyone died, that would have been really good. There is Dr. Loomis, Donald Pleasence, a horribly old and dying man. Despite his last leg, Pleasance remains the star in the short time available. It's such a shame that a cornerstone of this franchise has to say goodbye to the trash like this one. What else is hogweed, oh yeah the piece where the radio DJ gets it. First of all, how the hell did Michael manage to get in this van when he was home five minutes ago? Second, it was a useless killing that could increase the number of people, but it's another peace of nonsense that adds to the driver that is this movie. It was actually this death that said everything to me in the sense that it did not make sense like this movie.
