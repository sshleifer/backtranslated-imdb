I have been a Star Trek fan since 1966. I still am. Star Trek taught me that special effects are secondary to characters. The meeting at Farpoint fails in his mission. <br /> <br /> Superb production. <br /> <br /> POOR realized, written, played. D.C. Fontana really blew this one. This episode is so embarrassing that the master tape must be engraved. <br /> <br /> The first half of the first season has not gone better.
