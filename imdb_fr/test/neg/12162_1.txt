First of all, the nature of the film is beautiful and there is a bit of Mongolian music. Well, the horses looked like Mongolians and camels, but that's about all that was Mongolian. Oh, Borte is played by a Mongolian actress, although it's a lame performance. But she is pretty, which buys a little lack of performance on his part. <br /> <br /> But I totally failed to understand the interest of this painful 1.30 hour fantasy film created by Mr. Bodrov. The plot lacked total cohesion. There was no logic behind the development of the plot. In fact, there was virtually no story, there were just a number of vaguely related scenes with a group of guys dressed in "Mongolian" clothes, speaking of a pidgin that is supposed to sound Mongolian. Most of the actors were either Japanese, Russian or Chinese, most of the scenes were shot in China, Kazakhstan or Russia and there were many disturbing pathos about what is a "Mongolian". The dialogue is primitive and the scenes with dialogue are slow. Battle scenes are laughable. All supernatural pathos are lame and are obviously only there to make up for the lack of history. <br /> <br /> The Japanese actor was like a wooden doll, and looking at him would have no idea how this person could become a leader in uniting nomadic tribes. He looked sleepy, soft, stiff and pitiful for most of the movie. <br /> <br /> And I do not even want to talk about the historical relevance of this cinematic mess. See half of Chinggis-khan's movie as a slave, see his first two children be born to other men, see his wife sell to the Tangut merchant ... my blood begins to boil. And where is the beautiful story of the friendship between Temujin and Jamukha? We could make a good movie. Where is the story of the rise of Temujin? From his childhood, from his relationships with his family, with his brothers, from the way he struggled to survive among the powerful enemies of his family? where is Van Khan, who helped him a lot? where is the description of life in the steppe, the life of the nomads, their traditions, their relations with the other nations around them? <br /> <br /> Where is the development of the characters? We do not see at all what brought Temujin and Jamukha together and what differentiated them and most importantly, how Temujin became Chinggis-khan, how he, an outcast without wealth or military power, managed to unite the Mongol tribes and to create such an effective war machine that crushed one nation after another and created the greatest land empire in history. All this could make several interesting and dramatic stories with complicated intrigues and deep characters, but unfortunately we have not seen anything like it in Bodrov's creation, not even a glimpse.
