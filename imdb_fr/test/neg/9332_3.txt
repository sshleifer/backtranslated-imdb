A biblical Mumbo-jumbo that does not get involved and has been going on for more than two hours. The only thing that saves this movie from the crown of God (and there is only one God, remember) is the unintentionally funny dialogue and a good battle scene that comes way too late in the film. For most of the two hours before the action scenes, we talked too much; the dialogue is so inept that the film only needs to be imitated by MST3K. <br /> <br /> George Sanders is absolutely awful; one of the most animated and theatrical performances I have ever seen. Brynner is not much better; his stiff and wooden role playing, combined with the horrific wisdom statements of fortune cookies, make Solomon a nuisance and an idiot. It seems that every time Brynner opens his mouth, something so wise and ridiculously loud and powerful comes out. To a certain extent, it is not Sanders and Brynner's fault, because of the crap and comic dialogue and the typically biblical unidimensional characterization, but they have made little effort otherwise. Brynner's accent is even reminiscent of Schwarzenegger's; it is not a plus. Only Lollobrigida manages not to be embarrassed, playing this role more convincingly and appropriately, which suits a role in such a stupid movie. To describe these Biblical characters as one dimensional would be to give them unmerited credit; the characterization is half-dimensional.
