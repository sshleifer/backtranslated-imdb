This is quite typical of the Sci-Fi channel: one-dimensional characters, a ridiculous plot and terrible special effects. We have some puppets of extraterrestrial socks on the train, and Lou Diamond Phillips is doing his best with the little he has given to improve his performance. And save the day. All other participants are absolutely indispensable. the ex-wife who has gone through the secular clich√© of not loving Lou, then, of course, ends up loving her at the end. The unpleasant senator who gets nibbled early and a group of dull security guards who run a lot. Then there is an ecological terrorist who is in this movie for no reason, except to provide us with 3% more trips. He passes all the central part of the film to hide in a box. <br /> <br /> Special effects really deserve their own paragraph. We start with a meteorite that flies through the air, trailing flames behind it, at about 100 miles an hour. Depending on the physical characteristics of this film, if you exceed the speed limit displayed in your car, the atmospheric friction can cause an explosion of flames. Then he lands on the hood of a car, entering horizontally. A bit like a velcro ball that lands on a velcro floor, I suppose. This does not damage the car much, but slightly bends the hood. Later, Lou gets in a helicopter and pursues after the train. Even if the train had only a two-minute lead, it takes a good half hour to catch it. The CGI is so bad that the helicopter looks as big as the hills it flies over. Then he flies down the mountainside - you have to see this effect to believe it. It looks like they took a pot of gasoline and threw it against a wall, then superimposed the flame effect on the helicopter. About 10 times too big. No wonder the helicopter could not land in time, he was carrying five tons of nitro glycerin. Then the eco-terrorist ends up blowing himself up, but instead of exploding in all directions as most explosions do, he explodes upward like a cannon shot into the air. Then there is the problem of not being able to stop the train because it would allow the aliens to go down, but it seems that the extraterrestrials can fly faster than the train, so why would it keep them in the train? I've no idea. <br /> <br /> All in all, if you absolutely need to kill a few hours and whether it's a movie or reruns on Food Network, well, think about it, some of these Heads are a bit cute. Usually, these movies have at least one or two things about them that allow you to get through them; Maybe there is a sexy girl, a certain T & A or a character who has a personality, a suspense or something. I really did not see that here.
