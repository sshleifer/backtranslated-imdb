This film was extremely disappointing, I thought it would be another "marijuana comedy" but make no mistake, it's not at all. There are not many jokes about weeds that come to my mind, I do not even think they smoke grass in this movie. The marijuana field is only a conspiracy device. <br /> <br /> After seeing this film, I had the impression that four friends were bored one summer and decided to write a script full of (their idea of) spiritual dialogue and make a film . The product is a bland dialogue backed by a mediocre actor's game, saying that this movie does not have a "clip" is a huge euphemism. Do not waste your time and money.
