My wife and I have watched this abortion from the beginning. I immediately hated it, but my wife has been addicted for a few years. For me, it only got worse, and the characters were definitely bleak and depressing, with no redemptive features. My wife then had enough and we stopped watching. From time to time, I take a clip or cross it when I surf on a channel. There is always someone who screams after someone or does something terrible. There never seems to be any lighter moments or happiness of any kind. This has always been my main complaint when we first watched it - no humor. Writers seem to have no idea of ​​the drama - they seem to think that conflict is a tragedy, and of course, it's just one part of it. Light and shadow are indispensable and actors can bring something. I'm sure the Eastenders actors are competent but they have nothing to work with. It must be the most depressing actor's job in showbiz. I do not understand why the British public look at him and love him. What does he say about our psyche? I heard it was "like in real life" - it does not look like my life or the life of anyone I know, or we would throw high buildings or public transportation. The themes are far from being watched by the family but are always presented before the arrival of the waters. I love series like Breaking Bad or The Wire but I would not expect to see them at 7:30 or 8 pm. The program is very bulky and must be avoided at all costs.
