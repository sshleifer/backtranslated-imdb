I think the value of the production is OK .. probably deserves a 4/10 or 5/10. It is traditionally filmed, featuring beautiful people with model quality and a bit of class .. <br /> <br /> But the premise leaves me bored..a decent woman would make such a mess? I mean she's going to marry a man who would have sex with another woman? <br /> <br /> and more importantly, it is also active in the behavior of ...... only in the spirit of de Laclos .... the film also has many aspects that make the Eastern Europeans seem immoral <br /> <br /> after all, it's just a movie, if it does not intend to degrade women in general, I'll give one last point .. but obviously, it's the <br /> <br /> conclusion: a nasty piece of shit with a little taste
