In simple terms, the only thing that saves from this movie are the settings, the costumes and an OK punk concert. I do not want to know what H.R.Giger should feel about his cyborg photo on the cover of this movie. All I could do was immediately make sardonic comments about the protagonists of the film; I was hoping that the "freaks" of this movie would execute them in a bloody way. I feel SPOILERS a comin '! I wondered if this movie was in the spirit of the first 20 minutes. was intended to be as half-cooked humorous as the rest? Examine all obvious political complaints (police trying to rape a "monster", discussing the superficialities between the "monster" and the frat boy and the punk concert with the singer) and the use of slow motion in combat sequences ( who screams "martial arts coordinator") I just do not know. The character named "Steve" pissed me off since he was trying to fight with people on the street (he should have been assaulted and raped) and looked bad when he broke that guy's neck to the end (I want to show you how to do it?) I must say however that if they had developed other characters better than "Splatter", it might have disappeared somewhere. If there was a 0 to give to this film, he would have it, but alas it's a 1.
