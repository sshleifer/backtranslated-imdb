The Earth was destroyed in a nuclear holocaust. Well, some parts of the Earth, because somewhere in Italy, a band of purebred survivors - those who are not contaminated with radioactivity - are locked up in a grand mansion surrounded by lush land, waiting for the next opportunity to hunt those who have polluted blood. The final executioner tells the story of one of their victims, Alan (William Mang, who looks unsurprisingly to Kurt Russell), and his efforts to eliminate legally sanctioned hunters, led by Edra (Marina Costa) and Erasmus (Harrison Muller Jr.). Alan was trained to kill by Sam (Woody Strode), a former police officer from the Irish Military Police, who remains primarily to give moral support to his pupil and to mooching for canned meat. Strode is by far the best thing about the movie, even if it does not look very good and only a third of the time is up. In terms of history, it's a mix of elements from better movies and stories, including Ten Little Indians, The Most Dangerous Game and Escape From New York. The final executioner advances at a reasonable pace and provides reasonable entertainment to less discriminated supporters.
