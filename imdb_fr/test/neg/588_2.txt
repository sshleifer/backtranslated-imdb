I did not like this movie for several reasons - VERY BORING! It was interesting to see what they were thinking of in the future, but I was seriously bored with watching this. There was almost no action. Although the soundtrack of the classical orchestra was very nice. The visuals were very creative. Whenever this film appears on television, I want to change channels instantly. Not because it's a bad movie, just because I know what I'm doing when I look at it - total and total boredom. It's a movie I saw when I was young, but I never talked about science fiction ... because it just was not real. Just like this movie - very unrealistic. Anyway, I never understood half of the film.
