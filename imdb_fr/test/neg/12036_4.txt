MARY, MARY, BLOODY MARY is a good times killer. It has a uniformly appealing distribution, the action is rarely dull. There are many murders. And the production values ​​are not bad. But in the end, it looks like a standard televised episode of the 1970s, with nudity. The film is the final product of an "author" who tries to make a purely commercial film. There is very little depth here and the film spends too much time with lawsuits and action scenes. With the exception of the beach scene with the old man, MMBM is almost devoid of fear, suspense or fear. The director has very little understanding of the horror genre. <br /> <br /> This remains visible even if it does not leave a lasting impression.
