The only reason I did not give a disappointing score to this film is because I think it was such a horrible movie in all its aspects that it deserved at least a 2 / 10; not to try. <br /> <br /> The plot is the least of your worries, because you are slapped by the language and scenes like the "singing asshole" in a poor attempt of shock and disgust. Seen as the main purpose of this film is to shock and that the main body of it did not realize it, the final scene succeeds in disgustingly erase the memory of this scandalously useless film and to fulfill its objective to become the dirtiest film in the world. br /> <br /> A film with a very small budget, terribly played and the dialogue is terribly bad. <br /> <br /> I really give it 0/10 !!!
