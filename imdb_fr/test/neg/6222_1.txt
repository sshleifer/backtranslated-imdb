I do not know where most of you were, but when I watched the movie, no one sang as some have told, but others laughed at Brosnan's likes. The only people in the audience who seemed to be captivated by the film were the seventies who relived the past with the songs. I was a DJ in the seventies and I went to the ABBA concert at the Northlands Coliseum in Edmonton in September 79. I liked them then and I'm still doing it now. But this film should have followed the same path as their marriages and ended in a divorce. The sequences were so badly staged, dubbing and editing absolutely horrible and it must be the worst production of Meryl. I can not believe that an academic award winner would sink so low that he would do this trash. So, save your money, wait until it comes out on DVD, and then maybe spend your money on something better, like cat litter.
