I must say that I had few expectations for the film before viewing it. Everyone around me said it was great, but I knew exactly what they like. They like Aerosmith's song, which is great, they like the amazing special effects that have come a long way, they like the comic side of the movie and of course many girls who love Affleck who, in my opinion, is a very bad actor who did not try to be one, failed and now he is nothing anymore. And all these things, as well as the reviews and the notes I read on the Internet, gave me a hint: the film would be a huge disappointment, since I am a kind of big disaster of moviegoers. Well, I was right, but at least I was prepared. <br /> <br /> The film is really commercial. That has been said, but I will repeat it again. We have over $ 100 million budget, we have a love affair between Hollywood stars Ben Affleck and Liv Tyler and many other famous actors, who are popular with the fact that they rarely get along to be part of the casting of a commercial film if their names are not written with large letters on the screen. Like Billy Bob Thornton and Steve Buscemi who are very respected actors that I like a lot too. They could play many characters in different types of movies. They could improvise, they could turn tasteless lines into hilarious jokes. All in all, they could turn small movies into really interesting, funny or dramatic films that people love and will always love. Such as Fargo in the case of Buscemi or A simple plan - Thornton. And to be honest, I'm really disappointed that they took part in Armageddon. Thornton plays an intelligent and refined man involved in politics if I remember correctly. Buscemi is one of the members of the deep-core drilling team that is sent to save the world by destroying the asteroid that is about to disappear. <br /> <br /> What I did not like - well, I guess I've already been understood. I pointed out the bad factors. The story is dull, naked and silly. It is so obvious that the film depends on the effects and the dramatic end that it is ridiculous. At least films like Deep Impact and Godzilla have something special that could be considered an art. At least it is not clear that the film is made of financial goals. Apart from that, bad performances of all the big stars. The jokes are not funny, the lines are absurd and sometimes they do not make sense. In fact, I recently read on the scene that Ben Affleck asked Bay if it would be easier to teach astronauts to drill, that drillers become astronauts and that Bay's answer was simply "Shut up! " It's a really funny story that perfectly shows the despair of the creators. <br /> <br /> Finally, I will explain why I give 4 to the film. Well, I like "Do not want to miss anything" and the special effects, which are obviously the only good thing about the movie, impressed me. The first scene is memorable. These are the only 2 good things I liked in the movie. Michael Bay is an average director, but The Rock and the two Bad Boys were hundreds of times better than Armageddon, who was, is, and will always be a great film.
