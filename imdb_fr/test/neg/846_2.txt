I give it a 2, because of the beautiful Mediterranean Greece, otherwise it would be 1. When Nicholas Cage came in with his first lines, I thought he was laughing. Cage like an Italian ?? I'm sorry, but the very bad actor who plays is so bad, not to mention his Italiano accent. The story is very vague, it could have been good, but with other actors and obviously with another scenario. The camera is excellent, photography too, but why on earth did you pick Nicholas Cage and Penelope Cruz for the role? Please, do not get me wrong, I do not have anything against Cage, he has very good movies, but he obviously is not for all the roles. It's a shame that the cast is not better because the story has potential.
