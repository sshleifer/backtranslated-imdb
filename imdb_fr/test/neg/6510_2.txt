The typical Steven Seagal fare is shit. The plot is based on a series of incredibly improbable coincidences; There is a heavy theory of conspiracy that would be much more acceptable if we did not know that Seagal takes it all literally; and again, the multi-millionaire bad film Seagal tells us all about the ills of The Rich. <br /> <br /> Seagal's survival rests, as usual, on the fact that the bad guys never pull their weapons from their arms reach, and always like to give a little speech "I'll kill you" before blow up a man's head. <br /> <br /> Look at it right after the worst * Fire Down Below * and notice how the carpet in Keenen Ivory Wayans' apartment is more flammable than a big puddle of gas. <br /> <br /> Oh, look at the final scene of the fight for the incredible forehead injury, which is probably the most fun thing in the world. movie.
