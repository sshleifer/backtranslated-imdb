If you are tempted by the following, do not hesitate, go to your local Blockbuster and rent this movie in a hurry: <br /> <br /> 1. Breathtaking 60s hairstyles, from pathetic permanent to nail fluffy. <br /> <br /> 2. The worst child actor in the world to date, just crying and saying DADDY in the most annoying voice you can imagine. <br /> <br /> 3. Many archive footage of alligators and monkeys that do not mix with the movie. At all. <br /> <br /> 4. Stereotypical Indians who use blowguns and speak gobbledegook. Oh, and needless to say they are screaming around a campfire. <br /> <br /> 5. Hilarious hilarious plane crashes where actors throw themselves into the corners of the board game. <br /> <br /> 6. Exterior shots of 5, which look strangely like a toy stream on a string guided around a studio lit by blue light. <br /> <br /> 7. Terrible special effects that compare those used in the first Star Trek series. (Special Mention: The little boy's blond hair is shining Oh, my dear ..) <br /> <br /> 8. Laughing montage and continuity, the background elements moving from a scene to the other, the soundtrack changing completely without any warning, etc. <br /> <br /> 9. Not enough money to hire a professional dancer? Get any street lady to prance like an idiot! Nobody will notice the difference! Er .. <br /> <br /> 10. An 'exciting' climax involving quicksand, snakes (more archive archives) and a ton of fake blood. Do not forget to put a stupid "tribal" song! <br /> <br /> The most reasonable of you will wait, however, that its inevitable appearance on MST3K appears at the resumption of this classic television show. look at him in the spirit to which he was destined. Any other type of pleasure from this shit is unthinkable .. not to say impracticable. So do not even try. 0/10
