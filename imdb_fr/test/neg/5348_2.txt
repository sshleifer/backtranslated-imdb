So many great actors, so unworthy of interest. But with a scenario that is so lacking in what made the book special, I do not blame it on the screen. Although defective, this book was one of the few that I really liked about Grisham, especially the way it reflected the scent of a small, deep southern town, a world slightly different from that of a coastal dweller like mine. I also liked the factual, natural side of what's going on in the book. In the film, the characters are given a "nobility" of personality that seemed so elevated. The villains and the foils are flat and 1 dimension. But as with many of Joel Schumacher's works, authenticity and authenticity are clearly absent and each point must be delivered by means of a feeder. So, preached, elevated, and superficial about such a horrible tragedy, I would like someone to remake and give a little more legend to the story.
