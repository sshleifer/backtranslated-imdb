I bought a DVD collection (9 films for 10 euros) containing this one. This turned out to be the "uncut version" no matter what it means. Besides the mediocre average quality and the short scenes, there was one really strange thing: the soft sex scene. It started with a closeup of 2 bigger boobs. After about 2 minutes, I had an expression on my face that matched the term "boooooooooooooring!" quite perfectly. 7.5 minutes of concrete steps like breasts (at this point, the term breasts is not a bad choice) is far beyond entertainment. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie looked more like "people are not / stupid, are they?" <br /> <br /> Fortunately for me, the DVD was scratched and I recovered my money.
