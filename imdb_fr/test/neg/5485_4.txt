This is my first Almodavar movie. I admit that we chose it mainly because we knew that it had the attractive perspective of Antonio Banderas in gay sex scenes. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, that's about all that this film should recommend. I consider myself a rather sophisticated viewer, I like European films, "art" films and I am generally able to recognize a quality film even if it does not correspond to my particular tastes. <br /> <br /> But this movie was a complete blank for me. The plot was ridiculous, the characters lifeless, the box called it "a hilarious comedy" but I did not laugh once. Loosely and clumsily built, with a lot of useless dialogue. I do not understand at all. It seems like an amateur effort. Can someone enlighten me?
