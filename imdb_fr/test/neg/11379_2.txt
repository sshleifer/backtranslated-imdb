I'm getting excited when the movie starts (because I saw Juliette Lewis appear on screen). The script seemed very complicated at first, but as the movie continued, it became understandable. I focused well, but the result was disappointing. object of sex too used unnecessarily in the film and it seemed to me that the director ignored those who tended to prefer the opposite sex.in my opinion, the script well prepared could not be embodied.As we watch the casting, the promises of the film Something at first or if I was expecting too much ... and finally at the end ... the end is so mediocre that I would not expect it. The main character Cassandra wants to give a message about having a baby and how a baby can make it change a life, in my opinion, this scene is the real disaster of the movie. All in all, the characters are funny and have acted beautifully. But only the cast can not save a movie.
