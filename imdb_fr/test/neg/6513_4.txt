New Year 2006, and I'm still watching Glimmer Man. Say what you like, I find Steven Seagal's movies fun. Like a lot of comments, good fight sequences - I particularly liked his response from the phone to the restaurant saying how long it would be closed for catering. Kind of like Schwarzenegger's humor in previous action movies - though it tends to self-denigrate. <br /> <br /> But the one I like here is Brian Cox. One of the most versatile actors there is. Pity for his hand and foot, but too bad for his lengthy interrogation - had to miss this class at the "farm". <br /> <br /> As the movies went by, I wonder how much Seagal's ever thicker girth is affecting his movement? Never mind, it's entertainment!
