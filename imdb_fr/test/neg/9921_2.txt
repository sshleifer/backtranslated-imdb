It was a sordid and dreary mess. I needed a shower when it was finished. It looks like this: social figures are murdered and a homicide detective is assigned to the case. She discovers that the victims belong to a clandestine lesbian society and befriends a group member who may have relevant information. As the detective is an attractive woman, she is naturally excited and intrigued (which says a lot about Hollywood and her psychosis in women). What is amazing is that none of this is very sexy or interesting, just depressing and disgusting. Ellen Barkin gives a respectable performance as a senior detective and Julian Sands delivers unintentional laughter as a versatile psychiatrist.
