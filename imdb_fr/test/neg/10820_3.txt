The mission to see the film "The Cave" was a dream for one of my friends after watching the extremely dramatic trailer, full of flashes of a creature hidden in a cave, young divers in the caves and not much else. It's a pity that the movie did not change much more than the trailer. <br /> <br /> The immediate attraction of a movie like this is the creature. What will he look like? Why does he live in a cave? How is it supposed to be different from other creatures featured in movies like Alien and Predator and the relic? The "demons" of the cave are not far removed from the skeletal creature of Alien: Resurrection and even have the view of Predator. Too bad it's a real scam ... <br /> <br /> Well, let's look at the plot: very confused and jumps to more and more improbable twists as a team of cavers is sent to find a cave and its inhabitants in the Carpathian mountains. The cast was very clear about the fact that we wanted young girls, trendy, tough, chiseled guys, and girls who have a brain must also be hot. We must also have one of all racial backgrounds in case the public thinks that filmmakers have a bias for a certain point of view. Totally finished, and I'm really fed up. <br /> <br /> The other major problem was the end, as if we could say that there could be a sequel. Please shoot me if there is one. The tag that was ending made me miserable. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie 3/10 stars. The points he got were more or less points of appreciation to the creature builders for their high-quality work on designing and designing monsters for the monsters that live there, even if they seemed totally ripped off. . And there's an interesting (but hard-hitting) documentary on the cave diving DVD. Check it out only if you like new monster and creature creations, but you probably have seen this movie before, and it was better the first time.
