I'm surprised anyone who loves this movie. I never go out movies, but my friend had to physically stop me from leaving the cinema during this insulting disaster. the white characters are saints and the Asian characters are virtually non-existent and worthless for the story. they exist only in the form of objects, of surprise. the characters of the other races are much better off. the twists were laughable and predictable. but if you read this, you already know it. Paul Haggis is a hack. Hollywood can not even do well multicultural films. do yourself a favor and observe a much more honest approach to interracial relations: Harold and Kumar go to the White Castle!
