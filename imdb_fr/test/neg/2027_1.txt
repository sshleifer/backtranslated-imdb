I found this DVD in the store and I thought, why not support an independent movie and watch a horror movie. Please save your time and money and pass this one by. The acting, the script, almost everything with this film is sub-par. There is really not a lot of history, and there is no character development. I realized that I did not care what happened to people in the movie as long as something happened. Everyone is supposed to be university-age, but they all seem to be in their thirties, except for the woman who plays a mother who seems to be 40 years old. In fact, the worst thing about the movie is that each scene is unique. shown in a master stroke. There is no editing, no breaks or close-ups. Do yourself a favor and skip it.
