I think I can safely say (without revealing anything) that this film contained no robots. The guys in "robot" suits did not act and speak as such, and the evil entity behind all the "plot" was not a robot either. <br /> <br /> It looks like everything was shot in a city park somewhere, with pictures falling in the background when the director needed a custom game. I can not even use words to describe the acting game ... <br /> <br /> It could not even offer the hilarious end of "Star Crystal". In short, this is clearly one of the worst sci-fi movies of the 80s and I would have the audacity to say "all the time".
