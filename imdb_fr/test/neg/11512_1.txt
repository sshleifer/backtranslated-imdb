For those of us who are part of the real world of ballet, this movie is completely ridiculous. Ivan Kirov was essentially a gymnast, not a ballet dancer. At the time, Viola Essen was with the Ballet Theater, now American Ballet Theater, and a pretty good dancer, but with the exception of Dame Judith Anderson, the acting is amateur and Checkov is completely excessive, which is embarrassing! I saw this film at the age of 14 and at that time, having never seen ballet, I was very impressed. However, later in life, long after completing my own dancing career, I bought the videotape, curious to know what it looked like after so many years. I could not believe how naive the world of ballet could be in Hollywood. But it was made in the mid-1940s, before The Red Shoes or The Turning Point, the latter giving a true picture of the world of ballet. The whole actors of Specter are now dead ... Ivan Kirov (his real name) is dying at 79 years old. It was his only film, which was later kept by a Chicago businessman.
