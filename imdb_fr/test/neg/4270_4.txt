OK already enough. it's a terrible piece of television. the work of the camera is appalling (should I remind you of the crispy gravel so hard that you hardly hear the actors talking) lady bertram has the most annoying voice in the world. Anna Massey "acts" in such an incredible way. and the lack of chemistry between fanny and edmund is beyond. the bertram girls are not pretty enough, and the guy playing Henry crawford is awful. To say that the work of the camera is risky is a euphemism. I watched this adaptation at Christmas, and I think that in other circumstances, I could not bear it, and I certainly could not have justified the time lost. <br /> <br /> I am a fan of faithful to Jane adaptations. I could not stand the film adaptation or the recent film about pride and prejudice. but see any other adaptation instead, even emma is better than that.
