It seems that I am in the minority in this case, but I found that One True Thing was schmaltzy, artificial and generally unpleasant. Not that the acting is so bad, but the characters seem little more than archetypes (the bad father, oh, but wait, maybe he's not irretrievably bad, maybe he could be a resolution at the end ...). Certainly, the woman I was with was a fan of the movie, so maybe you'll like it. But I have not got.
