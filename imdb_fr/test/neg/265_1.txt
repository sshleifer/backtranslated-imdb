Ocean's Twelve: just stupid, bad and nothing compared to the other two. <br /> <br /> A robbery of art. 10 known actors, at least. A weak scenario and a very slow idea to develop. That's why I'm characterizing a film that I only saw 20 minutes at least. Do not get me wrong, you can love it. But I only like ocean movies because of the Heist theme. If Ocean's 12 has nothing to do with Heist, what is the point of seeing it? Glad Soderberg saw his main mistake and redeemed himself by making a film much higher than the first one. Congratulations for that. <br /> <br /> Steven Soderberg is not really a good director. Apart from his hit "Sex Mens and Videos", nothing else has changed the career of this director so much. Shame on him. But his fault only.
