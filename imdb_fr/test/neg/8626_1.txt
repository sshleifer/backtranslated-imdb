I can not believe that this movie has 6 stars on IMDb. It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen and it's not an episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000. The plot is predictable. I could not bring myself to worry about any of the characters. The dialogue is cheesy. Several moments in the film made me moan loudly (including the crazy neighbor of Kiefer Southerland and the incredibly lame joke that ends the film). Jeff Bridges' accent is awkward - I do not know which country he is supposed to be. It must be one of the least thrilling thrillers I've ever seen ... after the disappearance of Sandra Bullock's character, nothing happens to move the story forward for about 45 minutes. I would give this film a negative number of stars if I could.
