This is more than a simple adaptation of Bond: it's a simple scam! With pictures of mediocre characters that Ian Fleming would not have approved, this film is considered the worst film of 007. An older (same haggard), Connery, tries to relive his 12 years later. The result is a humorless version of the classic hero. Give me Roger Moore any day!
