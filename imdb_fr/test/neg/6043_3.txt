OK, we have 4 electricians in the city who find a mini-nuclear reactor, transform it and fall into a parallel universe inhabited by a giant spider queen also from a parallel universe, who managed to slip with some of his parents to conquer the land. but alas she's the only one left? If so, why did not the rest of humanity join her to hunt her down? In addition, what happened to the army, it is impossible to use a few billion cartridges and why hide in a basement while much more defensible places were available to people. Also, do not look for the workers in the city, but how do they know what a mini-nuclear reactor looked like and how if they did not have it in the parallel universe, could they reopen the loophole? Sorry but the movie is not nice
