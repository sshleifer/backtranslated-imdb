This is supposed to be the story of the life of a man named Wirey Spindell from 8 to 36 years, told in his narration by the character at every age of his life. For example, when he is eight years old, it is the voice of the eight-year-old who is telling the story; when he's in college, he's the one who's doing the narration, and so on. That's about all that is interesting in this film. It seems that every actor playing Wirey is a separate character. Not only are they not alike, but their experiences are not alike. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie like a big cold.
