This soap is worse than bad: it is toxic. Eastenders is the best example of the many television shows that have had a corrosive influence on British society over the last twenty years. For two decades, this show celebrates the public, the thug, the boy, the pie, the gobby, the violent, the sexual incontinence, the criminal, the ignorant, the ambitious ... <br /> <br /> How many times has anyone noticed that Estenders "reflected life"? Life on which planet, exactly? <br /> <br /> It is written about the characters of the "working class", as imagined by the middle-class people who followed a course of creative writing. Eager to show their peers in the middle class how familiar they are with the "working class", they imagine the lumpen rush that is the citizenship of the Eastenders. <br /> <br /> This has a toxic effect on some less well-equipped minds than others to manage fiction, so we find members of the actual population assuming the attitudes and behavior of the people of Walford. <br /> <br /> That's how Eastenders reflected life; but only after life was transformed into a mirror of Eastenders. <br /> <br /> Other serials have followed the footsteps of EE, filled with their stinking, stinking-gun characters with ugly characters, with their puckered faces, shaved heads, bulging belly, scowling at each other. others and issuing threats constantly. It is the proletariat as perceived by the authors who produce this junk. Writers will be enriched by the product of this production and will continue to enjoy the finer things in life in their rarefied enclaves. Meanwhile, the growing number of new drones induced by television will inexorably go to cultural bankruptcy. <br /> <br /> And here are the new priests and new creatures of the early 21st century. This is due in large part to the immeasurable power of this illuminated box of dancing pixels in the corner of your living room. It's your fault, dear reader: this is what you chose as the only window by which you can look from your prison.
