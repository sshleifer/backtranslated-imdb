Nobody in this movie has much to do. It's probably the longest 65 minutes I spent watching a movie. The effects of make-up on the pianist with macromeglia are pretty good, but that's the only thing that keeps him from giving a note of the next scene. The director has put together many appropriate ingredients for a film of mad doctors, but he has somehow forgotten the skeleton of a story to hang them on. Unless you know someone in the casting or the team, I would not even recommend sampling it.
