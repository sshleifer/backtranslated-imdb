4 realz his my game is crazy tite yo i can not wait 2 go on show and ride in a club n do it real style 905 with crazy models n bottles, son! <br /> <br /> No, I'm laughing. This is a sad spectacle, created by and for the pleasure of sad men. Men who are so sterilized by the modern existence that they channel their frustration in the clubs, where they try to pretend to be an ephemeral self-validation feeding on chicks in the hope of touching their little nuts to try to alleviate the feeling of loneliness and make them feel even if only for one night, their seat on the Sausage Party of Toronto's board of directors is a little less permanent. <br /> <br /> I have read comments on this point, stating that this program represented Canadian television that was finally preparing to compete with American television or something like that. Well, that does not apply at all. It's like, yes! Stroke in the back, Canada - you have finally understood the elusive formula of American content as revolutionary as "Studs", "Change of Heart", "Elimidate" and "The Fifth Wheel". You see, the real idea here is to nail "... meet Candid Camera" on the ground. Genius. And there is nothing that straddles this thin line between fratboy camaraderie and latent homosexuality, like a group of adult men filming themselves in hidden cams, admiring the "game" of everyone in the club. The man-love exposed here is so palpable that he should consider renaming it "Keys of Steam Bath". <br /> <br /> It is interesting to note how interesting it is that the people who have given this show such laudatory reviews have registered an IMDb account for the express purpose of doing so (I suppose I am guilty of use the same means to do the opposite here.) My favorite is the enthusiastic critic who claims to come from the "United States". which springs that "now it is clear that talent in Canada has the ability to produce a television of American quality." <br /> <br /> Smooth. <br /> <br /> But why bother to make articles online? After all, you can not be canceled, you're on the Comedy network in Canada, baby! Viewers will continue to ignore your show for years. In all likelihood, you'll be fine, comfortably squeezing this proverbial plains of mediocrity with the majority of Comedy Network's original programming.
