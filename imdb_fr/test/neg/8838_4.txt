I watched the beginning twice, I could not understand, and it bothered me throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> So, solve this with me: Wayne (the GOOD guy) jumps on the stagecoach, disarms the drivers (!), steals the money (?!) and takes off. Disarmed, one driver is then killed and the other wounded by the wicked. Thanks to Wayne, who disarmed them and looked at them afterwards. <br /> <br /> Then Wayne drops the money in the mud, saves the girl, goes to town, laughs with Yak (too bad for the dead) dude, I guess) ... and then more he later "found" the money on the spot. And everyone agrees with that. <br /> <br /> And that's the good guy? And I'm pretty sure there were no small handheld flashlights at the time. And Bell did his first phone demonstration in 1876 ... were they in houses then? Do I think too much of this one? Normally, I'm happy to suspend my judgment to watch a movie, but this one bothered me. And it's a sign that the move did not really work for me.
