It's a very famous Ninja movie but it's not a good movie. If you want to see ninjas and characters, you want to know more about Ninjas see this movie. This movie is reserved for ninja fans who want to make nostalgia. <br /> <br /> The first 20 minutes and the last 20 minutes of the film are preferable. You can just see Ninja figures and fight in these scenes. Between these are below average, almost bad as a movie. Play is bad. Sho (black ninja) is the best actor in this movie. Frank Nero is a good actor and charismatic, but he can not fight well. The scenario is not good either. It's so simple. Franko Nero approaches his best friend, old friend of the army and the war. He also protects him from the mafia but he has sex with his wife and his friend knows it, but do not tell Nero anything. Is it possible in life? What friendship! <br /> <br /> Finally this film started a genre; Ninja Movies. There is also the ninja master Sho Kasugi but some fight scenes are neither realistic nor fast, even with shoo. This film is below average even if it is a classic.
