The action was episodic and there was no narrative thread to link the episodes and advance the story. The plot advances. With a few exceptions (Graham Greene, for example), the acting was uninspired and, at best, pedestrian. The actors seemed to have something in mind, other than the scene in which they were. It is boring to see a man driving a car in the semi-desert country of the scenery of this film, which he drives badly or badly. Such scenes are typical of the level of tension in the video. There was nothing in this video to engage or attract the observer, to take care of the characters and their output. I am doubly disappointed because I rented this film based on the reputations of the executive producer (Redford) and the author of the novel on which he was based (Hillerman). I note that the jewelry box indicates that the funding is provided by PBS and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, as well as by Carlton International. I hope this video has been as disappointing for them as for me and my wife, so much so that they will no longer fund disasters from the same source.
