This movie was so horrible that I could not do everything without turning it off, it was so terrible! When I looked at it, I thought it looked like a really cheap film made in the '60s or something with these terrible special effects, but I realized that it was just filmed in 2001. <br /> <br /> the dialogue and the acting were really horrible and the plot was almost non-existent. I did not think anyone would start making films that look so old and so cheap, I do not know if they did it on purpose or if they really did not have a budget for that movie. It really looks like it was shot on someone's camcorder at his neighbor's house or something. Maybe they thought they were retro or something, but it really looks very old-fashioned. <br /> <br /> I really do not know how anyone would like to watch this. <br /> <br /> 0 out of 5 *.
