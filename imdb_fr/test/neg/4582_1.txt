Greyfriars Bobby was NOT a Westie - Bobby was a skye terrier. One of the highlights of my childhood trips to Edinburgh was going to the monument to Bobby. I grew up with the story of the valiant and loyal little dog, as did all the children of my generation, and I remember lining up with my mother in front of the cinema - with many other children of Dundee and their mothers - to see the wonderful Disney movie. How could a movie based on such a wonderful story be made with a Westie, for heaven's sake? It's like making a film about the life of Robert Burns, for example, and portraying him as an Englishman. I say, give back his race to Bobby!
