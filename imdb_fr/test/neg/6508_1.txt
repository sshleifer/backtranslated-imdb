Perhaps it was the excessive weight gain that Seagal had taken. Or maybe it was the awful behavior of Wayans in an action movie. Or was it the total lack of chemistry between the two main characters? These considerations, among others, lead me to conclude that Seagal should never have had this acting nightmare. True, the scenario was good. Yet, as a fervent follower of Seagal's career and background, his physical appearance was inconsistent with his clean, pure and healthy Zen Buddhist lifestyle, particularly in his on-screen discussions with Wayans. (Again, his connection with the "nanny" was also contradictory!) <br /> <br /> If Seagal wants to become a more diverse actor, then he should do what his colleague did in "Kindergarten Cop" .. put humorous text or situations in the scenario where the actor has no choice but to react comically. Otherwise, leave out the gaps and vain attempts at humor to chase a serial killer. Seagal is not a type of natural humor. It did not work. <br /> <br />
