Seriously, I have not found anything that constitutes a rational human thought in this film. For some reason, the writer decided to have a group of actors in random places, grunting, creeping and screaming like Cro-Magnon bipeds. I understand it was gymnastics, but seriously, what about those roaring and human bleats? I've also seen at least five actors with Terracial Hyperactivity Syndrome and Stage Ten Syphilis. Although this film has real human acrobatics, I have to say it's amazing that you can make a movie of this type without having intelligible. form of human language models. This is really an important step in the history of film production because it was not deliberately decided that the characters express something other than a timely Urrrrr! or Rfff! his. <br /> <br /> Incredible.
