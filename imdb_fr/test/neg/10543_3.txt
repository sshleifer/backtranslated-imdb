I enjoyed the first "Toxic Avenger", but the rest simply did not work. There are funny gags in the opening, involving members of the house for the blind, but after this point, I was simply bored. The sequel is also filled with offbeat and humiliating humor. Only this time it's not funny! Much of the gags revolves around crisp Japanese stereotypes. Almost all Japanese characters seem to cut fish. Does everyone in Japan cut fish? Troma's films are known to be more than a little irreverent, but if you're going to use racial stereotype humor, at least, have fun. I can not laugh if you give me the same shit I've seen a million times before! One thing I must recognize is free nudity. Nudity is even more free than in the first. But overall, I was very disappointed and the film ends on a tedious pursuit scene that made me sick and dying, dying for the film to go black. At least there's a hilarious phrase in the movie that made me laugh out loud. After the villain has sent a Shakespeare line to one of the local citizens, the citizen (an elderly woman) responds by saying, "Thank you, this is from David Mamet." <br /> <br /> My score: 3 (out of 10)
