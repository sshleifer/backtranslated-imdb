One of those movies in which there are no big twists and where you can predict pretty much what will happen. Matt Dillon was once again great, but the rest did not play a bigger role than he should have done. <br /> <br /> It was exciting at first, but rather slow and predictable at the end. If you have absolutely nothing to do, you can try it. Personally, I found that it was not worth watching. The story could have been more interesting and the director could have done less of a B-movie by putting together a happy ending.
