We rented the film and it is perhaps the worst film of all time. The box they had in the video store had a pretty monster on the cover, but in reality, this monster was a creature of the black lagoon mask. Horrible, awful, awful ... you might actually have to praise it, it's so bad. It's like you're watching a bizzare-o movie at home.
