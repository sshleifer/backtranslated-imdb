Jack Frost comes back with an army of Styrofoam balls that can only be thwarted by being shot with super-dippers loaded with margaritas. How's that for a plot? The film is based on such a ridiculous premise that it almost does not raise the eyebrows when characters are killed with barbecue tongs and impaled by carrots. You could even say that all the film rolls on thin ice (ba-boom-tish). <br /> <br /> Of course, there are fantastic liners, including a remark on the murderous shark-coconut. <br /> <br /> The difficult moments are quite difficult, but that does not excuse the will of the actors to take part in such guts. <br /> <br /> For fans hoping to see Jack Frost, get ready to accept it. like a simple phallic carrot crawling on the beach with voiceover comments.
