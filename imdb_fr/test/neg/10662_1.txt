(HR's name is Himesh in the movie, I think he likes it too.) It's amazing how smart, talented people fall into the same trap. <br /> <br /> I really like Reshamiya. It's amazing what he did. No one in recent years has come back from nature and left a footprint. <br /> <br /> And I was really expecting a great movie (with a budget of 50 Cr and a cute actress). As intense as I think, thought Reshamiya, he would excel in a sentimental and emotional role. Ironically, he is represented in the same way, but for what care? Incompetence, carelessness, terrible games, banal background music, insensitive direction make it a real pain. <br /> <br /> The rule of gaffes. (Ex: How can the German police give public instructions on a loudspeaker in English?) They communicate with each other in English!) Unfortunately, this incompetence has become the norm in Bollywood's main line. There are excellent directors but many of them too. The worst is that the majority does not care. <br /> <br /> The songs are the only grace that saves ... <br /> <br /> Do not repeat this time and find yourself a good director (small budget .. No problem). <br /> <br /> The bad guy really should have shaved his head instead of the wig you know ... after all, it's a 50Cr movie.
