I am very diplomatic in my criticism and, as a university writer, I try to give a creative license to TV writers who try to explain a true story. This story, about Karen Carpenter, could have helped many people, but, because of the staging and editing, does not do it. <br /> <br /> The story, in this case, is not fully treated, unless you read psychological journals. While Cynthia Gibb represents a realistic Karen, it is unfortunate that so much has been published ... Louise Fletcher represents her mother and does a great job, with little material and dialogue. In this case, I thank the actors for surviving this project. <br /> <br /> Why is the public not allowed to see the causal factors? ... The American public is very knowledgeable and, if they have cable, usually educated. <br /> <br /> I sincerely feel that I could have written a better story, not having suppressed the truth and allowed the actors to project the reality. <br /> <br /> Richard Carpenter, as director, seriously underestimated and insulted the American public. Karen's story is important and it's sad to never hear it.
