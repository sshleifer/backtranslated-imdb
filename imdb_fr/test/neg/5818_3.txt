This is the story of an investigator who hates his work - which proves why actors - even as weak as Tom Cruise and Denzel Washington - are on the big screen and your neighbors are not! <br /> <br /> However, the best times show the basics to be really funny (not just wacky), keep trying, maybe take classes, and use the time to keep learning to make a good movie . ("Dude, where is my car" and the sequence "Scary Movie" have it all on this ... college attempt.) <br /> <br /> The lighting was not; the production was not; and the script had moments (the conversation of the space - very nice attempt executed in an unconvincing way). (That made me think of "Dark Star" - which talks about "losing in space" - but this movie is simply lost.) <br /> <br /> The talent was the bartender (he said "dog "So boring that I knew he had to play ... was not it ... now, that's the role!), Mark Hammond and Marty's guy. I guess I gave a point to the film for each one of them ... 3/10. <br /> <br /> -LD <br /> <br /> ______________________________________________ <br /> <br /> my faith: http://www.angelfire.com/ny5/jbc33/
