I knew I was not going to see a quality movie when this title was included in a "B-level video night" at a friend's house. Despite the warnings, I was still surprised at the seriousness of this film. It was fortunate that many of us shared our pain. The film tries to tell the story of a dark future, one in which Hawk (a character of the Mad Max type) goes to the rescue. Damsel in distress. In fact, the plot is a barely disguised excuse for producers to promote their own philosophies about life (look at the end credits and the disclaimer "these people are not true" in the end for a real laugh) . The film often lacks direction and does not develop its characters to any degree. What's even worse is the editing of this movie. The film repeats scenes (often 10 to 20 seconds) up to 4 or 5 times in a row. I think it was an attempt to emulate things like Jean Claude Van-Damme's fight sequences, but if it does, it fails completely. The film would probably be about 1/3 of its length if we did not have to see the main character move his head in front of the setting sun half a dozen times (yes, that's all that happens in this scene repeated). I give this film my prize for the "worst movie I've ever seen". I doubt that it will be soon exceeded.
