I too had waited a long time to see this film. As far as I know, it was never published in Australia, I found a copy on the network and I ordered it through. A few weeks after the confirmation of my order, she finally arrived and I was extremely excited to finally sit in front of my TV, ready to watch a film of such interesting and controversial quality, filmed in a region of the world where there are so many good movies. What a desappointment. In the very first minutes, I realized that I had ordered a B grader, but that I was hopeful. I convinced my 18-year-old son to watch him with me because I like to share when I find a valuable movie with good underlying statements and / or stories. About halfway through, he got up and said he could not stand, so predictable and amateurish. I accepted but I watched to the end. The acting was atrocious even for Grade B standards. The stereotypes are also predictable and I think of the people of Lake Arthur, Louisiana, who had to crack after seeing the movie portraying them that way. There is no doubt that some racial prejudice still exists in many parts of the world, not only in the United States, but really, nowadays, I doubt that they will get away with all the ridiculous alibi presented here. I had to check the date the film was shot, as I was expecting their attempts to film more horrible scenes with fantasy as a first attempt by a high school student to make an indie movie. ". I would like this film to be put in the hands of experienced screenwriters and directors, be it an old story, but which could still have a punch if it were treated in a professional manner. So disappointed after such a long wait and with such expectations. The soundtrack was probably the only thing I liked.
