I was expecting a documentary covering the years 1950 to 1965 of science fiction and I received a big commercial message mixed with leftist political insinuations of James Cameron and baby-mogul of the cinema repelling their own works. "Watch the Skies" has referred in the past to the "Giant Bug" and "Space Exploration" movies of the 1950s, including favorite movies such as "Earth vs. Flying Saucers", "Thing From Another world "and" Forbidden Planet ". "Them", "Deadly Mantis" and "Tarantula". There are some low budget examples that are rarely mentioned, such as "Space Monster", "12 to the Moon" and "Cosmic Man". <br /> <br /> This would have been a much better documentary if the few remaining actors, directors, stuntmen and collectors, as well as non-Hollywood boomers of the time had been interviewed. I just wish there was a score of "0", since a "1" is worth a lot to generous.
