Not just the money we paid to rent or go to the movies. I'm talking about how big production companies are wasting so much money on boring and not ridiculous things. With millions of people, they used to make a film like this, because I do not think the actors here would actually work for free or for an insignificant sum. With that money, imagine how many good independent movies you could do, or maybe a good Hollywood movie. It's just to rip you off, but not just anyone, just the majority of teens who are willing to go see a Ashton Kutcher movie, just because they are his fans. I do not know how a man of common sense could play in this kind of film. If you look at it prospectively, the actors have the same quality as this film. So I guess I should not be surprised, I could not really hope for more.
