The Polar Express. Director Robert Zemeckis, I love Back to the Future, Forrest Gump, Contact and Who Framed Roger Rabbit (NO BRAND QUESTION AFTER THIS FILM TITLE !!). And Tom Hanks, one of my favorite actors. The critics of this film were almost unanimous in saying that it is a classic vacation. Ebert & Roeper give him two ENTHUSIASTIC thumbs! Even Ebert's critics have awarded him four stars! Wow ... OK ... that, I have to see! But wait ... the motion capture used seems really weird. Hmm ... maybe I'm not so interested in seeing this anymore. <br /> <br /> "Well, are you coming?" said the train driver to the boy in the Polar Express. The boy is reluctant at first and the train starts his journey without him. The boy quickly changes his mind and jumps on board just in time. <br /> <br /> Now, most of you have probably decided not to board this train and wait for the TV-train or the Rental Express (hey, I'm so smart and smart ). For my part, I was like the boy who was skeptical at first, but jumped on it to see what was happening. <br /> <br /> I just lost $ 10 and two hours of my life. <br /> <br /> I can not even begin to explain the pain in my stomach. The Polar Express was so painful to sit still that it was not even funny. There is no story. There is no reward. You sit through this series of events and wonder "is there any interest in all this?" It would be a thing if the scenes were entertaining ... but that's not the case. <br /> <br /> This film is devoid of any emotion, any soul, any ounce of plausibility, and especially all fun. This movie is not fun. <br /> <br /> And let's talk about how these characters expect a second. To say that it's the same technology (movement, sorry, capture "PERFORMANCE") used to make Gollum is really a shame because Gollum was Croyable !!! Photorealism simply does not translate well into this medium. You use animation, why not design the characters so that they are more expressive? Or why not film everything with real actors? They could certainly have it. As people, we know all too well how we walk, talk, interact with things. To see this on the screen unconvincingly is not impressive. The convincing caricatures are all the more believable as The Incredibles has proved. The result of The Polar Express is now as if they were taking corpses of dead children and transforming them into puppets. They move and talk, but where is the heart? Where is the soul? That's what we see on the screen. UGH UGH UGH UGH UGH! This movie is so horrible! <br /> <br /> There is an early scene in the movie where the boy takes a girl train ticket from his seat because she got up and left it. He wants to give it to him but you sit there saying "why ?!" Just leave her ... she's coming back! He obviously loses the ticket and "adventure" follows. And then there is a boy who is stuck in the back of the train all the time and who brings him hot chocolate, but he can not go up and join the rest of the children? And then there's this boring "know it all" kid with the voice of a 35 year old. It's so disturbing. <br /> <br /> Oh and there are songs! A girl climbs to the back of the train where the lonely kid is. He sings a song for himself. And then she interrupts and joins! They finish the song holding hands, looking into each other's eyes as if they were in love. Very clumsy. I will not even go into the details of the hot chocolate service song while the waiters dance on the train. "keep warm keep warm!" The only scene where Tom Hanks slips on his knees with his arms up in the air must be one of the most memorable scenes in the history of bad scenes. <br /> <br /> I have to stop now or I'm killing myself. I have to watch something crappy to clean the palette. Yes ... crap, it's better than the Polar Express. <br /> <br /> "The only thing about trains, no matter where you go, what matters is to decide to ride." <br /> <br /> Do not climb on this one. . For God's sake, I decided for you! This is just another movie taken from an incredibly thin children's movie-shaped book. It happened with the Grinch and the hat cat and those were horrible too. But who can blame them? I bet if I took Berenstein Bears' Too Much Junk Food and turned it into a feature film, it would probably be pretty boring too. But at least ... there would be a story and a point, that's what the Polar Express lacks.
