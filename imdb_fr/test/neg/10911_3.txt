and totally non-scary movie. The characters are not interested at all and spend most of the time driving. The dog is at best ugly, never really scary. To interest you, a more threatening threat would have been necessary, at least a few people that you like and that arouse emotions in you. And above all, something interesting must happen. Something inexplicable. In reality, this film hangs around again and again, in what seems to be an eternity. Perhaps a saint Bernhard is not smart to choose as a terrible threat to life and society? <br /> <br /> In most scary movies / thrillers / mysteries, whatever the genre, there must be characters that arouse interest and make you crazy want to know what's going on. Here you do not really care, you just wait until everything stops and you wonder if it would be better to see something else. One of the weakest adaptations of the king.
