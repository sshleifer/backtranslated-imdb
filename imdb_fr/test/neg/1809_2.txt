A version made for Dark Heart television seemed like a good way to add more insight to the book, well, that was a false assumption. The film made the situation worse. I was very disappointed with almost everything in the movie. I was hoping that the film would eventually help to assemble pieces of the book that I did not understand, but that was not the case. It always left me confused and suspended. This is one of those movies that gives the impression that it would be more fun to watch grass grow instead of watching the movie. This is not anyone's cup of tea. Overall it was a horrible film, boring and slow. <br /> <br /> To begin with, Nicolas Roeg must have been rather desperate when he decided that he wanted to undertake the task of turning the already boring book into a film. It's a guaranteed loss. It's like going into a knife fight, but forget about the knife on the kitchen counter. The person without knife will lose; and in the case, the person without knives was Roeg. All I've heard about the movie are bad things, and the film deserves these bad things to say about it. Watching the film, I felt that the film's authors had flipped through the book to understand the key points. <br /> <br /> In addition, although the film followed the main story of the book, it left many details and also changed the end. I'm not a fan of that. Roeg dropped when Marlow and his crew passed through the Russian sailor's camp and found the book. In addition, it was not seen when, at the camp, they came across a sign saying, "Drink for you, hurry up, take a cautious approach" (Conrad 110). In addition, at the end of the book, Kurtz dies on the boat, not at the inner train station. <br /> <br /> On the contrary, Nicolas Roeg did a good thing by making his film; he managed to engage actors decent enough to play in the film. For example, he acquired Tim Roth and John Malkovich, who then have a successful career. In doing so, he added a little something to the horrible film. Moreover, although I tear up his book in tatters, I have a little respect, because it takes a lot of courage to try to face The Heart of Darkness. This is not exactly the easiest novel to describe in a movie. Twus a valiant effort, however! In conclusion, if for some reason someone really wants to watch this film, I suggest first to read Heart of Darkness. This way, you will get all the scenes left outside the movie and you will not be completely lost when you watch it. But I really suggest that you do not read the book and that you do not really watch the movie; both will be a total loss of your time. Believe me. My English teacher forced me to do both. Now, I would like the book and the movie do not exist. If the book or the movie is pursued, good luck!
