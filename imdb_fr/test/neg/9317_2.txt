Help me! Once again, Paul Schrader sabotaged his own intentions with a dull and pedantic narration. I reorganized the holidays to be able to see this "world premiere". What an error! Why did Schrader even want to make an exorcist film? The high intentions are good, but if I wanted 2 hours of theological babbling, I would visit my nephew's Sunday school. Father Merrin's struggle with his faith, as presented in his younger days, is a potentially interesting topic. But an exorcist film needs more! The dragging, relentless presentation, accompanied by ridiculous special effects, gives rise to a strange production. Who is this film for? I did not bother to see Harlin's version, but at least they apparently tried to deliver some kind of visceral chills. <br /> <br /> The Exorcist series was quite strange. The first movie was excellent, but each sequel was unloved and useless. Why do they continue to manufacture them? I guess Schrader managed to make a lot of money. But why should we go?
