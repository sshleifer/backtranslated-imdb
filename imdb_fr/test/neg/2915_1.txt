Remember those old kung-fu movies that we were watching on Friday and Saturday in the late evening, when our babysitters thought we were in charge? Well, this movie plays exactly like one of those movies. Patsy Kensit's biggest claim was Mel Gibson's character interest in "Lethal Weapon 2", and this performance was one of the reasons she was never so important: a terrible actress. <br /> <br /> In "Lethal Weapon 2", I thought she was cute. Pretty cute to watch some of the other movies she went to, including "Loves Music, Loves to Dance", another big failure that obviously did not impress me either. But, as attractive as it may seem to me, my soul screamed at me to extinguish it because it played another inexpensive and predictable role, and did it very badly. <br /> <br /> In this film, Kensit plays the role of an actress (and not good either) who works in the clubs of France (she can not cut in her own country, so she bleeds her ears), which has no chance, but, worse yet, the French government wants to throw it because of an expired visa (or maybe they just caught his act). But she gets married to this Casanova (Freiss), who is not so lucky, and the predictability begins ... terribly! Is there a way to give this movie a NEGATIVE rating? 1 out of 10 stars is overvaluing!
