This film is a total waste of time. I can not understand anyone sitting in this bin. Oh, I would have loved it when I was seven. I think a seven-year-old may have written and realized it. <br /> <br /> There is no script, no acting, just waste. The best game is the fighting cocks. I think I could whip those ninjas and I'm not someone you consider difficult. Totally unconvincing and did not attract any interest. I yawned and laughed at the end of the first ten minutes of the film. It's the one that would divert people from martial art movies. Great comedy, bad action movie.
