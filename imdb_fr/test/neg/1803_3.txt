The film adaptation of Heart of Darkness is disappointing, both as a film and as a representation of Joseph Conrad's classic story. <br /> <br /> There are several small differences between the book and the film, but this is expected in any book-to-film transition. Kurtz dies in a different place; the manager does not accompany Marlow on his journey; Kurtz's mistress spends much more time with him than in the story. The real problem is the amount of footage that is inserted into the movie but has no basis in the actual story. For some reason, the director finds it necessary to "spice up" a few scenes, adding dramas or actions that rarely make sense and that are still irrelevant to the story. Some examples that come to mind are Kurtz's "mistress" who strikes Marlow on the head and knocks him out. Nothing happens as long as he is unconscious and Marlow did not even provoke the attack. A few hours pass and he wakes up: total loss of time. Kurtz has a company monkey who, for whatever reason, kills on a whim. In addition, when Marlow leaves Kurtz's post, he takes the "noble" decision to leave behind the invaluable ivory he had obtained, for no real reason. Another defect is Kurtz's character. John Malkovich is a terrible choice to play the man who is described as great and inspiring: a man with an imposing presence. He whispers practically all his lines which, in the hands of a more capable actor, could have been very stimulating. I can not remove the image of John Malkovich playing a mentally handicapped man in Of Mice and Men when I watch him play Kurtz. Overall, I would give 3 out of 10 stars to the movie. It's a good movie if you've read the book and want to see it as a movie, perhaps to help you visualize the scenes, but as a source of entertainment, I would never recommend it.
