Alien Express is one of the worst movies I've ever known. <br /> <br /> The plot is predictable. Extraterrestrials look like rubber sock puppets. The effects would have been poor in the 1970s, but they are simply awful by today's standards. Could not they photograph a real train instead of using an obvious model? <br /> <br /> The game of actors is not great but, in reality, dialogue is the worst part. He makes his way in your mind. "Do not die on me, not now." If you succeed in suspending disbelief long enough to be absorbed by the film, you will quickly be hurled back to reality by the extraterrestrials, the miniature train or the clich√© dialogue. <br /> <br /> The only reason I did not give a "1" to this film is that it did not deserve to be judged so badly that poor cupping could look at it for pleasure inherent in a very bad movie.
