Emraan Hashmi post MURDER has done good roles in Bhatt movies but another director has just used his hugging and naughty image <br /> <br /> already fed up with him and such roles <br /> <br /> > The film has a beautiful turn at the beginning I felt like a film of Abbas Mustan but then it turns into a routine movie with a sudden love, a sudden jealousy and a bad climax <br /> <br /> Anant Mahadevan makes a terrible movie Music is a saved hi The work of the camera is fabulous <br /> <br /> Emraan Hashmi just repeats the act of his previous movies and has 2 expressions through Dino, the stiff air speaks like if he practiced Hindi and was fine in some scenes, Udita is expressionless and irritated
