Good things first: I agree with another viewer who said that Gene Raymond had a wonderful drunken scene. He does it - I was tickled to finally have a chance to laugh. And there were other moments that I found amusing - Raymond's parents in the bathroom with faulty plumbing and the restaurant scene with Robert Montgomery trying to make Carole Lombard jealous by making sweet words a stranger. <br /> <br /> But overall, I was dismayed. I love Carol Lombard and most people from Hitchcock. And I understand the restrictions imposed on productions by the Hays Code. But it was embarrassing and awful to watch. Of course, I knew they would end up together, it's a romantic comedy after all. But that made no sense, it happened too fast. Moreover, I can not believe that the professions of love are confronted with such painful behavior, both physical and conflictual.
