This movie reminds me of Harry Potter - not the style but the marketing strategy. There may be the second part, the third part ... until the end of the product life cycle, of course, provided that the first part is commercially successful. so many things seem to be hidden and the story seems rather incomplete. the action design is boring. the scenography is ok but not very good. Edison Chen might be a big star someday. It really looks charming even on the big screen. The most impressive is Anthony Wong. 4/10 <br /> <br />
