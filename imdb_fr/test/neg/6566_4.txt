I do not think I can add much more to what has already been said about this film. However, I can offer a little memory of seeing ST-V in the theater. In the last (horrible) scene, as the camera retreated from the photo of the campsite and it seemed likely that the credits would begin to roll at any time, the audience seemed to rise in unison. Normally, for a film like this one, at least some unconditional fans remain to watch until the last withdrawal. As the people withdrew, I remember not hearing gay, cheerful jokes, but only low whispers. <br /> <br /> I remember reading a movie review in the local newspaper in which the reviewer said it was so serious that only Trek fans would like. What an idiot. The fans were the most apt to tear it first! <br /> <br /> Scene of choice: Target shooting with a space probe Voyager, through a periscope, no less! Space must be a much smaller frontier than we thought.
