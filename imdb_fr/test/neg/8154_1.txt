The only thing I thought I did not have in this movie was a smart, talking bike. <br /> <br /> This film is simply awful. I gave it a star, which of course means that I greatly appreciated. Bad acting, bad writing, bad direction, bad fight choreography. The only real actor of this film is Martin Landau, who of course plays the role of the villain, although the character is your diabolical standard cardboard cutout, the CEO / Villain. Even the so-called "plot" in the end was not a shock. <br /> <br /> There was so much to make fun of this movie that I liked a lot. And he had some impressive car stunts. <br /> <br /> Do you like bad movies? Check this one, Ouch. Want a good movie? Not here.
