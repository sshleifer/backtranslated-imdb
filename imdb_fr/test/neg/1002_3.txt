To my surprise, I was trained in this film at first because I did not intend to watch it at all. Now, I wish I did not do it. The suspense starts well, with success and death leading to death and the question of whether the guilty character will confess, or be discovered, or (feasible now, though not, in the old days of film making) Turn the page. The plot has already been made - which has not been done - but the tensions associated with it, along with the additional complications and motivations arising from the illicit love relationship, are a fascinating first half. Then, the film abandons the success to embark on a hazy exhibition of two loves not shared and without suffering. The two sides of the plot - random love and unreasonable love - just do not have enough to do with each other, and they imply the same characters do not tie them enough to justify the departure from the original story line. The screenwriter should have chosen one or the other plot. At the end of the film, in the middle of the film's second funeral, I thought, "What does this all have to do with this hit-and-run?" The filmmakers may think that the answer is obvious, but I think the film was conspiracy and executed in the wave.
