So, unfortunately, my companion and I watched this !!! It was broadcast on a Sky channel called "Zone Horror", which basically shows horror movies of rotten B movies 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. It was a boring Friday night, so I decided to laugh and take a look at this one. Aside from the atrocious gameplay, the intrigue, the disastrous effects, the mediocre work of the camera and the ridiculous brain that makes it all ridiculous, it was OK, LOL !!! Seriously, it was all a laugh that consisted of digging holes and laughing crazy actors. There is a bit of semi-nudity that has reassembled the film a little, unfortunately, it is "the uggo" which has become topless while my companion calls it: oD If you get bored one night and it happens product, take a chance, you may like it :)
