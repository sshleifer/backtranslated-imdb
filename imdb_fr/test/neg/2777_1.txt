I'm not sure I've seen a movie that bad. Bad acting, conspiracy everywhere, terrible special effects. There are some moments "so bad that it's good" here but not enough to maintain interest. The woman playing Tracey looks hideous. There are some rather disturbing scenes with a dwarf that leave you with a slight sense of violation. On the benefits side, the operating scenes are quite fun for the special effects, as is the car chase where a car "tries to force us to leave the road" without making any contact. I guess the budget was not excessive. Oh, and what looks like a Taj Mahal postcard is shown every time they visit a fictional alien country.
