I guess this is in the public domain as on his DVD. First of all, it's a good propaganda film that has to be shown to an Australian public during the war. This is why we should not consider this film as a serious account of Tobruk. The first half to 3/4 is very dry and takes place in Australia. Like many American war movies where recruits meet, I guess it's so long. Then we come to Africa and Tobruk, very bad, low budget. The battle scenes on the copy of the DVD I watched were almost completely black. See if you must, but be ready to use the fast forward because I doubt that you can take it after a few minutes. I really liked the "Battle of El Alamien" in Italy, very cute. Richard Burton also made an African theatrical war movie that was good "The Desert Rats", this film is just a real movie and should have stayed at that time, do not resist well today (I doubt that he was highly regarded at the time either). I say the same thing about the war films of my American counterpart, so do not take it personally. Australians (I like Australia, I've been there twice!).
