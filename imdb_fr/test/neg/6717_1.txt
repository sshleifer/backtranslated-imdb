I think this film was shot upside down. They first shot lots of scenes, action and explosions, then the writers set to work trying to find a story that connects all the scenes. this movie is without a doubt the worst movie I have ever seen, your average porn movie comes with a much better script and much more consistent script. The film does not make sense. Seriously, even if you're a Segal fan, you'll NEVER want to see this movie unless you're one of those who likes to watch accidents, because it's a horrible accident and should never have been published. on this world. <br /> <br /> Boran.
