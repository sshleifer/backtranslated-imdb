I saw this at my in-laws' house one night, when it happened on television and my mother-in-law said it was one of her favorite movies. Well, she can have it. <br /> <br /> Listen, I can enjoy a nana movie from time to time, as long as it's good. But this one is extra-sappy, unrealistic and quite predictable, despite some decent performances by Rock Hudson and Jane Wyman. It is strange to see how quickly a woman can accept that her sight is taken away. Oh, they say that love is blind ... <br /> <br /> The happy little ending, tidy and tidy, almost shut me up. And how many times did we need Otto Kruger to repeat the title? It happened not once, not twice, but THREE times!
