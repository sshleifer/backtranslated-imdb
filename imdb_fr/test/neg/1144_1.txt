I sat every 2 hours. I do not know what was worse, the plot, the lame characters or the Hawaiian hottie who Eddie's kid and his 80-year-old grandfather made sexual advances. The money spent on it was thrown on the throne. Matty Simmons should be ashamed. The original idea of ​​this movie was "A Swiss Griswold family" and it was kind of messy. The only good thing is that the ratings were so bad that we will never see that again on TV. AVOID ALL COSTS ... RENT ERNEST SAVES XMAS or something else.
