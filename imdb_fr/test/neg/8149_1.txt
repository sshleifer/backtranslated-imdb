With the little respect it deserves, I would like to say that this film was horrible. The filmmakers had good intentions, but the overall quality of the staging and the value of production was clearly lacking. I would recommend this film to anyone who likes to laugh, and who still loses two hours of their life to live a truly painful experience. I'm surprised I even found this movie on the $ 1 DVD holder where it was well placed. I thought it was going to be good and I could discover an unbelievable independent movie - I was wrong. I wish I had never seen this movie. My 3 year old cousin could not make a worse movie. I'm glad I saw the movie because I can finally tell people that I have seen the worst movie of all time and be sure of it.
