I generally liked the Carry on movies, but this one is actually pretty awful. There are very few laughs because everything is so forced. There is a lot of talent on the screen and some are doing better than others. June Whitfield, Kenneth Williams, Hatti Jaques and Peter Butterworth go well, but Barbara Windsor looks tired and Sid James is just ugly. Joan Sims is doing well, but in the case of Charles Hawtrey, who is generally wonderful, he is simply sad. When one thinks of the sad end of his career, the film is almost too depressing to be watched. The homophobia of the film is nasty and it is a very unpleasant experience. The set seems cheap and unlike the other films in the series, the film takes place very clearly in England. The seaside looks cold and there are few attempts to create illusions here. It looks like a cheap production. You will be surprised at how unhappy you are to watch this, especially if you liked the show.
