Terrible adaptation of Heminway's discreet love story. An American soldier (Rock Hudson) falls in love with a British nurse (Jennifer Jones) in Italy during the First World War. What is the problem with that? Virtually everything. Hudson is WAY out of his depth here. He could be a good actor but not in this movie. Jones is way too old for her role (she is 21 years old in the book - here she is 38 ... and that's it!). Moreover, his game oscillated between the gifted and the underused! They took a simple story of discreet love and ruined everything. The film is inevitably long (a little over 150 minutes), complacent and ridiculed. It seems that producer David O. Selznick thought he was starting again with "Gone With the Wind". Some landscapes are really beautiful (even on a small TV screen), but there are not enough stories to match the pictures. <br /> <br /> SPOILER !!! The end of Jones' death is supposed to be tragic, but the exaggerated theatrical and theatrical misinterpretation made me fight not to laugh! <br /> <br /> To make matters worse, the actor Vittorio De Sica exaggerates to a point really embarrassing. Overblown, self-indulgent, poorly cast and slow. Pretty terrible. It was (of course) a critical financial bomb and ended Selznick's career as a producer. You may want to give some of the landscape at the end, but it is not worth it. I give him a 3.
