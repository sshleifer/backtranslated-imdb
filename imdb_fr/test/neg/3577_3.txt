"R Xmas" looks at the life of a family of married middle-class narco-distributors during the Christmas season. There is no story here - just a rambling collection of events. Ferrara seems to have taken the train of juxtaposing holidays and family life with narcotics peddling in New York, jumping between them. Players seem to improve and adapt from time to time an unconvincing watch. Overall, a mediocre effort is not worth it. (RE)
