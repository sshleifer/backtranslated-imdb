I thought there might be some level of value for this movie and I sat down for it all. I can summarize by saying that it left a bad taste in my mouth. <br /> <br /> The movie started well, I think Herc's initial characterization was true to myth. Child and young adult, he started strong enough, but not the brightest bulbs. But later, he becomes a charismatic speaker loved by all. Huh? <br /> <br /> Another problem: terrible CGI. The satyr seemed to be fine, but the rest of the critters looked horrible, especially the hart, the most phonetic beast in the movie. And how is it that Leelee Sobieski's skin is sometimes golden, sometimes normal? The worst part for me - and everyone should regret it - was the twelve labors of Hercules. Because the producers obviously did not want to cover them all; perhaps they thought that the primitive screw heads observing this waste could not count so high. Instead of the TWELVE works of Hercules, we got the FIVE works of Hercules. Yes, the five jobs! WTF?!? He did not even finish last, so it was really the 4 1/2 jobs! Simply terrible. I'll take Hercules: The legendary journeys on this shit, any day of the week.
