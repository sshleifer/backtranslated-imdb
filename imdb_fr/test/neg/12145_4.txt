GOLD RAIDERS (1951) <br /> <br /> Sad western with the Three Stooges (including Shemp Howard at this point, which I've always enjoyed as "Third Stooge") doing their usual job, led by Edward Bernds, a trustworthy man, who has also directed some of their funniest classic shorts - so what's wrong with this time? The most likely answer is that what worked well as a 15-minute film on two reels is too long for a 55-minute feature film. Unlike most of their classic shorts, GOLD RAIDERS does not deserve to be revisited. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 on ****
