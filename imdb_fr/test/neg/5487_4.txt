I liked all the movies of Lilo and Stitch. The TV series was not great, but I put my opinion of the series aside when I watched this movie. And I have to say ... it was bad. <br /> <br /> The animation was something that disappointed me. Yes, you heard it Animation. I found its quality greatly degraded since the first film. Its quality was at the height of that of the television series, which I did not expect at all. If you're looking for candy, do not wait. In addition, the animation did not portray serious moods. Even in the supposed sad scenes, I felt nothing for the character, another downgrade compared to the first movie. <br /> <br /> The next was the absolutely horrible voice game. I found that very unconvincing and wondered why Disney, with all its riches and glory, could not afford players doubled with a real talent. The skills of the actors of the voice were as annoying as those of the series. I tolerated the one from the show because, hey, who would not be tired when it's sung for so many episodes? Heck, I do not even know how many episodes there are (theoretically, there are 624, but I can not believe it). However, I thought the acting game would improve in the movie, and the truth forced me to believe that what they could do in the show was already their best. <br /> <br /> Then it was the horrible script. It was nerdy beyond redemption, and writers are just trying too hard. They try to make jokes, but I just found them annoying. Maybe it was not the voice, but the nerdy dialogues that ruined the sound section. (On the plus side, the soundtrack was not too bad and fit the mood pretty well.) <br /> <br /> Fourth, the problem was the scenario. I predicted everything, and the scenario was what made the characters so unoriginal and so inimitable suddenly. You have the extraterrestrials get new positions and new responsibilities in the external space. After the initial hype, they realize they do not really like it and miss their old life. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, the evil villain is out of jail after a very action-packed action scene and breaks into Jumbaa's lab to steal his experience. The experiment was then cloned in another 100 and the hamster wants to conquer the Earth. When the main characters discover it, they try to stop the evil hamster but find themselves faced with a risky final confrontation against the experience. The characters then give up their new privileges and return to Earth to resume their lives. Seriously, how many other movies have already used this ending? This scenario was extremely short and formulated according to your formulas, so do not wait too long. <br /> <br /> Disney has failed in sound, graphics and screenplay. The only charm of the series was the original characters, and how they managed to retain the "touch" of the characters, but even that could not save the movie. I tried to love him, really, but I gave him a score of 4/10. Another failure of Disney.
