Step Up is a film about dance that tells the story of some children who get their great performance. The film is average in every way with a little more for the viewer. A jock fights external prejudices to become a dancer with an accomplished partner and a teacher who sees something special. The acting was good, but the dialogue and staging had little to add to overcome a predictable story. Nevertheless, you are still quite satisfied with the outcome of the film. There were dark scenes and typical generalizations about the dancers going a bit too far. It is a class B + film with moderate continuity errors and dialogue problems. The landscape was good and the characters remained faithful to life. It's worth watching if you like this kind of movie.
