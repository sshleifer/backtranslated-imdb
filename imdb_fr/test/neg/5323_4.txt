Once, I would like to see Koontz's work entrusted to a writer, director and a decent producer! JUST ONCE! <br /> <br /> It's a good attempt by Jean LeClerc and Chris Sarandon, and an even better attempt by Victoria Tennant, but all the rest is just pure crap. The screenwriter should be filmed for having built Koontz's work that way and the director ... please. <br /> <br /> The story is a well written story, but the screenplay is pretty dull, incredible and horribly executed. The only things that work are the performances of LeClerc, Sarandon and Tennant. <br /> <br /> On a personal note, I really wanted it to work. I love Koontz's novels, but they have never given them the attention, support and talent they deserve. If they invested the same money in Koontz's work that they shoveled into King's, they would rise up quickly. But unfortunately! Without powerful people who believe in his work, I'm afraid he never gets the chance. <br /> <br /> As an adaptation to the novel, this film was a total party. As an independent film, it was not so bad, though extremely weak in many places, with huge holes in the plot and a terrible, rigid and unprofessional dialogue that should never have happened the final cup. This film failed miserably to realize its potential. If they had followed the original work of Koontz, a little closer, and invested a decent amount of production money, it could have been a much better company. <br /> <br /> However, all I can see in this is how it could have been and was not. <br /> <br /> Gives a score of 4.3 / 10 to ... <br /> <br /> the Fiend :.
