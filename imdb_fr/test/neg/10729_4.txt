Dick and Jane Harper (Jim Carrey, Téa Leoni) find themselves unemployed when the society for which Dick works is caught in a corruption scandal out of poverty. <br /> <br /> I have always been a fan of Jim Carrey. It's been a long time since he did a comedy straight. The last one was Bruce Almighty, which was pretty good. He proved that he was capable of serious drama, but comedy was his true element. Having fun with Dick and Jane proves that he still has it. Even though the movie was funny, it was always disappointing. It was not as funny as I thought. It's worth looking at once, even though, unlike most of Carrey's movies, repetition is not good. Part of the problem is the script. I was surprised that the script is weak because it's the same guy who created The Forty Year Old Virgin. Some of the jokes fall flat and other times they seem to try too hard. If Jim Carrey was not there, the movie would have been a lot worse. <br /> <br /> Alongside Jim Carrey is Téa Leoni. She is a good actress but it's not very funny. She does not fit well with Carrey and she seemed to be phoning for her performance. They should have gone with someone else. The secondary cast includes Alec Baldwin, Richard Jenkins and Aaron Michael Jenkins. The latter plays Billy Harper and he gives a decent performance. He was not as annoying as most star kids. Alec Baldwin was fine and Richard Jenkins was trying too hard to be funny. To be honest, I am a bit biased. The movie was pretty average overall but I liked it more because of Jim Carrey's performance. Jim Carrey fans should enjoy it but that's about it. In the end, having fun with Dick and Jane is a fun way to spend 90 minutes but it's not very memorable. Rating 6/10
