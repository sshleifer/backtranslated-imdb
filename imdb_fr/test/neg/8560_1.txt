I can not even describe it. it's the worst movie I've ever seen (I'm a nice guy when I call it a movie). Just another big budget is for someone who does not want to think much. It's not even scary. It is disgusting when there are big films that never reach the big screen and then comes this "trick" to deceive moviegoers. I guess the big producers are doing what they want. <br /> <br /> Find a great producer, hot girls (though horrible actresses) and a ton of horror movies and cook for about a week. get "The Nun". <br /> <br /> And I thought Bad Boys 2 was horrible !!!!
