it is difficult to distinguish actors from non-actors. Bad American films can be spotted by all young people, preceding each line of dialogue with "You know what?" Bad Canadian films can be spotted by all the young people ending each line of dialogue with "Eh?" Have we learned nothing in a century of cinema? The total weight of millions of wannabes that come down on Hollywood with scripts and reels in hand can not save us from these horrible made-to-order TV movies?
