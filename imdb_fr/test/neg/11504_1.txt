When I saw this show for the first time, I thought, "What is it !!!!!?" This is one of those shows where there is a perfect fake college world with stupid problems that are considered "huge". Then there is Sadie. This maladaptive complete for his friends and his family. She is completely obsessed with nature, although it is not a bad thing but she compares high school students to animals! like what is it !? they also made him another clone of Lizzie Miguire (yeah because the world really needs another one of those!). She is also very perfect as most girls on TV are what makes me sick! So please, it's a stupid show, it does not make any sense to skip it, unless you like Lizzie McGuire or any other show like that.
