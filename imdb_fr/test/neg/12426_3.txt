What can I say about such a bad movie? The people who made this film did not even try to make the monster realistic. You never see more than her head, and the head is just a giant puppet that has little movement except when she opens her mouth to roar. And the sound they used for the roar is the best part. At many times in the movie, it looks exactly like a TIE fighter flying over! I could not believe it when I first heard it and had to rewind it a few times to get it inside. Except for the terrible monster and the sounds it makes, there is not much more to this film except for some Cretan attacks. scenes and the Scottish fool attacking children trying to have an intimate moment in his castle. Nevertheless, you can watch if you like this type of waste. I know I'm doing ....
