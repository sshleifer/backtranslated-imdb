SPOILERS THROUGH: <br /> <br /> Not good. The movie was completely different from the book (the book was not really a classic, but it was really good.) <br /> <br /> I guess Demi Moore was OK. In fact, I do not remember much of his performance in one way or another. However, the big disappointment did not concern Ms. Moore. <br /> <br /> WHY did the one who did the rewrite decide to make the millionaire suddenly afraid? (I refer to him as "the millionaire" because he also had a different name in the film and then in the version of the book, just another change.) <br /> <br /> People who did not not read the book obviously won I do not know anything that is different but in the BOOK version, this guy is a lot more ruthless and complex overall. He is also fascinating. The fact that such a big change took place in the film changes the whole plot. It was almost like seeing a completely different movie. <br /> <br /> I know that LOTS of movies vary considerably from books. But I also thought that the character of Redford was a bit of a jerk. It's not Redford's fault (he's a great actor and he could have played ruthlessly), but without these qualities he becomes just another dazzled and amorous man; It was not really the purpose of the book. <br /> <br /> It could have been much better. Even if I had not read the version of the book, I would not have liked it too much, but changing so many things makes me lose a lot of points.
