It is a typical and very average academic comedy. The story is correct but not very funny. This is an unlucky guy named Reno who loses his job, gets scammed and his uncle dies in a bar. He has a girlfriend (a beautiful one, by the way) :-). Anyway, this uncle gives him his hotel in LA and Mercedes as an inheritance and soon, Reno and his girlfriend are moving to Los Angeles in this new house. The problem is that they would need roommates to pay the high rent of this house, which explains the course of the film ... <br /> <br /> Suddenly, the film turns right in hell. .. The end is BAD. Really bad. It destroys everything in the movie. You'll know what I'm talking about when you see the movie ... <br /> <br /> 2/10
