I could say it would be a bad idea for the trailer, but the lure of the DVD box forced me to rent it anyway. My boy was right .. <br /> <br /> Also, for some reason, the DVD version is VERY fuzzy and unclear at times (in terms of video quality). Looks like they shot the whole movie with a 20-year-old camcorder, it's so bad. I really did not like the plot, and after watching the movie, I was very disappointed. I will NOT talk to those who spoil, but it will be said that the end was so bad that I laughed, it has been done so many times before. <br /> <br /> The whole story seems to come from an English schoolboy paper. If I had to consider a movie as the worst horror movie I've ever seen, this one might be. I can not believe they actually released this movie. It's really not worth the rent, or a penny of someone's money, unless you want to laugh at the film's expense.
