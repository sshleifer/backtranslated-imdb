Three businessmen are involved in a bar fight with three mysterious men. The three businessmen take revenge, which degenerates into murder. Supposedly, the story speaks of the violence that could happen to ordinary people. <br /> <br /> The plot has too many holes. Details have been ignored to advance the story. The acting was uneven. The color balance was awful even though I watched this movie on DVD. The tight budget and tight schedule were obvious. All this seems to be an excuse to shoot the last cannon fight, and the end was amazing.
