The film starts relatively well and seems to go somewhere when an African-American passenger sues an airline for negligence. There is a scene in which his dog is sucked into the engine and it's really sad. But the way it is described makes it difficult to understand whether it was an attempt at rude humor or a real tragedy to reflect on the extent of neglect? After that moment, they clearly lacked ideas. If you stay in the area long enough, you'll soon be treated to one of the worst movies ever made. It's basically a very racist sequence of drugs, toilet humor, style of every segment of the plane, reflecting the Afro-American pop culture and virtually nothing else. One would think that the only 3 white passengers on board would result in hilarious consequences, but nothing like that happens. They were simply added to show how much they could be treated, and then accepted, if they behaved well. To avoid.
