Barricade finds Alice Faye without any song as a refugee trying to flee China without a passport. She's in a lot of trouble, I will not say exactly what, and even American extraterritoriality will not help her. <br /> <br /> I mention it because of one of the grievances that the Chinese, including the bandits who attack The American mission in this story, deeply rooted in the interior of China, was this particular institution by which American citizens who had committed crimes were tried by American courts set up by our consulates. However, we were far from the only country to do so. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the story begins with her on a train to Shanghai, trying to use a Russian hokey accent. The intrigue focus Warner Baxter which is beautifully coated. <br /> <br /> However, bandits interrupt their journey and take refuge in the American consulate chaired by Charles Winninger. It's the best of the movie and I just want a better story to be given because I loved his character. He is a widower and proud member of the consular service, appointed in 1900 by William McKinley. He asked for a transfer ten years later and this is the last time he got news. As Assistant Secretary of State Jonathan Hale has said, he is the real forgotten man. <br /> <br /> Baxter plays well in the role that a man like Clark Gable would have played in his sleep at MGM. The exploits would have been more natural for Gable than for Baxter, the mission being barricaded and defended against the bandits. <br /> <br /> Alice Faye had a number to sing. Why Alice's song was cut off, God and Zanuck only know it. One thing I'm still trying to understand is when the people of the mission take refuge in the cellar with a hatch, who stays upstairs to pull the carpet on the cellar door? <br /> <br /> The barricade had the potential to be much better than it was. However, a neglected edition and the loss of confidence in the project made the release of 20th Century Fox an unfinished project. Watching Barricade is like eating a poorly prepared meal.
