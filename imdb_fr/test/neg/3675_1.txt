It seems that there is a great potential for the story of this film to be watched. The acting was flat and the story lacked depth. There was too much confidence in the camera work, which had some strong points. I agree with the other negative comments. I would only like to have read them before buying the DVD. The film may be worth watching for free and you are bored to crying. There could have been a lot more conspiracy with why there are homeless people in Moscow (ie post-Soviet "capitalism", endemic drug use (that is heroin traffic from Afghanistan), the USSR, the archaeologists themselves, or even more in the fight against nihilism.
