Following the classic horror movie of the 1970s, Carrie, with this offer, is like Ford following the Mustang with the Edsel. This film was horrible in every detail. It would have been entitled Beverly Hill 90210 meets the Mystery Science Theater 3000, but these two shows far exceed this tripe. This film was hardly a horror movie. I timed about 3 minutes of gore and 90 minutes of hazing and ritual in high school. Wow, what a surprise, Carrie's strange friend commits suicide! Wow, Carrie misinterprets her love interests! Wow, the crowd is hosting Carrie! Wow, the jocks have a sexual rating contest! This movie needed a lot more action and clich√©s of much less tired teenagers. This film is totally invisible.
