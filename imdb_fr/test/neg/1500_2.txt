This one presents an interesting way to manipulate a camera, <br /> <br /> especially for a digital TV movie - the version I saw was in full screen <br /> <br /> - but it is not up to the scenario department. You start with <br /> <br /> about 20 minutes of discussions, talk, talk as if you were fashionable after the "Trainspotting", then it's the most scathing city. And then comes <br /> <br /> the most dishonest ending I've ever seen, much worse than <br /> <br /> "April Fools" - where at least that made sense. So, all in all, this is the old song and dance: an interesting director is trying to follow him, but deserves a better movie. It's funny: usually, it's the actors who desperately need something better. Skip anyway, for your time
