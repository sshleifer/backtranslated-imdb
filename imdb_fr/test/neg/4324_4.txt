Perhaps the weakest film in the series "Kharis", despite the presence of John Carradine (Egyptian high priest) and George Zucco (his predecessor, hilariously afflicted by a bad case of Parkinson's disease) alongside Lon Chaney Jr. creature holder - if it was him under the bandages, because his contribution is at best negligible! I guess it's 60 minutes of viewing in itself, but the standards have been drastically lowered compared to the previous two, and the end result is a simple routine that is not memorable. The only interesting feature here is the fact that the main female role happens to be the reincarnation of Princess Ananka, which has been much mentioned in previous films but has never been seen.
