There is an undercurrent in all the positive reviews of this movie - it's just a brainless comedy, do not take it seriously. Chillax guy !!! Well, that's a point of view. The other solution would be: why do we accept exactly the same scenario, the same formula and the same unusual people in all these "comedies"? <br /> <br /> What you get is a slacker who, in totally unreal circumstances, must change his life (always a he), overcome a set of circumstances that would only cause a problem to a raccoon or a teenager, beat the equally stupid villain who tries to steal the girl he met two days ago and triumph while remaining a lazy but with more money / self-esteem. On the way, someone is doing something serious, but very illogical. This means that the viewer can call someone after the movie and say something like "you will not believe it." This guy finds the otter drowned in the bucket of diarrhea that the other guy left after eating laxative brownies Then he shines his shoes with that. Hilarious. <br /> <br /> Most of the usual names appear. David Spade and Rob Schneider are not funny, but they are crural characters: a Russian and, I stand next to me, a waiter in a vegan restaurant. Adam Sandler, the king of the illogical comic co-produces brainless and brainless, and no-one without talent, Dante, appears again. The United States will have to explain to the rest of the world how this guy Dante is famous because we have no idea. Allen Covert plays a 36-year-old man who had the biggest laugh of the night. He was 42 years old and looked older. <br /> <br /> Did I laugh? Yes, but no more than I would do at a TV sit-com and I do not have to pay a dime to watch them. Please, stop making these movies.
