Before seeing this movie, I thought there were two kinds of bad movies. (1) Your average fare, without any inspiration (eg "Constantine"), and (2) a charming job, so bad, or so bad - it's good (at the "Manos the hands of fate"). Now that I've seen "Dr. Gore", I know there's a third kind of bad film: the total shit sandwich. This will be irrevocably tattooed on your memory. Work that is execrable. Anathema. <br /> <br /> I already hated some movies, but I've never hated a film so much that my aversion reached its threshold and became SELF! Have you seen a film that makes you regret not having spent an hour looking at it, but who still grieves you an hour later? Disciples of the Mystery Science Theater, beware, it's a cinema that sucks the soul. Go rent "Circle of Iron" or "The Killer Shrews" instead.
