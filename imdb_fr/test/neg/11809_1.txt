A pre-nerd, Robert Carradine, a pre-automan, Desi Arnaz Jr., and an almost pre-pubescent, Melanie Griffith, take to the road and head to Alaska with romantic dreams of becoming wealthy salmon fishermen. Well, their dream is as exciting as this dull youth road movie. They are not particularly interesting, and the film does not really make sense, beyond "We've collected images of famous people and made a low-budget movie about their misadventures." Among the films of road films of the 60s and 70s and rebellious youth films, this one is mediocre, characters underdeveloped and little involved, little spirit, not a lot of freshness in the history, which is also fade as the muddy landscape of movies. <BR /> <br /> But, for those who care, they're heading to Alaska, and apparently, Alaska looked like the Wild West in the '70s, because everyone carries a gun and is shaken. Robert Carradine says charming things like, "I hope we can find a shower, my nuts really itch." (And this is the one with Melanie Griffith!) They are quickly robbed and forced to accept jobs. The local boss, their employer, set Melanie on the move and eventually fired Desi for not being bribed. That's when they are not smart and do not leave the city, opting instead to eat dog food or to be hungry, get beaten by the guys' sods, then take a ride in the bigwigs car. . The last half of the film abandons the bad bigwig while the trio commits a flight, leaves on the run, develops a program of kidnapping, etc. The film ends in somehow, embarrassingly and ambiguously, but since the way they did not bother to develop a lot of characters and history, it's quite appropriate. Worth a look if you are really in the 70s budget, but ultimately forgettable enough.
