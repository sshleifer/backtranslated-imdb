Horror comedy fans will love this one. Others may get angry quickly and turn it off. It's a kind of movie boyfriend, with an exaggerated violence and gore, deliberately stereotyped characters and a lot of madness. <br /> <br /> It seems to have been done on a budget of about $ 100, by a group of fraternity guys after a big beer party. There is a lead who is a frustrated nerd, and his boyfriend who pulls the pranks, who makes fun of him about 30 times a second. There's a cool monster truck chasing them for hundreds of miles, which is the highlight of the movie. Whenever this thing and its driver wearing a knotty mask appear, it's a beautiful scene. There is a mysterious girl who appears randomly in their back seat, and a lot of giant guys in overalls dragging in red elbow patches. The nerd's friend never closes his yap and puts them in a mess after another. Their arguments got on my nerves, but other aspects of the film made up for it. <br /> <br /> Pranks of sight make fun of several "psychotropic and trying to do silly things", movies are ubiquitous. Choose from the choices you like the most: Hills Have Eyes, Saw and Jeepers Creepers are the ones I've recognized. <br /> <br /> It's a nice craze, if you're in the right frame of mind. Boring sensory breweries with your friends can make viewing more fun; it's a good bet, it's the condition of the filmmakers when they put it all together.
