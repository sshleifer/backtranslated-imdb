Although David Lynch's version of Dune is agitated, clumsy and unfaithful to the novel, she is visually well-crafted and well-played. The best we can say about Sci Fi's attempt to turn Dune into a mini-series is that it's ambitious. In fact, it is practically the only positive praise that can be offered. The actors (with a few exceptions) seem happy to recite their lines with the least possible emotion and the least appropriate accents. The costumes seem to have been designed by someone with a surplus of surplus Mylar fabric and an unhealthy love for unflattering headgear. <br /> <br /> This mini-series is suffering in part from living in the shadow of Lynch already well-known effort. However, he takes elements of Lynch's film that were not present in the novel and copies them almost in bulk (that is, the Guild Steersman navigation sequence), which only encourages a negative comparison with Lynch's film. A for the effort. D for almost everything else.
