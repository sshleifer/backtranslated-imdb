Sorry, it was a sorry excuse for a movie ... a plot so disturbing that it looked like a block of Swiss cheese and a bunch of characters that seemed to me totally devoid of interpersonal relationships ... Well, of course, for Carlyle and Lee -Miller that I could have sworn was supposed to be in love .. Unlike the union of Tyler and Miller who were mostly, like the rest of the film, totally unconvincing .. although the final product was unappealing and fun for all the wrong reasons, the production values ​​were high and deserved some recognition..but, unfortunately, the end result was zero, what did everyone think ...? they certainly should have packed early on this one ..
