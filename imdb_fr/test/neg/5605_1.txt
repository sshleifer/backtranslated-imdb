I watched this out of curiosity. I enjoyed Stargate SG1 and watched many other TV shows and movies on which the main characters worked. <br /> <br /> My expectations were not very high. So I was surprised to be disappointed so monstrous. <br /> <br /> The acting is awful and the scenario is worse. <br /> <br /> Zero research on the bad science that is spread throughout the film or the martial arts (that many members of the cast are engaged throughout the film, although they obviously have no training in martial arts (the baton does not make the warrior make)) the formation makes the plot already implausible even less credible. The same weapon (worn by Michael Shanks), when touched on the side of a mountain, causes considerable damage, but when struck inside against the wicker wall, it creates a small fire effect fireworks without damaging the wicker structure - OK, I guess Michael Shanks fans will be sued for seeing it in Stargate SG1, where a master weapon creates a surface burn on a main character or blows up a hole in a part of the castle wall, if necessary), but still ... A bad snake CGI 'God' eats a faithful as a dog would eat it - snakes do not behave like that. <br /> <br /> The basic premise of an Amazonian warrior cult on a distant planet is at best silly.Matriarchal societies have always been based on a lack of understanding that men are necessary to the process of spreading the species - by example, the Picts s, who did not understand the role of men in sexual reproduction before the ninth century - at that time. , the balance of power has shifted from women to men. They carry technological weapons and demonstrate some knowledge of science - especially medicine, so the idea that a matriarchal society could exist with this level of scientific knowledge is based solely on the author's wet dream. original. Of course, the few references to stellar science made in this film demonstrate that the author did not know either (with the exception of a few keywords that he probably heard in other films). Still, it could have been better done - like "She" in 1965, for example, which showed the matriarchal society with some reverence, much more likely, and even after 45 years, it seems more recent than this fetid exercise of stupidity. Bring a few women in armor, pout aggressively and spit out their replicas like a child who is looking for a fight in a nightclub (style "Come on, so I'll make you!"), Seems to oversimplify the complexities of a matriarchal culture. <br /> <br /> The cultural references are so simple: "Hi everyone, mother of snake" sums up just about everything. Even the smallest hamlet shows more cultural variation. <br /> <br /> There is nothing clever, stimulating, interesting, visually exciting or entertaining about this movie. The soundtrack is of similar quality. <br /> <br /> I can only assume that the few charitable positive reviews this film has received come from blind admirers of Michael Shanks, who will agree to everything about him. Do not be fooled. Low budgets are not a reason for a movie to fail - cheap B movies can be brilliant. This is not one of them, and there is no reason to inflict this movie on you.
