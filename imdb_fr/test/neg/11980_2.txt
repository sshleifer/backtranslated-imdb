I am a big fan of the game Farcry, a huge fan. It still occupies a place in my list of the 10 best games of all time! The plot was new, fresh ... A really bright base on which to base a movie ... or so I thought ... <br /> <br /> Farcry the Movie is nothing less than another directorial attempt to film on a successful game franchise (see Doom: The Movie, and many more ...). <br /> <br /> The video game begins when the player (Jack Carver) wakes up in a grotto by the sea after being shot. boat by an RPG of an unknown soldier. Jack then finds a communication device where (Harlan Doyle) guides him through the islands, shipwrecks, jungles, installations and VOLCANOES, in order to find his (a friend?) (Valerie Constantine), all his super mutated soldiers and his genetically improved animals. <br /> <br /> The film unfolds very differently: There are 30 minutes unnecessary (1/3 of the film) "backstory" before even arriving at the scene of "the explosion of the boat" . 2: Jack then goes to the beach, kills morons, then leaves ... Nothing to do with the game ... 3: There is no communicator with Doyle at the other end .. 4: The "modified soldiers" look like albinos with jerseys on ... And there was no mutant creature resembling a monkey jumping out of the bushes. Part of the game Farcry I liked ... 5: There are no sunny scenes on the beach, no aircraft carriers, no communication stations on huge cliffs, LITTLE reference to any content in the game (characters / objects / vehicles), in fact no attempt to follow the story at all. 6: The culminating volcanic scene of the game is replaced by an old industrial building. 7: There is an end scene ... where everyone (except Krieger) lives happy forever ... WHAT! <br /> <br /> I recommend avoiding this movie at all costs! If you are a player, you will hate this movie will be your soul. It's a clearly male-oriented film, so girls, stay away ... So, if you're a man of 12 to 29, he's never played Farcry and he's not do not be disgusted by the attempts of its directors to bring books / games to the cinema ... So it's for you ...
