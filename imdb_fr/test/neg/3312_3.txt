OKAY. Well, I guess it was worth my time to go through this * time * but I will not look at it anymore. This film pissed me off in many ways. <br /> <br /> First, man ... I really hated the characters. I had the same problem with Sid and Nancy. I find it hard to rationalize spending enough time following characters that I really do not care about and can not understand. It's not that the actors or the writing were technically bad; it is that the characters were written in such a way that I despised them as the film progressed, I almost want to see the sky fall on them. That brings me to the second problem, and to a question that I think is at the heart of this film: Was the intention to simply document that generation and those types of gypsies who were wandering (I guess) in Europe in 60's? Was the intention to criticize them and lambaste? Or was this film a kind of warning? My final evaluation of the film (that is, to determine if there was something recoverable) is based on this question. <br /> <br /> Anyway, these characters are really inimitable and, therefore, it's hard to really make fun of the plot or what's happening to them. If it was a statement about this generation, the movie becomes a bit more tolerable. It is clear that Schroeder is not a kind of geriatric institution, so his approach has more weight than, say, the countless stupid films of the AIP filmed in or about the counterculture of the 60s. At least, this film has two objectives: first, the soundtrack (obviously). I like the way Cymbaline is used here and that others have mentioned it as well, because it occupies a prominent place in the film. I guess if you're a fan of Pink Floyd and you want to see it for that reason, nothing you read here will stop you from looking at it anyway (that would not stop me either). Curiosity to hear Pink Floyd in a movie may be enough to make you understand. <br /> <br /> Secondly, there are beautiful landscapes. Ibiza looks like a nice place to visit. I may be tired of watching Los Angeles, New York and Chicago in movies, but European films that take the time to really show us Europe (the beautiful or the ugly - mostly beautiful here) are always welcome. <BR /> <br /> But I really do not see any particular genius here. No revolutionary camera work, not even a morality, a tone, a message, a sensibility or a plot that has nothing new to say. What was perhaps revolutionary in this respect was simply the fact that it came from a guy like Schroeder - a film criticizing a state of mind that made at least his films marketable. In this sense, it's an honest film. Here, there is no glorification of the abject excesses of the 1960s, which one would expect. In fact, the representation of the characters in this film reflects closely the modern cultural memory (somewhat distorted, in my opinion) of this generation. <br /> <br /> Oh yes, a bunch of nudity and sex (yawn) here; Nothing new if you look at these types of movies from this era. I guess it was considered novel or provocative or something at the time. I do not find it shocking or moving (I doubt you do it either); this only prolongs the duration of an already tedious film. In its own way, this particular use of sexuality in the movies of the time (especially European films) has become a bit of a clich√©. But I guess with hindsight you can not blame them; during this decade, they were able to "get by" and I guess (I guess here) that the very presence of this type of graphic sexuality was a political or social statement in itself (the fact that sexuality a part of life that this generation would not be as weird as their parents). <br /> <br /> Should you watch it? If you're a fan of Pink Floyd, of course ... I guess it's worth watching. In any case, The Valley is a better movie. I went in this movie hoping for the most part what I had. If you do not normally look at these kinds of artistic and avant-garde films and you do not know what to expect, that will surely be annoying. It's a normal, healthy reaction :) <br /> <br /> If you're not a fan of Pink Floyd, I do not know why you'd spend your time here. I noticed that a guy who left a comment liked this movie so maybe I'm missing something. I do not need guys running idle with fireballs, special effects, explosions, or anything like that to enjoy a movie. But I need some kind of grip - I have to find something to like in a movie and, in general, I need to understand some aspect of the characters' fate (unless a new film is made; filming, etc. forward). Here, there is nothing to remember except the magnificence of Pink Floyd. Which is just enough to make it tolerable. At least, if you're a fan of Pink Floyd, you'll love Cymbaline, I promise you.
