The only good thing this movie has created is that it made me hungry for ice without the dead parts. The movie is one of the craziest I've seen in a long time. When the "Ice Cream King" died early, I laughed so hard because the kid took the ice cream and started eating it. His mother asked him to say something and should have said, "Leave me alone and let me eat the free ice cream so I can watch my acting career get lost forever". That seems pretty much right for a line. Then I wondered why the ice prince was behind the bars of his ice truck. Would someone steal his twenty cents? I have never seen bars on the window of an ice cream truck. It sounded pretty stupid. You might as well forget the acting because it's horrible. Forget this movie and go see a dairy for an ice cream.
