Outside of Sweden, you are not expected to have seen this movie. Happy you. The cast includes several actors who are an important part of the history of modern Swedish cinema. And again ... <br /> <br /> Looks like Peter Dalle had an idea of ​​about 20 minutes. Robert Gustafson is totally misused in this film, trying to copy a young Gösta Ekman.

Music is fine <br /> <br /> But overall, it's a waste of divine actors and public time.
