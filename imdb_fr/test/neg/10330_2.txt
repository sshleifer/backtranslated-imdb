Sandra Bullock is my favorite actress ..... But this movie was so horrible that I could not help laughing all through the movie, incredulous because I was watching something so bad. Ha ha The audio editing is horrible, they are trying too hard to create creative camera angles. Because they are just strange and stupid. The script was nil. Play was horrible, the scenario not very good. Very unrealistic, even for a movie. But it's a 20 year old movie ..... so I'm going to give him a bonus point for that. And yes, the music was terrible. But we all have to start somewhere. And to submit these things is so complicated ..... 10 lines minimum ... boredom. Well, I now know why I could not find this movie in the movie store ... I had to buy it offline to see it ... Fortunately, it cost only $ 0.58 .... while the cost of shipping was $ 2.59. Oh well ... I do not recommend anyone to waste time and money watching this movie ...
