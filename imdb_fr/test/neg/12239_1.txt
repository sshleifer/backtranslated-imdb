I'm sorry for you, you know why. I feel sorry for watching this movie. I went to the theater with friends to see this movie and I still have not given him the satisfaction of watching it in full (I left with about 20 minutes left ... hoping that it will make me at least comfortable during a moment.) most movies now, even the worst ones ... when I watch them, there may be a small part in the film where I sometimes feel joy because maybe of a weird joke or on the other hand, I felt uncomfortable and angry with myself all the time, especially since I wasted money on it . It was badly written, misdirected, badly shot, and certainly badly played ... <br /> <br /> please, for the sake of humanity, do not see this movie, even if you are a guy that means he saw like every movie ever ... just do not ...
