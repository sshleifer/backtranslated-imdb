A heap of hunks less than the redeemer who is happily free from the ravages of skill. Some northern idiots come to the far south in search of Confederate rifles hidden in the legendary Whiskey Mountain. They are threatened by terrifying hillbillies, who make a broad nod to "deliverance"; but it turns out that the fools are making the headlines for a tough-to-cook northern marijuana smuggler. This is brought to light so soon that it can not even be considered a twist. Women are locked up and raped in catatonia; Instead of saving them, the guys come to town to look for the sheriff, who is lazy and does not believe them. I think if my girlfriend was raped, I would take the shortest way to the hiding anyway. But it's okay because as soon as they present themselves to soften the bad guys, the girls find all their joy and walk if the trauma was the same in real life. Also featured a forest guy with a shaking beard. Not quite brimming with ideas.
