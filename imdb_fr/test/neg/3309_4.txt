Like many other people, I heard about "more" and wanted to watch it because of the music composed by Pink Floyd. I must say that I was really disappointed, not because of the music but of the film itself. it's an annoying tasteless film that lacks rhythm. Where does this disappointment come from? In my opinion, different things. First, the subject of the film, drugs, is intimately related to the film's sunny atmosphere. This one should have taken place in the sordid quarters of Paris and give birth to a dark and defenseless climate, for example. In addition, it is supposed to tell a descent into hell but this descent is softened and barely sketched. Barbet Schroeder does not dwell on the dramatic side of the story. You could wish a little more madness, cut. On the other hand, Schroeder fails to gain the emotion and public adherence faced with the distress of the two main characters. You look carelessly at their trials with drugs. While the two main actors, they are perfectly inexpressive and hardly evolve during the film, especially Mimsy Farmer. In the end, you only remember the beauty of Mediterranean landscapes bathed in sunshine. The film caused a sensation when it was released in 1969. Nowadays, it seems dated <br /> <br />. The hippie culture is nothing less than a distant memory.
