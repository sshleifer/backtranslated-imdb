Like most viewers of this movie, I am an avid reader of books. The first two films have as main characters Buck, Ray and Chloe, but in this second sequel, they are supported by the presidential effort of Louis Gossett JR. World at War is based on his encounter with Buck in the book series. <br /> <br /> The problem is that this film is as awful as the first two. Amanda just appears out of nowhere and suddenly has an important role to play (I will not reveal it in case someone has not read the show). Other illogical parts characterize. I really wish Cloud 10 to make a good movie Left Behind, but unfortunately, it's similar in both cases to the first one.
