I can not believe the number of people referring to the main characters as "male cows" !! there is no such thing people !!!! There are cows and bulls and all males of the bovine species are bulls and have no udder! There was even a bull but it was like it was another type of animal completely! my god, it looks like drawing human ears on a cat, breasts on Superman or mickey mice with shirley blond curls - even in animation, it just does not work! Giving human qualities to animals is not new nor predictable, but changing their bodies into an essentially transsexual figure is strange for a family drawing - how many people: writers, writers, producers and animators have seen this and have not seen it. not known better or did not say anything - it's completely amazing! I'm not a snob and I'm a fan of luv-simpsons, beavis & butthead, south park, even glaciation and all the other stuff - on the hedge, it was great - but it's crazy - I could not accept that many people are as ignorant as me and that I kept hoping for a reason for the udders of the movie - an explanation - none came - and in the end, when they brandished this little new calf -need, half of her belly is udder and they pronounce my boy, I almost choke me !!!! please, writer / creator let us on the joke!
