Like a terrible cancer falling from the sky, I wandered into this pan on a movie channel the other night. As a fan of bad movies and actively participating in the purchase and viewing of this bad movie, I was intrigued by the idea of ​​a really awful action movie coming from modern times. After that, I found my hands inexplicably squeezing myself against everything within reach and stabbing my head and neck. There was something sinister in this tape ... uh ... where was I ... anyway, this movie is one of the most embarrassing films I've ever seen. William Forsythe can not play more than one character and this character is always a walking joke. Even when placed in a comic context and given things to do and to say that are supposed to be funny (ala Deuce Bigalo), it is laughable to be badly taken. Erika Eleniak is pretty much the same thing. After playing in many awful movies and doing a terrible job in each of them, she did not fail to help unpack it. The classic villain of the B movie, Andrew Divoff, does a respectable job, but has virtually no decor to chew on. Even in sleep, Daniel Bernhardt does not deliver anything comparable to entertainment. Regarding the merits of the film, the plot is lame, the scenario, as the action and the movement of the plot, is both dull and ... well, stupid, for lack of a better adjective (Lord knows they have not put any why I should make an effort?). <br /> <br /> Anyone who has seen enough movies has seen bad ones, and those who have seen enough can learn to appreciate them, but there is simply nothing here. to be appreciated unless you are among the worst movie fans and just so inclined to test your mettle. Before you do, however, believe me, this one is not even terrible enough to be appreciated (contrary to what some of the most ridiculous Italian zombie movies say). It would be much better if b-movie fans were invited to watch most of Bernhardt's other films, or just about anything that has already been filmed. The United States is just not the place to go, especially not now. If you have a compelling need, discover films like Heroic Duo or Hakaider, a little less normal (as well as everything in the awesome cannon of Keita Amemiya), will offer much more fun and action far better than yours. find elsewhere, especially here.
