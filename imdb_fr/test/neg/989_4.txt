Talk about being boring! <br /> <br /> This was a fascinating glimpse into the life of the man who wrote the legendary Night on the Galactic Railroad. I was expecting to see crazy stories and stories of an eccentric man and discover his inspirations for such a strange material. Boy, I was wrong. <br /> <br /> Spring and chaos are mostly boring with only sporadic moments of innovative animation. This is certainly not something for which you have to write and which is not nearly as good as NOTGR, which I suggest you look at. Leave this boredom alone. If you absolutely MUST see, rent it or find it in a cheap place. Do not pay the price.
