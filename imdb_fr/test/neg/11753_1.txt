The original Hitchcock classic has benefited enormously not only from the performance but also from the "look" of Anthony Perkins. He projected a kind of clear innocence: a teenage idol type character. He was not an actor who had portrayed villains before that; Nor was he physically fit for the role of what the public might have imagined to look like a psychopath, especially in the 1950s, when this extremely frightening aspect of mental illness (dual-personality psychosis) was relatively unexplored in the world. movie. That's exactly why his cast as Norman Bates was a part of the true Hitchcockian genius. The public was surprised to say it nicely. <br /> <br /> That's why this overhaul does not work, even a little bit, despite the desire to be an exact copy. While Anthony Perkins looked like someone you never imagined to be a serial killer, Vince Vaughn is easily imaginable. It lacks the frail look of Perkins and his acting skills are also significantly lower, at least in this role (honestly - has there ever been a player capable of transmitting a nervousness as authentic as Anthony Perkins?). Although this was an unnecessary redesign in the beginning, the misinterpretation of the most important character in the story completely sucks this movie. <br /> <br /> As a reminder, I think that Hollywood's propensity to make great movies again because the "young people" refuse to look at everything that is not filmed in color, not only stinks in heaven big companies of greed, but is exceptionally disrespectful of the original work. For viewers who can not watch in black and white - it's their loss. Hopefully they will mature in the future and they will not need bright colors to hold their attention. When they do, they will discover that sometimes black and white is more effective. With the background softened, history and performance are much more present. And in many cases, the atmosphere or atmosphere created by black and white cinematography is simply not accessible in color.
