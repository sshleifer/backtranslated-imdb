As a fan of almost all the period dramas, and a big fan of Jane Austen, this adaptation horrified me. As a fan of the 1999 version of Mansfield Park, I constantly compared the two, which is far from satisfactory. He felt extremely rushed and very unidimensional, so he quickly became boring. There did not seem to be any subtlety in the relationships, especially those of Fanny and Edmund, and there was little atmosphere despite the fact that he was in a beautiful place. Although I had been waiting for Jane Austen's season since Christmas, I turned it off after an hour and went to bed. I'd be interested to watch the adaptations of Persuasion and Northanger Abbey, which I do not have the much appreciated version, to see if they still get bored in this way.
