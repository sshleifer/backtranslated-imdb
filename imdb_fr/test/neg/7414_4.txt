Bigfoot movies tend to be bad, so I'm not inclined to watch them. However, there was good advertising on The Sci-Fi Channel, so I decided to watch. A climbing expedition heads to the Pacific Northwest to find a plane carrying the daughter of the expedition's leader (played by Lance Hendrickson) and bringing a revolutionary DNA detector that could be used to prove the existence sasquatch. And that actually creates a bit of suspense in the beginning. The sasquatch is invisible, but sees the warmth of the mountaineers' bodies (like the alien in "Predator"), and I wondered when he was going to hit. The acting is passable, as is the background music. The dense wooded location is well used. And when the creature is finally seen, the costume is not bad, but nothing good. But as the film progresses, it becomes more and more annoying and absurd. Most of the characters are unpleasant, rude to each other and only in the expedition for money and advertising (except for Lance Hendrickson's character), so it's impossible to worry of what happens to them. And their behavior becomes more and more stupid. A man pulls on the creature (not fatally), then gets drunk and sits alone in the dark. A camper puts on a silk negligee before crawling into her sleeping bag, then runs away from training in the woods by the sasquatch without being stripped of her hair and makeup. Then, the survivors conclude that the sasquatch is really after the DNA detection machine and will let them live if they leave it behind ("a creature knows what threatens it"). Obviously, instinct does not apply to these actors, otherwise they would not have appeared in this movie. And the end is so stupid that you will want to kick the TV screen. Without the script, it would be a decent horror movie.
