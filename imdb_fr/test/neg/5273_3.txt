Kevin Spacey is without doubt one of the best actors of the 90s. After his performances in The Usual Suspect, Se7en and American Beauty, you expect more and more from him. That's why the ordinary and decent criminal is a huge disappointment. <br /> <br /> Michael Lynch is the most cunning criminal in Dublin who has never been in a bad mood. His next flight becomes an obsession when his partners begin to wonder about Michael's ability to plan everything to perfection, although this is the only thing he does when he does not play a good father at home. <br /> <br /> I guess it's partly my fault for not paying enough attention to the thousand details of the plot that unfortunately turn out to be the "essence" of the film. I gave the film a chance by calling it a parody and ... well, parodies are always funny, no matter what they use or how they do it. So, it was not after all a complete parody made on purpose. It's just a different scam movie that desperately tries to be funny and fails. <br /> <br /> Unlike some of his "colleagues", Ordinary Decent Criminal depends too much on the development of history and logical continuity, forgetting the main reason, the viewer chose this kind of film - for himself to entertain. It is certainly not entertainment. This includes one of the most ridiculous scenes of all time: the introduction of Michael's TWO Wives. I do not know if it's a kind of stupid metaphor or strange, dark humor, but the chicks are sisters. Do not forget that the character of Spacey has children. <br /> <br /> A decent ordinary criminal is complex and confusing. You do not wait for a fun scene. Instead, you carefully follow the dialogue, as there is a great chance to get lost in the boring and pale world the film has inhabited. <br /> <br /> Let's go back to Spacey. I wonder what he was like, signing for this movie. This is not a broadcast error, but something much worse. An insult to his work in American Beauty, published a year before Ordinary Decent Criminal. Michael's character is eccentric and talkative. Spacey is almost pathetic sometimes. The only cure for that, thinks Lester Burnham and Roger Kint. <br /> <br /> The writer, Gerrard Stembridge, should definitely rethink his screenwriting skills and be more objective this time. Because the dialogue is very weak and the scenes are often useless. And we are still talking about a comedy. <br /> <br /> Ordinary Decent Criminal is a comedy about a very bad crime that does not deserve your attention.
