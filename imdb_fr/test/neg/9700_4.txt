Although the new movie Pride & Prejudice is beautiful to watch and the soundtrack is lovely, we do not see Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen. The film has for some reason been postponed until the early 1790s, rather than during the regency period when the novel is set, as scholars have long shown. The Bennets' Longbourn estate is chained and looks like the Cold Comfort farm. Yet, the Bennets of the novel belong to the gentry class; they own a farm, but the pig does not cross the house, nor does the farm with manure and chicken poop next to the house. The scenes are taken from the novel and, not to forget, Jane Austen has set scenes in some places for a reason. For example, the film depicts Darcy's great proposal in a storm in front of a neoclassical temple, as opposed to the interior of the Collins Rectory: why did Jane Austen put her in the presbytery? Because although Lizzy and Darcy speak with total honesty and brutality, the Collins never shared an honest word. Why rain and outdoor proposal? Looks like Jane Eyre meets Rochester! And when Elizabeth crosses a windy field to stand on a cliff and admire the panorama, we expect to cry, "Heathcliffe" at any time! Austen was broken! Judy Dench is an excellent actress, but Lady Catherine is supposed to be big and striking. Little Tom Hollander is a brilliant actor, but Mr. Collins is described in the novel as big and heavy, suggesting that his terrible dance with poor Lizzy is an elephantine. Matthew MacFayden is another of my favorites of MI-5 on A & E; in P & P, however, he's no longer the young Heathcliffe, never smiling - though Austen notes in the novel that Darcy smiles a lot to Lizzy, and she realizes it when she sees her gorgeous smiling portrait at Pemberley - a portrait that this film is for some reason replaced by a carved marble bust. And much of Austen's dialogue is transformed into modern language. Mr. Bingley has been turned into such a clown that one wonders why Darcy would have him as a friend and why Jane Bennet would like it. The bottom line is that even though it's a fantastic movie to watch and hear, it's so different from Jane Austen's novel that any student watching it thinks it can substitute viewing for reading. , would fail!
