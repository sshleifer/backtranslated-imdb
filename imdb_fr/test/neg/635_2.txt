Watching ALIEN EXPRESS sparked feelings of fear, shock, pity and, of course, terror. To think that actors who have done a good job in the past should come up with something like this. Horror, horror. <br /> <br /> Tell me if anything of that sounds familiar to you. <br /> <br /> A specially built train for a political campaign is on its way to Las Vegas for a big rally for the candidate, a Texas senator (Barry Corbin, the only actor with roles for both ALIEN EXPRESS and NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN in the same decade). At a railroad crossing in Utah, a meteor cremates a car while waiting for the train to pass. <br /> <br /> The train stops. Local police are summoned. Oh, is it possible? The senator has a charming young lady (Amy Locane of CRY-BABY and MELROSE PLACE) who has just been married to one of the officers who answered 911. Lou Diamond Phillips is the ex-husband. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, the aliens of eeeeevil managed to stop on the train. <br /> The train leaves. Lou asks his friend to fly a helicopter so he can get off the running train (about 70 miles an hour) and save the day. As a reward for the boyfriend, he hit the helicopter in the mountains. <br /> <br /> This is another example of the poor writing quality of ALIEN EXPRESS. The companion of the police hero must die, we all know it. But he is supposed to die by the end of the third act, usually saving several lives. <br /> <br /> Once on the train, Lou manages to lose his t-shirt to be able to channel Bruce Willis into DIE HARD. a drummer's t-shirt. Yeah, Lou is 46 but he goes to the gym. The role he plays is not worth looking after, but he is in shape. <br /> <br /> The senator is going to spend an afternoon of fun with Miss Utah, but extraterrestrials are interfering and he and the woman are young enough for her little girl to pay the ultimate price. <br /> <br /> Soon, we have bomb threats, multiplying extraterrestrials, and of course, the train goes out of control and strides towards its rendezvous while Lou and Todd Bridges (DIFF'RENT STROKES) try to save as many lives as possible. <br /> <br /> There is exactly one surprise in the whole movie. At the beginning of the story, a couple wears wine glasses at their thirty-fifth birthday, hoping to live another thirty-five years. The guy gets banged, but he and Ms. both live. Perhaps the authors have just lost them. <br /> <br /> This is the kind of movie you would like to be a fly on the wall. Those actors who have done a better job (and, really, deserve better than that) are probably just happy for the job. Did they really think they were working on something worthwhile, or were they crying (and / or drinking) themselves to sleep at night? At the end of the story, the survivors (quite a few, all things considered) find themselves in the last car of the train, which is off the hook. The other cars cross a cliff, but the one containing the protagonists stops a few centimeters from the cliff. <br /> <br /> Lou and his ex are together. Happiness reigns. I would have thought that the first thing they would do was get off the train to have a firm ground underfoot, but I move away from the subject. <br /> <br /> Someone looks out the window and sees a star shootout. Look, make a wish. Then another. Then more and more. The Earth is bombarded by meteors that will split and scary puppets with big teeth will be everywhere. <br /> <br /> It has become so difficult to observe the words "The Sci-Fi Presents Channel" on an "Original" movie tells us that we will be happy to have Ti-Vo to be able to quickly advance in the next two hours. Or, better yet, go ahead, erase it after two minutes and spend this time more wisely.
