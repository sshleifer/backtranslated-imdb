The legendary fiasco of Blake Edwards begins to seem useless after only 10 minutes. A combination of The Eagle Has Landed, Star!, Oh! What a beautiful war !, and Edwards' Pink Panther films, Darling Lili never engage the viewer; aerial footage, musical numbers, romance, comedy and espionage are all very good. When is the viewer supposed to make fun of? This disaster falters, never decides what he wants to be and apparently thinks it's a travesty, but it's pathetically and crankly square. Old game in the worst sense, the public naturally remained in mass. It's horrible. James Garner would have been a huge improvement over Hudson, which is only cardboard, and he is not connected to Andrews and vice versa. And Andrews and Hudson do not seem to have been left in the joke and perform with a seriously miscalculated. Blake Edwards' SOB is little more than correct, but it's the only good ever released from Darling Lili. The expensive and professional look of a large part of Darling Lili only makes it more difficult to bear all that he lavishes. To quote Paramount chief Robert Evans, "$ 24 million film and no picture".
