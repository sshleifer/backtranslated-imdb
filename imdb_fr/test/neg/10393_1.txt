I'm not sure whether it's a comedy or not, but I found it quite funny. Isobel is possessed by the devil. One way or another, a pervert priest and the gardener will fix that. Both exorcism and soap opera, you will have at least some laughter. There is the jealous paranoid father, the satanic sister, the mother of Valley of the Dolls, then the cowboy boyfriend; all there to help the priest chasing skirt to fight the demons of dear Isobel. It sometimes sounded like an episode of Jerry Springer, but I actually paid to see that. Instead of the cold head, seamanship and crucifix that Regan did in The Exorcist; We hear a lot of Isobel bouncing on his bed like a trampoline, hiding in his closet and jumping out of a hay loft. Yes, it's Chuck E. Cheese gone wild. So, if you want to watch a horror movie in quotation marks that is worth laughing while you wait for the predictable end ... it's your movie.
