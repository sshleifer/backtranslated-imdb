Like most people, I praised him after hearing the universal praise. And despite many weird and inexplicable moments, we were very interested and entertained throughout the 100 minutes of the film. The two women then went to "representation" late at night. The rest of the movie (which is another 40 minutes) is even EASIER than the first part AND completely at odds with what I've already seen. Then the film ends abruptly. <br /> <br /> Confused, I went to my computer to see if I could buy a clue about what had happened. Nothing made sense, and I'm a pretty smart guy. None of these other user comments made sense, even when they said "SPOILERS". I still have no idea what they say. Someone dream? Not true? So what's the point of a 2-hour, 30-minute movie if it's "not real"? Or is it real? I have to make a choice. Either: <br /> <br /> [a] The film is a genius job at the MENSA level and I'm just too stupid to understand it. <br /> <br /> [b] The film is strange for strange reasons and simply does not make sense. All who love him try to save face and pretend that they "understood" him. <br /> <br /> I choose [b]. Fuck you guys, I'm going home ...
