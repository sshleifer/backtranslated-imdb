Three young movie theater employees are reopening a long closed theater where many years went by before a series of horrendous murders. It seems that many other murders have occurred since then, but all this remains unknown to these three young junior employees who hope to finally succeed alone. As they approach the grand reopening evening, things get more and more strange and more and more disturbing, objects suddenly begin to move without apparent help and a terrifying old man seems to haunt the scene. <br /> <br /> Oh, it's really horrible. In fact, if the character of Mary Woronov's secretary was not such a fiercely independent and autonomous young woman who steals virtually every scene in which she appears and the incredibly hot chick who played the incredibly suspicious but totally sexy Selina, this would be a total loss. The only other good thing I can say about this movie is that some of the murders in theaters are really inventive, although not too gory (a preference for me but not necessarily for others), the fashion. The rest is wallowing in constant sleaze (so extreme that the rare few can find humor) and through the predictable slasher that kills the boring characters one after the other.
