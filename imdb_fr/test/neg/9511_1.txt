One of the joys of Shakespeare is that there can be no definitive performance - no performance can be "right", but some may be wrong, and this one is. There are at least two things about Hamlet that you can not do without: 1. His indecision and inability to take action. For God's sake, that's what makes the play last as long as it lasts. If you had Othello instead of Hamlet, Claudius would have died at the end of the first act. Every production must try to explain why Hamlet is late, why he is unable to act. 2. His sexual disgust. His total disgust at the thought of what his mother and uncle do in bed completely disgusts him for all that is sexual and that means that any relationship with Ophelia is impossible. At the slightest hint of sex, Hamlet vomits. So, what does Mel Gibson give us? Vigorous man of action. You could not get away from the character of Hamlet if you tried. Hamlet can be played in many ways, but it's not one of them! What I do not understand is that they managed to get such good actors for the other roles - Claudius, Polonius, etc., why could not they find one to play Hamlet as well? Mark Rylance in the game would have made an excellent film. This ?? Mel Gibson ', whoever he is, has completely dropped the rest of the cast. And let's face it, Hamlet without the prince really does not work.
