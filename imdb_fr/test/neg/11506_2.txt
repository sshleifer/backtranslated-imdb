When this show first came to Disney, I love watching it all the time. It quickly became one of my favorite Disney shows, but this show has turned into something unsettling and disappointing. <br /> <br /> I now find one of the second and third season amusements watching teen shows. I hate this garbage. The first season was really unique as it showed Sadie who loved science, animals and creatures. The first season was very entertaining. Most of the time, I do not like the second season because of Ben. It annoys me and makes me shit shit. The plot in the second season is also bad and is just terrible
