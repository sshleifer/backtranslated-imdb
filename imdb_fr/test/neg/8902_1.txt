Endless rehearsal on the evil of the World Bank, IMF, Globalization and Americans are held accountable for all Africa's problems - and the film is long, about two hours, but it seems longer. The French have actually occupied Mali, the country where the film takes place, for centuries, but they are only peripheral villains. <br /> <br /> We do not learn enough about any of the characters to really care what happens they are completely marginal to the preaching, which continues over and over again. There is no plot, no character development, no humor (except for a few shots at Bush and Wolfowitz, but it's almost cheating, it's so easy) and the production values ​​are mediocre - there is no redemption. <br /> <br /> It is amazing that a film can spend two hours preaching on such a vast subject and transmitting no real information. The Irish ballad "I was dying, then the famine arrived" has more content. <br /> <br /> The film is boring, the subtitles are hard to read, there is no real content on the subject of the film, and the propaganda is relentless. <br /> <br /> Jump this one.
