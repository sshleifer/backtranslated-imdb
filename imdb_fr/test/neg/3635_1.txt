This television show is stereotyped and far-fetched in many ways. <br /> <br /> First, the frame. All the characters attend PCA, this incredible boarding school with painted and elegant dormitories. The campus does not seem to have reasonable rules - for example, boys are often seen in girls' dormitories and vice versa. But this may be simply because the dormitory advisor, a silly person who bores the viewer instead of amusing her, as I suppose, is supposed to be her goal, stays seated and does nothing. I have friends in boarding schools and they make fun of many aspects of school in this show. <br /> <br /> Next, the characters. I was very disappointed to discover that Nickelodeon was not at all creative with the personalities of this show. They all represent features that are exaggerated to the extreme: Zoey is supposed to be perfect in everything she does (looks, notes, sports, guys, judgment, creativity, etc.), Michael is the jock, Logan is the arrogant fool who basically does not do anything. In addition to worsening all the characters and poor viewers, Nicole is the preppy idiot who knows nothing but who somehow keeps everything straight-A. Chase is the guy who's afraid to confess his "real feelings", which really annoys me as the show goes on, and this new girl - Lola or something - is just another Nicole clone. <br /> <br /> The two main characters that annoy me the most are Zoey and Quinn. First of all, I just do not understand Zoey's character. She was obviously created to be the "perfect" character, as I said above, but she seems to be the most imperfect of all - she creates a problem in most episodes, she then has to solve it. What's frustrating is that we're supposed to love her and think she's amazing so they did not even create a very realistic character to start with. <br /> <br /> Quinn, on the other hand, bothers me because she is so exaggerated that her character is absolutely insulting. Nick gives me the impression about his character that "geeks" and "nerds" are people to laugh at, criticize, make fun of. In the episode of the spring break that they did a year ago, they presented two other "nerds" that the characters had to make "cool". I found this very offensive and stereotyped. What kind of message does Nick send to these kids? Is not it: do not succeed at school, do not get good grades, do not study hard - you'll end up being a geek and we'll make fun of your job in future TV shows! Because that's the message I hear from these poorly constructed characters, and it's a terrible message from start to finish. <br /> <br /> All I can do is hope that Nick realizes one day that, by belittling the intelligent people in our world, they do no good to anyone.
