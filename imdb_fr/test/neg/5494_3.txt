If I am normally a big fan of the work of actor and director of John Turturro, ILLUMINATA is a big disappointment. Although the film presents charming moments, overall, it falls flat. Worse of all, the film is confusing. Where is the movie? Italy or an Italian troupe in New York? Why bother making a historical film if it fails to give a set? If you want to see a well-done and inspiring historical film on stage, check out Tim Robbins' THE CRADLE WILL ROCK. This film has many benefits, including a great performance by John Turturro.
