There seems to be a whole sub-genre of tired, cheap old-fashioned "comedies" that say the same old-fashioned middle-class couples. A bit like friends, but with more soft porn and no mind. This film is no exception. He had such familiar situations that I died of déjà vu. People were sitting on sofas, sowing clichés about sex and relationships? Check. Monogamy against cheating with a woman / man who would never look twice in reality at another woman / man? Check. PORN BADDIES !!!! 111? Check. A guy / girl who happens to be the only reason you look at this garbage? Check. The lesson seems to be: when one doubts, do an old "comedy" of tired sex on people nobody cares about, in order to make a statement that everyone has already heard three thousand times before. Your movie will be done. It will even attract a sitcom, no one in a bad wig!
