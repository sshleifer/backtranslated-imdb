George Zucco was like Boris Karloff in the fact that regardless of the poor quality of the film in which he appeared, he always maintained a sense of dignity and performed well. "The mad monster" is no exception to this rule. This is in all respects a mediocre (though entertaining) film. Filmmakers obviously did not know how to make the most of their small budget and the scenario seems to have been played in one or two days. Nevertheless, Zucco is good and credible as a mad scientist. <br /> <br /> The film itself is nice at a camp level. Most horror film fans will not appreciate PRC movies. However, these productions of "Poverty Row" have an unimportant but loyal worship. Sometimes they exceeded their limits, "Detour" being the best example. Usually, they looked like this. Despite all its mediocre technical qualities, "The Mad Monster" is a pretty fun way to kill a rainy afternoon. The Retromedia DVD is recommended because it is associated with another production of the band "The Black Raven", the original trailer of the film, and an interview with Glenn Strange who talks about his role in this film. (4/10)
