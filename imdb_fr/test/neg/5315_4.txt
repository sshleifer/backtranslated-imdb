In 1995, Barry Sonnenfeld had made a film that was among the best lists of critics when the summaries of the year were published in entertainment publications. The film was called Get Shorty and gave main star John Travolta his second big hit in years after Pulp Fiction put it back in front of the paparazzi's goal. Based on a novel by Elmore Leonard, the film focuses on the wise Chili Palmer (Travolta) and his attempts to break into the world of cinema. For my part, I was completely captured by the various characters and the clear dialogue of the original. So much so that when I learned that there was going to be a sequel, I seemed to forget the usual thrill that occurs when a studio tries to rehearse what was a good idea ten years later. The sequel, also based on a Leonard novel, is this time made by F. Gary Gray, whose Italian job in 2003 was one of this year's most profitable films. Add to that Uma Thurman, Harvey Keitel, Cedric the Entertainer, The Rock, Vince Vaughn and James Woods and you get all the benefits of a great continuation in the exploits of one of the most interesting characters of the 1990s. This time, Chile (Travolta) leaves the cinema sector after being disappointed both by himself and by the sector for having participated in the realization of the sequel to his first successful film. Partly thanks to his friend Tommy Athens (Woods) and the misfortune of his death, Chile decides to embark on a lucrative and dangerous music industry. This premiere leads to the famous Viper club, where Chili and singing star Linda Moon (Christina Milian) can direct songs like Whitney Houston (the Whitney before Bobby Brown begins to bring home sugar). Linda is under contract with Raji (Vaughn) who, with her overly apparent gay bodyguard, Elliot Wilhelm (The Rock), plans to ensure that Linda will fulfill the last five years of her contract, even if it means putting Chile on the ice. Thus, with Linda's future in the balance, Chile is weaving an interesting network that will include a record producer (Thurman), a gangsta sound mixer (Cedric), the Russian crowd, the police, the main singer of Aerosmith , Steven Tyler, and many point fingers. Woo-Wheee! It looks exciting. So why not that? Be Cool makes too much effort to be cool. But the result is a film that, unlike the original, has no heart or soul. Be Cool seems to have been directed by a producer of Saturday Night Live, because some scenes or sketches do not follow a whole movie. Let's take the example of the scene where Travolta and Thurman are dancing together for the first time since Pulp Fiction, while Black Eyed Peas performs live in the background. The scene is forced and should have been on the floor of the cutting room. Instead, it is coupled between two other useless chapters that do nothing to move the story forward with a real push. The Aerosmith concert and The Rock's trip to a boot shop are also perfect examples of individual moments that, once assembled, are not really a film. But these are not the only problems with the sequel - which could probably be renamed Product Placement with the amount of 2-Ways and Diet Pepsi that seem to be looking at you more intensely than Chile's serious look. The story contains just about every imaginable stereotype and everyone has just enough time in front of the screen to become slightly offending or embarrassing. Whether it's the gangsta entourage or the beefy gay who has a poster of Sylvester Stallone's Rhinestone movie on the wall, no character offers us more than anything we've ever seen before and in much better movies. The magic disappeared from the first film, we find ourselves with a product of inferior quality, the second film in the last six months (Ocean's 13 being the other), which plunges a group of stars in a big top to finally become a movie. movie that no actor would bring to an open audition. Be Cool was a major disappointment. I wanted so much that it was the Get Shorty of the new millennium and I ended up with a movie where the releases had to be a gas, but the experience left me with an odor.
