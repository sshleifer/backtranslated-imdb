I stopped this film at 48 minutes and I change ... I do not know ... maybe it's because I'm not Swedish ... nor French (the commentator of cannes) ... or any of these OTHER sleeping places from where the previous critics held forth ... born and raised in New York. lived near san francisco for a quarter of a century. and now Holland. I love a good independent film as much as the next movie buff ... but in a nutshell, it's not funny. see? Now, it's funny ... that you think I made a mistake. I said, "in a word" but then, "it's not funny" ... Nope. no mistake. If this is your type of humor, I would say you have not really had such a life ... consider your appreciation of this movie as a symptom ... and PLEASE, NEVER write another comment ... j have a tendency to believe them when they are unanimous. even if there were only 3 reviews before mine ... I thought I could really save someone else than boredom ... the anticipation of a laugh that does not materialize never ... I smiled once or twice, though ... when I started the movie ... and when I stopped it. it should be 10 lines.
