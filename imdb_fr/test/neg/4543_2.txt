"The Chilling" directed by Deland Nuse and Jack A.Sunseri is one of the worst zombie movies I've ever seen. Why Linda Blair ("The Exorcist", "Witchery") appeared in this scent is Beyond me.The plot is really dumb: frozen bodies in a cryogenic laboratory are rekindled after lightning and turned into cannibalistic zombies.The characters are completely one-dimensional and stupid, the zombies look horrible and there is no bloody. Avoid this piece of cheap junk like the plague. My rating: 1 out of 10
