You may not believe it, but when the credits of this film were launched, I looked for the name of the director. When I saw it, I engraved it in my memory and I never forgot it. This film is beyond terrible. This makes Ed Wood's films look like Orsen Welles. At least B movies are entertaining, it was an agonizing experience. The quality was so bad that I began to wonder who had allowed this. <br /> <br /> I hear that Uwe Boll ran fourteen miles a day. Indeed, no matter where his films are viewed, people must drive him out of the city with a flame and a fork. The scenario was appalling, the lighting looked like a high school football match and the cinematography was just above the quality of Roger Patterson's Bigfoot video. The acting game was performed by people too shameful of production to say their lines with no credibility. Alan Smithee would not have put his name on the film. I learned that day to avoid any film of this man despite the circumstances. From what I've heard, it's not a bad thing to do.
