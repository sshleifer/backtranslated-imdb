His balmy look was totally inappropriate for the role. His face remained too white, his hair too coiff√©s, his clothes, etc. It would be one thing if the production had allowed all the other actors to stay clean and perfect too, but she was the only one who did not get confused. There was never even a trace on his powdery cheek. Should we believe she was the only person in the Civil War to have a bathtub and a mirror? She certainly looked like the only person who used them. Tweezers, too; I mean, what are these eyebrows? She looked absolutely nasty! <br /> <br /> The love story was incredible. She went to see this guy only because someone told him that he said he thought she was cute. So, she's going to tease him, then flirt with him twice more, and suddenly it's a love equal to Odysseus and Penelope? Please. <br /> <br /> I should have known better than waiting for anything from the man who brought us "The English Patient". My reaction to it was the same as Elaine's in Seinfeld: "It was fearing."
