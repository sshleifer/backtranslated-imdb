This movie is so bad that it becomes really funny. One of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life. The funny thing was that the trailer contained scenes that were not in the movie. Just by watching the trailer, I would have saved a lot of time. It actually showed everything that had happened in the film, except for the conclusion, and that it was so obvious. <br /> <br /> It's honestly hard to find a reason why this movie was shot. It's so bad. Horrible. <br /> <br /> I would give 0 out of 10 if that would be possible. There is nothing else to say about this movie.
