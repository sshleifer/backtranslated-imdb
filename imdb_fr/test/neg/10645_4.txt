There is a lot of ketchup, but not much sense in the third supposedly explanatory sequence, which stacks Naff visuals with no effect. The good old Alan Smithee directed this one, in which several members of the same family (all badly played, by Bruce Ramsay) are terrorized by Pinhead (Doug Bradley, released from his job for the umpteenth time). Peter Atkins tries to bring a poetic touch to his screenplay, but does not seem to realize that his dialogue is as deep and meaningful as a plate of sickness. The incoherent plot fails to fill the meager production time of the film, although it may have more to do with studio interference than anything the filmmakers had planned.
