Oh, boy, this is another movie that hits the comet. Coming in a year or two with Deep Impact, Armageddon, Space Cowboys and various other stupid movies with rap stars, one would think that people would be exhausted by this concept. Apparently no, since I praised it, hoping it would not be great: Dennis Hopper was there, after all, and he's a good actor, right? <br /> <br /> I forgot something important: with Peter O 'Toole, Robert De Niro and many other esteemed actors, Hopper has a penchant for dreadful movies. Not only that, but he seems to be preparing himself by taking courses of procedure forgetting. His performance at Tychus is so horrible that you expect Divine or Edith Massey to appear in certain scenes. <br /> <br /> I do not know what to say about this crap, unless you want an accident in the movies of the Earth, look at Deep Impact, then Armageddon and Space Cowboys. Forget others completely. This one is really at the bottom of the pile.
