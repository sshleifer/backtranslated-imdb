I do not see why anyone would make such a movie. From beginning to end, this movie is really, really bad. <br /> <br /> The characters are all superficial, terribly acted and downright boring. There is absolutely nothing happening under the surface, be it characters or intrigues. <br /> <br /> The humor, if we can call it, is aimed at an adult audience (I suppose by the language and the nudity) even if that seems to be mainly of the humor of the toilets and would have hard to draw even the smile of a half-witted teenager. <br /> <br /> I would recommend avoiding this excuse for a comedy. There is nothing that can please a movie buff. Lack of laughter and a conspiracy that almost makes me wonder "Why was this film shot, why, why, why?" <br /> <br /> I expect the film to end in the best conditions top 100 of the worst films.
