Wow, there's a lot of venom directed on this movie, and it's largely deserved, but it's not the worst movie of all time. (It's probably "Zoolander".) <br /> <br /> Anyway, if you're addicted, something really drunk or just in the mood for a "less than nothing" movie of which you can make fun, it can be your cup of tea. <br /> <br /> Yes, as others have said, the first part of the movie makes you think you're looking at an update of Bram Stoker's novel. Two of the main characters are named Van Helsing and Mina, the ship is the Demeter and they are in the Carpathian galaxy. You will find later that Van Helsing is a descendant of the original and it turns out that he is on a ship in the 30th century with Dracula. Suuuuuuuuuuure. <br /> <br /> Oh yes, and to add to the originality, this movie "Spooky Ghost Ship" has another character called Ash. Sound familiar? <br /> <br /> Characters and anachronisms such as the aforementioned manual wheelchair, and Coolio and Tom Lister speak in black slang of the twentieth century. But what makes the movie ridiculous is the end. If that's what happens to the characters, the previous two hours have been a waste of time. <br /> <br /> As I said earlier, you want a stupid movie in which you can play "Mystery Science Theater", pretty much the same mode as that required to watch the episode of "LOST IN SPACE ", entitled" The great revolt of vegetables ", you may find this game confusing. Otherwise, take a turn, it's done.
