This film is from a long-term ITV sitcom with the same name. The sitcom lasted about half a decade and brought Rigsby, Phillip, Alan, Mrs. Jones and Vienna to our screens. <br /> <br /> Then in 1980, The version of the movie hit the cinemas. Now, Richard Beckinsale is dead and was replaced by Only when I laugh, actor Chris Strauli. <br /> <br /> I thought it gave the film a different feel. I would prefer that the film not be shot because Richard was a key figure. It's like we have the porridge film without Godber or Mackay! <br /> <br /> The film certainly had some classic moments, but it seemed a little De-Ja -Vu! Many pieces have already been seen in the TV series. Now, if you first saw the movie rather than the show, you would have a different feeling about it, then the fan of the show! <br /> <br /> Say that Leonard is really fit and makes the film, like on TV The film recently had a new life on DVD and is usually on Terrestrial for a quiet weekend. It's a good movie, but for Rigsby fans, you may feel like you've seen it before. <br /> <br /> That said, it's worth buying / watching <br /> <br /> 7.8 / 10
