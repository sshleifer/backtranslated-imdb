Tarantino's previous films were those of a man in love with other films. This one is from a guy in love with his own writing. It's not without glory, it's disgusting. <br /> <br /> I absolutely hated Inglorious Basterds. All the purpose of a movie is to entertain - if you call banging people's heads and pulling out their scalps to entertain them !!!! - and if there is an unforgivable sin that a film can commit, it is extreme boredom or extreme disgust. <br /> <br /> The film is a collection of endless scenes and excruciatingly boring and disgusting people speaking at tables in various languages. There is even a scene where 3 people talk for about 45 minutes at the same table, before, fortunately, they are all shot. I wish they were killed after 5 minutes. Even Woody Allen knows when to close the F ** K. <br /> <br /> This style of table discussion is a feature of Tarantino, but in other movies I really cared what they said and people who spoke. . Here, I do not care. All of Quentin's films have enormous confidence, especially Jackie Brown. But here, there is an overwhelming feeling in every scene, Tarantino had no idea where he was heading with the movie. <br /> <br /> Is it violent? Of course, there is torture and scalping galore, but you have to remind me. Fortunately, the movie was so thin that I did not even remember seeing it earlier in the day. Until I see a review title on MSNBC. <br /> <br /> He runs out of gadgets and seems to want to die to write a novel. But do us a favor and save the film. <br /> <br /> I came out of this film halfway through and I would never recommend anyone to see it, no matter what their status as a hardcore quarantino fan. <br /> <br /> I give it 0/10.
