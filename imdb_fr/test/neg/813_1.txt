This film was given to me and I must admit that I am happy not to have paid for it. <br /> <br /> The back of the box gives the impression that it is a kind of sexual triangle, with 2 women trying to seduce her. But the reality in this film is far from that. <br /> <br /> In reality, the main subject is the victim of a vicious and sadistic rape committed by the other two characters. I did not find anything interesting about that. <br /> <br /> Even movies like Silence of the Lambs and Wild Things (which the box is trying to compare this movie) were captivating, due to unexpected turns. and suspense. <br /> <br /> But Jaded has none of this. He focuses on the rapists and the sick relationship with the boyfriend of one of them. And the continuation of a videotape that could prove that the victims' story is true. <br /> <br /> Even if it shows that same-sex rape is possible, it is not a film that deserves to be watched. <br /> <br /> If possible, skip this movie at any cost.
