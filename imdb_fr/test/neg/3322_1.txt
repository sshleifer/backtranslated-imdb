I am generally not inclined to write film reviews that, in my opinion, deserve no mention. But, in order to grow as a writer and film critic, I think it's important to express my thoughts when I do NOT like a movie. "Queen of the Damned" is one of those movies. <br /> <br /> Anne Rice's popular horror stories about Lestat, a bisexual vampire, were featured on screen in 1994 in the blockbuster movie "An interview with a vampire". Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt, two of the biggest Hollywood heavyweights, the elegant and aesthetic staging of the film conquered the audience. Although it may have been a background style, there was something that worked despite its failures (I've never been so in love with the vampire genre in general). <br /> <br /> Since that time. Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise have moved on. It is likely that both would have laughed when asked to appear in a sequel. They would have laughed even louder when they saw the final result. "Queen of the Damned" characterizes the type of Hollywood film only to publish at low cost in the hope of making quick money thanks to an average soundtrack and a big marketing campaign for 13- 17 years. <BR/> <br /> Needless to say, this movie is terrible from the beginning. Lestat, now played by Brit Stuart Townsend, famous for "Shooting Fish", wakes up from his dark grave to the sound of ... you guessed it, Nu-Metal. He panics confused punk musicians and joins their band, as long as it only appears at night, with the sun burning through his skin and all day long ... <br /> <br /> Jesse (Marguerite Moreau), a student who studies the paranormal (Vampire Studies 101 perhaps?), Tries to find out if Lestat is really what he says he is. On the way, she falls in love with him (something to do with his strange past), but has some competition in Queen Akasha (Aaliyah), a vampire demon queen who returns from hell to acquire Lestat as king of his choice. <Br /> <br /> The film is shamefully indulgent, but its rustic tone leaves some room for its devaluing humor. Anyone who sees this film other than laughing needs to see more movies in general! Watching Townsend is nice. He knows that the role is completely exaggerated and does his best to walk the tightrope between full play and serious action. The late Aaliyah is unfortunately terrible in the lead role. She has little reading time and she does not fully use what she has. Mediocre makeup and special effects do not help; she sometimes feels like talking through a voice mail. <br /> <br /> It is said that this film went straight to the video until the untimely death of Aaliyah last year. With the opportunity for people to see his latest movie, Warner Bros. has presented this project to a general version. Otherwise, it would have been one of those movies that you see on the shelves in the video stores but avoid them because you can deduce that it will be just terrible. <br /> <br /> There is no doubt that such films will continue to be shot. Watch the wave of rom-coms teenage acts or parody like this with movies like "Not Another Teen Movie". If there is a market to exploit, Hollywood will do it. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem I have with this movie is not the movie itself. Hollywood aims to make money, so if there is a market for this movie, they will pursue it. It's business. But what worries me the most is that people are actively going to the movies and paying money to watch it! I think this is the most important argument in the world of cinema: the art of cinema and entertainment then, or vice versa? The only people who can decide that it is the public. If you like and are intrigued by good movies, stay away from this turkey.
