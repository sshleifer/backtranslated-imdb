This is one of the most horrible movies I have had the misfortune to pick up. Do not get me wrong, I love a good movie of zombies, but it was not one of them. <br /> <br /> ... could also be called (at least in the first scenes) "Titty Zombies from Outer Space." This had absolutely nothing to do with the other movie or the video game (as far as I know.) <br /> <br /> The best part of the movie is how the two main characters can get so bloody and so confused. here and miss and stay with a safer zombie pleaser like "28 Days Later" or "Dawn of the Living Dead" (the remake, of course, unless you're in a serious camper action.)
