By a strange coincidence, I started watching this move right after Brice from Nice and the good thing was that few movies could be worse than Brice from Nice, so I was really looking forward to finding something better that would make me forget that horrible flop. . <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, OSS-117 has left me disappointed again - I do not know, it may be a translation problem, but since "Diner of Cons", I have not seen NO French comedy that I would call very well. Even when I watch the reviews on IMDb, only the French give high ratings to the OSS-117 ... <br /> <br /> For me, this movie did not really work - in some parts, is as funny as real Bond movies, in other jokes were a little too predictable or too nerdy.
