At first, I thought it was supposed to be a kind of comedy / horror when I saw the body in the bathtub with the lady standing there, screaming again and again but as the movie in advance, the film becomes more and more flat. The plot was ridiculous with a man thwarted by rising real estate prices. He then decides to call a radio psychiatrist and blur his fury because he has nothing better to do. Then the law comes in and tries desperately to make us feel that they really care about who the caller is and they do everything they can to find that guy. One suspect after another are charged. This film is horrible and the slow-moving love scenes of Adrian B. and her husband are boring and made me move fast on the film. Avoid it!
