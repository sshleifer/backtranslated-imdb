This film is about 3 stories gathered around 3 different individuals. One of the worst movies available and even better if not available. <br /> <br /> The Good: 2 beautiful lesbian actresses 1 true and touching story about Theresa Chan <br /> <br /> The Bad: The main story that revolves around the blind and dear woman Theresa Chan does not need to be told in a movie format and more appropriate in a documentary format. No link between the 3 stories. DIALOGUE minimum in the movie, replaced by SMS and PC CHAT programs. No cultural vision of the film and it makes you forget even before going out of the cinema.
