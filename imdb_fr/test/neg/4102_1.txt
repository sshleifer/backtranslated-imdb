In general, I do not review movies that I have not seen for a while, so I insert or rent them to give them a complete and fresh version of the film. In the case of "A sound of thunder", I remembered my wish never to see this film again, so I'll just remember. In fact, I had not thought about how much this film had been done before reading someone else's review and remembering the experience I had in 2005, when I had it really seen at the theater. My movie friend forced me to see him, even if it did not interest me, and wow. (Later, I forced him to see 'Basic Instinct 2' in the cinema, reminding him that he had made me see this shit, so I guess it made us equal.) I certainly had my share of deep laughs (at the expense of the movie, of course,) that did not make him happy because he really wanted to see it. The film effect in time / butterfly effect had so many bad graphics, the loudest laugh of me was every time they showed the dinosaur (God loved to see this dino and they were really scared of that? hilarious!) Or simply, Ben Kingsley. That's great, Kingsley can remind us how much actors can be human: from 'Gandhi' to 'Schindler's List' to, uh, this. (Even a Meryl Streep can make a "devil" from time to time, so they are forgiven.) For months, I released an MST3k with my boyfriend, constantly referring to this film with any science film -fiction inexpensive or Kingsley flick. Yes, the movie would be a good movie to see drunk (or intoxicated): horrible over-the-top, a "special" effect that even the Nintendo64 would turn away and ridiculous twists. The biggest disappointment was that the Razzies did not even offer this movie for a price.
