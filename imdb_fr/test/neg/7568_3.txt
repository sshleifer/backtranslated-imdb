I like J-horror, cartoons and even a little pink movement, which some claim to be a member of the band, but it did not bring me anything. I'm ready to go one step further and call this episode one of the biggest disappointments of my career watching movies. <br /> <br /> Three young rockabillies are walking around to rape girls. One of the members of the group begins to elaborate concisions on their hobby when his little sister surprises them almost in the act. Invariably, the group turns against itself when friends start fighting. This ends on a note that goes well with the film as a whole. <br /> <br /> Aside from watching friends scream at each other, which they often do, there is not much to do here. The film is littered with LONG continuous shots that only exacerbate the problem. On top of that, even when the movie starts doing something interesting, it suddenly gets bogged down in an ethereal philosophy that never makes sense. For example, after one of the buddies changes his mind, he goes out and starts again, but then prevents his buddies from taking their turn. Huh? The cinematography is slow and the lighting is weak. Writing is good, as is the acting, which makes it an insufficient cinematic effort from the start. Mix the lack of technical prowess with the fragile content and you have nothing more than a waste of time. <br /> <br /> Oh, and one more note, at least one of the girls featured in the embellishment did not seem old enough to do that sort of thing. <br /> <br /> 3/10
