This horrible action ?? sci-fi movie is a shit. I just spent 90 minutes of my life watching one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The story has no meaning, there are a lot of flaws in the script, the characters are poorly developed, the unknown cast is horrible, the main actor of the ham seems to be too old for his role. I was prompted to buy this VHS, which has a gorgeous cover, and see this shit because of the illogical IDDb rating and some critical "ten stars". I just checked the authors and each of them has only a short review (of "L.I.N.X") published in IMDb, and nothing else. Why are they promoting such a trash? My vote is one. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "L.I.N.X. Conex√£o Letal" ("L.I.N.X. Lethal Connection")
