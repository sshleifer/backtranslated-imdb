Wow - thank God, I was on a plane and could look out the window. Bad scenes of fire in Hollywood, predictable, terribly acted (who the hell was this terrible woman who played the wife?), Misread, terribly written. This film has apparently been made to please the kind of person who is ready to kneel in front of the altar of firefighters in particular, "Heroes" or gods in general, I suppose. I just do not have enough bad things to say about this movie. It could not be cheap either, with all the stars in it, as well as all those special effects and fire scenes. It must have cost a fortune, but it's still worse than any movie I remember. Funeral scene? Amazingly bad. The court between the fireman and the terrible woman mentioned above? Corny, artificial, banal. Firehouse jokes? Do not we all wish that we could be both manly and funny at the same time?
