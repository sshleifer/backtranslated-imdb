I can not believe that some of the scores of this movie are published on the IMDb website! Have I been published with the special Naff version? Edited by Dewhurst, produced by Bernard Matthews, this film should be hosted in Battersea. I'm sorry for all the references centered on the UK, but if you're elsewhere and you do not have any toes to cut or if you do not have a collection of beer mats to catalog, then this movie could well worth you 90 minutes life time (as long as you do not have paint to watch the drying). The plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is surprisingly fistful of ham. What does Irons do in this movie?
