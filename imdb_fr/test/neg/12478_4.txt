Lucio Fulci, a director not particularly known for his subtlety, tries himself at Touch Black, a TV movie directed for Lester Parsons (Brett Halsey), a psychopath who seduces and kills rich widows to pay his gambling debts. br /> <br /> Beginning with a wonderfully bloody scene in which the mortal lothario has his latest victim via a chain saw, a slicing machine and hungry pigs, Touch of Death begins in a promising way, but Fulci loses soon the control of the procedure, introducing a strange sub-plot involving a mysterious imitative killer and some "comic" scenes in the hard hand. There are several other illustrated murders that, like the Fulci, are extremely violent and macabre, but even the high level of bloodletting does not prevent this project from being one of Fulci's poorest efforts. <br /> <br /> As I did. found with many of his other films, an understandable story is not exactly the order of the day when Lucio is behind the camera. This film has a lot of peculiarities that left me more than perplexed: why did not Lester dispose all his victims using the method of dismemberment seen at the beginning? Why are all her victims hairy or disfigured? What is it then? <br /> <br /> Many consider Fulci to be one of the "greats" of horror cinema; I do not understand his popularity, finding that the majority of his films I have seen so far are generally lacking worthy stories and technical skills. Touch of Death certainly does not change my opinion.
