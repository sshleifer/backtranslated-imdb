I am surprised that "The Hospital" has been so well received by critics and the public. I found it sad, visually ugly and generally devoid of meaning. After the first 40 minutes almost unassailable, the film improves (relatively), but it remains too farfetched (not to say non-funny) to succeed as a satire and does not have enough substance to succeed as a drama. The uncertain tone of the film is his biggest mistake, eclipsing even Scott's formidable performance (as usual).
