I thought Godzilla 2000 was the worst movie of my life until I saw this monstrosity. My friends and I went to our local blockbuster and spent about an hour and a half looking for a movie. We could not find any because we saw almost all the movies created. We decided to look in the low budget horror section. We searched for the most attractive cover featuring slightly dressed women. We finally opted for Last Slumber Party, THE. Oops, we made a mistake. Looks like this film was shot with the cheapest camera that can be found in K-Mart. The actors were recovered in an army of salvation, and as for Steven Tyler. We will leave that to the imagination. The plot of this movie was ridiculous. SPOILER ALERT When watching the movie, there is absolutely no closure. So come discover that all events were just a dream. This film should also have lasted about 30 minutes. If the whole camera zoomed in on fixed shots and wall scans were removed, it would have been much shorter. All I can say is that I'm glad there was no follow up.
