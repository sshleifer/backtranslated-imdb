This film amused me with lots of laughter from the actors who made the film move in all directions. If you like suggestive language and sexy girls, they were all in the picture and the girls and guys all looked exhausted even before graduating high school. There is a scene where teenagers drive their car in a very fake deer and then throw it into a lake or an ocean, which is repeated over and over again. This film has no horror except the word Horrible for the whole picture and Arnold who plays a plastic policeman is really a sick person. Please do not waste your time watching this movie.
