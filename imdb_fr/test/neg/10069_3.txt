<br /> <br /> JURASSIC PARK III * ___ Adventure <br /> <br /> Sam Nell (The flat), William Macy (Happy Texas, Fargo), TZ (A man of the family) <br /> <br /> A better title would be: EXHAUST FROM THE DINOSAURS ISLAND REALLY SIGNED. But then nobody would need to see the movie. In this sequel, a group of scavengers visits Dinosaur Island to rescue a teenage girl from a hang-gliding accident. <br /> <br /> ACCESS HOLLYWOOD reports that JP3 has started filming without a full script, which is why the film seems to have little or no purpose other than to present the current state of play. Of course, there are some clever scenes and some pretty amusing elements, but no meaningful plot to link them together. Dinosaur puppets and animation in JP3 are very good to excellent and more numerous than ever. cinematic experience can not hold a candle to the original JURASSIC PARK or even JP2. <br /> <br /> JP3 is a fortunately 90 minutes - whose last 10 minutes is credited. Even at that, I often found myself checking my watch. The public with whom I saw her left the room in silence. <br /> <br /> A better bet: see the movie LEGALLY BLONDE. <br /> <br /> Dave
