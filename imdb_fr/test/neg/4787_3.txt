After I could not ignore the hype about the series, I started watching season 1 and it felt really good and I was hooked ... for about 5 episodes, then it was started to decrease. Why? First of all, Ethan Suplee is designed to act like a complete idiot, which obviously confirms it by stating semi-random stuff and hoping that it becomes somehow the next best joke. <br /> <br /> Jaime Pressly has a great look, but if she thinks she's stretching her lips to explore parts of her face that they never go to normally and make strange grimaces to emphasize everything she says is hilarious she is out of place. Maybe she thought that her character would be too flat, faded and she wanted to make it colorful and spicy, but she created a flood of colors, an overabundance of spices and shouts of attention out loud that make me eyes, ears and intellect. <BR /> <br /> I really wanted to like this show, as I said, the principle is excellent (comes from the same shelf as Amelie Poulain's The Fabulous Destiny) and Jason Lee does a great job with some of the other actors but there is no way that I get 'sucked up' and forget that this is just a show, because the surreal and extreme characters of Pressly and Suplee wake me up abruptly when they show up. It's worth noting that their characters and roles would be fine if it was not a 70-episode series and they did not get much time on the screen.
