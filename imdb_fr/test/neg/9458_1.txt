Oh yes, this is another classic story, "a murderous sociopathic doctor creates a Frankenstein woman and falls in love". <br /> <br /> From the same director who brought you timeless classics like "10,000 Maniacs" (no, not the band) and "Blood Feast", this "unfinished" movie almost calls for MST3K treatment. The doctor's assistant even has a Torgo connotation of the classic "Manos: The Hands Of Fate". I do not know if the graphics, if a false appearance of violence or frequent trouble without dialogue could have scared the team, however. <br /> <br /> The main reasons to bother watching this film are: for the hysterical "hypnosis" scene, the ridiculously serious end and the darkest production values. I watched all the credits after this movie, for the same reasons that you are inclined to slow down your car when you pass a serious road accident. This and the genius of the final theme that looks like a "My favorite things" sweetened played on a toy piano. Goblin it is not.
