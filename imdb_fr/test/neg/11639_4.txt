A black-faced man lands in a spaceship and meets a girl who lives in a kind of cabin with a monkey. He connects her with a phone and she tells him how to get to Charleston. Then they fly into the spaceship, leaving the monkey behind. Blackface misleading, this short film makes no sense. I think that's the plot, but I'm not sure about it. You can not say that it's Renoir at work, despite his characteristic humanism. Good use of slow motion, though. It can be found in the series of experimental videos on the film New Film Annex, No. 18, I believe.
