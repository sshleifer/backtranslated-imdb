This movie describes a really horrible event, of course. But all this is due to the poor performance of all actors. It is impossible to feel the emotions of almost all the characters, all the emotional scenes resembling parodies of themselves. For example, a character is filmed at the beginning of the movie and you get the desperate clich√©, "Am I going to get there, sergeant?", "Yeah it's not nothing" ", but it's played like a sketch from a Wayans Brothers movie (I do not know if they've ever made the war movie) or anything featuring Leslie Nielsen. <br /> <br /> Sergeant Sean Penn reminds me of Al Bundy's Married With Children, while Fox is the biggest shot of self-depreciating good-guy you can imagine ... God be praised, he curses and smokes during. <br /> <br /> His emotion "NOOOO !! ! "is certainly more suited to comedies like Back To The Future than so-called serious films like this. <br /> <br /> To their credit, some of the" main "scenes ... (without revealing too much about it) , where they actually perform quite horrible acts) ... are well done and require us to take the subject seriously.But it is despite, not great that the acting.
