When the Legends Die tells the moving story of an orphan Indian Ute, who will become Tom Black Bull, a champion of broncs. Old-fashioned, Tom receives the name of a white man and must adopt the language and manners of the white man to live in this world. Bitter for the role in which he was forced, Tom finds his accomplishment in one thing: breaking horses, riding them to death, in the rodeo. The film has Richard Widmark in the role of Red, the man who befriends Tom and acts as his manager. Red is a drunkard who finally dies in the story, which explains the end of the film. The real story is completely ignored, the dark side of Tom Black Bull, who is gaining a reputation as a horse killer in rodeo arenas. Oh, well, you should read the book, this movie is far from doing justice to the story.
