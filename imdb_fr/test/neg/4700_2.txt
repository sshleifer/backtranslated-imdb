It seems incredible that the same decade that brought Star Wars to the silver screen caused the disappearance of untold guts like this one and many other "adventure" movies. I remember the same 'Ashanti' sumptuously similar, but just as miserable, described elsewhere. <br /> <br /> Whatever the motive that motivated the actors to sign for such waste celluloid, this author is frankly beyond. They must be very, very desperate. To be perfectly frank, the appearance of Roger Moore in any film is the kiss of death. Although very attractive in his youth, his entire acting career is based on his ability to raise an eyebrow. Every emotion from A to B is translated by this simple stratagem. These are the days of James Bond's dog. Lee Marvin, on the other hand, has had very commendable releases, including "Paint Your Wagon" and "The Dirty Dozen". He has a comic strip, but he is much better when he plays straight. <br /> <br /> The excellent Ian Holm is a disposable, barely recognizable blackened as a mute African. All the others were just picking up their pay check. <br /> <br /> The only plausible and observable element is the German cruiser. It looks like a very big model. But he is incredibly massive and looks authentic - just like his crew. The rest is not even hokum. Childish comedy mixes with the brutality and violence of a story that winds awkwardly, as if the screenplay itself had had too much puffs of Lee Marvin's gin. Here is a director who just does not know where he is going. There are allusions to "The African Queen", an excerpt from "The Pride & The Passion", "Gold", and one or two other movie scams whose titles do not come to your mind. <br /> <Strangely, I saw him three times. Each time it was broadcast on television when I was hit with a cold or flu. Maybe it influences my judgment - but not much. <br /> <br /> Compare it with any Indiana Jones movie and you'll see what I mean. <br /> <br /> I gave him two stars; one for the battleship and the other because it finally ends, even though God knows that enough time is needed to do it. <br /> <br /> It's time for another Lemsip, I think.
