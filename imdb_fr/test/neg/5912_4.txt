In 1989, Eddie Murphy was no longer so hot and was starting to make films that would soon be forgotten. Curiously, it was also the year Murphy made his first film, but it would also be the first and the last experience. "Harlem nights" was not exactly what we call a hit, although it was great to see the two best black actors, Murphy and Richard Pryor, together. Do not blame the actors because they all played their roles as you wanted, even if you have to (still) face Murphy's typical laughter. The worst thing about "Harlem Nights" is both the scenario and its terrible scenery. Everything happens in the roaring twenties and everyone benefits from the banned clubs. Sugar Ray (Pryor) and her adoptive son Quickie (Murphy) easily make $ 10,000 a day, but of course, soon, the crowd and the corrupt police come around the corner to claim their share of the cookie. Sugar and Quickie are not guys who give their money for free and have their own projects. You can watch "Harlem Nights" for sure, but if you throw up the moment you hear Murphy's name, you'd better avoid it, because after all, this movie is just a lame excuse at the joke.
