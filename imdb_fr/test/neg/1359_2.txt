For those of you who have never heard of the film so far (which, I suppose, a lot of lucky people have not done yet), I'll summarize it for you. Ryan Gosling plays the main character of Leland, who also plays the role of narrator of the film (at the Kevin Spacey in American Beauty, but without the intelligent observations on life). Leland goes to jail for stabbing a disabled child to death, and the film tries to understand why he did it. He seems to be a nice boy (if he is not mentally absent) and is described by Gosling with a complete lack of violence, anger or agenda (and if you wait for him to reveal his sinister side later in the movie, don't waste your time-- it's not that kind of movie). Once in juvenile jail, Leland follows classes given by Pearl Madison, skillfully portrayed by Don Cheadle (who is incapable of anything except quality, even in bad movies). Pearl tries to unravel the mystery of Leland to try to understand how such a child could do such a thing, and so write a book about it later (besides being a juvenile prison teacher, Pearl is also an author budding). <br /> <br /> The relationship between Leland and Pearl is the main story behind the film, as their interviews reveal Leland's past to the audience. However, to call it the central focus would imply that this sinuous film has one. It's not. The United States of Leland have an impressive cast, which seems to be at the expense of the film. It seems that the writer / director Matthew Ryan Hodge (do not worry, you have not heard from him, he never did anything) had to give EVERY character a personal scenario and a personality defect for that the actors can play them. . Most of these traits and stories are clichéd, and most are underdeveloped and unresolved. <br /> <br /> I'll try to break them down here: Martin Donovan and Ann Magnuson are the parents of the murdered late boy (I love how the movie continued to call the kid "retarded", never "mentally handicapped" This part made me laugh inside), they apparently have a cold relationship because all suburban weddings in contemporary cinema must be cold. Their other two children are Michelle Williams, who is apparently a budding actress on the verge of university, and Jena Malone, who plays the same teenage archetype she always plays, this time with an addiction. to heroin. Malone was also Leland's girlfriend, which gives her a connection with her victim. Williams's boyfriend, who was an orphan and came to live with the family, is a baseball player who seeks to attend the same college as his girlfriend, is played by Chris Klein. He ends up doing more with his character than any other player, sometimes succeeding in stealing the film. Lena Olin is Leland's mother, who seems to be always sad for some reason. Kevin Spacey (also executive producer) is the cold and absent father of famous novelist Leland. Finally, Sherilyn Fenn will come forward to put an end to Leland's story, if it matters to you. Oh yes, and there is an ex-boyfriend who is a drug dealer, a couple of young boys and a colleague from Pearl with whom he has an affair with his long-distance girlfriend with (played by Kerry Washington). <br /> <Sorry if all this summary and character decomposition took so long. If it sounds insignificant and boring, you have just experienced what I did during the 108 minutes I spent watching the movie. But the unruly cast of overworked clichés is the least of the crimes in this film. The most important thing is that the whole exercise is totally useless. We do not look at us in a fascinating way in a troubled mind, we are not given an effective explanation, we are not given much. Since it's been so bad, I'm going to tell you the end so you never have to see it: Leland stabbed the self-timer because all that Leland could see in the world was sad, and wanted to save Corky (or whatever the name of the victim, the sadness in his eyes, it's as if the worst emo group in the world had made an album entitled "The world is sad, so I've lost a delay." Oh, and Leland finally dies, in a sequence that relies so much on incredible coincidences that it would have ruined the film, if the film was not already void.Of course, it dies in the end, because the film was so deep. /> <br /> I give 2 stars to the movie, because the actors themselves all did a great job with the junk they received.The scenes with Cheadle and Gosling together were even interesting on some levels. , to paraphrase the film itself, it must be believed that the films are more than the sum of their parts, kiddo.
