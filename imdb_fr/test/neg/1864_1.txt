It's one of the worst movies of all time. I can not believe how bad it was. I was shocked by the horrors of ghoul masks. These are obviously Halloween masks! Mouths do not even move when they speak !!!!! Why did they feel the need to make comic and clumsy ghosts? Whenever they do anything, there seems to be circus-like music and BONK and BOING sounds that are overused when they hit people. The domineering slavery is one of the worst actresses I have ever seen. This movie is just bad. The plot is non-existent. The mother of ONE TREE HILL is however in this situation and she has obviously had a nose job since it was done. Why did the main character of the first movie come back to make this trash? Bad bad movie.
