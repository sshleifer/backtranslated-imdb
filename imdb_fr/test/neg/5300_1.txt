Uma and Travolta were very good together, but - sadly - when they left the screen, the movie was just a group of very boring and verbose secondary characters, wrapped in extremely bad writing. Occasional glimpses of grandeur, such as the dance scene between Uma and Travolta, quickly faded when Harvey Keitel and similar uninspired hooligans appeared. And the white guy who tried to act in black became VERY, VERY tiring after a too long exposure on the picture. It weighed a pretty good performance of The Rock, the only secondary character you could not wait to see off the screen. Bad stupid plot. The writers clearly could not know if they were writing for Generation X or for the rap group aged between 12 and 15, and the combination turned into a movie that allowed me to watch my watch!
