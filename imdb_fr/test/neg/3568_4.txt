For me, this film is essentially a pilot episode of feature film for a television series. It reminds me particularly of the British remake of the TV series Wallander, starring Kenneth Brannagh. The people interviewed by the police are robust and often as bitter as time, the chief investigator has enormous family problems, the investigations invariably lead to the cruelty of the distant past and the plot is labyrinthine with strange events and secondary intrigues with meaning. Both have excellent cinematography. <br /> <br /> The Jar City scenario is extraordinarily reminiscent of a classic British or American detective series. Indeed, you can take the plot of any episode of Touch of Frost and transplant it over the dark region of this movie to get an effective sequel. <br /> <br /> The script could not be clearer. from the cookie cutter. You even get the most familiar motives, like the fact that the police go to the local jail to interrogate a manipulative and dangerous psychopath, who inevitably explodes at the end of the interview. <br /> <br /> I'm absolutely convinced that for a lot of people, it's scones and jam, but I feel like I have to point out people like me who do not go to the movies to watch TV. What I felt like a glaring lack of message. The film focuses on genetic studies in Iceland. The Icelandic genetics have remained largely isolated from the outside world, providing scientists with an excellent opportunity to study their genetics. Much information on the heredity of the population has been preserved and many of Iceland's genetic diseases can be effectively detected in a population that has failed to hybridize and is remarkably homogeneous genetically ( it's like trying to piece together the puzzle of the London Underground Plan, instead of the puzzle of a daisy field). A company called DeCODE Genetics has attempted to create a database containing all the genetic and hereditary information of the entire Icelandic population. For reasons of confidentiality, this project was stopped and at the end of last year deCODE Genetics went bankrupt in Iceland. The episode is a subject of rich debate. <br /> <br /> But in this film, genetics and medical science are not there for education, but for a strange atmosphere. <br /> <br /> It's a dreadful film if you're interested, and there's often a morbid focus on food to accompany events, like a coroner eating lunch between incisions. The most uncomfortable for me is when the chief inspector devours the head of a sheep. Unfortunately for me, this has sometimes become a joke. The film tries the rather delicate task of mixing the macabre with the sentimental, and ended up providing an involuntary humor towards the end. It's the equivalent, in cinematic terms, of trying to prepare fugu. If you are unskilled, skillful and insightful, you poison the client. This rather novice director should have lowered the price of his performance. <br /> <br /> I came out of this movie, feeling pretty bad about myself and life in general.
