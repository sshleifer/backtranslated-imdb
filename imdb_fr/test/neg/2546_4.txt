Maybe the spoilers then do not read if you do not want to. Just like watching the news on TV, everything has already happened, a big tsunami threatens a bay of the city and CUT, nothing to see, Tokay undergoes a big earthquake, did we see more than 5 seconds what I saw? If you want to make a love story, make a love affair but if you want to use a disaster movie title, please be kind enough to show me THE DISASTER, pd after watching this movie watching JISHIN RETTO or any other movie GODZILLA part that was ready to see people screaming and collapsing buildings that did not have a chance to do it in this movie. Do not take me bad. I like the disaster movies and chimbotsu Nihon and Jishin retto of origin, I even like the last Poseidon, which is not really a story, but a very good and disastrous sequence disaster, chimbotsu New Nihon loses sight of point. many times like Pearl Harbor or the day after tomorrow but at least these two movies show good disaster sequences, and also enough with the expensive FX that shows nothing, give me fake buildings if you want as long as you destroy them properly, I know I must look like a sadistic monster, but I've been to Love when I wanted to go see a romantic movie, grrrrrr even kimpachi sensei makes me cry and I did not like this movie. there is also a television series called nimb chimbotsu made in 1975, I have on DVD and it's much better
