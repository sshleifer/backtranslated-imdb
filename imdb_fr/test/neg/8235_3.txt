Luther the Geek (1990) is a dull horror movie and is really bad even by Troma standards! This is a monster that bites chickens' heads and kills people by biting his neck, and he actually thinks he's a chicken himself !!!!! Luther is released from prison after 25 years because apparently he has been a "model" prisoner and deserves another chance in life (which is VERY difficult to believe after seeing how he acts and treats people throughout the film ). <br /> <br /> After killing an old lady in a supermarket parking lot, he manages to sneak into a woman's car and torture her, along with her daughter and their daughter's boyfriend, at their family's home in the countryside. <br /> <br /> Then, we are entitled to a long and boring film, with a dreadful acting game, before a useless cop shows up to try to kill Luther once and for all! Oh and the movie has a ridiculous and laughable ending too !!! I love low budget horror movies and I think "The Toxic Avenger" is a classic all time, but I'm afraid Luther the geek is boring, illogical and boring, there not much gore too, just a few bloody neck bites and that's about it! 3/10
