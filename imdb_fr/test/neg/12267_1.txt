Everything in this movie is horrible. <br /> <br /> You can tell in the first five minutes that this movie is going to be awful. However, you can not know how difficult this is going to be. <br /> <br /> We begin the film with a seemingly endless intro scene, with gay music and no dialogue. Making the camera go up and down in the big players who are trying to look like minds does not cause the slightest emotion. <br /> <br /> What begins then seems to be one of two distinct stories. The first half of the film is a series of fierce battles fighting over paid midnight fights with other ethnic groups. Pigeons always win, of course, because they seem to lift weights and have "respect". It is in these scenes that we first discover the degree of misinterpretation, editing, scripting and hatred of the people who financed this film. <br /> <br /> The main character and his companion end up being sent to prison. The entire prison part of the film is not related to what I suppose is the plot and consists of a series of fights. <br /> <br /> Once out of jail (3 years for murder?) The main character and his companion reunite with the wogs. They then go to "the other side of the city" and try to fall asleep because, apparently, everyone wants to kill them. <br /> <br /> Soon, the war dogs are preparing to rape another gang girl around the city to fight hordes of different gangs. This point of the movie can be likened to an arcade game, as wogs simply run and fight enemies that seem to get worse as the movie progresses. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the movie ends with some huge climactic battle scene in which the remaining wogs (the two main characters) take on every gang they've fought so far . Apparently, the other gangs have no problem to unite to attack the last dogs (the skinheads are not bothered by Asians). After a million more people are beaten by the invincible Wog brothers, the film ends with the return of the main characters. They do not return home, however, because they are burned to death by thousands of angry movie critics who storm the scene and leave angry letters everywhere. <br /> <br /> This movie may look more like a computer game then a movie, because that would explain how two guys can take about a million punches from a million different people who most of time are twice their size. <br /> <br /> There are also tons of more stupid Unexplainable events in this movie, like an Asian fighting his own gang and taking a katana to the head just to let the wogs go away. <br /> <br /> As someone else has mentioned, this movie is not so bad it's funny, it's so bad.
