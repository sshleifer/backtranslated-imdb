It's a space film, or at least I think so. you have half-naked prisoners in a space prison and a monster in a space station using a virus to infect humanity during sexy encounters. His Friggin Hilarious. The acting is so bad that Space Nuts looks like an award-winning film to an Emmy Award. The story is simple. A prisoner of space has the opportunity to reduce his sentence by investigating a space station that has lost touch with humanity. She finds a doctor who is "experimenting" with a woman and an angry stranger. She fights them, so on. It's a movie that is worth seeing to wet your pants with laughter. If you like real sci-fi movies, this is a no-no, but it's a great asset for the amateur filmmaker, because I can guarantee you that his film is better than that one.
