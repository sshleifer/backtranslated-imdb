This movie just does not work. There are no two ways to go. I saw it for the first time in 1998, when it was released, and I did not like it. I just bought it for sale a few days ago, because I thought "but damn, I'll try". I do not regret the money I spent on Hamilton, but the fact remains the same. This film is useless, boring and uninteresting. <br /> <br /> Stormare is usually a delight, but that's where he wins movies in the United States. Back home, it does not work. Of course, the film is well done (if you forget the footage here "), but in the end, the only thing that REALLY raises Hamilton over the stars is Hamill's turn as villain Hawkins He has a lot of fun with the character and is also responsible for the only two good moments of the film. "Swedish intelligence, huh? There is a contradiction in terms" and when he allows Hamilton to talk with his wife more than once the phone near the end of the movie and that's just about everything. <br /> <br /> ** / *****
