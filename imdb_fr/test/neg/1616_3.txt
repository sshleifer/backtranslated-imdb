I bought this movie at e-bay as part of about twenty horror movies, each for a dollar. Looking at this, my first impression was that it was probably from the late 80s. Later, I started thinking - Linkin Park posters hanging on the wall and everything else seemed to indicate that I was was busy with a newer movie. In realizing this, the film became an unbearable torment. The last three minutes were the longest in the film's history - the film simply refused to end. Is there a genre such as "horror for children"? In this case, it is the film. If there are parents who are perverse enough to want to introduce their offspring to horror, I suggest that it would be perfect for children around 6 to 8 years old. The only thing that really appealed to me was Greg Cipes, who was far too good actor for this kind of nostalgic retro stocking.
