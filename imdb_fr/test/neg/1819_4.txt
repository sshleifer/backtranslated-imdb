This film would like to be the kind of shocking, cerebral and intense film that many others of its kind have achieved, but it is not. It's at best confusing and absurd. When the twists finally turned out, rather than saying "Ahh, I understand!" I whispered something like "Ok ... no matter." In my opinion, when a film reveals a major twist of the plot, it should not be forced to resort to a flashback sequence to prove that it gave clues allowing the viewer to discern the truth itself. But this movie has a flashback; and here is the kicker: it recalls scenes that did not even appear in the film! <br /> <br /> The characters were stereotyped, unfriendly and totally ridiculous. I think the "hot" love scenes between the romantic characters were the most untitled and less sexy scenes I've ever seen in a non-pornographic film. It seems that the director was shocking and perverse with the scenes of love, but they were really just silly. <br /> <br /> And NEVER make me talk about shit accents and second-rate decorations. I guess the film was shot in New Orleans, but the film could have been shot in Anytown, USA. In addition to the aforementioned accents and some insane cliches of the city. <br /> <br /> My recommendation: do not bother!
