This film hits only by its banality and its use of clich√©s. Unfortunately, it was obvious until the end. But do not be fooled into thinking that it ended strongly. A little unexpectedly, although nothing is worth watching. <br /> <br /> From the taciturn and injured hero to the wicked German, through the replaceable team, the characters were entirely wooden and obvious. The two FBI agents, Smith and Wesson (geddit?) Put a little hope in humor, but it did not succeed. <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of science fiction, but it's hard to find a quality that redeems in this movie. A turkey! <br /> <br />
