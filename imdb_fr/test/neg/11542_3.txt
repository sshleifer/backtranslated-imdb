Simply horrible. It is almost unbelievable that with the characters and situations provided by Dashiell Hammett, such a mishmash is possible. But it's television for you: you fill in between ads. The first alarm signal sounds from the bustle of the reenactment of the period, which screams "1928" in banner type. Flivvers and passenger cars, fedoras and vests, bells and spoken jazz (played discordantly) - with all the attention to unnecessary and artistic details, important issues are ignored. <br /> <br /> Like narrative clarity or likelihood, or competent writing and acting. The plot features one of Hammett's agents ("Hamilton Nash", his name is "Ham" or "Nash", then "Hammett" or "Dash") investigating a robbery. of diamonds. Thus is presented the young woman who wears supposedly Dain Curse (Nancy Addison, without charm and talent, who returned to the soap opera where she belonged); she belongs to a religious sect led by Jean Simmons and seems to be addicted to "drugs"; There is also a mysterious gaseous drug that seeps into the rooms .... <br /> <br /> But enough. The writing is never more pedestrian than when it strives to reach the poetic or the high flight, and the distribution perforates it in the only way they know how to do it: by acting grotesquely. Simmons is treated as a minor royalty of Old Hollywood, but the great lady's treatment does not wash. Hector Elizondo, for some reason, appreciates the second bill (after Coburn) for an indispensable part. Other familiar faces parade, doing little good to their resume. <br /> <br /> The actors are not even photographed to look beautiful; Jason Miller is a particularly scared person, but Coburn's super-shots are also ruthless. Coburn probably played this role because, with the mustache, he looks a lot like Hammett. He needed more advice than that. no one has given him any hint as to how to play his character, the tone of the story, or how the different parts of the plot come together (they do not, at least not in this story ). So, he throws his big Chesire cat smile, whether he's called or not. <br /> <br /> Dain's curse is available on videotape, in a variety of lengths. For those who are brave enough to "see for themselves", the shortest shortcut is the sweetest of cuts.
