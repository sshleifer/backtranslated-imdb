This film is about three young idealists, two of whom join the Naxalite movement and blah blah. It's really just another film about rich, handsome people trying to decide who to sleep next. the peasants and Naxalites and the political struggles of the time serve only as a picturesque backdrop. Literally, when we do not hear the villagers say a word, it does not matter to learn the name of anyone, so they occupy the same "role" as the "natives" of old Hollywood movies. The film is also boring and the story does not get us anywhere - except in different bedrooms. We are apparently supposed to admire the artistic side of all this, which simply means that there is no good singing and dancing routine, which of course would not have saved the film, but would have at least mitigated boredom. <br /> <br /> My friend Japna was upset by the immorality of the whole story, not on the bedroom side, but on the uselessness of the story. The message seems to be that ideals are not worth pursuing.
