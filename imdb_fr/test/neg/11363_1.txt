It must be the worst movie I've seen this year .. and I watch a lot of cable. The plot is just ridiculous, the scenes are launched to you without action, without beginning or end of any scene .. they are just random idiots with makeup that screams in a plane. his buttocks are horrible, the contact lenses are cute .. I must administer that I could not stand to look at the end. The scene where the great scientist Bennett stood close to the engine was too much for me. I'm sorry for my bad english. I come from Romania (and this is my first message). I had to sign up just to comment on this movie because I just can not believe it was a 2007 movie.
