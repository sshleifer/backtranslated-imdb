Let's summarize how stupid this film is with two details: Arnold to Antichrist: "Let's see who is the meanest," said an impassive face. And you can say that they were not trying to be funny. <br /> <br /> How do you think Arnold will fight evil from all evil? <br /> <br /> Blessed water, a crucifix, a priest. .nooo! with a bazooka, yes, even Satan did not expect it, they are also intelligent. <br /> <br /> After an engaging start (which reminds you of the Devil's Advocate), that leads nowhere. Someone gives me back these two hours of my life. Never look at it, praise it, do not buy it. <br /> <br />
