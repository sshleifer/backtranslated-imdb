The Bridge At Remagen contains some of the most absurd scenarios I have ever seen about the war. Aside from the actors' play, which is wooden, no tank commander attacks with his chariots in pretty rows, in the middle of roads, and with troops tight on the whole, arms clenched. The constant suicidal behavior triggered my "tilt switch" so often that I found it impossible to enjoy the movie. Apparently, the writers and the director have never known the war and have never bothered to bring an expert. This film is the very antithesis of the excellent detail of Saving Private Ryan. Unless you are under 7, I recommend you look something else. <br /> <br /> FR
