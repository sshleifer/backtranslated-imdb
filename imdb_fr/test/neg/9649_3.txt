First, let me say that I am not someone who is used to fear watching movies. I love Tarkowsky's movies, for example. Berghman is also a favorite ... but that? The positives can be summed up easily: the photography is beautiful and the music perfect .... is it a good movie? I used to think so, but this one is the perfect example of the one who (for me) does not ... maybe it's because I'm so stupid? possible, but I do not think so ... Tarkwosky, for example, also used very long shots, but what he never did was shoot 5 minutes of the same picture of two people walking (and I'm talking only in their head, because In this film, there are many, but sometimes it's effective), the overall result is downright boring, even with the intelligent nuances (which are made in an intelligent way, but above all very pedantic ) <br /> <br /> you always have the feeling that the director realizes some of the long shots not for an aesthetic or symbolic effect, but just to save on the budget .... <br /> <br /> I am very disappointed with this film, because I liked the first 30 minutes or so, but it continued over and over, without even keeping the same level as in the first scenes .... <br /> <br /> > By reading the very laudatory comments on this page, I also have the impression that this Some people simply try to see much more in the film than there is ... when a film is slow and artistic, it is not an allegory of a musical theory placed in the context of a film. little town, which is pretty interesting about itself, but it is NOT a deep film .... except for people who I absolutely want to make a kind of intellectual masturbation, but that's not what you find in the film, but what you find in yourself ... an exercise that, in my opinion, can be done much more effectively by looking at "Stalker" or "Solyaris" than Werckmeister Harmonies, that owes a lot to Tarkowsky, but the taxi is never equal to its level ....
