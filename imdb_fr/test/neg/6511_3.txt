Imagine an alternative universe in which SEVEN was created. Instead of forming a team and talented actors, he chose a politically conscious environmentalist and a humorist comedian. If your imagination can not stretch so far, just watch THE GLIMMER MAN, because it's the worst thing to come <br /> <br /> !!! MILD SPOILERS !!!! <br /> <br /> Jack Cole is a cop with a hidden past and it's very ironic that he's portrayed by Steven Seagal, because he's also someone with a hidden past, but do not tell him nobody because he is Top Secret. Perhaps the biggest secret is that someone like Seagal has become a movie star since THE GLIMMER MAN continues in the vein of all the other Seagal films, in the sense that it is completely nil. Look at the way he is introduced as his partner enters his office "Yoi love beads man, you're in the wrong office," Steven answers with some quick wit, or he would if someone was able to understand a bloody word he said because he mumbles for most of the film. In fact, the only moment I managed to discern his dialogue was the scene at school where he stopped on the shooter holding the hostage hostage hostage <br /> <br /> "Ne do not force me to kill you "<br /> <Is that what a policeman would say to a suicidal gunman? I just think that in another movie where Steven is not the hero (ie a good movie), the policeman would say something like, "Do not kill me, I have a wife and two children waiting at home ". So anyway, a suicidal warrior will break his head, but Steven saves his life by hitting them both by two windows. It goes without saying that you should not try this at home <br /> <br /> As the story progresses, Steven (I give up calling him Jack, although the scriptwriter assigned him a reasonable name) becomes involved in a plagiarism affair where someone steals pieces of other high quality movies featuring serial killers. While Steven finds more victims, you can see him thinking "What is this movie that plays Morgan Freeman as a cop?" While inspecting the bodies, oh, and the action keeps coming back to the hero's domestic life, just so we know that this guy is good as a family man, this guy is very good as a as a family man, pity he's so bad as a movie star
