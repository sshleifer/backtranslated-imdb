I watched this movie by accident on TV and it was so horrible that I could not turn it off. The story of Oscar Wilde has been totally erased by the scenario writer. It hardly matters, because the terrible actor and clich√© music and the disgusting music would ruin anything that looks like a decent scenario anyway. The worst performance comes from Patrick Stewart who appears as the most martyr, the most talented and the least Shakespearean nompompoop of the ghost. "Get out of here!" he screams at one moment, waving his arms like a mean pantomime. A really awful film and why does Stewart, who can act when called upon, tarnish his reputation by making worthless nonsense like this and the XMen.
