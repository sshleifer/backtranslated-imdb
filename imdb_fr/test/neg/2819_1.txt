This film was an absolute trash. The director and the stars (?) Should be banned from making movies forever. The plot concerns a sordid director played by the shady director (who is now acting) advertising on the Internet for women to play in a snuff film. <br /> <br /> There is no horror at all, the girls look bored, the direction is useless, the music is misplaced (heavy metal in a library scene?) and the light is awful. The director should have cashed two other caddies full of aluminum cans and get a script, sober actors and some light bulbs. As it stands, it's one of the disgusting, ugly and worthless mess of a movie.
