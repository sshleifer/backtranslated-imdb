It's a pretty ugly image. It offers nothing unique, original or even interesting. <br /> <br /> Medical student discovers that a secret society at her university is engaged in macabre medical experiments.And of course, she gets involved in This film started at the beginning promising with some cool special effects in which a guy is partially dissected while he is alive and tries to escape after waking up, but it eventually collapses and the rest of the special effects. Beautiful plastic models of plastic of the human body and that unreal blood that always seem to have these second-rate horror films. <br /> <br /> And as if the routine plot and the unhealthy game were not enough, this movie had subtitles that many times did not even match the dubbed English you hear and add then that the movement of the mouth does not match the dubbing .. well, let's just say that trying to coordinate everything that goes in your head is not worth it for this mediocre film. <br /> <b r /> I relied on at least one skin in this film and apart a little during the opening credits, this film did not keep its promises. <br /> <br /> It's a boring routine. horror movie / gore --- short on horror and gore.Skip this movie unless "Ernest goes to camp" is the only rental left.
