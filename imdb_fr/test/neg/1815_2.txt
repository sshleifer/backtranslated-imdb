After seeing the movie version of Heart Of Darkness, I feel like I've lost 100 minutes of my life. Although the book is not my favorite, I was very disappointed to see how well Nicolas Roeg had told the story. Despite the fact that he omitted a lot of important information, the actors did not seem to fit their roles and the film as a whole seemed extremely emotionless. The book describes striking scenes and details that are completely ignored in the film. <br /> <br /> One would think that a director could insert 76 pages of a book in a film of at least an hour and a half. The differences have completely changed the story for me. For example, when the character of Kurtz's fianc√©e is indifferent to Kurtz's passing away, it completely changes the end given by the book. Not to mention the sets and sets used in the film were not as beautiful as they had been described. It's like Roeg was filming another story with Heart Of Darkness references. <br /> <br /> If you watch the movie without knowing the title or expect it to sound like a Joseph Conrad tale, you might find it good. Although I thought the camera work was mediocre and the cast did not fit, it's still a captivating story. However, if you are looking for a good cinematic version of the famous classic story, do not look for it in the Roeg movie.
