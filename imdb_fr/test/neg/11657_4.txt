This movie seemed to have been rushed out for some reason. It's really not a well done film. So incredible. The scenes where the president (Holbrook) was in the city center and walking among the population were a joke. Ordinary people would have no chance of being within 30 meters of the president in this real situation. If it were not for blood and blasphemy, it would have been shot like a TV movie. It could have been decent if it had been done differently. The talents of Holbrook (president) have never been realized in this film. Shatner's role is fine. The production values ​​of this film leave much to be desired. Overall, I think most people would be better off not wasting time looking at this case.
