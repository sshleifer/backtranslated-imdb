This film could have been summed up in about 10 minutes. I do not know what everyone was smoking, calling it a beautiful movie. I feel that a few hours of my life have been stolen and I want to get them back. I would put this in the category of a Battlefield Earth. Yes, people are so bad. You might as well watch an excerpt from this film twice in a row, it would have the same effect. DO NOT LOSE YOUR TIME !!!
