This "documentary" absolutely does not illuminate what it would be like to be behind the scenes of the Hard Knock Life tour. Admittedly, I was not there, but watching this movie did not give me the impression of being. And for a film like this, it's not really a compliment. All the time I watched, all I could think was, "What are they dropping?" When all is over, the only rapper for whom you have an idea of ​​the subject is DMX, and that's mainly because he only talks about his dogs. A waste of time. <br /> <br /> 3/10
