As several posters have "hinted", it's an unpleasant "Star Wars" scam. Now, if you want to steal "Star Wars", do it at least as it should; "Battlestar Galactica" did it, and there were a few other space operas that did not do it badly, but it's certainly not one of them. David Mendenhall, the thread of youth, is actually not so bad, although he exaggerates more and more about the "cute" factor. Vince Edwards has not improved much as an actor since his "Ben Casey" years; on the contrary, he is even more wooden than he was ten years old. The other representations are not a subject of reflection either. The special effects are even worse. the best you can say about them is that they are ugly. It is obvious that the "extraterrestrials" are simply actors wearing rubber masks covered with a bit of foam or latex, and the scenes of "battle" between Edwards' attackers and the extraterrestrials are poorly staged and slaughtered. A very small effort by Roger Corman. Jump.
