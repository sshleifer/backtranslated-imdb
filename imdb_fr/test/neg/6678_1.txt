Normally, I would not waste my time reviewing a film like "Human Pork Chop" (the 2001 version, not to be confused with the previous movie of the same title, which is probably best known in the West as "The Untold Story "."), But as the reviews already presented are rather vague as to its composition, I thought I'd better publish something more detailed, so that no one is really tempted (as I was) to buy it because of the mystic film.Honly, I would simply say: STAY AWAY. <br /> <br /> **** The main spoiler are shown below **** <br /> <br /> "Human pork chop", I was expecting to be like a Chinese interpretation of the popular Japanese "Guinea Pig" movies, and anyone who has watched this series enough can see where its creators come from. the humor in all this - you can not look ridiculous "He never dies" without laughing and "The Making of Guinea Pig" is a fabulous turnaround that does the opposite, proving that it has just been made, with some joy, by gorehounds in a good mood. All GP films have punk rock, DIY, video-taped aesthetics, occasional lightning of real art ("Mermaid in a Manhole"), an angry political agenda and a distorted and deranged zeal that places them in a league. of their <br /> <br /> "Human Pork Chop" has nothing that is mentioned above. <br /> <br /> It rotates in a 35 mm film (with extremely good production values), it lasts 90 minutes and is completely exhausting. without buying anything back. The plot tells, during a police interview with the suspects, the possible torture, death and dismemberment of Grace, a prostitute addicted to heroin who is kidnapped and brutalized by her pimp and henchmen when she he steals money. Despite its ephemeral attempts to moralize, the film has an impression of detachment and inhumanity and one can not help but dwell on the mentality of those who support it. Although she portrays Grace as an innocent victim without conviction, the petty nature of her script and the constant and vicious dialogue of the protagonist turn to a "she deserves it!" Shocking and totally unwelcome. point of view that makes everything almost impossible to look at. Much more time is spent detailing Grace's degradation, and when her captors are finally found guilty and imprisoned, it seems like a quick-hitting reflection from writers who have long since stopped caring for nothing. bewildering as to why someone would want to watch such a movie is that even the kind of people who REALLY attack blind sex and violence in movies would be severely lacking . The torture consists of a continuous stream of kicks, slaps, verbal abuse, psychological abuse, then increasingly bizarre power demonstrations in the name of the kidnappers who use Grace's heroin addiction to accomplish. And when I say that, do not misunderstand me, incidentally. Unlike "Guinea Pig" with its frequent barrage of nudity that gives an almost adolescent impression of mock trial despite the ultraviolet, "Human Pork Chop" does not have this sexual connotation. There is no real nudity in the film and the violence is purely malicious on the part of the odious protagonists (who at the beginning of the film were seen stuffing a dog in a bag and banging him against a brick wall - do not worry, not real, just a cheap special effect!). <br /> <br /> The only real bloodbath in the movie is towards the end when they dismember Grace's body and boil the bones, all very poor special effects (nowhere near "Guinea Pig" level) and, at this point, you will probably feel already too unhappy and sick to worry about what is happening. <br /> <br /> The film is terribly dark and uncompromising, in the same sense as that of Buddy Giovinazzo. "Combat Shock" and I guess we could even compare, with a push. Both films deal with the gradual physical decline of an individual who exists in a nightmarish environment devoid of social or morally redeemable characters, and the two films "culminate" in a particularly visceral way with the inevitable and inevitable destiny of the individual. <br /> <br /> In all fairness, neither glamorism nor violence (while "Guinea Pig" could easily be accused), but one can not help wondering where is the place of a movie like this. He omits many real points in his frank presentation of such brutality and with a lead rhythm, a virtually non-existent plot and the aforementioned lack of entertainment value, I simply can not understand what would encourage someone to watch something like that. I did it only until the end, only in order to be able to examine it fairly ... which I hope I have done now. <br /> <br /> Overall Score: 0 over 10. Welcome to the bottom of the cannon.
