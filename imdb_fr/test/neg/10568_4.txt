I had more fun watching my wife almost pull her hair out of frustration during most of this movie. I thought something that would tie it all up would be right around the dairy barn from one minute to the next. So I cheated, grabbed the remote and was relieved to see it ended in just 20 minutes. I should have turned the chain. Cute, it had potential, but yuck!
