As many people know, this is Edward D. Wood Jr.'s first feature as a writer / producer / director / actor. I have been a fan of Ed Wood for several years now. Although I do not like it as much as some of his other films, this is probably the greatest insight that the film-going audience gets from Wood during his lifetime. Everyone knows he was a transvestite. This film discusses sex change and how transvestite can create conflict in relationships with loved ones. This film is way ahead of its time in dealing with this subject and how it is treated. However, the film still contains Wood's usual traps, namely a bad dialogue, meaningless footage and hokey special effects. Add Wood's usual overdose to Bela Lugosi and you have Wood's first attempt at being a director. <br /> <br /> The plot is that a police inspector goes to a doctor after discovering the body of a transvestite committed suicide for advice on how to avoid other problems in this direction. The doctor tells him the story of Glen, who is also a transvestite. Glen wants to marry Barbara, but can not bring himself to tell him about his secret. He also talks to Alan's inspector who undergoes a sex change because he is more fit to be a woman. Bela Lugosi plays a scientist who seems to add some sort of common comment about what's going on (Lugosi's role is really not well defined and proves to be a very useful way for Wood to have a star in his film and Lugosi Treasury). <br /> <br /> In total, the film shows the distinctive features of Wood's career. Obviously, it was shot with a very small budget and a few rather risky things. He really feels "it's so bad, it's good". However, I must congratulate Ed for his progressive thinking in making this film. Transvestitism and sex changes were not very open topics in the early 1950s. Wood took a big risk in making a movie about transvestites as people who are not sexual deviants and putting a more human face on miscegenation.
