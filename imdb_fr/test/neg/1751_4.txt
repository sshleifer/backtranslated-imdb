I recently saw Shame, directed by Ingmar Bergman. The film was interesting and very unique. I liked how it was in Swedish with English subtitles and it was also in black and white. These features allowed me to better understand the characters, the period and their stories. I did not like the slowness of the movie at first or how you did not know what was really going on. At first, it was mainly the story of the relationship between Eva and Jan. The film also ended on a very depressing note, as no conflict or change was beneficial throughout the film. I probably would not go to see Shame, but it was a very cultured experience.
