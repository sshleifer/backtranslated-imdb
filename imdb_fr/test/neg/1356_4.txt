Really crazy. Even if you have not seen George Cukor's original film with Norma Shearer, Joan Crawford, Rosalind Russell, Paulette Goddard, Joan Fontaine and a cast of a thousand other stars, you can dismiss this forced comedy, politically correct and depressing. Depressing for many different reasons. Meg Ryan for one. What did she do? His face can barely move. That alone puts her miles away from Norma Shearer. Annette Bening should continue the DP and Debra Messing, what the hell was she doing here? Actresses without any link in the subconscious of the public trying to pass for friends, in a totally unconvincing way. Eva Mendes in Joan Crawford is a scandal. What a terrible idea! Her character is like a transgender interpreter without any taste or subtlety. It's strange to think that a woman adapted and directed this woman. The only positive things I can mention are a brief but very funny appearance of Bette Midler and Cloris Leachman as a housekeeper.
