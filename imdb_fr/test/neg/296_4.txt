I have heard a lot of this new bird flu that has killed dozens of people in Southeast Asia in the last three years. Apparently, it is about to mutate into something very contagious and millions and millions of people will disappear in a global pandemic. I just thought I would mention it in case you have not written your will yet. <br /> <br /> I also thought to mention it since I was looking at something called CARRIERS tonight and that was not. It's a naval war that begins with a scene at the crossroads of OUTBREAK and an episode of THE X FILES that I saw many years ago. I thought I would look at something with extra resonance after hearing the stories about the danger posed by bird flu, but after the rather unimpressive opening, CARRIERS goes down into a cheap and cheerful TVM and, like all the other TVMs you will see the main characters being women. , one of whom is an authoritarian figure while the other main woman is a mother of young children. It goes without saying that there is also a sub-plot for sick children <br /> <br /> What is irritating about the TVM format is that it exceeds the potential of what could have been a very good movie if it was made for the cinema. There is a pretty bloody scene of someone coughing blood on a nurse's face and a very impressive jay walker who is getting hurt at the waterfall, but these fragments are quickly forgotten as the mood goes down in the air. feelings of the family since made for a predominantly female audience
