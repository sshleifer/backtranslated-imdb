This movie was probably one of the worst films I've seen in a long time. A friend of mine grabbed it at the video rental store and forced me to watch it, an action we both miss. Ehh ... where to start? Writing, acting, quality? All that was bad. <br /> <br /> It is likely that some of the worst writings ever presented in a film. The dialogue was worse than I thought I was at the movies. A blatant dialogue, such as "how are you?" ... "not so great, doc" (just after an attempt to exorcise a man's daughter, then his wife's suicide attempt.Sure, he's not so great.) points, kind of funny. If it's not horribly written, planned and obvious. The general plot of the film, the writing and its operation, HORRIBLE. It was as if the writers could find nothing better to do than to write a bunch of crappy dialogs and incorporate as many scenes of sex and nudity as possible. The only almost good sexual scene (between the preacher and the tattooed girl & peirced) was filmed with a quality so poor that it looked more like a cheap porn than a feature film. Oh yes, and they never really accomplished the act. <br /> <br /> The acting game? Horrible. x100. I think the only good actor was the little Spaniard who played Miguel, Del Zamora. And his part was written horribly. The worst actor? It may be argued that Paul Kappellas, whose play was mingled with shitty music, a gun and a half-naked, bluish-white girl running in the woods, made the film almost unbearable. He even screwed up his own scene of death, one that should have been easy to understand. Although most other players have had horrible behavior as well. <br /> <br /> The lack of characters has also added to the overall sucking level of the movie. There were just enough characters for almost half of the characters to die, for the same number of people to become possessed at one point and for the remaining characters to be counted with one hand. I like ... 50 inches down. <br /> <br /> P.S. What is it with the culmination of the exorcism movies happening in a stable, anyway?
