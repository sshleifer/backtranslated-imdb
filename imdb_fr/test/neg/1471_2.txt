This film was praised to the point of ridicule. "American Movie" is a boring documentary about a boring, so ordinary person that you will find equivalents in just about every corner of America. It takes a long and hard look at a guy who has failed just about everything in the interest of making an independent movie..or two. If his failures were due to reasons other than his own selfish projects or because they were in the name of true art, the film might have had a chance. America has an abundance of better stories to tell. It should be emptied and many critics have good reason to be ashamed. Two bravo indeed!
