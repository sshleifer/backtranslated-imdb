I had the misfortune to see this movie recently and get through it. A friend bought it for £ 1 and insisted we watch it because the back cover story seemed to sound good. <br /> <br /> 10 minutes after the beginning of the film, it was obvious that the actors were amateurs and it was extremely reduced budget effort. <br /> <br /> The scenes were very badly interpreted, the script was stupid and the story contained many scenes that seemed unnecessarily long, so that the film had a reasonable length. <br /> <For example, when the main character rents a warehouse, the movie spends a ridiculous time on this scene, with a meaningless dialogue that serves neither the purpose nor the necessity of the plot. <br /> <br /> The main actor is supposed to take revenge on a woman who sleeps with men to give them HIV, he never thought to be tested. Instead, he turns into a crazy killer who decides to torture her before killing her and sawing her in pieces. <br /> <br /> If it sounds good and you think it will be a lot of gore, think again. This movie has no real bloody footage and is pretty tame for this type of movie. <br /> <br /> It's not scary, it does not make you think, it does not offer a quick entertainment. However, it can make you sleepy, it is certain that you are bored to tears, so avoid despair and follow my instructions. <br /> <br /> AVOID THIS FILM 1/2 out of 10 (it does not even deserve 1) <br /> <br /> The film lasted 78 minutes but seemed to be 2 ½ hours.
