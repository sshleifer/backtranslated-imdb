"The Apartment Complex" is a camp comedy full of kookie characters, created in place of a real story told to a young psychology student (Lowe) who occupies a management position of an apartment complex and is taken in the trap of a mysterious murder. you can call it that. This low cal watch does not contain suspense, no thrills, no drama, no action, precious rare moments, a pinch of nudity and almost no romance. "The apartment complex" is a forgettable and passable junk food reserved for the poorest people.
