The first season was excellent - good combination of work and brother and friends at home. it was actually a pretty funny show. <br /> <br /> Now he appears again and the brother and the two hot girls are gone - and everything revolves around the airline. Even the old man who runs the company has come down - way too much, where before that was perfect. <br /> <br /> This is how Sarah Mason, one of the most beautiful girls in Hollywood. <BR/> <br /> That's what happens when you let leaders get a show. You can almost see the meeting "the old man is funny, let's focus on him, point him up and explain him about the airline ... it will be a crazy version of the office!" Anyway, no sexy girls, no watch.
