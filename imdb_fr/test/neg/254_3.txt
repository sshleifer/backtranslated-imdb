the usual warning - I do not give 1 star to movies that are harmless, bad, low budget and ridiculous, although they may deserve it. These films are often fun and receive a score of 2 to 4 based purely on entertainment value - not a representation of their exemplary movie art. This film fits perfectly to this model. It's a Mexican movie about monsters, with voice over narration and not very weak special effects. Makeup is not so bad, and the acting is sometimes quite fun, but this movie is almost as stupid as Aliens vs Predator and the screenplay is not as sober (Aliens vs Predator could well receive a 1 of me but I want to see again before I commit). <br /> <br /> The plot is ridiculous, but deliciously complicated. If you have read so far, you really need to know ... A group of remarkably unscientific scientists includes the main characters. Most of them are heroes - somehow - but one of them is (of course) crazy and quite perverse. This mad scientist invents a laughable nuclear-powered robot (which looks a bit like Wizard of Oz tin man, but has a human face inexplicably located in his head). An Aztec mummy, discovered by the same "scientist" whose wife was precisely an Aztec princess in a previous life (do not ask), is opposed to the robot for the big "climax", the fight scene is enough to put the most stoic moviegoer on the floor laughing his stomach. <br /> <br /> For what it's worth, given the budget and total stupidity of the screenplay, it's a monstrous, low budget, fun movie. If you like that kind of thing, go for it.
