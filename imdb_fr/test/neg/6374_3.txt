I am obviously disappointed so I will be brief and I will not waste your time. First of all, the plot was not inspired ... at least. The animation was even worse, we are in 2008 for God's sake and it looked like a brighter version of G.I.Joe. I will not even bother to describe the actors' performance and dialogues. Or maybe I'm going because I just saw that to post a comment here, you need 10 lines (?! ??!?!). Where were we? Ah yes the performance, well it was totally flat, without passion or talent if I am excused. Now, with regards to dialogue, just like acting, no memorable quotes, nothing that anyone would expect. Let's hope the film will be decent ... at least.
