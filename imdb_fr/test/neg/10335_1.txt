If you've already shopped at Wal-Mart, then you're probably familiar with the $ 5 DVD box in the electronics department. Well, that's where I found this movie. However, I was fooled! You see, the cover of this particular DVD contained a great image of Sandy Bullock and even indicated his name as "headliner". I understood it by saying to myself: "Wow, I did not know that Sandra Bullock had made this movie?!?!" So I felt compelled to go home to watch a cool film by Sandra Bullock. To my surprise, Mrs. Bullock had a small role ... very small role. She plays the girlfriend of the son of the CIA agent. Talk about supporting the actress. She may have had no more than 2 lines in the movie. In addition to being cheated as being a Bullock movie, I looked beyond that and continued watching an action-packed movie. Negative! At one point, for special effects, a firearm was recorded on camera. You have to watch this to laugh at the horrible thing.
