Four elementary school girls witness the murder of one of their classmates over what they thought was an innocent game. The killer is a strange young boy named Milo Jeeder. Sixteen years later, the four survivors of the event meet in happier circumstances in the same city where it happened. They believe that Milo drowned in a river shortly after the murder, but soon learn that demon killer Milo has also returned, still a young boy, unchanged even after almost two decades. <br /> <br /> The cover of this film makes it really cool (I was still expecting a bad movie). When I put the DVD in my player, the menu appears and still gives the movie a cool look. Unfortunately, this film is not the only thing that fascinates me. The movie is your average slasher movie attempt and when I say mean, I mean just like all the other low budget slasher movies that have never been welcomed with open arms in most members of the community. horror (I'm talking about you, the horror fan). In other words, you could approach any horror movie fan and most of the answers would be "that sucks". <br /> <br /> What are the mistakes made by the film? First of all, the DVD cover gives Milo a really dark appearance, but she exploded by showing her face in the film in many different scenes. He had the potential to be a very weird character. Second, the back of the sleeve tells Freddy, Jason, Chucky, etc. to pack up and leave because Milo is so much better ... why the hell would you like to say something like that when it comes to a non-budget slasher movie that obviously failed? I mean, it just boosts your expectations of the film, which makes it harder to impress you. In a last effort to attract attention, it is written (in very large letters) "On the part of the creator of Anaconda". It just shows you how much attention they will get on the movie. <br /> <br /> The coolness in the film is nil, the director gives you horrible angles when Milo attacks someone. The music is not so bad and I never fell asleep during the movie (congratulations). I'm still trying to understand what Milo really is. My best bet would be that he is a zombie, if anyone else knows, tell me. Rest assured, I will not lose my sleep by thinking about it.
