Maybe if you've never read English literature or just watched the Hollywood version of any book, you might find merit in this horrible film. He has Shoreditch's director and scripting skills. The 1995 adaptation of the BBC is both very enjoyable and close to the book and captures the atmosphere between Elisabeth and Darcy very well. <br /> <br /> The characters in this production are misinterpreted, Sutherland as Bennet seems a total buffoon. Likewise, Bingley is a fool and he can not possibly be a friend of Darcy's. I can not imagine how Judi Dench could have accepted the role. She thought maybe it was a surrealistic comic version. <br /> <br /> The quotes from the book are thrown out of context. Lots of songs are missing, the important episode with Wickham is not mentioned. <br /> <br /> However, Mr. Collins is very good and dominates the other members of the cast. <br /> <br /> Only good thing The thing is we did not pay to see it. Wait for the DVD and use to keep a table from wavering.
