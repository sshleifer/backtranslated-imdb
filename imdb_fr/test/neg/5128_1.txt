I was a sophomore at the university when this movie was out and I had never seen it until last night. I finally decided to watch it because I like to dance and the film has had such a cultural impact. After seeing the movie, I am completely confused by its effect on people, except to lull people to sleep. <br /> <br /> The story is rather absurd when you think about it. Did anyone really agree that this beer group filled with steelmakers and truckers could keep their clientele with the high-level dances these girls were doing? They would all have gone to Zanzibar faster than you can say "performance art". Can you imagine the reaction of the real versions of this audience to this weird television watching No Theater Dance she did? Please. <br /> <br /> It seems plausible that a woman works in a steel mill and is also a dancer. After all, these two jobs are physically demanding. But I did not buy for a second that THIS girl was working in a steel mill. And I did not buy a second that I was watching in a real steel yard. The work of steel is dangerous. You do not keep your work area like a junk and do not end up losing a limb. I love some crazy moves, like when two welders sit in the big weld of corrugated tubes. What are they doing here? Or when she cuts six inches of a rusty steel bar with a blowtorch. She was obviously on the board and was just starting to cut things at random. <br /> <br /> But stories like this can be overlooked if the film is fun or at least challenging. Flashdance does not propose anything to balance it. <br /> <br /> The horrible dance. It's the spasmodic and chaotic style that has ruined American musicals until ... well, are we really out of date? The sensuality sought by the film is ruined by Jennifer Beal's total lack of personality. I mean, I'm a 42 year old man and when she was supposed to eat lobster, my only reaction was to think she should have a lobster bib. <br /> <br /> You can not really get behind Alex and she dreams because her character is so stupid and shallow. The dog had more than him. <br /> <br /> The love story is flat. It's nothing but an enthusiastic boss for one of his workers. Zero passion. <br /> <br /> Even the last scene where she dances for Orville Redenbacher and some other stiff is not satisfactory, because the reaction of the panels is incredible. What serious dancers would not be watching Alex's lame cheerleader routine? In short, the movie only had leggings and big sweatshirts. Oh, yes, there's a good deal of nudity when Alex "saves" his friend from being a useless erotic dancer (a bit of laughable hypocrisy). Apart from that, the film is a waste of time. I wish the MST3K team is still active. That would make good feed for them.
