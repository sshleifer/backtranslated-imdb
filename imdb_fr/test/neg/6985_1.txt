First of all, the original concept of lost gold bullion fortune discovered in a New Zealand lake, inside a plane shot down by World War II, is an excellent opening. The following is nothing more than a caricature like a flirting. Men chase men, cars chase men, helicopters chase men, helicopters chase boats, boats chase boats, for an hour almost the most insignificant, without the slightest progress. Special mention must be made to the editing of the cutting workshop, because many scenes seem to have been attached in a random order. The game of all concerned is an embarrassment. One last thing, the quality of the picture and sound is so bad on this DVD that you will be dismayed. - MERK
