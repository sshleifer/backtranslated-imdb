What on earth? It's like watching an episode of Neighbors after drinking two vials of cough medicine, nightmarish and meaningless. I was waiting for the intelligent part where everything is set up and save the film. Maybe it was there and I just missed it or did not know it. <br /> <br /> I suspect that this is a thinly veiled attempt to commercialize a new drug that is about to fall on the streets. I would not say "do not look at it" but I will say it's pretty poor at all levels - as if I were drama in high definition. Beat. Unless you drink two bottles of cough syrup. So it's just dandy.
