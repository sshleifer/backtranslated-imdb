This movie was completely horrible. Stupid premise and horrible game of all. Whoever wrote this basket should be hanged. It reminds me of a student hack movie, but worse. Whoever has produced this should give up now. I know that opinions are subjective and all, and some may think that this "fantastic" as some people think "Dune (1984)" was fantastic, let's see real movies. OK, the acting was tolerable, and with better direction could have been much better, but that was not the case. I do not know how much more I can say about this waste of film, other than throwing it in the trash. In any case, it was horrible and I recommend avoiding it like the plague. If you are approaching the "land of dreams", rent the movie next door.
