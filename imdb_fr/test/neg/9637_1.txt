After watching Stop-Loss, I find myself against Hollywood's disappointment at having made such a fucking one. No more glorious days of 1940s movies that were the pride of being an American, fighting the evil that wants to conquer abroad and death at home. What remains to us is the dribbling bubbling mouth of anti-Bush radicals rabid. The story tells the story of three young men returning home after the war. One falls into an uncontrollable madness, culminating in his death. The main protagonist leaves his country in time of war and at the same time destroys the best relations he has with his fianc√©. The third is truly the hero of the story, choosing to continue the fight that took place on our shores almost eight years ago. What makes this film bad is not the acting, but the premise behind it. We are led to believe that decorated soldiers are actually enemies of our country. Desertion is a betrayal in wartime and the main protagonist flirts throughout the film. This paradox is designed to weaken the public's reaction to the central act of the film. We are not supposed to find fault with King, since he is wearing medals, but his actions do not deserve it, they claim it. He is not an anti-hero. To accept the film, the public must accept the rightness of desertion because the story portrays King as a hero. I can not accept that because it's like asking me to call the yellow sky a light blue day. Moreover, we make fun of the man who re-engages and continues to serve his country. I would only recommend this flair to someone who needs to convince of the decadence of Hollywood, as it is a clear example. No wonder it went badly at the box office.
