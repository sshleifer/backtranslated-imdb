This film clearly has an agenda, which could be summarized as follows: Never, ever cross the border (physical or metaphorical). Let's avoid everything on the other side with a wall, a fence or something else, let's pretend that all the "gringos" were evil, satanic, or drug traffickers. Anything outside your country's borders (especially the US borders) is dangerous, malicious, and the people there will hate you, envy you, or try to steal you or something else. "Real events" is just a perverse label that can be pinned down to give an impression of credibility or, in this case, simply to help push the ideology of the film into naive gorges. The evilness of the film lies in the fact that it reduces countries, people and everything else in stereotypical categories very black and white: Mexicans in disgusting people, the Mexican police in a group of corrupt cops, Republicans in fools of right, democrats in humanists almost hippie and so on. Is there anything good in the movie? I hardly think, but you may think differently.
