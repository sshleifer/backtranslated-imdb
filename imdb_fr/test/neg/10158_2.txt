This one is a doozy. Dating from 1949, Scene of the Crime often plays more like a Coen Bros movie. shot in the 1940s and filmed in black and white, except that the writer's ear for pastiche is not as comfortable - maybe it's possible seen instead as the precursor of schlock Oscar baits like Road to Perdition. Frankly, it is amazing that this film is not considered a classic by cinema professors and critics, considering all that it offers in terms of mannerist sensations too articulated with a false meaning (a little like the grandmother of all those "fake art" films Citizen Kane or anything from Murnau.) <br /> <br /> MGM is usually a studio that can not hurt anything in my eyes, and I think that any story, any atmosphere, even "realism", can only benefit grotesque overestry. You could say that I am a disciple of Minnelli School. But it takes a slight touch to write a hard-to-bust dialogue from the band Dashiell Hammett, a willingness, perhaps, to let maybe one or two scenes go by without a line like "Attention, Mr. Wiggly, or you'll have thirteen-year-old fish to fry and no small worms to catch them with. "" Mr. Wiggly ", unfortunately, made the cut, but believe me, the dialogue is simply inflated and filled with non-sequencers. Even the wife of Arlene Dahl's senior police officer speaks as if she had a moon-shaped scar under the Christian name and eye Rocco. By the time Van Johnson hands over his badge with the phrase "I'm sick of death and homicide," you'll wonder how the writer's fixation with ornate literary devices - in this case, zeugma - could have been wrong interpreted as "street". <br /> <br /> For those who have gone beyond the stage of The Naked Gun series, it's the funniest movie of cops-thieves.
