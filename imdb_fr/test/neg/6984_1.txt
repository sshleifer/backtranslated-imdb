In contrast to RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, David Hemmings' adventure is far inferior to the plan to recover an aircraft with valuable cargo from the Second World War. Highlights include beautiful New Zealand scenery, Brian May's energetic musical score, dandy helicopter chases and jet boat chases. Evil, however, far outweighs good. Donald Pleasence plays like never before; half of his dialogue is almost unintelligible. George Peppard tries an Australian accent (I think), then abandons it midway. Lesley Ann Warren is at her most irritating. Ken Wahl is good, Ken Wahl. The dialogue is painful to hear and Hemmings' management is largely inept. The script is not only obvious but terrible. The jokes fall flat, the scenes have no punch and the continuity is practically non-existent. According to the end credits, two men were killed while flying jet boats during the making of the film. Such a waste.
