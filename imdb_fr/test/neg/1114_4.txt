In 1913, at the Carlton mine in Addytown, Pennsylvania, the cruel owner of a mine used poor children during the exploration and, after an explosion, a group of children was buried alive. Karen Tunny (Lori Heuring) has just lost her husband after a long terminal illness in which the family's savings were spent on treatment. Without money, she moved with her daughters Sarah (Scout Taylor-Compton) and Emma (Chloe Moretz) into an old house in the mountains that belonged to her husband. Her neighbors advise Karen to stay home at night and Sarah learns that there are zombies in the area. When Emma becomes a friend of Mary, her mother considers her as an imaginary friend. However, when Sarah's friends are attacked and eaten alive by zombie children and Emma disappears, Karen and Sarah chase her close to the mine. <br /> <br /> "Wicked Little Things" is not a totally bad movie: playing is good. ; makeup is scary; and cinematography and score are excellent. However, the story, and therefore the storyline, is very weak, or even a bad collection of clichés. The beginning is reasonable, a widow settling in a distant house, because the family has spent all its resources in the disease of the patriarch. But when it happens, little zombies attack people without any consequences, for example, families do not search missing persons. Then the naughty Mr. Carlton arrives in the place with the most disgusting attitudes, a typical cliché that he will die at the end. Nothing explains why the children attacked innocent people and why they should stop after killing Mr. Carlton. When Sarah runs away with her mother and says she's tired and can not run anymore, it's one of the stupidest phrases I've ever seen in a horror movie. My vote is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Zombies"
