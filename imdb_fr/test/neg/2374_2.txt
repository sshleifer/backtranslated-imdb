I always said there was nothing better than the original form: comics. I proved again that I was right. This, like all other films on the Asterix series, failed to impress. The directors of this film do not understand that what makes the success of all the other comic films transformed (x-men, superman and others) is that they all deviate from the original versions and adapt them to make it more watchable. Okay, this movie deviated, in that it was a cross between two Asterix books, namely. Asterix and the Grande Travers√©e & Asterix and the Normans. Moreover, unlike the Asterix series (with the exception of Asterix and the secret weapon), a love interest was introduced for one of the main characters. All this ended up creating a childish and immature scenario. Fun parties were very rare. In short, a complete loss of time and money to watch this, not to mention theaters, even at home.
