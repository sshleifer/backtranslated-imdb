Potential viewers being warned, the current rating of IMDb viewers for "Tomorrow to Seven" is a low participation rate anomaly. The murderer leaves a business card of Spades at the scene of his crimes, while alerting the victim in advance. The execution does not hold, however, and saying that the film has its share of holes in the plot would be tantamount to saying that there is actually a plot. <br /> <br /> Chester Morris portrays mystery writer Neil Broderick, weaving real murder items by the ace killer in his latest novel. Broderick intends to interview a wealthy businessman for his book, but he must first miss out on the man's eccentric secretary - "If you line up his loved ones, you'd have enough chestnuts to hold a Ford together ". This line adores him without ceremony for the girl "crazy" Martha (Vivienne Osborne), who proposes to make the presentations. <br /> <br /> Broderick meets Thornton Drake (Henry Stephenson) as she is about to finish a puzzle. puzzle delivered by a courier that morning. As we will learn in the following scene, the only remaining pieces form the black and bold form of the ace of spades containing the words "At seven o'clock the next day". Now, whoever assembles a puzzle does not use the pieces with contrasting colors FIRST! <br /> <br /> Initially, the presence of Frank McHugh and Allen Jenkins in the role of two police detectives summoned to the Drake Residence intrigued me. In general, their characters are colorful enough to offer a real comic relief, but here they are simply annoying. McHugh Clancy, in particular, ends up shouting objections to his partner Dugan's insane comments, and the two usually head in the opposite direction when real problems may arise. <br /> <br /> Now, here's a question - in light of the killer's identity to the ace, why would he have invited a novelist and two policemen he had just met on a flight to his Louisiana plantation? Especially when at seven o'clock, all parties would be a captive audience aboard the plane when the first murder is committed. However, it is not Drake who died, but his secretary, Austin Winters (Grant Mitchell). The first suspicions weigh on the Henderson pilot (Cornelius Keefe) after a scene in the lighting, but Henderson has still not reported the murder to his boss until well after his arrival at the Drake plantation with everybody. Can you imagine anyone trying to get away with this today, unless your name is Ted Kennedy? <br /> <br /> The cause of death still to be determined, the local coroner is called, but the first one who shows up (a Broderick's accomplice) is a fake. Yet when the real coroner comes, he disappears right after! In a second dark scene, a letter from murder victim Austin Winters is about to be read. He ends up missing when the lights come back, and as he can point the murderer, he becomes a clue that must be recovered. So where was the letter? Winters' daughter, Martha, grabbed her and put her on the living room coat! How much time has been spent on this issue? <br /> <br /> Obviously, the case is so absurd that the character of Morris solves the case quite easily. Even if the film comes about an hour away, it becomes almost a chore to watch with all the nonsense happening. There is really only one humorous moment worth repeating; aboard the plane, the detectives have this exchange: Dugan - "Hey Clancy, how often do these things fall?" Clancy - "Once!" <br /> <br /> With the exception of McHugh and Jenkins, I can not say I saw other players in the movies of the day, although I'm a fan of most B-type movies from the '30s to the' 50s. Fortunately, the couple is doing much better than saving Humphrey Bogart in a wacky jewel of 1938 - "Swing Your Lady", where bursts of laughter are intentional. The best I can offer about "Tomorrow to Seven" is a quote from Martha Winters about this turkey's midway - "This is just a stupid waste of time".
