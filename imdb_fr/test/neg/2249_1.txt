At a table (1941) <br /> <br /> In which a German Nazi and a French dairy producer speak at a table for 20 minutes; first in French, then in English. <br /> <br /> Chapter Two: Three years of basterets without glory in sixteen minutes ... without paintings (most of the time) <br /> <br /> In which an American lieutenant talks with his unit newly formed commando, composed of 8 men, composed of American Jews. There are no tables present. Adolf Hitler, three years later. He is angry at the inability of his men to deal with the Basterds. Hitler has a table. We return to the Basterds in a flashback. Again, lacks separate content based on tables. <br /> <br /> Chapter Three: The German Night in Paris ... At a Table ... Talking <br /> <br /> In which a Jewish woman who escaped under the table of the first chapter managed to get by and become the owner of a movie theater. The Jewish woman speaks to an actor at a table in a bar. Later, the Jewish woman, actor Joseph Goebbels and a translator speak at a table in a restaurant. The actor and Goebbels speak German. The translator translates German into French. The Jewish woman answers in French. The translator translates French into German. Goebbels decides to make a film premiere at the Jewish woman's cinema. The actor and Goebbels are leaving. The Nazi (who spoke with the dairy farmer at a table for twenty minutes in the first chapter) arrives. He speaks with the Jewish woman at the table. He leaves. The Jewish woman collapses; overwhelmed by the emotion of having spent so much time talking at a table. <br /> <br /> Chapter Four: Conversation at the Operating Table <br /> <br /> In which Austin Powers sends a British officer to join the Basterds and an actress on a mission to speak German at a table in a tavern. After 21 minutes of discussion at a table, they shoot at each other. The actress survives but spends the next 5 minutes lying on a table to discuss. <br /> <br /> Chapter five: The revenge of the giant painting <br /> <br /> In which, the Basterds decide to continue the operation to speak in Italian and suicide bombing in the cinema. The Nazi takes the actress to a small room where they sit next to a table. A hoe he found under the table in the tavern is so good that he kills her. Then he takes two of the Basterds to a large room where they sit and talk at a table. During this time, the cinema burns, Hitler is riddled with bullets and the two Basterds blow themselves up without good reason. <br /> <br /> The end
