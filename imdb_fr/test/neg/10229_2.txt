Also entitled -> The Magic Castle -> This one is a stretch. Why bother? Why create another rockbart then add another story that has almost nothing to do with the game or Swan Lake. Only a rockbart girlfriend, the stolen book of forbidden arts and the original characters (no voices remain). Stripped to out, it's a continuation by a thread. The next thing you know, a bird will have memorized the "forbidden arts" and Swan Princess 4: the magic bird will be born. Fortunately, even if the chapters are reportedly closed, the ill-timed trilogy will end.
