I turned it off for about 50 minutes! Whoever decides to steal the idea of ​​Koushun Takami's book (Battle Royal), and make it a pathetic reality show, deserves to be shot! <br /> <br /> This has made the film industry a good turn though. Now, filmmakers like William Malone (Fear Dot Com) can say "well at least it's better than the series 7". This piece of shit & Dracula 3000 ranks first among the 100 worst movies ever made! <br /> <br /> Be warned that this is not a "shame, it's good" click! <br /> <br /> It's a shame for filmmakers around the world! <br /> <br /> Never see this movie!
