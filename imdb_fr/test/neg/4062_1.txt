The plane is a 747 Jumbo. The cockpit is on the 747's upper deck. In the film, the pilots do not climb the stairs in the 1st class cabin to reach the cockpit. They go to the front of the 1st class cabin and go through the cockpit doors. What a blunder !!! The front of the first class cabin has a cloakroom for jackets and a TV screen. Beyond that, there is the radar dome. Before takeoff, a 747 appears to start the taxi to the runway. On takeoff, the aircraft has only two engines. L'Ar√©al 747 has four engines. Who was responsible for the continuity of this film? At the beginning of the flight, the front of the plane contains toilets, another ridiculous gaffe !!! After that, the front of the plane becomes the back and vice versa. At this point, I stopped watching. Absolute waste !!!
