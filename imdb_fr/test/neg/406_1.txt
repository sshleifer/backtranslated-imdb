I understood it because, after spending time in the Albany area of ​​New York, I knew a few people in the film and met him by chance. Comedy attempts are lame, the obligatory girl-girl scene is disgusting, the plot is non-existent, the acting is one of the worst I've ever seen, and does not even get me into special effects. I realize it's a very small budget film made by a small independent company, but if you want to make a sci-fi horror movie with giant bugs, do not make the giant bugs completely unbelievable. People want to see giant insects. That's half the fun there. And if you want to make the giant bugs completely unbelievable, at least ask the actors to make a tongue-in-cheek allusion to that ("You idiots, it's not them, you've captured their double stunt!"). Prepare to lose two hours of your life that you will never recover.
