This movie, "Desperate Measures", was .... I do not know how to put it into words. Was it supposed to be a comedy? I could not help but laugh at how ridiculous it was. I love Michael Keaton and I really can not understand he did it. They caught my attention because I can not wait to see how ridiculous it is to be done minute after minute. In fact, I just registered on this site in order to publish it. I do not watch movies. I do not have time for that, but I can not let that go by knowing that I did not do my civil duty by letting people (those with IQs of 85 and over) know that This is not an action / thriller, it's honest to funny goodness. You who make me live strong emotions scares me. Go watch a good movie like Million Dollar Baby. The acting of Clint Eastwood is not superb, but I felt good in the end. Exercise your brain in America!
