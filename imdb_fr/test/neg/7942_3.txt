The opening scene prevents me from recording at absolute zero. I wish the whole movie to be as realistic as the intro. <br /> <br /> To be able to enjoy some movies, many things can be forgiven (pistols with 60 blows, heroes with superhuman powers, all women) are gorgeous AND half-naked) but Puuuuleeese this "Assault On My Intelligence 13 "is so hard to get that I'm surprised the cast is coming for a second day of shooting. <br /> <br /> First, how are these guys being cops? Based on stupidity I guess. How do the main female characters justify being half-naked in the middle of winter in Detroit or elsewhere? In fact, no character reacts to the elements of this film. No windows, no electricity (miraculously unexplained) during the storm of the century and they are all comfortable as insects in a carpet. What technology exists that disables all cell phones, radios and brain functions. It must be the same power that drove Maria Bella out of the car in her disabled wheelchair, deep in the snow, with no coat and almost no clothes on.
