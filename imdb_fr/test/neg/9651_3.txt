I guess the movie was based on a large book. Given the number of characters and subplots during Katyn, I thought that the movie creators, perhaps the writer or director, intended to create an epic movie. But in reality, there was not enough time to devote to the development of the characters or the story. Recurrently, many parallel stories that could have been deleted. <br /> <br /> In recounting the events that led to the mass murder of all these intellectuals and officers, I do not think the film explains all the reasons why murder was necessary. Was it political? Philosophical? Revenge? The interesting part of historical movies is to see personal motivations or emotions. Instead, Katyn's assassins seemed to be automatons, entirely controlled by Stalin, who sometimes appears in the form of a charcoal drawing. The representation of Russians and Germans seemed entirely unidimensional. (Are the Poles just angry at the Russians?) In addition to being badly mounted and biased, or at least unrealistic, the choices of music and cinematography seemed incompatible with each other and with the film itself. I do not think you can really shoot an epic war movie or a hand-held camera event. (But if the director chooses a story centered on the character, perhaps focusing on one family, perhaps the practical approach would be more effective.) Blows made.
