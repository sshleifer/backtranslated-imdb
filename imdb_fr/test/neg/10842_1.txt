This film seems to be a cute idea for a movie, to have imagined two or three fun possibilities, recruited a good cast, then entrusted to a very bad writer and a worse director. The director filmed a romantic comedy screwed as if it were a dark and artistic film - strange camera angles, blue-filtered shots, a long wait, a close look at the raindrops. Steve Zahn was good, as always. Ben Affleck was charming, sweet, almost shy; he was perfect for a romantic comedy. Sandra Bullock struggled valiantly with a character who was supposed to be crazy, but whose delusion consisted of, for example, madly kissing a husband she hated, abandoning her child, taking a carnival tour, proposing to undress for the first time. money and airline companion. The script had very few funny lines; there was no physical comedy; it was boring. He introduces potentially amusing situations and then cuts them before they can develop. To top it all off, the "twist" at the end was a slap for everyone waiting for a fun romantic comedy. If you saw the movie trailer and liked it, like me, my advice is this: do not go to the movie. This will only spoil a beautiful trailer.
