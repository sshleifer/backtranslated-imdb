I'm not sure what the director and the editor thought when they put up that lame excuse for a movie, but whatever they think does not help this film, it just hurts him, and the film too. The acting game, for once, is not the problem, it's the horrible editing, the scenes will end for no apparent reason, while in the middle of a sequence of action, people will be cut at middle of the sentence. I'm not sure of the story, but it did not matter, because what I saw was rather uninteresting. Just a pity, a huge "Jaws" scam and not a good one for that. The MST version was funny though. 7 for that, none for the film itself.
