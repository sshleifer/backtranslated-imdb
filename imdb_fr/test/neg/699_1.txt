I'm in a movie class and I know I do not know everything about cinema but, in truth, it's one of the worst, the most stupid, the delayed and a waste of time, movies that I have never seen and where I saw NAPOLEAN DINAMITE. they are both equally terrible. Conrack is boring and nothing interesting even happens in the movie, it's not a hot story and Pat Conroy does not overcome anything! I'm not saying that there should be a fight and shit that explodes but it would animate this film more than bland. the children they love to play in this movie are perhaps the real children of the island of Yammacraux. They seemed stupid and could not act as much as I know. It was a stupid idea for a book and an even worse idea for a movie. I do not know why this film was even shot: five of the worst movies of all time.
