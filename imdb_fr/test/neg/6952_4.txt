These are not all movies with lesbian girls and vampires, it's good to touch our favorite genre of trash / worship. Unfortunately, this film lacks originality and performance is not up to standard. Seem the intention of the creator to make it worship, it failed. Trash movies are trash movies because that happens. I do not know if Mr. Creepo is a legend (the first time I hear his name) BUT if he is, I wonder why ... Awful. <br /> <br /> Awful. Even lesbian scenes are pathetic, so all fans of x-run erotic films will not be satisfied because there are thousands of better movies than Barely Legal Lesbian Vampires.
