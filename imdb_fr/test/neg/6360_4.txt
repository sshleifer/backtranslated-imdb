Critters 3 begins on the road when Clifford (John Calvin), his teenage daughter Annie (Aimee Brooks) and his young son Johnny (the IMDb, Christian & Josephh Cousins, two identical twins?) Go home after their holidays. Suddenly, the tire of their van explodes and they must stop in a public rest area to repair it. During their stay, Annie and Johnny meet a child named Josh (Leonardo DiCaprio, yes, that one) who in turn meets Charlie McFadden (the co-producer of the movie Don Keith Opper) of the two previous films of Critter. Charlie tells them the story of the Critters and the city of Grovers Bend but they do not believe it. Meanwhile, a creature lays eggs on the underside of the truck, out of sight of everyone. Once Clifford repaired the tire the trio left for their home, an urban building located in Los Angeles, with Critter eggs, for the ride. Upon arrival, the eggs hatch and the Critters head straight for the building, quickly eliminating Frank (Geoffrey Blake), the keeper. While the night attracts a few remaining residents, a fat woman named Rosalie (Diana Bellamy), a phone repairer Marsha (Katherine Cortez), a senior couple, Mr. (Bill Zuckert) and Mrs. Menges (Frances Bay ) must meet. with Clifford and his children to fight the Critters. Josh also makes an appearance when his father-in-law (William Dennis Hunt) owns the building. But will the band be able to defeat the critters and prevent themselves from having dinner? <br /> <br /> Directed by Kristine Peterson I thought that Critters 3 was an unbelievably poor movie, but at least she can say that she made a movie with Leonardo DiCaprio and few people can say that! The budget of Critters 3 was probably not really a fortune, because the production as a whole seems cheap, there are very few characters, very few Critters & I think only 3 appear in the same shot at the same time and that eliminates any sort of angle of space so there is no special effect of expensive spacecraft or far distant planet to pay for. The scenario of David J. Schow is strictly encrypted and very predictable. A group of humans is stuck in an isolated situation with Critters and has no way of contacting the outside world for help, this plot scenario seems very familiar, is not it? It's the same as in previous Critters (1986) and Critters 2: The Main Course (1988) and many other horror movies. Critters 3 does not do anything with the principle, it does not even try to add anything to a scenario already old, tired and well used. Critters 3 is also very docile for a horror movie with only two people being killed. The elements of the comedy seriously miss, as well as the best joke that Critters 3 can handle, being a Critter eating beans and farting, very funny if you are 5 years old. The characters are mostly cliches of classic horror movies and have quickly become annoying. In Critters 3, there is virtually no blood or blood. Just a few splashes of blood. Unfortunately, Critters 3 seems to do everything possible to show no violence. The special effects on the creatures are acceptable but they still look like static and simplistic puppets that have very little movement. The acting is not good and Critters 3 is a very first feature film by Leonardo DiCaprio, to be fair to the child, he's fine & I wonder if any of the other actors or team had an idea what he would become. Why the hell should Charlie continue to appear in these Critter movies? To give credit to Critters 3, it is moving at a good pace and is not boring, it is generally well done with fairly good production values ​​and it is safe fun if you are in a good mood and, fortunately, it only lasts for about 80 odd minutes. Overall, Critters 3 is a good waste of time, but do not expect anything deep or meaningful. As a cheap horror movie, there is nothing wrong with that, but I could not help thinking that I had seen everything before. An average loss of time that is not as good as one of Critter's two previous films. Critters 3 ends with a "to follow ...", filmed immediately with Critters 4 (1991) which, unsurprisingly, goes directly to the video, probably to save even more. Critters 3 is a pretty decent way to lose about 80 minutes if you can watch it for free on T.V. Otherwise, do not bother.
