This "movie" will give me nightmares, I'll wake up sweaty, shouting "I did not make this movie please do not blame me!" Honestly, I think it would have been more fun to watch a fat guy eat lard in his mother's basement for an hour or two, than to watch that shit. I understand that the money was tight, but damn, what did they think there was no thought, conspiracy or effort in this area? This film needs a warning "Please, for the sake of God, do not finance the theater department of the local JC." On another note, these are the least likeable characters I've ever seen, and I've seen Hitler movies in them. So, finally, follow my advice the next time you are thinking about renting this apartment, just place a few hundred Adivl and let sleep come back.
