I saw this piece of pseudo-intellectual bullshit a few years ago and is now back in the local movie club. He uses all the clich√©s in the Intellectual Movie Makers manual to appear as intellectual as the director probably imagines. You get a slow idle tempo, a brown color scale, slow pans in bombarded environments, empty expressions and facial expressions, too symbolic images and the miserable end that is needed. <br /> <br /> It's a complete failure, an involuntary perfect caricature of the typically Russian art film. The director, Aleksandr Sokurov, has an excellent technical mastery, but he lacks an eye. He does not see when he crosses the border into the realm of pathos. <br /> <br /> This film is a wet dream for the enemies of art cinema. This corresponds to all stereotypical ideas about gender. <br /> <br /> If it was bad in an entertaining way, it would be a turkey. But for a film that is so bad that you then quit royally, we need a new term. This film is a Sokurov.
