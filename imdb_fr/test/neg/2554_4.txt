Without the hilarious role of Christopher Guest, I would have stopped watching this movie after 20 minutes. The jokes were flat, the film was moving and slow, some characters were obnoxious and painful to watch, but the character of Guest made me laugh and I stayed with her. <br /> <br /> I think there are much better choices to make There!
