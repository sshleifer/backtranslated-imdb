There is nothing to say except that I want my time that this movie took me. I am not racist against Latinos. Damn, I'm half Brazilian. I loved the Kids movie. It does not mean anything. These kids just go around and do nothing. They are not even good at skating. All the while, I'm waiting for something, anything, to happen! but this is not the case. Nothing happens all the film. Did I mention that they fear skating? I could make a movie called Beat Up Rockers, and the basic principle will be to kick a panty punk like that. I will not even go in, this movie is bad. Please, do yourself a favor and burn this film if you come into contact with it so that another poor soul does not make the same mistake.
