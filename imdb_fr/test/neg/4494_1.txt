This film serves all Greek stereotypes imaginable. In a particularly annoying scene, the tycoon said: "I am only an ignorant peasant." As the grandson of Greek peasant immigrants who passed on a legacy of wisdom and love to their children and grandchildren, I found this film despicable and obnoxious.
