I write this with 10 minutes before the end of the film. I feel comfortable writing it now, because unfortunately I know how this film will end. <br /> <br /> The principle is quite simple. A mad dog on the run in a small town kills people. Simple large - plot for a fun fun 80s horror camp. <br /> <br /> Uhh ..no. <br /> <br /> The main problem is that this is based on a book (Stephen King) and you can say that it should not have been really adapted to the movie, at least not with the same plot. Why? Because it's boring! The first 45 minutes attempt to give depth to his main characters and create suspense. It takes too long (half of the movie!) - the characters are inimitable and we never love them anyway, and this creates no suspense. The easiest movie (based on plot and time) to compare it to the classic Jaws. All that Jaws does well, Cujo hurts. Jaws has created good characters and a real sense of dread. Cujo does neither one nor the other. Jaws effectively creates a scary and scary villain in his shark. Cujo has a dirty St. Bernard running about grunting and jumping, and not much else. The jaw is exciting and unpredictable. Cujo is an indefatigable boredom that remains predictable to the end. <br /> <br /> It is also disconcerting to see the plethora of subplots that serve only boring red herring in the main storyline of the film. <br /> <br /> If this film was rewritten for the big screen and had a better director it could have been good. But it was not. It was a loss of 90 minutes of my life. <br /> <br /> People here say it's one of the king's best adaptations - I'm sorry you can not be more wrong. The mist is a hundred times better, Thinner is 10 times better and even that with cats is twice as good! This is in my opinion one of the worst! The only good thing was that the action scenes with the dog looked real, even if they were dull. <br /> <br /> The movies stop now and things do not improve. To avoid.
