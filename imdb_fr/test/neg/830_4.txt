Even before this film, it is clear that Ali G has become the exact character he wanted to parody. Anyway, I'm not a fan of Sacha Baron Cohen's character, but I was curious to see how a man so talented could convince Universal Studios to finance a feature-length film of about an hour and a half on a 3 minutes joke. <br /> <br /> A paper-thin plot is just a torrent of jokes about penis and marijuana and I must confess I shuddered when I saw people as respected as Charles Dance and Michael Gambon give in to a job. To say that I have to admit (although I am quite ashamed) that I raised the tone more than once, and regardless of the quality of this film, it was never boring and I I have never thought of turning it off (mainly the beautiful Rhona Mitra). That said, only watch this movie if you are a teenager aged 14 to 17 and you find jokes on the hilarious cock.
