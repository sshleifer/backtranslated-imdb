Over the GW is the first failure of a first feature film, and it's not because it's not for nothing ... In fact, it's the case. It's still a mess, because it's his scriptwriter / director / technician, Nick Gaglia, who has experienced the same cult of rehabilitation that he describes in the film. Sometimes, a beginner filmmaker, full of vigor that emanates from his fellow students in film, sinks into a style too disjointed, uncertain and frustrating dramatically that the personal aspect of the story, the very personal side, is stained in the purpose of telling a good story. Gaglia, who was 13 years old when he was put into a horrible program that was torturing and brainwashing their "patients" with fright tactics for the group, psychological psychological sessions that could last days and attitudes of the leaders of Rehabilitation Most Nazis start and run away at the age of 15. I'm glad he came out, even though it might help him if he now goes into a rehab for his directorial skills, if only for a few days, to learn things like let's say , structure, adequate lighting, fluid movement of the camera, subtlety with the actors and other basic elements that are lost here. <br /> <br /> It's all the more frustrating that Gaglia is dealing with a subject that needs to be further highlighted. to the public (there was recently an article in Newsweek referring to a rehab similar to an AA sect). Often, one wonders if certain studies of personal character could function better as documentaries than as narrative dramas. This is a throbbing sensation in Over the GW, where you almost feel that Gaglia means the truth but does not know how to communicate it correctly through her characters. Bronx teenager Tony Serra (Gallagher), who is taken by his mother to a New Jersey detox center, is closer to Gaglia, is actually more of a person than anyone else. one-dimensional, where there are very few background stories (we see a brief freak-out, in black and white, in his old house) and little connection with his mother (Moriarty), who has more than potential that never, except a cold stone that passes his children to another. But there is a story to tell with his two years of crisis, I suppose. <br /> <br /> From the start, things get complicated (a search in a bare cavity in the first five minutes), and it is soon obvious that In terms of medical care, it is more of a cross between anger management and a weird religious sect, where Chief Medical Officer Hiller (Insinnia) is a totally over-controlling loonie. But soon Tony's sister, Sofia (Donohue), is on the program and, contrary to her repeated moments of indignation and noncompliance, she jumps into the three-step program and once released, she becomes runaway . Sometimes, there are snatches in this fractured nightmare, where a woman, a 22-year-old mother who has been in the program for a year and a half, discovers that she has become a prisoner prevented from leaving, and when the father of the siblings The principal arrives and makes an enraged visit to Hiller when Sofia finally returns there, which contains some raw power, very brief glimpses of Gaglia that can at least get leverage in pure melodrama. <br /> <br /> But these are rare moments. It is not just the characters who fail, who are mostly reduced to stereotypes that resemble a hysterical, D.A.R.E. Scams (maybe some of them, such as an angry black boy, passive-aggressive counselors, or even Serra's older sister, sidelined as having hit a member and almost thrown into the program, would resonate more if there was more time to develop). Gaglia is so fuzzy in his many roles thanks to his tiny budget of $ 30,000 that no side of any potential talent he has had can be realized. He uses too many shades, mostly with a shade that seems to be covered with urine), he moves his portable DVX camera as if it were supposed to be intense at the City of God, from time to time a character would take a picture at Chances are, his music choices are like the worst possible selections among pseudo-independent pseudo-rockers, and there are even fake scenes of silly interviews with Nicholas Serra (inspiration?) and Krakowsky that seem as fake as possible. <br /> <br /> Could Gaglia simply not have interviews with the real victims with whom he was and resort to an artistically cathartic B plan? In the end, no matter what life stories you truly enjoy, do not bother seeing them at the theater or even renting, unless you like a final scene with two kids watching the digital movie. on the Hudson River with the last words: "Dedicated to the Kids". Oy.
