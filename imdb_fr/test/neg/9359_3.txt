I had heard good things about "States of Grace" and came in with an open mind. I thought the "Army of God" was fine and I thought maybe Dutcher had improved and matured as a filmmaker. The movie started with a shaky acting game and I thought, well, maybe it'll be better. Unfortunately, this has never been the case. The photo begins by introducing two alumni - Mormon missionaries - and it seems that the public will learn to know them and become aware of them. Instead, the story degenerates into a series of highly improbable events highlighting the blatant disobedience of the missionaries (something that undeniably exists, but rarely at the level described by Dutcher) and it becomes almost laughable. <br /> <br /> The only thing about Dutcher The success of this film lies in its successful alienation of its target audience. By unrealistically and inaccurately describing the lives of Mormon missionaries, Dutcher accomplishes nothing more than angering his predominantly Mormon audience. The film does not reflect the reality. The missions do not look anything like what Dutcher shows (after serving a Mormon mission myself, I can attest to that) and gang life in California certainly contains a much more explicit language than light casual vulgarity. <br /> <br /> The conclusion, which I suppose was supposed to reach the public and make them believe that forgiveness is available to all. It was amazing (come on, the whole mission meets to see this old man sent home - and the mother and daughter are standing right next door!) And cheesy. Next time, Dutcher, try to create a movie that SOMEONE can relate to.
