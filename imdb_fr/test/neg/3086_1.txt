One of the worst movies I have ever seen. Yes, I know that I am not the target audience. The target audience is women, college-aged, middle-aged or some other age, I suppose. I'm not one of those, so the manufacturers do not mind that I do not like it. But that will not excuse the fact that the dialogue and the plot are horrible. The main character, Phoebe, travels to Europe to find out what happened to her sister Faith, who committed suicide. Phoebe is a foolish person whom I hope no one identifies with. Faith is also a character with very little credibility. Wolf is the only person who seems to be a little reasonable. As I said, the dialogue is boring and uninteresting. The plot sometimes makes things completely stupid. The worst part is that Phoebe and Faith's father is an artist, but his paintings are quite terrible. There is nothing new, interesting or refreshing about this movie. If you are a guy, you will pray for the end. If you are a chick, you may be able to sit down but you will not be impressed.
