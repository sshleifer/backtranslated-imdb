The opening scene really made me watch the movie. However, no more than 5 minutes later, I was already tearing my eyes. Not only could I not understand a word that was said, but the game could have been better done by a group of mentally handicapped people. The highlight of this movie was that there was a white punk dwarf. However, I did not understand how a white dwarf was the child of two African-Americans. But I guess anything is possible. Also, why the hell was Robin in the movie? I'm not sure it added anything artistic. Overall, I highly recommend jumping off a cliff before renting this movie.
