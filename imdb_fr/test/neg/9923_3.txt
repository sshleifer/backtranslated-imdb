<br /> <br /> Very slow and painful film with a puzzling story. The only hope of the film to keep the public interest is the free nudity thrown at regular intervals. Ellen Barkin is a bad idea and her appearance does not stand when she's on screen with the much younger Peta Wilson. I do not know what this movie is about.
