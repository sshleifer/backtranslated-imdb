You are one of the worst films I have ever seen. But on the other hand, most Slovenian films are better than those that are full of depressing characters and history without brilliant ideas. You are brilliant, optimistic and without any artistic moment. In many interviews, director Mitja Okorn tried to tell us that his film was top quality simply because it was cheap. But thinking that way is wrong. You pa pa tam is for me a very bad movie. The dialogues are very badly written (90% of the scenario is cursed), the characters are stereotypical fools, the story and its twists are very predictable and the action sequences (this film is supposed to be an action comedy) are very very filmed bad and without style. Okorn thinks he's even bigger than Quentin Tarantino, so he copies his style in 90 minutes. The humor in the movie is very cheap and primitive (Okorn probably thinks the incessant curses are funny). In my opinion, it's a very cheap movie (not just a budget) of Tu pa tam with a stupid story and a very bad acting.
