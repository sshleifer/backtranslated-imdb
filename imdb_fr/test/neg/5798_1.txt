I can laugh at almost anything, but unfortunately, there is not one in this stink bomb! I honestly watched this film from beginning to end and I did not even smile. I'm shocked that Sandler, Schneider, Spade, etc., put their name on this piece of shit. Worse than the worst that ever came out of the worst ever released by former SNL players. What more can i say? How could such a tasteless and extremely unpleasant behavior come from such an apparent talent pool !! I may have lost my sense of humor (probably not), but I do not remember a movie that I disliked so much for a long time. What a loss of 2 hours I will never come back.
