The plot for such a movie is a gift. How can you go wrong with a gay intrigue and all the colors and music of India - a story like this is written. I will watch almost everything, but it was unassailable. What is sad is that whites are the most colorful of the film. Vanessa was a riot with a mouth like a sailor and Jack was a real treat for the eyes, but all the others were so boring. Saeed Jeffrey, who was exceptional in My Beautiful Landrette, did what he could but the story was so boring. The hi was really the background music, which made it possible to laugh at the film rather than the movie or not at all. There are many other best gay, ethnic movies, quite simply. I miss a lot of low budget movies, but that should not have been done, or by anyone else.
