overrated, badly written, badly acted. Has the academy even looked at this? I suppose not. the political content guaranteed him an Oscar nomination - indo-pak border - a little boy, terrorism. anything that carries the word "terrorist" is getting attention in this <br /> <br /> post-9/11 world. it's like holocaust movies that are guaranteed an Oscar nomination regardless of their merits. <br /> <br /> and please cinematography does not mean taking landscapes that are pretty in the first place. you have to be a rotten shooter to screw up the desert in beauty. at least that did not win the Oscar. they are at least right. would have been a travesty.
