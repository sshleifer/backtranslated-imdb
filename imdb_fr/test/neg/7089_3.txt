Just listen to the Broadway casting album and the voices of Barbara Harris and John Cullum, who are doing wonders for the wonderful score of Lerner and Lane. Then, with this magnificent cast in mind, watch the film, with Streisand as Streisand, and Yves Montand reading his lines with a French accent so powerful that a chainsaw could not cut it. The best part (for those who need something to wait) is what Montand does at the introductory portion of the title track. Listen as he sings / says: Could any of us have an idea or clue, what magic feats of witchcraft and voodoo can you do? (This part summarizes the problem that arises from the creation of "name stars" in musicals instead of the appropriate talent for different roles.) I can simply see Rex Harrison enter this scene and suggest that Montand, too, could learn to do justice. to the beauty of the English language. <br /> <br />
