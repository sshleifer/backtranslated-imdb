There are only 2 reasons why I watch this show ... I have already invested time in previous episodes and Col Tigh. For all science fiction fans who love the new GSO, give me a break! Go and read some of the greatest science-fiction classic novels or watch some of the most memorable movies and TV shows of the past, and you'll see what these BSG writers have to say. Their only gadget is "who is the fifth Cylon". Bad writing and really, really no sense of character development. If Adama resigns or tries to take power, cries again or discovers the inner father, he should have been again ... ahhhhh! And Roslin is as annoying as a character who has ever been on a spaceship. Take the airlock with her. I do not care if he stays six months before the end. These budding writers were short of hints in the first season. If you do not know, you simply do not know how to write.
