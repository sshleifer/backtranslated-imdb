A few weeks ago, in a movie theater, I saw a movie poster from El Padrino (2004) bearing the label "The Latin Godfather". We became so lame, I thought, Latin just because he's Mexican? Let me remind you that everything about Latin comes from Lazio, Italy, or is related to it. The main character of the movie Godfather is therefore more Latin than the Mexican godfather and that is why: language based in the Latin language that was born in Rome now in Italy. So, placing a label on a movie poster like "The Latin Godfather" is not an ignorance, of course, if we try to link this film to the original Godfather, but a desperate and unconventional attempt to get credit in copying the title of a classic movie. Now, regarding the movie, I hate to react too much, so I guess it's 3, the most.
