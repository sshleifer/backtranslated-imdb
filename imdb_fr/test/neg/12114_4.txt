Of course, this movie has been delayed. But you were expecting the moment you looked at the cover box. It's a movie B, and on the T & A factor this film delivered. Honestly, it was funnier than expected. Although this is by no means a comic genius job, like "The Party Animal" or "Orgazmo", as far as B-movies are concerned, it was worth seeing, if you like anyway this kind of things. <br /> <br /> Christians and parenting groups of moral orientation, this is adult entertainment for adults. If you do not want your children to watch sex and nudity, keep your children away from this movie.
