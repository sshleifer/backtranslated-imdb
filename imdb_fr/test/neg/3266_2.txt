Caddyshack Two is a good movie in itself, but compared to the original, it can not stack. Robert Stack is a horrible substitute for Ted Knight and Jackie Mason, while the funny fun can not compete with Rodney Dangerfield. Ty Webb is funny, being the only character of the original. Most of the other characters in the film do not have the punch of the original (Henry Wilcoxon for example), with the exception of the funny hysterical lawyer Peter Blunt, played by Randy Quaid. Every line he says reminds me of the original humor, especially the scene in his office (I do not go to court or make a motion, I find out where you live and come to your house to knock on the door) * Make a bonfire with the chippindale, maybe grill that golden retriever (arff arff arff), then eat it, and then I get to the junior floor and catch you by the pjs of your brother brooks , and I miss your new BMW mounts your tight one ** Do we have an understanding?). Dan Acroyd, who obviously does not replace Bill Murray, has however compensated for his small role. His voice is more than irritating and everything he does is not even funny, it's just stupid. Overall, Caddyshack II is a good movie, but compared to the brilliant original, it just can not cut it.
