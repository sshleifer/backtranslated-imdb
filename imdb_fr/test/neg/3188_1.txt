Horrent "comedy" in which a beautiful, mad woman (Liv Tyler) "comically" destroys the lives of three men (Matt Dillon, Paul Reiser and John Goodman). Dillon hires a hitman (Michael Douglas) to kill her. What happens to comedy? The year 2001 produced some of the worst comedies of all time (Saving Silverman, Sugar and Spice, Freddy Got Fingered, Tomcats, etc.). This is one of the worst. There is not one, repeat, not a funny moment in it. The jokes are either stupid, funny, dirty, or really sick. There is also a strong hatred of women in this trash - the only main female character (Tyler) is constantly used as a sex object. Extreme and bloody violence is also projected in the end. The only bearable moments come from Reba McEntire as a psychiatrist and Andrew Dice Clay in two roles - both psychos. Dillon, Goodman and Reiser have reached a record level of their career with this - the only way to go is to progress. And poor Tyler! She stopped making brave and independent independent movies for THIS? And DOUGLAS ???? What was he on when he accepted? A piece of shit - to avoid at all costs !!!!!!!!!!
