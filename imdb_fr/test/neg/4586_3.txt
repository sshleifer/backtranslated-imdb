The plot: a trucker (Kristofferson) fights a corrupt sheriff (Borgnine) by bringing his truckers together and forming an unstoppable convoy that stretches for miles and quickly creates a national media frenzy. <br /> <br /> THE NEGATIVE: The configuration of the film is weak and the end even weaker. It contains all the clich√©s of the good old boys / truckers without adding anything new to the process. SMOKEY AND THE BANDIT ends up giving a brilliant and inspired appearance. Kristofferson is far too casual for a leading role and can not wear the picture. The character of Borgnine is awkwardly portrayed. At first, he was created to look like a real sheriff's fool who shows a little enthusiasm for a minor subterfuge. Then in the end, he gets a little more friendly and even secretly sided with Kristofferson, which does not work at all. In both cases, Jackie Gleason is a much better actor for this type of role. The worst thing about the film, though, is Peckinpah's attempts to introduce a "serious message" into this silly action movie that only slows and bombard the process. <br /> <br /> THE POSITIVE: The only one A good scene in the whole movie is the fight sequence inside the restaurant for truck stops. The director Peckinpah brings a fun twist to the violence "slow motion" of his brand and the result is fun. Unfortunately, it starts to slow down the rest of the photo until it is exhausted. McGraw is always a pleasure to watch, but unfortunately, he is given very little to say or do. <br /> <br /> THE LOWDOWN: If you read the synopsis, you basically saw the movie. The song on which this movie is based is pretty good, but the film adds nothing and should never have been made. It's a very uninspired material for such a nonconformist director. <br /> <br /> NOTE: 3 out of 10.
