I do not know why I looked at Ali G Indahouse, except that Salon seemed to think that a crime had been committed by not naming Sacha Baron Cohen in the Emmy category for his work on Da Ali G Show. It's a safe bet that I will never watch this show because there was absolutely nothing funny in the film. The comedy? The torture was more like that. It was pretty much the stupid thing I looked at. I will admit that I was captivated by Rhona Mitra. I had not seen anything. She was not part of the training during the time I was watching, so I guess I should go to Boston Legal one of those nights to see how she was doing in something that might be worth watching. .
