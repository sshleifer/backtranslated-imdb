4 Oscar winners, Karl Malden, Sally Field, Shirley Jones, Michael Caine. Great character actors Telly Savalas and Peter Boyle. 1 hour 54 minutes of boredom, melodrama and horror horror, a mess of scenes and a sense of loss of GOOD LORD, WHAT DO THEY THINK? <br /> <br /> Irwin Allen was just trying to capitalize on the popularity of the original classic disaster movie with a less grade D scenario, obviously the players were only there for pay, ... horror, horror! <br /> <br /> How crazy are the characters Caine, Savalas, Malden and Field play? Embark on a potentially lethal ship that is 1. on fire 2. Hot steam 3. Sliding water and oil, 4. boilers that explode every 5 minutes, etc., all for the sake of money? Greed? 5. They have very little equipment, not even a pair of gloves or work boots in sight, let alone a grappling hook, rope, etc. <br /> <br /> Stupidity! <br /> <br /> do they think? <br /> <br /> Peter Boyle exaggerates so much that I just wanted to hit him! Stop that! And what is the problem with the bad wolf? In addition, it is impossible to believe that his character was a veteran of the Second World War. <br /> <br /> Caine, Field and Malden find all this gold and silver and they are happy - whoopee! Were rich! (We may not live to spend it, but hey ...) <br /> <br /> And yes, it's the big actor Slim Pickens! <br /> <br /> Survivors galore! Jack Warden and Shirley Knight too! <br /> <br /> The last dramatic plot about this scary plutonium has never really gone anywhere, it's like they've forgotten, sort of? Many holes in the script. <br /> <br /> This film has a disease that the strongest pill could not cure. I am surprised that the name of Alan J. Smithee is not in the script. I would be embarrassed to have written this one! <br /> <br /> Oh madness, Oh humanity! Oy Vey! <br /> <br /> Horror, horror! <br /> <br /> It's like a bad two-hour TV movie. <br /> <br /> At least the sets were made from recycled paper material from the first film. <br /> <br /> The script had to be on the compost pile ...
