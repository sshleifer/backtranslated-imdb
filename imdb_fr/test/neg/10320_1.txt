I saw this one remastered on DVD. There was a big picture of Sandra on it and she was saying "Featured Sandra ..." and gave the impression that she had played an important role. Not so. She is hardly there. She does what she can with the script, but it's not a lot. <br /> <br /> The sound was awful. By that I mean things do not go together. Shots would be fired and the number of shots did not match the sound. People talk in a moving car and the shot comes from outside the windshield, but there is no engine noise, road noise or anything. A little weird. <br /> <br /> The score was awful. It looked like the same notes again and again. Dialogue really horrible. <br /> <br /> Play was terrible, I could not believe it. The fight scenes were like a Batman cartoon without "BIFF" and "BAM". They were really lame. The shooting scenes, I mean with guns, were laughable, literally. I made a quick advance in a lot of this movie. Even then, it was too long.
