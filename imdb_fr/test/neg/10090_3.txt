Imagine all stereotypical and over-the-top shots of all the movies and TV shows that take place on the streets of Brooklyn between 1930 and 1980. Fill it with a cast of interchangeable caricatures instead of real characters. Add a mix of "vintage" music and wailing guitars during "rumble" scenes. Then, spend the time trying to determine (or carefully determine) which of the Deuces will be killed in the last (anti) climax. <br /> <br /> I will give this film some points to not be another. romantic comedy, teen slasher, explosive action movie, teen sex comedy, children's musical or vehicle with Oscar nominations. But bringing something new or interesting to the kind of tragedy of street gangs could have been good.
