It was a movie doomed to failure since its conception. The very idea of ​​this idea was lame - take a minor character from a mediocre PG-13 movie and create a non-consecutive sequel while changing the tone to become a PG rated family movie. I was not interested in the least. Then came the caravan. Not only did this confirm that the film would be non-generic and generic, but it also managed to give the film ENTIER; and I'm not exaggerating - every moment, every point of the plot, every joke is told in the trailer. It's like a 3-minute version of Cliff's Notes movie. So obviously, I would not pay to see it, but once the DVD was launched, I thought I would watch it for free. Maybe Steve Carell could save him. <br /> <br /> No <br /> <br /> I'm still puzzled as to why he's involved. He must have a favor for someone. The jokes were so simple and obvious, and the director obviously asked him to adopt a very broad comedy style like Jim Carrey, Bruce Almight's first. But it's just not funny. The studio obviously tried to take advantage of Virgin's 40-year-old success with several of Carell's former co-stars, a reference to the movie on a theater marquee and another end-credits sequence. But even the talented Carrell can not save that. His co-stars are doing better, with people like Morgan Freeman, Jonah Hill and Ed Helms just defeated. Wanda Sykes is not wasted, she wastes everything she did, and her awful one-liners and her reactions made you want people to stop giving her work. <br /> <br /> The story itself is just predictable and lazy. This frustrates your head with obvious prefigurations, such as Evan's contempt for the environment (drives a gas-thirsty Humvee, chooses to use endangered tree wood for his house, hates animals , ...), and in the end it's a bit finer The highest preaching on faith and the environment. <br /> <br /> Why the film was shot is pretty disconcerting, but I really do not understand how it would become the most expensive comedy of all time. The only real effects are the presence of all the animals and their integration into the scenes is one of the worst and most obvious works on blue / green screen that I have ever seen. Maybe hiring live animals on the set cost a fortune. Who knows. But whatever it is that cost them so much, it does not mean quality, that's for sure. But hey, it was not the worst movie of the year. There are still a lot of bad surprises like Norbit and Death Proof.
