The assassination of the Red Comyns at Grayfriars Abbey was far from one of the most horrible things ever committed during the Scottish War of Independence. Shortly after, Robert Bruces' wife, daughter and two sisters were captured during a fight in a church where people were killed. And compare it to the Berwick massacre in which the English massacred at least 8,000 non-combatants (some, yes, in churches) is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> That said, it's not a well done movie. It is a slight antidote to the absolutely ridiculous depiction of Robert Bruce in Braveheart. Whatever Bruce was, he was not a rascal. <br /> <br /> Too bad they have not done a better job in this area, because someone should make a very good movie about a war as incredible as it may seem. as if something were going from a total defeat at Methven's battle to a secret return from hiding to a long guerrilla war in Bannockburn. That's not it though. Badly done and to a large extent poorly written and misinterpreted. Pity!
