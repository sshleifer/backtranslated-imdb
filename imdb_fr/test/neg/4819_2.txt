New Orleans has nothing to do with its description in this <br /> <br /> movie debacle. Quaid's attempt to speak with a Cajun accent <br /> <br /> (by the way, hardly anyone speaks that way in New <br /> <br /> Orleans) is terrible. Terrain = elemental and without spirit. This image <br /> <br /> defines itself as a mystery, but a mystery implies <br /> <br /> a gradual process of giving the viewer clues and twists throughout the film . There is nothing here. "Big <br /> <br /> Easy" tries to cope with banal stereotypes of New Orleans. <br /> <br /> Do not be fooled - the real Big Easy has nothing to do with the city <br /> <br /> that Quaid and Barkin are making their way.
