Watched the director's cup last night ... glad it was a free rental, even a dollar would have been too expensive for me to watch this "movie noir" attempt. Anachronisms (modern phones) were annoying to me, not smart, and more like budget constraints than anything else. The "non-traditional" cast also distracted me a lot. If I have to stop following the story to ask "what the hell is the black chick / drag queen doing?" so the storyteller failed me. Again, not smart in my opinion, but boring and irritating, and very final project of the film school. And for Pete's sake, if you plan to shoot in black and white, use at least some of the techniques used in old movies that take full advantage of the lack of color. There was no use of shade in the lighting, no shades of gray, no depth, no texture ... just black and white ... boring!
