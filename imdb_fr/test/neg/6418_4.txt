This original and exciting film tells the story of a misled dentist who begins his mission or crusade to fight tooth decay in the back and beyond Patagonia. Originally from Northern Ireland, via New Jersey, his main character, Fergus, sees his crusade as a mission of great importance and addresses it with all the enthusiasm, vitality, discipline and attention to detail that the one could expect from a dentist training. Which adds to the hilarity, as his big projects break up and collapse as he goes from one disaster to another in the Patagonian hinterland behind a motorcycle personalized or mobile dental unit. We never meet his wife, nor the rich philanthropist who sponsors this unfortunate mission, but we get a solid demonstration of Lewis. Fans of his work will not be disappointed by his highly credible performance as an illusive dentist adored by the famous, yet innocent, but sexy, 18-year-old woman who accompanies him on the * ahem * hike. <br /> <br /> This film is not for everyone and I can understand why it was not pushed by the costumes. It's a low-budget film, sometimes charming, always disarming, slightly amusing and instantly forgettable, that starts with low expectations and almost succeeds.
