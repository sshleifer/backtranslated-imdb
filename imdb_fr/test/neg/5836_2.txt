Terrible film. Simply terrible. The beginning of this film is like an outing of a film of women in prison. Then, it becomes a version of B-movie of Aliens. In this case, B-movie means the addition of free sex scenes and women in lingerie. Oh, and most of the pictures are exactly the same as those used in two other movies from the same company (including women in prison schtick). The only thing that saves this film a 1/10 is that I've seen some worse movies. Not a lot and not a lot, but worse.
