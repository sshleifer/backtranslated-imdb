It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> What is the purpose of this film? A group of Americans enters France occupied by the Nazis and begins to massacre the Germans. You see them climb their enemies and beat them to death with baseball bats. Of course, by making jokes. <br /> <br /> Some will say that this film is a parody of a certain kind. For a parody, it's neither spiritual nor funny. The content is zero. It's exceptionally brutal and disgusting. Beneath is a subtle political message, because it is again the "good guys" who kill "bad Nazis". The whole plot is unthinkable if you return it. Can you imagine a scenario where the Nazis (while joking) kill everyone in the Warsaw Ghetto with flamethrowers? Probably not, but this film talks about exactly that, except that it meets the strange moral expectations of a given audience: killing people is so cool when it's done by the right people. <br /> <br /> This movie only works because of the Nazi ideology hidden underneath. He does not consider the enemy as a people. And while this is supposed to be an element of pleasure, I am happy to say that this kind of pleasure will always be a mystery to me. <br /> <br /> Another mystery is how such violence can fascinate Americans. crowd while a little nudity will panic them. But if a naked body is pornography, this film with all its brutality is pure pornography at its worst. <br /> <br /> Inglorious Basterds is a waste of time and money useless, boring and tasteless.
