All right, this movie could have been good if there was a plot behind. the title did not even match after the first ten minutes. the wind did not have much to do with the rest of the movie. the acting was mediocre and the writing reminded me of something you would read in a scary storybook for kids. <br /> <br /> As for horror movies, it should not even be classified as such. It was a shame for fans of horror and thriller everywhere. I do not like being so hard, but I felt that I wanted to spend the time I spent watching this movie. I hope there will be no follow up to that. this film should be locked in a safe and never be made public.
