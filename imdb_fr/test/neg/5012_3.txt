This film is supposedly a comedy. So where are all the bursts of laughter lost? Did I forget to put them in the version I watched? mud, no sense of humor perceptible.or maybe this movie is just not funny.It is also boring, with this way above the musical score "you are a winner". most of the season, only win the last two games, and the last game did not mean anything because they were not in the playoffs.so, what is the point? do they celebrate mediocrity? I do not see it. If anyone knows, let me know. Anyway, this movie is not good or even very good.I give it a weak 3 *
