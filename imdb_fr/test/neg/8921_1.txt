it's only the second time I'm so excited to write a comment. Unfortunately, both times are films that can be described with several 4-letter words that can be defined as excrement or excrement. the other film of this caliber was masked and anonymous. <br /> <br /> anywa, about criticism .. there are several important mistakes in this movie that I will describe below. <br /> <br /> 1) Steven has lost the plot (that is, in all his other movies, his family or friends are killed, Steven is angry, Steven kills people. ). <br /> <br /> 2) Steven does not have any money was a good pursuit scene at first, but I think he ruined his budget on this and he could not afford a writer or a decent publisher). <br /> <br /> 3) steven does not seem to be doing his own thing anymore. Instead, the (memory) 2 fight scenes were shot in the back and neck, so you can not really see his face. most likely a double waterfall. I guess chuck norris. <br /> <br /> In summary ... the worst Seagal movie of all time. second worst film I've seen in recent history, and I've seen a lot of bad movies.
