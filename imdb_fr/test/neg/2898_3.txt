"Ninja III" is not as bad as "Enter The Ninja", the first part of this "trilogy", but it's still a very bad movie. This will not please fans of martial arts movies, because there is not enough action, but even the action scenes are often ruined by laughable excesses and unnecessary violence. As if the film was not already weak enough, the filmmakers turn some parts into a silly "The Exorcist" scam. The only value that redeems is the winning presence of the actress who plays the heroine "dominated"; She is a beautiful and sporty woman, whom the director does not forget to exploit in a shady way - she happens to be an aerobics teacher. It does not bother me to exploit the soft kernel a bit, but that does not have to pretend to be anything else.
