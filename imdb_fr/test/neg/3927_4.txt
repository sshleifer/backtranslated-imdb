I start by saying that I am a big fan of JJL and NOT Patrick. So I watched this to see his performance and of course, it was excellent. I do not think that the director was suitable for the film because several very bad choices were made: angles of shooting, blockages, etc. If the director tried to give him a "realistic" impression, they failed and lost good performances because of him. Almost always, the camera was too static, too far from the intense facial reactions - and so many times that the action depended on the intimacy of the main characters, the dialogue was slow and painful. This could easily have been solved by nicks or camera angle changes. But the impression I had was that the budget was too small and only one camera was used! I also had the impression that perhaps scenes were shot several times and that the energy of the actors was ... exhausted.
