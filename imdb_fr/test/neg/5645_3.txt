The growth of tax funds and sale-leaseback systems has led to a multitude of unsellable films that are pushing dust into the laboratories and safes of the British Isles, as they appear to have been manufactured solely because they meet the criteria. potential public financiers. Lucky few spend a week on a small screen in London before going to budget DVD, but The Riddle has distinguished itself by completely bypassing film, television or even the rental market to create a free gift DVD in Mail on Sunday. <Br /> <br /> It's too easy to see why this was finally given to the letter. Apart from a few flaws (a boom mic is clearly visible at once), it is not particularly badly made and, although Vinnie Jones comes as a version of modern British cinema, Freddie Mills Mills embodies the greyhound reporter who wants to face the crime. the desk and the support room change from ham to vaguely passable, no one stands out here being either remarkably good or incredibly bad: mediocrity is no longer the norm here. The real problem is that, like so many movies on the leaseback fund, this is a "soft" movie - there is no reason to watch it. It exists because the circumstances allow it, but it lacks rhythm or momentum. It seems to target Sunday audiences at tea time (despite filming in Scope) but does not cut it. In this resolutely inoffensive narrative of an unpublished manuscript of Charles Dickens and some suspicious deaths in Limehouse today, the mystery is so painfully obvious - just like the last-minute supernatural twist (you'll never guess who the literate vagabond is from Jacobi, what did you guess?) - you almost expect the Scooby Gang or the Double Deckers to come forward to solve it. <br /> <br /> It's a very bad movie. for all sorts of reasons: some members of the cast play double roles when they should not even play one, and the whole shock of the revelation of the truth of Dickens' manuscript is completely upset, because everything is told by Dickens in the first person only the supposed character of the novel. The main murder in the film is clumsily integrated into the main plot. Characters suddenly remind Vinnie that he has already forgotten, announcing a last half an hour more and more desperate where the secretary of the developer Jason Flemyng puts Rohypnol in the glass of Vinnie. leave her naughty and leave incriminating photos "to make you look like a fool with your girlfriend", letting him dream of talking to Charles Dickens ("You're Charles Dickings" "What's the name?"), who offers the suggestion a little less likely that "You read too many books". But all this is nothing compared to the finale, which falls into absolute absurdity, with logic and common sense that escape any discretion when it is a strange tragedy of Jacobian revenge with handguns on the banks of the Thames, with two-day guests Flemyng and Vanessa Redgrave seem to prefer to be elsewhere (Mel Smith appears in a cameo of a day, so it is clear that the "names" of the film are mainly there for a salary $ 10,000 or to meet their support payments). The final image of the film is so absurd and useless that it is almost worth looking at. <br /> <br /> A curiosity is a pretty important role in the first third of Vera Day, a kind of prototype of Liz Fraser and The pillar of the British movies of the 50s - the barmaid in Hell Drivers, the barmaid in Quatermass II - is promoted to pub owner, while comedian comedian Kenny Lynch introduces himself briefly to give the best performance as an old school gangster. Oh, and the late Gareth Hunt is making his last bow as - oh irony - a coroner ... <br /> <br /> Just to complete the package, the freebie DVD also contained a trailer for the director's other film with Vinnie Jones, Bog Bodies, a transatlantic-looking British horror and Vinnie in a duck hunter Elmer Fudd terrorized by a 2,000-year-old sacrificed sacrificial victim from the nearest peat bog ( "Be wewwy, wewwy qwuiet: I hunt dwuids"). I can hardly wait ... <br /> <br /> The only thing I can guarantee, however, is that every independent producer in the UK will spend the next few weeks trying to find out exactly how much the Mail has paid. to get the license to tap the DVD (they paid Prince Â£ 250,000 for his new CD). With so many British tax shelters on the shelf and money so hard to find at the moment, it could become an interesting fallback market for British films.
