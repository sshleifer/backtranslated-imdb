This is one of those movies you watch with a group of people. You will have the best time. It's really, really bad, like Showgirls, but without Showgirls quality. <br /> <br /> Here you have the best mix of bad actors, bad director and bad story. You have here everything that can be wrong for an entertaining evening. The first being the slogan is "a group of teenagers ...". These people are as much "teenagers" as my grandmother. <br /> <br /> The director does not have the sense of suspense or tension. The 30-year-old "teens" are there and the "monster" comes out and attacks, which happens almost throughout the movie when the monsters are revealed. There is no suspense, no surprise, or anything. It's more like when you were children claiming to be pursued by monsters and things invented as and when. And when I use the word "monsters", I'm exaggerating. It's more like a couple of Halloween masks bought at the .99 cent store. <br /> <br /> There is no doubt that this script was created in a few days, no rewrite and I can only imagine how bad the format is and poorly formatted. it looked on the page because it was clearly written by an amateur without clue. This is another example of one of the disadvantages of that day: anyone can make a movie. <br /> <br /> But of course, the best drawback of this film is the acting game. It's as bad as possible. There is not one person in this field who has the slightest skill to play and the main role is the worst. He delivers each line in this monotonous way without any expression and you have to wonder how someone so bad could play a role in any movie, no matter who he knows. When he had to "cry" when his girlfriend was killed, it's one of the funniest scenes I've ever seen in a movie. Watching these people recite some of these ugly dialogues is really a lot of fun. But when the black guy said "tell him ... tell him ... I love him ..." before his death scene, there was a huge laughter among our group. Funny, fun stuff. <br /> <br /> My only hope is that this film gets enough ratings to take its place in its place: in the lowest IMDb rankings, 100 films. We can do it, friends! <br /> <br /> PS. Is it any wonder that the "big" comment that this film got here comes from someone from Virginia (who has only one comment, only on this film and nothing else). And guess where the film was shot? Virginia. I've said it before and I'll say it again: people working on the film should NOT be allowed to comment on it.
