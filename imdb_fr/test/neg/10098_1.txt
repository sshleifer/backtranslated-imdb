2001 may not have been Eric Roberts' best year. Raptor and this are out. I looked at Raptor a while ago and I really thought it was bad and Erics was worse. But it was a moment of sharing and standard fun. This one has nothing at all. <br /> <br /> Tommy Lee Thomas is the name of the worst actor these days. The story lacks punch and the whole seems even slower than that of a snail that breaks in curves. <br /> <br /> Martin Kove and Eric Roberts stand out. You can discuss the fact that their efforts are good or what, but compared to the rest, they are primarily critics. <br /> <br /> Thank you Roberts for seeing you next time (and, hopefully, better).
