This is the second MST3K'd movie I have ever seen, and I still have a place in my heart as one of the most hilarious and horrible experiences you'll ever experience. <br /> <br /> Miles O'Keeffe (sp?) is, using her chiseled physique to score another mortgage payment on her condominium. He is stiff, wooden and unconvincing, but he remains a cool and friendly guy, and at least he is photogenic. It's the only decent thing I can say about the movie, so I thought I'd do it right off the bat. The fact that it is in the film adds another point to the score and it avoids being a "1 in 10". <br /> <br /> In no particular order, here are some examples of how poorly assembled this movie is: <br /> <br /> 1) OK, Tanya Roberts' clone (Mila) in search of " Finder Ator, which lasts 3 minutes on screen, including the time she spends stumbling dying from a poisoned arrow on her shoulder (which, I suppose, would have slowed her down a lot) . Then Ator treats her and takes her faithful help Thong and sets off to return to her castle ... and moves on to more than 50 minutes of the film, covering the ground that Mila went through in 3 minutes. How it works??? I know that the intrepid team is harassed by magical forces, enemies, etc. on the way back, but still ...! <br /> <br /> 2) Apparently, the screenwriter / director felt the need to add "depth" to the film by adding an ongoing debate / Socratic dialogue / game of 20 questions between Zor (the wicked John Saxon wannabe ) and the wise Akronas (Richard Harris wannabe). But Joe Damoto apparently got his philosophical training with cards, t-shirts and stickers, and he does not understand the tempo, the stimulation or the timing ... and the actors either. (Crow's remark during one of these exchanges is the slogan of my entry). The scenes with these two films drag on, stopping the film and killing any excitement or excitement generated by the sword fight and the quest of the heroic trio. <br /> <br /> 3) Once Ator arrives at the castle (and is captured), things go even further downhill. Zor decides to feed a group of female victims, with Ator and Mila, to the Serpent god that he keeps in his basement. This scene had a potential for excitement, so the director immediately eliminates this potential by infusing the scene with the drama of people waiting at the DMV to pay their fines. Ator begins a great battle with the snake which is hardly more convincing than the battle of Bela Lugosi with the rubber octopus puppet in "Bride Of The Monster". <br /> <br /> 4) The culminating scene in which Ator invents the hang gliding from twigs and animal skins is so stupid that it makes the spectator completely run away and rolls you to the ground, laughing until you your sides are hurting <br /> <br /> 5) Oh, yes, and the filmmakers decided to include at the end of the archive footage of an atomic explosion, with the morality that Ator has decided to destroy the "atomic nucleus" McGuffin who animates the movie because humanity was not ready ("Zzzzip! MESSAGE INING !!!") Just like "Bride Of The Monster" again, come to think about it. A spectator simply had to observe: "They have trafficked in the realm of God." <br /> <br /> 6) For some reason, the version of the film I saw featured homoerotic introduction and closing sequences that have absolutely NOTHING to do with anyone or anything else in the film. I do not know where this footage comes from, but it's actually worse than the movie itself. <br /> <br /> Watch this only if you're a big fan of Miles or if you like the way MST3K skewers like this material.
