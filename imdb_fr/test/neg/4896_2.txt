When we consider that Carson McCullers is one of the greatest literary figures of the twentieth century, it seems that there is a great lack of talent to ruin one of his stories, but this film shows that it is feasible ! How do the actors manage to become directors? In wood, non-atmospheric, unsympathetic, totally out of sync with McCullers' poetic compassion of writing, my jaw collapsed with horror and disbelief at the fact that such a film mix could have found funding and sponsors. The only traits that buy are some good actors (although it is said, Vanessa Redgrave seems to play permanently the same performance regardless of the character she plays), and good cinematic quality in some places, but otherwise is a bitter disappointment, bitter, could have and should have been a contemporary masterpiece. Simon Callow should be ashamed of his head and keep playing!
