The only reason there is a question mark in parentheses is NOT because I have not seen all the movies released in 2001 so far. This is because this film was only partially made in 2001. The rest was stolen from Roger Corman's other dinosaur films, Carnosaur 1-3. <br /> <br /> I have a confession to make. "Carnosaur 2" is perhaps one of my favorite B movies. It borrows so much from "Aliens" James Cameron that it's not even funny. But I love this. I can not explain exactly why. It works just for me. I liked the sets, the cinematography, the way they borrowed from "Aliens". It's a little ironic that Cameron was at one point a Corman dub, with films like "Battle Beyond the Stars" (1980). <br /> <br /> I own the trilogy of Carnosaurs on DVD say for the first part is that he has moments. All I can say for the third is that it took me five years to find it. <br /> <br /> We now have "Raptor", which does NOT continue this series. Instead, he borrows ALL scenes from the Carnosaur trilogy and BUILDS a movie around him. And one way or another, Roger Corman was able to convince Eric Roberts and Corbin Bernsen to do it. Now, I'm not saying that Roberts or Bernsen are at a high career level. But they were both at one point what we could call RESPECTABLE actors. Not here. Of course, actors react to effects they will not even see while filming. Here, however, they react to inadequate images of films aged five to eight. There is even a sherrif whose costume was modeled directly after a character of "Carnosaur 1." Apparently, it was too logical to recover the original guy. <br /> <br /> When "Raptor" was announced, I was a little excited. I was disappointed, however, when Corman announced that they would use the old "Carnosaur" dinosaur models. Apparently, after this interview, Corman decided he would not even do it. And it's not that he could not find an FX crew to do it. The script of this operation was clearly written, keeping in mind that the story had to be built from previous footage. <br /> <br /> Do not compare this to Ed Wood. Ed did better than that. At least he only used Bela's archive footage once in a single movie. There is a way to incorporate archive footage into a movie, and "Raptor" brings this poorly viewed technique to a new level. Even if you liked "Carnosaurus 3: Primal Species", stay away from "Raptor".
