May 2: someone clicked 11 no, then made 15 other remarks: almost as funny as this turkey! <br /> <br /> May 1st: <br /> <br /> As I write On this, I'm still very under the impression of what must be the funniest thriller that I have never seen. I have a major case of giggles, but I will try to calm down. (It's a bit difficult to write when your nose spits and your mouth throws on the keyboard sporadically.) <br /> <br /> Two young women who have just returned from vacation take a shuttle bus. Two young men join them. But the bus is not really a taxi service: it's a kidnapping vehicle. (Do not laugh!) His driver is part of an organized gang of "white slavery" that is tearing young women out of airports and has been doing so for five years. (Do not laugh.) Five years at SAME airport, without the police or even the FBI ever knowing. (No chuckles, please.) Apparently, dozens of women are disappearing in the same place for years and years - and yet no one notices a trend. Is the FBI so incompetent? The world of "Shuttle" seems to be made up of three types of people: blondes easy to kidnap, stupid / comatose / invisible FBI agents and all-powerful psychotic gangsters (who hate sexy blondes with a tattoo behind). <br /> <br /> The driver barely survived this mission and yet he has been doing it for five years, I repeat, without being killed or losing one of its members. (Stop laughing ...) Did I mention that the driver is immortal? Should I talk about it? We all know that the movie psychos have immortal DNA. You can stab them, bounce them a few times against the walls of a bus, stroke them gently with a hammer, steal a fingernail in your ears ... Damn, you could stick a pomegranate in the mouth of the average psychopath from Hollywood, and he would still escape with only a few scratches. No, the driver is neither Satan nor a minor demon, but just a Hollywood psychopath with better survivability than the biggest and most seedy cockroach. <br /> <br /> The basic plan of the plot: a guy loses all his fingers on the one hand in a silly scene. (A magic bus that reads and obeys the spirits!) The passengers try to escape. They fail. They hurt themselves. They sulk. They argue. They try to escape. They fail. They are injured. They argue. They try to escape. They fail. They are injured. They try to escape. They fail. They try to escape. The kidnapped manage to seize the gun! Alas, they do not kill him because pacifism in the Golden Hollywood Rule of Gandhi forbids them to do so. (No chuckles.) One of the other passengers turns out to be part of the gang! (Stop laughing.) It's played by an actor who studied at Rob Zombie / John Travolta School for excessive aggravation and stupid nonsense. He is threatening to rape. Later, one of the girls hit him with an iron bar on his head, about a dozen times ... very loudly. Seconds later, he regains consciousness. Yes, he survives. (Immortal, remember?) He's killed a little later. (I do not know how, though! He's not supposed to be a murderer.) The kidnapped are arguing. They try to escape. One of them escapes! Alas, the psychos have a power too much like that of God not to resume their prey. The game starts again: the passengers try to escape. They fail. They sulk. They look in the void. They hurt themselves. They try to escape. They fail. They are injured ... <br /> <br /> You understand. <br /> <br /> Frankly, I believe that a drugged snail, highly disoriented and intoxicated, would have easily escaped these unscrupulous kidnappers. There were so many opportunities. At one point, these bumbling psychos (remember: FIVE years!) Even sent one of the kidnapped to a grocery store! She leaves a message to the police. However, yes ... you guessed it: this fictional fairy-tale American town has no police. <br /> <br /> And just as you thought the film could not go idiotic, not even if Luc Besson and Brian De Palma joined forces to lend a hand to the screenplay - that's the case. The girls are kidnapped to be sent to a distant island (?). To do this, they are transported by freight. Apparently, this fictional America has neither FBI nor police - nor custom customs. However, he has immortal criminals with more luck than twenty winners in the lottery. A blonde had her billionth chance to kill the driver, but she failed. How is it that the victims of these idiotic thrillers are NEVER trying to finish their immortal opponents once they are down and injured? I guess I answered this question myself: they are immortal! So why bother trying, she must have thought ... <br /> <br /> So why was a blond gassed to death and the other packaged and shipped alive (with a box cat litter and the funniest photo from The Demi Moore Elementary School Pictures)? Could it be the tattoo? I think they killed the most beautiful, but it's just me. Was his tattoo so ugly? <br /> <br /> Could it be that I do not care? Why should I look for logic in a movie made by fools (for fools)? And then, how can I even think straight while I laugh so hard half the time ?! <br /> <br /> Of course, this is a twenty-first century horror / thriller movie, the mobile phone does not work ... Maybe this invincible gang controls not only the FBI, the police and customs, but also satellites in space. <br /> <br /> Do I need to clarify? There are much easier ways to kidnap people. And many more smart people who should make movies. Give a camera to a fool and he will lay an egg each time ... This answers in a way to the eternal riddle that first appeared: the egg or the director of deer.
