A group of friends receive news of a friend who found gold in an old spirit well near an old abandoned town in western Suttersville. Despite warnings from the local sheriff, Murphy (John Phillip Law), the old man Prichard (Richard Lynch), a collapsed idiot who scams tourists with supposed collectible posters, and the superstitious kooky Aunt Nelly (Karen Black) to stay away from the mine It's a notorious legend (.. that a coal miner villain who sold his soul to the devil and murdered the daughter of a priest (Jeff Conaway) will come back from the dead for to kill those who remove the gold from his well), these people only see the green, not the red blood that could potentially come out of their dead bodies. Finding the gold of Jeremiah Stone intact, they cover their pockets and use cases, ready to face a bright future. But, when you ignore the warnings of those whom you consider to be loons of the hinterland, the obvious result will be horrible death. Jeremiah Stone, as we see, rests only on a skeleton near an altar containing skulls lined up next to each other, while the candles that surmount them light up, the pickaxe below waiting for his master, with dust particles bringing him back to a demonic grotesque corpse. exposure, his eyes burning with anger. This unfortunate group, hoping to have fun around the campfire with gold offering them great future prospects, will fall prey to the vengeful ghoul and his mediocre pawn. Another victim will meet the nasty end of a shovel thrown through the windshield of his vehicle and head him straight into the back of the neck. Another unsuccessful attempt at retirement was caused by a frightened victim who drove his car into a tree, his body devastated by the flames, otherwise he could not escape without injury. Another girl, a girl from the region looking for her new friends, worried about their well-being, receives the pickaxe buried in her stomach. Aunt Nelly informs those who are still alive about the Forty-Niner and the curse that strikes those who plunder her eternal hiding place .. and pays the price for the disclosure of such information. Will someone survive? Or is the whole group supposed to die in the hands of the zombie miner? <br /> <br /> Makeup effects artist and monster creator, John Carl Buechler directs this supernatural slasher without worrying about logic or narration. , opting instead to allow his zombie miner to destroy anyone and everyone in his path. It provides just enough history, and it's at best weak, for the killer allowing the special star, Karen Black (.. oh how his career sank into the abyss), to explain to the viewer about it . The story told tells us that the miner held a priest's daughter hostage, threatening to execute it while the Suttersville authorities warned against such action. Quite surprisingly, stone plants that got stuck in his back, the opposition unloading their weapons with little effect because he sold his soul to Satan. Retiring to his estate, the mine shaft, Stone sends a warning against anyone who even tries to take what belongs to him, the booty. Typical of most slashers in general, this group of young people from twenty to twenty is your gardening victim, with little development, aside from a few jokes and an exchange of words, which serves as a filling material until the maniac undead comes to slaughter them. They are the usual group, from the city, through an unknown territory, resurrecting an evil that should remain dormant. Like many 80's slashers, much of the violence is off-screen. What is on the screen, the minimal gore, is presented rather mundane and happens rather quickly. The ghoul's makeup for the murderer is only shown from time to time: he is mainly plunged into darkness, the horrified faces of the victims when he catches them or pursues them have more credibility than the method of destruction. One thing is certain, stuntmen have been torched several times. At least three times, a character is burned alive by a lantern or a vehicle on fire. Martin Cove has a little cameo as Black's old husband, Caleb, who now lives with a much younger and dense honey. Vernon Wells (of The Road Warrior and Commando celebrities) plays Jeremiah Stone as a human being, always capturing the same type of threat he is specialized at. John Phillip Law seems to have fun as a rather polite and hospitable man. Sheriff, welcoming strangers to his corner of the country. Buechler has a plethora of attractive actresses, all dressed in tight pants and tiny shirts, displaying their smooth and athletic silhouettes, especially Elina Madison, the easy-to-wear Roxann, always ready to take off her clothes to Hayden (Rick Majeske). Stephen Wastell (The ghosts of Edendale) is Axl, a rather clumsy film, used as a target of many jokes, including his scene of "dump in the woods" and his current unemployment rate.
