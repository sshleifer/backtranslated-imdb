Killjoy 1 and Killjoy 2 smell bad, but the first was better. The special effects in this movie were not at all special. Even if the massacres were better in this slice, they were not enough to boast. One thing that was worse in Part 2 were the characters. They suddenly changed their emotions and some of their lines were just silly. For example, one character quoted: "You'd better have a PE, or you'll find out what it means to me." Once I heard that sentence, I thought it was the worst I ever heard. Another thing I hated about this movie was the fact that it was too short. A successful movie must last more than an hour and twenty minutes, like Killjoy 2. If Full Moon performs part 3 of Killjoy, it would be down to the lowest possible level. Overall, 1 in 10. <br /> <br />
