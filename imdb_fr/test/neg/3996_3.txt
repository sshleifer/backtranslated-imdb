At first, I was interested in this film after reading a summary and saw some striking screenshots. The promise of a captivating horror film of the Dario Argento style was there. Admittedly, I must say that Argento's films have sometimes been rather inconsistent, and some have the impression of being a handful of striking and visually connected stage pieces with a vague plot. <br /> <br /> Since Argento is the author, I must say that I'm not really surprised. Even his masterpiece Suspiria, when examined, shows the same tendency to follow scenes sometimes unrelated only for aesthetic reasons. However, Suspiria also benefited from a singular main character and well-defined antagonists, as well as scenes that contributed to the final resolution. <br /> <br /> The Church, on the other hand, has none of this. He has no main character, no protagonist whatsoever; moreover, he has no real conspiracy to speak of, no crescendo, no climax, no denouement, no resolution. It is a completely hollow and incoherent work that suggests that Argento sat down and thought, "Hey, that would make an interesting scene visually ... let's do it!" The film is a series of these scenes. <br /> <br /> At first this might be interesting, and the direction of Soavi is excellent, I must say. Soavi can not be criticized for the material because it is made as convincing as possible. However, such a good direction draws attention to the terrible failures of the script, which makes no sense. The attempt at a central unifying plot is nothing more than the plagiarism of Carpenter's film, Prince of Darkness. Events happen only because the script wants it and reactions to these events are totally implausible. The narrative flow is irreparably damaged after a point, simply because it is impossible to suspend disbelief; it's too ridiculous. In addition, there are many factual errors that are so obvious that they become embarrassing. <br /> <br /> If it had been more overtly artistic and integrated into a different work, it might have been chilling or tense. If it had been transformed into a coherent story, it might have been captivating. But it was none of that. The best he could handle was confusing and sometimes infuriating. Plots are introduced but never followed. The characters are forgotten and modified arbitrarily. No logic is ever applied to a situation. It could have been frightening or interesting, but to arouse that kind of feeling requires more effort from a screenwriter ... much more. <br /> <br /> All in all, the Church is not worthy of interest for anyone but enthusiasts of Italian horror are more stylish than substance. Argento's style is at its worst, and it's a solid justification for the usual critics.
