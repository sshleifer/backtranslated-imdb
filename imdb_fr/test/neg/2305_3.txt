Jacqueline Susann has written several novels all dealing with sex and melodrama. A few of them have actually been turned into movies, including this effort. They all have the distinction of being among the worst films ever made. The story here is about Robin Stone (John Phillip Law) and his rise to television being ruthless and calculating towards everyone around him. He is a playboy of the worst type who uses and then throws all the women he sleeps, including the wife of the president of the IBC network. <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILER ALERT ***** Greg Austin (Robert Ryan) is responsible for the IBC television network and when his young wife Judith glances at Robin, she lose no time lying down with him. Greg gets sick and has to leave. This is where Robin comes in and starts trying to manage the network, but all the while, a model named Amanda (Jodi Wexler) who is in love with him kills himself. When Greg returns to his job, he tries to get rid of Robin by using the moral clause of his contract when rumors begin to circulate about his relationship with Jerry Nelson (David Hemmings), a gay fashion photographer. <br /> <br /> This was directed by Jack Haley Jr. who became a very successful producer on television and at the movies, but it was only his second film as a director and material that he was forced to manipulate him more and more! The scenario comes from Susann's novel and that would probably be why it sounds like a cross between "Alfie" and "The Valley of the Dolls" and I think the reason his books could never translate well on the film is that the filmmakers made the terrible mistake of taking his stories seriously instead of the language in the cheek. With that, the resulting laughter is unintentional, especially during this totally ridiculous battle towards the end of the film that begins when Cannon refuses to return the slave bracelet to homosexual characters! Hemmings was a very good actor, but his role here is completely exaggerated. He wears one of the worst beards in history and uses the term "chic" in all other sentences. Law was not the initial choice for the main role, but another actor who was chosen had a serious accident and Law stepped in and delivered one of the most wooded performances on this side of Miles O'Keeffe. The scenario of the film suffers in two different areas: it is both completely stupid and terribly boring. It will test the patience of viewers if they choose to watch this. One has to wonder what the result would be if a director decided to shoot one of Susann's novels and did not take it seriously, because the attempt here was heavy and ridiculous.
