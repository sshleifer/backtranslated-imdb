It was so poor that I had to turn it off at the end. I have never watched such a pathetic film. I love B-movies and I could not wait to see the same thing, but unfortunately I was disappointed. <br /> <br /> It's the worst scenario / scenario / direction / writing, etc. ...... seen in my life! <br /> <br /> My advice to all who think or look / buy / rent, do not go!
