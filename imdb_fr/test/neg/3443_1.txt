Honestly, I do not know why this show lasted so long. oh well, humor is subjective huh? but yes, this show is incredibly funny if you ask me. Tim Allen is annoying. Jill is annoying. the boys are annoying. Al is annoying. the neighbor is annoying. it's just more annoying than funny. the intrigues are all identical, Tim makes Jill angry and needs to right the situation. and the last seasons? The less we say, the better, who the hell would cancer be good for a damn sitcom? yeah, good idea wankers. then, home improvement is not a very good sitcom. I recommend going to watch News Radio or Seinfeld. If I had to give a note to this show, I would give it a 1/10 because it never made me laugh once. already. so yes, it's still better than the nanny.
