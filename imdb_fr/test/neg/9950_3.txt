The mad monster begins in the laboratory of Dr. Lorenzo Cameron (George Zucco), perfecting his discovery of the transformation of a human being into a monster-like vicious wolf by injecting animal blood into a human subject that happens to be his Silly servant (Glenn Strange), apparently, he plans to put the serum at the disposal of the War Department who will use it to create an unstoppable army of these monsters, the supreme soldier! However, first of all, Dr. Cameron wants to take revenge on the people who rejected his experiences, forced him to resign and ridicule him in public. Dr. Cameron puts his plan into action and uses his monstrous creation to assassinate Professor Blaine (Robert Strange), but Dr. Cameron is unable to control the beast and is spotted by a local farmer, Jed Harper (Eddie Holden). A journalist named Tom Gregory (Johnny Downs) gets wind of the story and begins to investigate, he begins to suspect Dr. Cameron and since Gregory is dating his daughter Lenora (Ann Nagel) he has many opportunities to sniff out ... <br /> <br /> Led by Sam Newfield, it's really a low-budget thing from the '40s, and worst of all, it's a drab, original, low-budget thing. Fred Myton's scenario drags the extremely thin premise to almost 77 minutes, which is way too long, there is no variety in the story and it's basically the same thing over and over again. The characters are crazy clich√©s, the mad scientist who leads useless experiments to create a monster, the fragile pretty girl, the journalist who plays the hero and by pure chance, both investigate the mysterious deaths of which the mad scientist is responsible and romance involved with his daughter, the dumb servant, silly stupid police & shotgun stereotype brandishing farmers who are still accused of being intoxicated. It was probably a cliche even in 1942! The film is moving at a rather slow pace and the director Newfield never manages to maintain or generate much excitement or atmosphere, which is a bad thing. Technically, the movie is not great, the budget was tiny and the crazy monster itself has a lame appearance that looks like an old homeless wino who has not shaved in recent weeks and who has received a pair of plastic fangs in the mouth. Black-and-white cinematography is basic and static, like most movies from this period, while Dr. Cameron's good lab consists of a couch and table with some desolate scientific equipment on top. The acting game is steep and wooden. Petro seems to be doping throughout the film. Zucco, as a mad scientist, does not convince and is forgettable. The crazy monster is a pretty lame horror movie, there is very little to entertain here, though at least I got to the end in one sitting, which, when I think about it, is a exploit in itself!
