** Spoiler * It gives the end very irrelevant ** <br /> <br /> At the beginning of this film, there was a brief introduction to the world of gore by the master of gore movies, H.G. Lewis. He recounted how this film was lost, then found years after the director's death. He also talked about how gore films were measured based on the amount of blood on stage used. Blood Feast was a 2 gallon, 10,000 Maniacs was a 5 gallon. But then he leaves and says that Dr. Gore was a 15 gallon. I want to know where half of the 15 gallons went. Watching the movie, I saw very little about 15 gallons. Okay, there was a fairly large amount of blood, but not nearly 15 gallons. Some dismemberment scenes were really gory and realistic, chains of flesh and all, but I would not say 15 gallons. <br /> <br /> "END !!! ENNNNNNNNNNDDDDDDD !!!" Sound familiar? That's what you should have said near the last half of this movie. After Igor's character was thrown into the acid bath, the movie slowed down at a painful pace. There was no coherent end, because it did not correspond to anything of the preceding 90 minutes. She left in a van with a stranger, BIG DEAL! This is what happens when you keep a person (I will not say anyone, because she is not qualified as a person) very innocent of the world around her. The doctor teaches the girl to love a man and that she loves all the men she meets. <br /> <br /> Even though HG Lewis told us at the beginning of the movie that we might not like acting, direction, or even gore ... I'll go with choices A and B Both were terrible !! It was enough to give me bad editing dreams and people with unstable eyes as they chatted with one person. But, I went through the film and I came out stronger. Too bad I can not say the same after finishing ROBO C.H.I.C. <br /> <br /> It was a bad movie. I can usually take my vinegar doses on the fly, but from time to time you get a movie that bites. I think this film took off an arm or a leg (haha ... * sigh *) Admitted, I loved the scenes where the good doctor looked down, the good doctor stared at his future victims and opened REALLY wide eyes and just looked. It was VERY similar to Fuad Ramseys in Blood Feast when he looked at this lady in her food store and did not use her power afterwards. I guess this film picks up where Fuad's powers were interrupted. <br /> <br /> * Final judgment * The film should have been lost. Have a nice day <br /> <br /> -Scott-
