(This review will feature very obvious spoilers, so beware.) <br /> <br /> A friend told us, and we managed to cross 45 minutes of the film before deciding that Fast Forward 8x Speed Was the only way this movie should be watched. There were times when we watched the movie at a normal speed when I was leaving, preparing a portion of lunch and coming back to find that literally nothing had happened. 2 lines of meaningless dialogue were exchanged. Nothing happened in the background, no important gesture of the face was made, nothing but an annoying and numbing silence. <br /> <br /> This is NOT how to make a movie well thought out, especially when the plot of the movie follows all the same basic film of Hollywood tropes. If I told you that Disney was shooting a film about 4 girls starting a band and the singer was a French student, would you expect it to be the "conflicts" that are happening? <br /> <br /> The lead singer has to overcome stage fright? Someone has an unspoken crush? The band is late for their performance and a secondary character must save time! <br /> <br /> * SPOILER ALERT * <br /> <br /> All of these things happen in this movie. <Br /> <br /> At no point in this movie, you do not fear that these girls can achieve their goal. <br /> <br /> * IT FINISHES THE SPOILERS SECTION * <br /> <br /> I like Japanese movies. I spent a lot of time in Japan. I work for a Japanese company. Heck, I even know all the bands listed in the record collections and the MDs they go through, and I sang on the track with friends at karaoke. <br /> <br /> This is probably the worst movie in Japan I've ever seen. Do not be confused. Although the characters have points in the movie where they do things typical of Japanese high school, it is not a "typical day in the life of the film". It's "a day in the life of 4 extremely random, extremely confrontational and clumsy Japanese students." <br /> <br /> The DVD also has obvious problems. Viz has decided that an additional producer will read Wikipedia's entry on the Blue Hearts aloud. What value! In addition, they care so little about subtitling that the group name in the subtitles, "Paran Maum", is different from that of the chapter selection menu, "Paran Marum". In the final scene of the auditorium, there is a VERY visible reflection / ghost effect on everything, but that seems to be the fault of the original movie. <br /> <br /> 2/10, DO NOT see if you do not absolutely love clumsy silences.
