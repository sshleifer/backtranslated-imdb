This film has been promoting everywhere in Spain with a huge advertising campaign. After looking at it, you realize that someone stole your money. Paz Vega is horrible like Carmen, she is not natural at all and she seems to make a fashion magazine cover on every level (the "best" is when she is an Andalusian woman .. Leonardo Sbaraglia is much better than her, but the story is very slow, the plot does not work and the screenplay is really very bad ... I'm thinking about Penelope Cruz (the movie was written for her) ) Carmen would have been a lot more credible and sexy. <br /> <br /> What a waste of time and money!
