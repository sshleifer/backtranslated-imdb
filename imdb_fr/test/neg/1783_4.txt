I thought it would be a funny comedy without sex or nudity. Well, there is no sexual content, but to be a "funny comedy", I only remember laughing a total of three times during "The Green Butchers". The hilarity is centered around cannibalism and mental retardation, which is only unhealthy humor. <br /> <br /> I should have come out of this movie and I got caught because I did not do it. In fact, I should not have seen this movie in the first place. The only good that emerges from this film is the fact that Bjarne and his brother finally amended and left behind their bad past. I advise any well-intentioned person to avoid this coarse film.
