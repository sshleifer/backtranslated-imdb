Before I start, may I say that I hope you have already eaten while reading this. Why? Because, after watching this film for the first time, the appearance and sound of the bird made me want to eat chicken after the words "The End" appeared on the screen. So, do not say you have not been warned. <br /> <br /> Fred Sears could have directed "Earth vs. the Flying Saucers" (a decent film and one of the biggest examples of Tim Burton's "Mars Attacks"), but "The Giant Claw" is not such a giant movie. Yes, it's a prehistoric monster that flies through the air, attacks planes and cities and sometimes treats itself like a parachute man. The beast is giant, except in scenes where it is considerably smaller, but who needs constant proportions in a movie? Scary? That could have been the case, but not if the plot is desperately stupid and the monster looks like a puppet who has run away from Sesame Street.
