Max Cash, a charter boat captain working off the Caribbean island of San Sebastian, is hired by Sarah, who is searching for the legendary El Diablo boat and her stolen treasure that sank in the reef in the 17th century. century. But something seems to protect the place where the ship is, because people who knew anything are being killed. <br /> <br /> I agree with those who felt it was going to be a horror. functionality. Instead, we ended up with a low rent movie, the late '80s, in the 1977 offshore adventure film, "The Deep", but with a puzzling supernatural origin and an injection of mystery. The story is confusing (many inconsistent angles make no sense and encourage a stained rhythm) and the technical aspect is clumsy. Beautiful exotic place and underwater photography though. While the carefree performances were not too bad either. Wayne Crawford is a witty man and June Chadwick is right at his side. Sheri Able is a real treat for the eyes. There are weird developments that entertain and one or two strange sequences. However, there is a real lack of cohesion. Most panicade deaths occur off-screen, with the exception of bloody and agitated murders caused by something invisible. Again, another thing that leaves you dry and dry. The music is generic with its percussive signals to warn us of imminent danger and the POV plans work well. Grasse, but observable.
