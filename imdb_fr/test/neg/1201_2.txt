Without really giving up on my age, I saw this for the first time more than 20 years ago when he first came out on video (maybe it was a beta tape?) And I was old enough to drink (barely) and I may have had some because I remember thinking how great this movie was! Since then, I've seen it sober and I have to admit it's a very bad movie. As mentioned in other articles, the plot is absolutely ridiculous and the poor quality of things only makes things worse. It's a poor attempt to fantasize that teenagers too can be "nonconformists" (although I'm surprised to discover that it will come out at the same time (about) as "Top Gun", and is not really intended to be a bad imitation.) But still, it's worth it - I find myself watching it if it's turned on and I have time. It's one of those movies you watch because it's so ridiculous and desperately trying to take it seriously. Like this other "big" movie - "Moment by moment" with John Travolta and Lily Tomlin ... do not get me started!
