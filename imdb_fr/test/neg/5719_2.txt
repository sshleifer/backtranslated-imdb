Possible Spoilers As Peter Jackson so brilliantly demonstrated in his trilogy of The Lord of the Rings, it is quite possible to make good movies, even big ones, in the genre of heroic fantasy. The genre has distinguished literary antecedents from medieval chivalric novels, especially Arthurian legends, upon which Tolkien and others have learned. 'Lord of the Rings', however, it's hard to think of other good sword and sorcery movies. I agree with the critic who said the best of a bad group was Ron Howard's "Willow", and even that made little distinction, other than being a simply mediocre film, as opposed to to a really bad movie. `Red Sonja 'can not, however, realize the even more modest distinction of being just a bad film as opposed to a dreadful movie. <br /> <br /> As with `Willow ', many elements of the plot in` Red Sonja' are derived from `The Lord of the Rings'. A diabolical ruler seeks to take control of an artifact with supernatural powers to achieve an ambition of world domination, but is thwarted by a group of diverse heroes. The film, which takes place in the Hyborian era, a barbaric era in the distant past of the Earth, begins with the villain of the play, the evil Queen Gedren, who makes unwelcome sexual advances to heroine Sonja. When they are pushed back, Gedren (not a woman to be taken for no answer) reacts by murdering Sonja's parents and brother. (In 1985, he was presumably still considered politically correct not only to make the wicked leader a woman, but also to make one of the main motives of his lesbian frustrated sexual desire). <br /> <br /> Gedren's next decision is to capture the Talisman, a kind of fluorescent green soccer ball with magical powers, slaughtering the entire female priesthood accursed in a cursory manner, charged with protecting it, just at the moment he is about to destroy it because they feel that his powers have become too dangerous. Among the dead is Sonja's sister, her only surviving parent. Sonja herself, however, did not sit idly by, but she enrolled in a martial arts academy from which she graduated with honors and took revenge. Along the way, she teams up with Kalidor, a heroic and wandering epic swordsman resembling Tolkien's Aragorn, Prince Tarn, the spoiled spoiled king of a kingdom that has fallen into the hands of Gedren and Falkon, the loyal servant of Tarn. The rest of the film is relatively predictable, as Sonja and his allies attempt to overthrow Gedren and prevent the destruction of the world threatened by the uncontrollable Talisman. <br /> <br /> That explains this situation. movie so bad? Well, the acting game, to start. Arnold Schwarzenegger as Kalidor gives the kind of typical wooden performance to the poker face that has become his hallmark, at least at the beginning of his career, with a strong foreign accent. Compared to Brigitte Nielsen as a heroine, he looks like Laurence Olivier. Miss Nielsen seems to have had even more serious linguistic difficulties, delivering every line of the mechanical and voiceless voice of someone who has just completed the third lesson of the "teach yourself-English-by-correspondence" course. One wonders if she was hired for the role just for Arnie to look good in comparison. The other characters, even if they do not lead their own personal struggles against the English language, are simply caricature cartoons, especially Prince Tarn, who must be one of the most heinous young screens of all time. <br /> <br /> A more serious fault than that of playing badly, however, is the almost total lack of imagination of the film. This is a particularly egregious mistake in a fantasy film, because films of this kind must rely on their imaginative power to persuade the audience to suspend the natural feelings of disbelief that would be caused by a fantastic plot. When we look at Peter Jackson's masterpiece, we can convince ourselves, at least for the next three hours, that we are in Middle-earth, that there are elves, wizards, and hobbits, and that the fate of the world really depends on the destruction of a magic ring. When we look at `Red Sonja ', we are not persuaded of anything except that we watch a group of actors with lamentable accents fighting on a hill for possession of a lime green soccer ball. <br /> <br /> This lack of imagination even starts with the title of the film. British science fiction writer Brian Aldiss, questioned about the exotic names given to his characters, replied that it was useless to create a fictional extraterrestrial society with his own culture if you wanted to spoil the effect by calling the hero Joe. . (Of course, Tolkien was able to <br /> <br /> get away by giving Sam's name to one of his main characters, but that's because the Hobbits were supposed to be familiar, the equivalent of Middle Earth in the tweedy, English smoking pipe). Likewise, giving the heroine of a tale apparently erected in a barbaric age gone by a female name such as "Sonia" (so pronounced the name "Sonja") is about as appropriate as calling it "Betty" or "Mary-Jane". <br /> <br /> The film seems to have been made with a very small budget, which makes me wonder why they were disturbed.The fantasy must be made convincingly, or not the All of a sudden, he was shot in a remote mountainous area, with little or no attempt to suggest a distinct culture.The few buildings we see, such as the Talisman Temple or the Gedren Palace, are obviously We learn that Gedren destroyed the capital of the Tarn using the power of the Talisman, but we do not really see this event, all we see is what could be a thunderstorm unfolding from the on the other side of a hill. goal, you wonder how Sonja intends to reverse an entire kingdom with few allies, but when you see how the army Gedren is small, it becomes more understandable. When an earthquake threatens to destroy the palace, you wonder whether it is the Talisman at work or if it is simply a member of the crew inadvertently leaning against the scenery. If we can only enjoy this film for nothing else, we can at least enjoy it for its unintentional humor; a fine example of the cinema school, so bad and so funny. Ed Wood would have been proud of it. If it had been broadcast on California television the night before the recall election, Gray Davis would still be governor. 2/10.
