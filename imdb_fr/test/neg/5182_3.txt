After a while, I realized it was just that my IQ was slowly decreasing. Frostbite is one of those pathetic movies where no one, and I mean nobody, even tries. I was rooting for the stupid hero to die in this trash (how did he manage to fit in anyway?), Traci Lords, the queen of the B-movie series, was horribly flippant and tore me and my friends, by not showing her breasts once. <br /> <br /> The "characters", although I use this term vaguely, are people so exaggerated and unidimensional that they could just as easily have used cardboard cutouts. The "jokes" (I also use this term vaguely) are just hilarious. A guy's fart causes an earthquake. Roflcopter! Our "hero" is stung by Traci Lords. Oh my God, I can not breathe! The blind type uses the word F several times! It's too much!!! <br /> <br /> Say what you want about acting, but I thought Adam Grimes did a great job playing with a snowboarder with a mental challenge. Apart from this, the only source of entertainment value here are the breasts. I think I counted three, maybe four pairs throughout the film, scattered over maybe five minutes. It's been five minutes worth watching over 83 minutes of garbage. Do not look at that. Watch Barb Wire with Pamela Anderson - at least there was a lot of nudity and action in this trashy movie!
