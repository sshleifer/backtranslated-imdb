The Greek places for some parts of the film were very beautiful and the photography gets all my votes and that's about the full extent of my praise for this movie. I found that all the characters were narcissistic archetypes that are so often found in American culture and were superficial and uninteresting. Susan Sarandon and Gena Rowlands are easy to look at, but I found their characters very narcissistic and inimitable for many other reasons. When Gena Rowlands sang at a party, I wondered how this woman could see herself as a competent star on the stage. I was tempted to press the MUTE button until she finished singing. Molly Ringwald was herself and the character of Raul Julia was so lush that it was downright scary. The film was way too long for me and I could not iron it, even at the tip of a gun.
