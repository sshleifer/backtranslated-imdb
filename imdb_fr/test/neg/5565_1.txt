After some failures, we are still waiting for THE French horror film that critics will certainly denigrate, but which will launch a new trend. Not this time. Doug Headline can not be accused of not knowing the genre (he is editor of a fantasy fantasy imprint, worked for the legendary Starfix magazine.), But why a scenario that uses EVERY clich√© in the book (except maybe the Odious Comic Relief)? Why make it so predictable? Even nods to Argento fail flat. It's not even a Euro-teen movie like "Anatomy" in German, it's much better, just a compilation of scenes that seem to barely have a relationship with each other and feature LOTS of field plot holes. . The whole "Celtic" aspect is barely touched. And, after a painfully predictable "revenge", the scenario offers us a boring and endless pursuit in an underground necropolis that seems larger than the Paris catacombs. I really wanted to love this movie. Really. But even a mother would not do it. Oh, and the writer Valerio Evangelisti was supposed to make an appearance, but I searched for it in vain.
