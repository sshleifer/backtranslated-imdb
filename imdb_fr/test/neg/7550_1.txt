I saw Rik Mayall at Blackadder and New Statesman, so I thought about trying this movie. <br /> <br /> Around 4pm, I bought it, around 8pm, I started watching movies, around 8:15 pm, I quickly move the remaining film to see if there was anything left visible thing for a human being with a brain ... but there was none. Around 8:45 pm, I threw the DVD in the trash. And that's where this "movie" belongs. <br /> <br /> What has happened to British humor? The witty, witty, smart and clever humor you find in Yes, Minister, Blackadder, Vicar of Dibley, Fawlty Towers or The Fast Show? Black humor is so famous for Britain? I do not want to insult anyone, but I assume that even stupid kids would not find it funny. They deserve a smarter pleasure. And Rik Mayall, you can do better, so please, do it!
