"Wagons East" is widely known as the last film of John Candy, since he died on the set. That's what makes him so sad: not only that Candy had a fatal heart attack, but that it was on the set of such a shabby movie. Seriously, I do not know what they were thinking when they invented that piece of shit, but the movie has NO quality that redeems. It's like they're taking all the unused scripts for stupid westerns and mixing them together to film them. No wonder John Candy does not want to make the film; It may have been his contractual involvement that did it. <br /> <br /> Anyway, Candy has done a lot better than this throughout her career. To be sure, he had already finished Michael Moore's "Canadian Bacon", in which the United States declared war on Canada. Stick to that and you can say that Candy has put an honorable end to his career. As for Richard Lewis - who had already shared the limelight with Candy in Eugene Levy's absurd but hilarious "Once Upon a Crime" - he made up for this piece of shit by regularly participating in "Countdown with Keith Olbermann".
