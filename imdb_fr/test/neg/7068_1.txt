This film has no heart or soul; it's an attempt to create a cult film from the sales of other directors, better quality, mainly David Lynch and Tim Burton. Rifkin seems to think that if he overloads a kind of rotten visual style and fills the street with raw and garbage, he makes a statement. But it's not a statement about anything - except for the strident scream of the director "HEY LOOK AT ME! I AM AN ARTIST TOO." But he does not have the imagination of an artist, but just a good memory of things that have worked - like some of the actors trapped in that - for other directors. All this would be almost acceptable if this film was not a tedious and boring chore.
