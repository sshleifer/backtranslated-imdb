I got a discount copy of that. I had seen it several years ago. My only recent experience was that of the "Science Theater of Mystery", where it was perfectly falsified. You never really get a chance to get into these movies because of all the byplay. I like the beginnings of the horror movies of the fifties. They give us a pompous lecture on the defense systems near the Arctic. These were there to protect us from the planned Soviet invasion, but they should be useful, given the threat of very large insects. <br /> <br /> This one in particular flies. For whatever reason, despite its exoskeleton made from the material that grasshoppers are made of, they can still withstand air-to-air missiles and disable fighter planes. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it's more fun - first, the obligate deranged case that saw the thing steal, cooling its feet in a hospital (it learns one - see an insect as big as a house - keep your mouth shut). I wonder if the poor guy went home after finding the virus. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, it is a rather ordinary effort. It follows the usual efforts to find a way to deter the stubborn insect - and opens the door to other possibilities - the Russians next time. I always have a kick for these films and this one is usable.
