A horrible film, horrible, horrible. I saw the original when I was a child and it gave me nightmares in my adolescence. When I discovered that a remake was on the way, I moaned. WHY OH WHY re-make a good movie? Well, we can thank Dark Castle for fucking another classic horror movie. This time, they replaced a rather interesting story with gore characters, slower than slow, and inspired by yawning. Someone has already said that he was surprised that Paris Hilton could act. Uh, were you watching the movie? She plays a little tramp. It looks like character conversion for me. Half of the spectators really enjoyed his death! This explains why people see this movie. If that's your only reason, find a better one, because like a black hole, this thing will lose more of your life than you want. If I had been alone, I would have left 10 minutes to start this boring exhibition. This thing looks like a guide on making shitty movies for a fool: In South America, stupid but attractive leads, plentiful knives, abundant, lurking truck, I could go on. After watching this movie, I started to really enjoy Jeepers Creepers and I thought this movie was bad. Save yourself and avoid this crapfest at all costs.
