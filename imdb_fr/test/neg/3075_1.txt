Years ago, I caught a rather well done TV movie titled "Linda". It was manufactured in 1973 and starred Stella Stevens in the lead role of femme fatale. Imagine my surprise when, more than ten years later, I saw the same story unfold again on television late at night. However, it was this 1993 version, featuring Virginia Madsen. Do not get me wrong, I can handle remakes, even the most obscure ones. But this poorly written and poorly filmed retreading was a big disappointment for Madsen and co-star Richard Thomas. Unlike the original, the dialogue is clich√©, which makes me think "Why did they bother to rewrite it?" Secondly, the work of the camera is very heavy and the film stock is mediocre. Sometimes I remembered the student film competition at the beginning of Christopher Guest's "The Big Picture". Finally, the cast looks bored (Madsen) or suffering (Thomas). In fact, the only one who seems to really like the job is Ted McGinley. Of course, with his perfectly coiffed hair and his coiffed teeth, he stretches a lot of his previous work on "The Love Boat". In summary, to quote a criticism of Opus the Penguin in Bloom County: <br /> <br /> "This movie does for the movie what Jonestown did for Kool-Aid." Thomkat
