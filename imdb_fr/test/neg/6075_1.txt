About your terrible copying film Beethoven. As a professional musician, it is my duty to watch every film made about a composer. Beethoven is one of my favorite movies. When Hungarians and Americans meet, it is a terrible combination of empty emotions and worst tastes. You proved it in your terrible series movie. The only thing that carries the film is the music. Of course, you have not bothered to look any further than the good but to my taste the artificial performances of the Tackacs quartet, but OK I have to admit that the performances have at least one quality that contrasts with the movie you have made. It starts with the dying DEAF Beethoven who understands Anna perfectly, who just whispers. Beethoven's audience during the movie is getting better, but it must be due to something divine. Then there is the scene of semi-pornographic double conductivity "big closed eyes", which is totally impossible, with Anna and her nephew crying at the end (who also cries in deleted scenes with constant red eyes, my God what performance). And as the culmination of the Amadeus scam, Beethoven dictating the music to Anna, not in notes, but in total nonsense, which she understands perfectly but that no one, even trained professional musicians, would understand. Of course, your reaction will be that this negative answer is at least an answer, but I can assure you that Beethoven himself turns in his grave because of your worthless creation and with good reason. This tribute is a blasphemy and I am very sorry to have rented one of the worst films of my life, even if it is my favorite subject. Ed Harris and others, you can not understand Beethoven's greatness in your wildest dreams, and certainly not after a few executive and violin lessons. It's your problem with the Americans: you think you can understand everything, even when it takes a lifetime of hard work. Yes we can do it anyway! Remember that a good product is synonymous with hard work, talent, dedication and professionalism. All these creators of Copie Beethoven are missing. We see each other in kindergarten.
