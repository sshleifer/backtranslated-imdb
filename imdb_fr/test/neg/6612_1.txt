This movie is TRASH of the word go. First, he reports on a season that took place 16 years ago! We do not care? This film was about as deep as a bottle cap. This makes a complex person like Bob Knight a cartoon character. <br /> <br /> Swear words do not bother me, but I'm always amazed that ESPN aired a movie with more curses than a Kevin Smith movie. cable channel. The word F has been canceled at least 20 times before the first commercial break. <br /> <br /> This movie was terrible and anyone associated with this movie should be embarrassed. I note this on the same level as Jaws IV - Revenge and everyone wins ... Two movies that are in the Crapfest Hall of Fame.
