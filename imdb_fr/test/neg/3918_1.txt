I must admit that this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I thought that Dennis Hopper had a little more taste than to appear in this kind of yeeeecchh. If this is supposed to be funny, I have to look for a new sense of humor. If you are thinking of buying this movie, you'd better think again.
