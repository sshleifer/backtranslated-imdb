Dillon, Fishbourne, Reno should have teamed up for a much smarter effort, because it slips into category B and could have been done with unnamed actors and a much smaller budget, because anyway, 2 armored trucks and a wasted warehouse could not have rubbed too much. Since the writers did not manage to present a smart flight plan, they targeted the dramatic aspects of the situation, but they do not have much to exploit. Fishbourne and Reno bring nothing to this movie except the interest of the media, they are only expensive commercials. Dillon is OK, but it was a walk in the park. The choices of the main character, Ty Hackett, are not inspired and the finale, with the "reward", is quite childish. Loss of time, money, actors, etc.
