The criticism on the main page admits that the film is horrible but that you should forgive it because it is very violent. No, you should not. There are spoilers at the end of this review but how can I spoil this rotten film, I have no idea. Even if you're a fan of Alien / Pred, I'm waiting for the DVD. It's not worth renting $ 3.99, but you'll be much less likely to hate this movie if you pay less than $ 12 per person, plus theater dealerships. <br /> <br /> At the theater, I watched AVPr. There were exactly two laughs, a girl sitting next to me. Other than that there was total silence throughout. No ooohs, or "it was bad ass!", Nothing. Imagine that you are a patient on an operating table and have just received the anesthetic. Now you know how you feel at the theater after the opening AVPr scene. <br /> <br /> What was the budget allocated to this film? Like in War of the Worlds, MI 3 and other f / x-based movies, the director seems much more involved in what CGI people can propose than to develop characters or plot. Spielberg tried and failed several times, usually with Tom Cruise. Of course, movies are money, but should they? War of the Worlds and Minority Report had the budget to pay for a decent scenario, Tom Cruise and others, and SS himself, but they were always awful. I am sure that AVP wasted 90% of its budget in computer graphics and had no choice but to hire an actor who would say yes, even if the casting agent would have done better by going to the supermarket and by choosing actors at random. <br /> <br /> There is no tension created in any scene and we are never close to being surprised. Who cares who gets killed? We do not know any of them, we all know what happens when the aliens lil perform their body output, we all know that the blood is acidic. In Alien, Aliens, 3, Resurrection and even AVP, administrators use the fact that Aliens can think, can hide and can set traps. This director decided that Ridley Scott, James Cameron and others were idiots to develop characters that you really want to see live or get killed. In this article, you will never worry about who lives or dies, not a child, a parent, a pregnant woman. The characters serve only one purpose in this movie, to die. The opening scenes establish the fact that the film will be a predictable joke. Character development scenes combine clich√©s, bad mood, and bad acting, and numb the viewer to the point that we do not really care if they are killed as long as they die like never before. But they do not do it. The director tried to do something different from those that preceded him in the Alien franchise, but only managed to get rid of the good sides of the first movies, the human protagonists, and steal the rest from other recent science fiction movies. <br /> There is no original use of Alien or Pred characters. In fact, the Pred has little difficulty in killing dozens of Aliens, while the last film let us believe that Pred venerated them as a mortal enemy and that they used the slaughter of him as Rite of Passage. The AlienPred is never really developed as a fearsome creature. Hellboy, where Samiel's dismembered tongue has injected eggs into Hellboy or Doom, where mutated creatures would have left their tongue after stinging their victim's throat, has been taken from several movies. In simple terms, we have no reason to worry about anything in this movie. There is violence but it does not shock or surprise and nothing that has been seen in a hundred slasher movies. The CG is OK and both alien species are made to watch and move as in past movies. But as the characters are never developed and the acting is so bad, we hope in a way that they all die. The little girl was probably the best actor in the pack, but unfortunately we do not have to worry about whether children, women or other people are living or dying. We just want the movie to end. Eventually, this happens, but not before another stolen plot of Resident Evil 2 has the nuclear objective that Gunnison eliminates "infection". And not before another stupid scene that is supposed to open the door to other suites, but is it true? In a film filled with bad scenes, the worst could have been saved for the end. <br /> <br /> Sorry for the rehearsal but everything deserves to be repeated: bad script, no script, non-original action scenes, uninspired direction, abyssal game, decent f / x wasted because of the many defaults. <br /> <br /> I do not mind going to an independent film and being disappointed. Actors, directors and film crew probably start their careers on a tight budget. For a movie with this type of budget and hype, I feel disappointed and disappointed. This film is a painfully boring time loss from the opening scene to the closing credits. Sad to say that a preview of Hellboy 2 was the best part of AVPr and that HB2 did not even look so good.
