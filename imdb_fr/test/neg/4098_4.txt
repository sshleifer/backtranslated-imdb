Although I appreciate the work of Steve Carrell, Evan the Almighty, like many other gifted films, has been much worse than I had hoped. <br /> a genre that employs famous comedians to enhance their image, but ultimately fail to deliver. <br /> <br /> Carell's usual dorky humor is almost absent from the movie and although it makes me laugh a few times, there was nothing hilarious about him in Evan the Almighty . <br /> <br /> His 3 children, although probably important for a biblical character, were really useless in the film and terrible actors. Even his wife was a bit of a third step in such a simple scenario. <br /> <br /> Spending so much money on comedy was a big mistake. Although Carell's career benefits from this film, there is no reason to see it. <br /> <br /> If only his family was a little smaller, a little more than Carell, Molly Shannon and maybe another SNL cast, it could have been a lot more fun. <br /> <br /> 4/10 for some laughs here and there.
