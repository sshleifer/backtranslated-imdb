This is supposed to be based on Wilkie Collins '_The_Woman_In_White_, but the only similarity he had with this story was the characters' names, period, and settings. If they wanted to change the story so thoroughly, I do not understand why they had to continue pretending it was from Wilkie Collins. Go read the book. It's much better.
