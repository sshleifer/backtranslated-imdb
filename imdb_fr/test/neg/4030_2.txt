Oh my god, it does not get worse than that !!! I still like the stupid little sci-fi movies that are so stupid that they're funny and I thought it would be one of those, but it was so stupid that I found it absolutely deplorable that it would be ok to Take it out. What were these people thinking? These are obviously not real filmmakers and I really hope they found their schedule after realizing it was the best they could do! Special effects and special effects were not the same level as the more economical B-series films. And with men disguised as women, could not they find any woman who wants to appear in this shit story? No, probably not. <br /> <br /> I would give him a "0" if possible, it does not even deserve a "1" for dreadful. Do not waste your time (and especially not your money) on this horrible loser of a non-movie!
