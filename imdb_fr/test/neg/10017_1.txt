The New York family is the last in their neighborhood to have a television set, which almost ruins the wedding of David Niven with Mitzi Gaynor. Comedy bedroom that rarely ventures into the bedroom (and nothing sexy is happening anyway). Gaynor as an actress has about as much room as an oven - she lights up, she turns off. The only compensation for the film is a performance by Perky Patty Duke, before "Miracle Worker", as a daughter of Niven. She is delicious; "Happy birthday" is not. * from ****
