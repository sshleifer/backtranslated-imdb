A study in ADB. Wrong direction, misinterpretation, bad writing and f / x that will teach you that you had better upgrade your computer before shooting. This is the kind of movie you used to totally drink in your cellar with daddy's camera when you were young. But you certainly would not want to show it in public when you become sober again, do not you? YOU would not even want to see it. Avoid at all costs.
