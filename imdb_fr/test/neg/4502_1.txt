After being a fan of Godzilla for many years, Gamera was for me an inexpensive imitation to capitalize on the success of Toho's No. 1 star, kaiju. The attack of the monsters was for me at the time (1975) an almost painful visual experience. <br /> <br /> This past weekend, I attended the annual Godzilla festival, known as G-FEST, where Carl Craig, one of the stars of GAMERA Vs. VIRAS have appeared. Of course, they presented this film. It was one of the most hilarious bad movies ever made. Of course, you have to be in the right state of mind to look at it. In one scene, for example, scouts held captive aboard the alien spacecraft manage to escape distracting the not-too-bright aliens. When they realize they've been fooled, one of them says, "It's funny ... I think these kids lied to us." Even NINE OUTDOOR PLAN can not boast of this kind of dialogue. <br /> <br /> It may not be GODZILLA or even GAMERA 3, but it will make you lose enough time if you look at it in the right frame of mind. <br /> <br /> However, if you want top quality entertainment, check out the recently released GAMERA 3. <br /> <br /> Note: ** 1/2 on *****
