The trailer for this film promised a new twist in the zombie genre: place it in the old west. Except it's not the real old west, of course. It's a kind of west of the future, in a world where an apocalypse has, as we know, made many people and then turned them into zombies. It's still time for the zombie virus, and you know what that means? Get stung and become one of them. <br /> <br /> Then, in this dusty and dead world, comes a hero. It's a bounty hunter who gets paid to take care of the zombies. It is unclear who provides the funds, but it seems that a small cottage industry of the zombie hunt has emerged. But, as the trailer says, there is a problem. They are running out of zombies. The only way to keep making money is to infect the virus with the virus in new cities. <br /> <br /> I think it's not a bad idea for a movie. But unfortunately, it takes a lot more than a good idea and a crowd of people who paw at the windows to make a good movie of zombies. What we actually get is a clone of Clint Eastwood (even the actor's name is Clint, for shouting out loud) and his hilarious sidekick, trying to sack the zombies while dragging bad guys still alive to get a big reward. The entire subplot about infection in other cities is mentioned only temporarily, halfway through the film. Instead, there are many clichés of Western movies, makeup of poor zombies and bad actors. Really bad. The kind that would not even happen on Hollyoaks. The hero and the villain chomping cigars, jeers are thrown, people are stung. As the film draws to a close, the only thing that needs to be asked is whether the hero's cliche will be the only man alive, after killing the one he loves, or if the cliché of him is transforming in zombie in the final Cadre. (This is the first, by the way) This film was written and directed by Gerald Nott. This is the only thing he has done and hopefully it will be his last. At the beginning of the movie, a caption says "Nott Entertainment". At least they have a good thing.
