I agree with another viewer who wrote that this film recalls the quirky comedy Melanie Griffith / Jeff Daniels, "Something Wild", in which a rather eccentric free spirit unites with a very conservative and orderly young man, and both a couple and basically, his personality is gradually affecting him. He loses and learns to appreciate their short talk. That's exactly what happens here, except that you have to insert an eccentric, Alex (Rosanna Arquette) as Melanie Griffith and a super-cautious teenager, Lincoln (the name is not a coincidence, interpreted by Devon Gummersall), in the role of Jeff Daniel. This film even shares the same twist and the same abrupt genre change where the violent and terrifying boyfriend makes his appearance at the end and things end rather badly. Only here, instead of Ray Liotta making a comeback for moviegoers in the 1950s, it's Peter Greene. <br /> <br /> The story tells the story of a teenager who lives in his little world. He is fascinated by the death after the suicide of his brother and his parents also disconnected, behaving in a rather strange way (the mother is convinced that Christmas will arrive shortly, while it is the month of August) . Then, at an evening with the "dudes" (including Jason Hervey of The Wonder Years) trying to buy them beer, he falls on Alex who decides to kidnap him and his friend's car (with his permission sure). ), and they take off for a mini-adventure through the deserts of the west coast, stealing convenience stores from Robin Hood and, of course, indulging in self-discovery, each asking for more about life the other. But Alex left behind a partner in his flying business, and he does not leave easily. Although we do not systematically remind him of anything like a repetitive backtracking or a reduction of his point of view. At least that was done smartly. <br /> <br /> "Do me a favor" (aka Trading Favors), is an essentially underdeveloped story of criminal mischief and self-discovery that hangs out a bit during the first half of the film, but book the goods a little too late once Alex and Lincoln arrive home in the middle of nowhere. By the time the filmmakers give you enough stimulation, the film is unfortunately almost finished. I would recommend that if this is the kind of story you are in the mood to want, and despite the fact that Rosanna Arquette always gives a good performance (even in a poorly written film), I would still recommend taking it under his best form, "Something Wild."
