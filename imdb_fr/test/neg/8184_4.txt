I barely managed to see the whole movie ... The trip to Mars began about 85 minutes after the movie started, and then it was 5 minutes before closing. These 85 long minutes were VERY boring and did not bring anything to the movie. Finally arriving on Mars, it was not much better. All of this could have fit into a much shorter span and nothing would have been missed. <br /> <br /> What I can not understand is the piece of trivia that says that, because of the film, the newborns are called "Aelita". ... Why would someone want to name his baby after a villain who, despite having only one eyebrow, apparently has three breasts ??? <br /> <br /> The only interesting thing here is the scenes of Mars. This is an interesting experiment in constructivism, just as "Dr. Caligari's Cabinet" was for Expressionism, five years earlier. <br /> <br /> I give it 4/10 for its superb design ...
