If the rich are different from ours because they have more money, the filmmakers are also different because they think that the whole world cares about their respective thoughts. <br /> just because the director felt it was time to make another movie, and someone would fund it. Any trivial ideas or reflections are not worthy of a movie (unless you are a film student and try to take a course). When you have nothing to say, it is sometimes better to stay silent. <br /> <br /> The images are not breathtaking. They are pretty ordinary. The dialogue is insane and incredible. They speak with words that no one would want to follow in situations beyond the imagination. Germaine Greer's f ** k t-shirt is finally on the screen. Even if you believe in love at first sight, no one goes to bed as easily as these characters. They fuck before speaking. Even more incredible is an aging and bald director who finds instant sex with the most beautiful girl in the city, although the gravity already touches Miss Marceau at a young age.
