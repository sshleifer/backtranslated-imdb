It is a bit difficult to believe that this comes from the same director who gave us HELLRAISER. Where is the style, the presentiment and the charm? I mean, HELLRAISER is not a big horror movie, but at least there was something. NIGHTBREED is like a big ball of poorly executed bad ideas. From the beginning, there is a problem of subtlety: the monsters are shown in the first shot! The opening dream sequence shows too much for too long. Our hero has no professional talent as a comedian (but nobody expected this bastard). There are killings that we want more interesting. Then we have David Cronenberg. The man was never supposed to be an actor. He is a good psychiatrist, but what he should have done was to get behind the camera and save that disaster. We then arrive at Midian, a scary false graveyard with a false door too scary. This thing is not a huge improvement over the cemetery in PLAN 9 OUTSIDE. There is worse when we meet the creatures it contains. Here, there is really nothing wrong with the design of the characters and the effects of makeup (well ... except for the guy without scalp, the guy with the chin and the sharp forehead, and the fat guy with dark circles around the eyes), the problem is the way they act and the terrible dialogue given to them. Barker's photograph of the underground city is tired and this part of the story could have been improved. Some might call the following SPOILERS. After the death of our hero and his transformation into "night light", we wait to see how it will change (we are talking about flying things and werewolves), but when the time has come for it to change , they seemed to think that their hero was too handsome to give a decent creature design. With the "character" of Cronenberg, the story becomes less interesting until the battle of monsters against norms (which is simply bad). Barker's mythology has let him down here. There is no genius and little originality behind NIGHTBREED. The photo could have used a bigger budget, a serious scenario and a character design that did not let you say "oh ... oh, how lame." Such a waste. Not scary, not cool, not even very dark, just weak.
