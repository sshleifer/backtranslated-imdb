I'm a big fan of bad horrors, cheap horrors, movies and all the last 100 movies, and I do not deny that these are the worst things to get on the big screen, or even your personal video. Some of them, for example the infamous Manos, The Hands of Fate, are really bad, and watching them, especially alone, without friends or beer, is a torture for the good taste of cinema. <br /> <br /> The Momia Azteca against El Roboto Humano, however, was not so bad. Of course it's BAD - it's silly, old, old-fashioned, cheap, etc., there's an Aztec mummy, a tin robot, a masked villain, a mad scientist, Mexican gangsters, and so on. the editing is poor, the lines, Well, let's say that the lines are not theatrical, FX and SFX effects are the best that low-budget Mexican production could have offered, etc. etc. Nevertheless, the film is FUN. it's so bad that it makes you laugh happily for an hour. It depends on the sense of humor, but I'm almost convinced that La Momia should teach all newcomers in this kind of cinema to enjoy it. Note: The movie lasts about an hour and I think it's just enough stupid time that can be easily digested. <br /> <br /> Another thing: watching Momia can give you an idea of ​​the SF / Horror genre concept in the fifties, when you compare it to the current era of Matrix movie entertainment. I think it also shows how the industry and the public have evolved, because watches like La Momia still attract a lot of people in the theaters for certain specials (films like this are quite special) and very often receive a standing ovation. .
