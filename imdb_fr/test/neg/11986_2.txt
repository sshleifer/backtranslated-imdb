I really liked the game Far Cry, nice graphics, good level design, interesting and intelligent enemies, an above average length and even a decent plot. I am not by default against the fallout of games. I thought "DOOM The Movie" was hilarious. But what Uwe Boll did here is take the game and change each of its positive aspects to turn them into something horrible (well, not the length, the film only lasts 90 minutes) The characters are still more stereotyped than in the game, which is quite an achievement. The entire plot is told without twists or mystery. Several ridiculously ridiculous scenes tell you every part of the story. And go on "Genetically Modified Soldiers"? they could have found a better name. <br /> <br /> However, this film should be rewarded for the most idiotic love scene. I have never seen anything like it. I could not believe they were trying to be serious "we need to get out of wet clothes" "I think I'm going to hypothermia" (although everyone wears a t-shirt) "we have to cuddle to have body heat "Is this your weapon? "But ... but ... were not there people who consciously did that?" There must have been a screenwriter, director, actors, gaffer, electrician, food guy! has anyone jumped on this stage to prevent this harm from happening? Was this film shot by peevish, inhuman and genetically modified moviegoers? I will not start complaining about the number of Logic errors, inconsistencies and script writing errors, but even for the action enthusiast, this movie can only be insulting. <br /> <br /> This movie actually asked to be rated 2 out of 10, so I'm going to do it in favor, but that lets me explain where the second star comes in. Special effects Nah Acting Not really References to the game You want to wait They used the game's font for the title and the credits, it was great. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a movie for a bad night in the inema, opt for "2012 - Supernova", this one is simply sad.
