"The Evil That Men Do" begins with a really disgusting torture scene, followed later by graphic verbal descriptions of equally repulsive torture methods that the sadistic and heartless villain likes to use. But despite the use of such shock effects, filmmakers can not really conceal the fact that it is simply a dull and inferior vehicle. Bronson himself is solid here, but he should have chosen a better scenario.
