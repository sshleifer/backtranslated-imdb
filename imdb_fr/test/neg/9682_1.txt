This interpretation of "Noah's Ark" has restored Hallmark's (and Turner's) reputation for about 100 years. However, production has its bright side ... a learning experience for neophyte entrepreneurs in "how not to make a film" <br /> <br /> Where in the annals of biblical literature and common sense can -we find these quotes and situations: <br /> <br /> "Ok, boys, let's get on horseback." "It's too bad that God created the sun so it shines only during the day when we really needed it at night." "We do not kiss ... we only whisper in each other's mouths." <br /> <br /> Timber for the construction of the arch with the inscription "Georgia Pacific". Metal nails. Children flying kites. A peddler (how can James Coburn sleep after) selling Chinese hats? Pirates attack a wooden arch, which they want to capture, with burning tar balls fired by catapults. Bottles of glass wine (Noah was in a state of continual inebriation.) It was a miracle to be able to see the Ark, not to mention build it.) Lady Godiva (Mary Steenberg in a blonde wig that surrounds the Ark on a white horse ... always ranked G) Protect Bible Pirates with an iron pan (Teflon coated?). Landing on Mount Ararat after crossing the straight lines of Hercules. <br /> <br /> etc. etc. etc. etc. <br /> <br /> Special effects ... to see absolutely order not to believe them. <br /> <br /> The list is long. This film should not be missed; but if you want the full version of the television, you have to call NBC for the on-screen version ... but only if you agree to release NBC of any responsibility for having already broadcast the thing in the first place. Only the redacted version exists in video stores (no hackers, etc.) ... that is to say those video stores that dare to store it. <br /> <br /> Marvin Cohn <br /> <br />
