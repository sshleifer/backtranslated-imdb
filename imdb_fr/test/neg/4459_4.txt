Although I have somehow appreciated SATANIC RITES OF Dracula (1974), I knew that I should not expect too much from his even more decried predecessor! Certainly the least of the Draculas Hammer (Marcus Hearn in the audio commentary of THE CREEPING FLESH [1973] even goes so far as to call it the nadir of the studio!), The film really fails because of its total absence of dating - and now with an embarrassing date - an update of the myth (the modern decor is rather suited to satanic rites) ... even if, to tell the truth, it is always better to break like Dracula 2000 (2000) or VAN HELSING (2004)! <br /> <br /> Despite the vehement denigration of the film by Christopher Lee, he still makes a striking figure as the undead vampire (although he appears very little and is inexplicably limited to a single frame); Similarly, Peter Cushing delivers his usual and committed performance. The only other outstanding acting work in the film is that of Christopher Neame (son of director Ronald) as Johnny Alucard (!) - even if it's only because of the incredible hams! Unfortunately, the two best-known female members of the cast (Stephanie Beacham and Caroline Munro, both accustomed to horror) can not go beyond their physical attributes. <br /> <br /> The film is by Dick Bush (who shot THE BLOOD ON SATAN'S CLAW [1971] and, for Hammer, WHEN DINOSAURS REGLED THE EARTH [1970] and TWINS OF EVIL [1971] - but can - be better known for his longstanding association with Ken Russell), who manages good atmosphere throughout, especially during three crucial sequences: the fight in carriage at the beginning (properly gothic); the Black Mass hysterical sequence, followed by Dracula's resuscitation; and the final confrontation between Van Helsing of Lee and Cushing.
