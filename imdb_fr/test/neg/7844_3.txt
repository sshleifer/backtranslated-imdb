Burt Reynolds plays Gator McKlusky, a friendly former convict who has just been released from prison and helps the authorities catch a corrupt sheriff from a small town. The disgruntled often accused Reynolds, relaxed, of merely calling these "good old boys". true, he's on autopilot all the way through. But in his day, Reynolds knew how to make a quiet effort work for himself. Ingratiating and handsome, Reynolds is as close to winking to the public as he can without separating; he seems to know these repercussions like any movie star, while director Joesph Sargent provides a quiet rhythm and a sweaty atmosphere that brings the South to life. Unfortunately, the story is not very long, and the supporting actors, Ned Beatty and Bo Hopkins, outdo themselves (as usual). Diane Ladd is doing well in a small part, and her real daughter Laura Dern can be seen in the background. Reynolds returned to this character for "Gator" in 1976. * 1/2 of ****
