Okay, this movie starts and it looks like it will be a pretty comedy about a completely obsessed soap opera fan. She has no contact with reality outside the soap opera (a kind of reverse of the main characters of "Pleasantville") and fled to Los Angeles to meet a fictional character. Well, it's a cute movie ... but at the same time, it's also a dark and very violent film about two killers who want to kill Betty for reasons that are too complex to tell here. One or the other of the intrigues would have been enough on its own, but "Nurse Betty" contains both stories at once and the effect is very shocking. I did not like it very much.
