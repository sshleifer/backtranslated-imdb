"B" crime thriller of the early '50s, the story is funny, the wooden characters, Allison Hayes and Abbe Lane are the only two sexpots that make it an eye-catcher, but a short shot, only a few pictures long , shows a train "el" crossing the river on the State Street Bridge, Pullman 6000 series cars, painted in their 1950s original paint scheme, as they were delivered new in 1950. For traction fans like me taking makes the photo useful. I think movies like this one, DETOUR, D.O.A. of Ulmer with Edmund O'Brien, THE FUGITIVE with Harrison Ford, and others of the black genre, make things interesting, if nothing else than the fact that I know intimately Chicago and San Francisco and that I recognize most of the streets Places. Otherwise, it's a really boring movie!
