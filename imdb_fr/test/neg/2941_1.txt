I saw this movie in Blockbuster and thought it would be a good movie on Sunday night when there is nothing else to do. So I bought it used, 3 DVDs for $ 25. Although it was cheap, my money would have been better spent on a nail that would cross my foot. <br /> <br /> The film started well. A little dark and mysterious. As a child, I was always fascinated by movies about vampires and samurai. I thought the combo would be really cool. The first fight scene was pretty cool. I was excited for the rest of the movie. Then the film seriously plunged into the nose. <br /> <br /> I understand that this has been a great success in the east. I guess because of the twins. I do not see it though. This movie, aside from the first 10 minutes, was absolutely horrible. So many films like this have the potential to be great and wreak havoc. This is just another victim. <br /> <br /> The role of Jacki Chan in this film makes no sense. Pourquoiyyyyyyy? Complete stupidity. However, he probably earned a few dollars. <br /> <br /> The only interesting thing about this movie is the swords they use. Nice idea. <br /> <br /> I would not recommend this movie to anyone.
