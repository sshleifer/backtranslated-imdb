The film has strange and annoying characters, a strange inexplicable slap and an insurmountable amount of dialogues about smoking. The film presents an artificial plot in which a woman (Jeanne Tripplehorn) with a vicious head and an empty head seeks love. Although those who love Jeanne's character, personality or dialogue reading, I really can not say it. Except that she likes to smoke. <br /> <br /> Sarah Jessica Parker gives an interesting character interpretation (who likes to smoke). Dylan McDermott does his best to look pretty and soulful (when he smokes). And, hey, what is Jennifer Aniston doing there? Oh, she's not good enough for anyone to care about her. (But she likes to smoke). <br /> <br /> It's a waste of time for anyone. I do not even know how I was able to watch the movie as much as I did. I can not even believe that I spent the time writing this, except to warn others of its banality. Someone needs a cigarette?
