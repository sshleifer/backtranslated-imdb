The name of the DEA agent, Anslinger, is a great joke: it is the name of the former drug tsar who has almost single handedly made marijuana illegal. <br /> <br /> Despite this little knowledge of the book, writers continue that farmers harvest and sell fresh, unseasoned leaves rather than processed heads. <br /> <br /> In addition, I find it always fun that filmmakers never seem to be able to find real marijuana plants for filming. You might think that a company would produce real fake films for the film industry, or could perhaps shoot a few scenes in Amsterdam or Switzerland. I guess that's asking too much for the budget. <br /> <br /> The essence of the film is probably to try to understand exactly what is right and what is wrong in society and how the law line and tries to do justice despite it. <br /> <br />
