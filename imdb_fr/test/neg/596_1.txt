Evil Behind You was created for a specific purpose, to allow writers / directors to give their point of view on who should walk on water or dance with the devil. Unfortunately, it seems that the creators were so focused on their point of view that they took their power completely by forcing their point to the viewer. The way his message is presented almost reminds me of the stories I heard from the Spanish inquisition. ! From one true Christian to another, avoid this as the plague, the tactic of fear never works when you try to send that kind of message! <br /> <br /> The behavior was horrible, the selection of Muslim terrorists was racist and unfair (they are terrorists so they must be Muslim). The premise of this was good, the story provided an excellent channel for his message, but it was the execution of those ideas that was missing, making it very difficult even to separate the message from the messenger so to speak. <br /> <br /> You'd better dust off your old "Ghost" DVD with Mr. Swayze to better receive this message. at least, this movie did not try to sink into the throat. Or if you like good Christian movies with a powerful message, try "End of the Spear"
