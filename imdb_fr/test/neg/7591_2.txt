I saw this film at midnight and I can say it's worse than another horror movie about a haunted house. Alexandra Paul is not one of the best actresses but she can do the role better, The little girl gets worse Bad actress, she has no future in the great world of cinema. SENTENCE FOR THE HOUSE OF DAMNED: BAD
