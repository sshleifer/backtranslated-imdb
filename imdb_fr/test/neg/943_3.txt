Let me start by saying that there is really no reason to watch this movie. I only attended because I was trying to kill some time before going to work. <br /> <br /> Basically, it's your typical sophomoric "comedy" that targets adolescence. There is nothing remarkable about it except the total ridicule of the story, plus there are parcel holes big enough to navigate a Carnival cruise liner. Obviously, it's not supposed to be a realistic movie, it's supposed to be funny. Unfortunately, most of the time, that also fails. I must admit that I laughed a few times, but especially in a "sacred state", I can not believe how stupid it is "so. <br /> <br /> If you never see this movie, you do not miss anything.
