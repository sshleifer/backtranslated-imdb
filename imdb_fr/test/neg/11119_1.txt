I found this film very disappointing, especially when it comes to casting. The characters are not credible, as are the ridiculous circumstances in which they find themselves. The only part of the film I appreciated was when the most annoying characters were finally murdered. Special effects consist mainly of dead or dying body scenes. A typical slasher film without imagination. <br /> <br /> It is hard to believe that it is impossible to believe that a lone creature sneaking on goats in the middle of the night can be captured by a group of clumsy and noisy idiots. It is equally impossible to believe that the authors know exactly how to find it, even though the creature has escaped capture or even photography. <br /> <br /> The man who manages to capture Chupacabra alive is our one-dimensional Dr. Pena (Giancarlo Esposito). The only thing Dr. Pena is more obsessed with than the creature is his dart gun. A dart gun that works while simple bullets have failed. <br /> <br /> The ship's captain (John Rhys-Davies) is presented as a "veteran". He uses his military prowess by asking his men to shoot the creature, whatever their destination on the ship. Navy Seals appearing from nowhere repeat the shooting pattern at all. <br /> <br /> Dylan Neal plays an insurance investigator brought aboard the cruise ship to catch a thief. He spends most of the movie scoring with the one trying to kill the creature for now. <br /> <br /> The creature does not even look like a Chupacabra. He does not behave as such either. Instead of a shy, secretive little animal that sneaks out at night, we have a bulletproof Freddy Kruger, who kills everything in sight. A simple search on Google would have been very useful to the editors and the special effects team.
