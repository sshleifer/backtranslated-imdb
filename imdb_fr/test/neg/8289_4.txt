A high school track star dies of a blood clot after winning a race with the community following a tumult against coach George Michaels (Christopher George playing it like a big skull VERY demanding athletes under his supervision) . It will be canned after school, giving the film its motivation as a possible killer. A sweaty twisted psychopath (much the same as Michaels often wears), using a stopwatch to time his executions, murders the runway crew members whose dead runner was part of. Soon, disturbed parents call the principal Guglione (Michael Pataki) to ask him why their children did not come home after a promotion night. Inspector Halliday (Carmen Argenziano) begins to search the campus at the request of concerned parents. Instantly, a troubled Michaels becomes the prime suspect after discovering a gymnast's body in a locker. Teach Anne (Patch Mackenzie) returned home to Guam to receive her sister's diploma from the dead track and soon confronts the killer herself in the scene of fierce pursuit. Kevin Badger (E Danny Murphy) is the tired boyfriend of the star of the lost song. <br /> <br /> A pretty rhythmic slasher unfolds the sequences of death a little while trying to mix humor and failing miserably. Low-quality killing sequences only increase laughter, such as a sword embedded in a soccer ball thrown into the belly of a football player or a pair of garden shears used to decapitate a poor soul. running away. Linnea Quigley has a funny role as a horny student Dolores who sleeps with her music teacher for a higher grade and always pursues a male stud (the recipient of the garden shears before having the opportunity to sleep Dolores outside the prom). Vanna White first played a role here as a ditsy blonde who discovers the body of the dead gymnast in the locker. Virgil Frye has an idiotic role as an inept officer.
