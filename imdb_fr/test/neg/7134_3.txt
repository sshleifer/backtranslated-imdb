I liked the first The Grudge. It really scared me and there was something that made me want to see him twice. Something was missing from this sequel. There was no creativity, nothing new or original, nothing that really sticks to your mind. These are people who die because a scary ghost comes out of the shadows and says boo. And most of the time, it was not even that scary. <br /> <br /> Regarding the plot, this film is a stalemate. Amber Tamblyn is a good actress, but we did not give her anything to do, and Karen's death seemed really unsatisfactory because she arrived so quickly. I was also disappointed by the secondary plot of Kayako's mother. I thought she could provide a way to fight the grudge, but she dies in the hands - the hair? - Kayako. It was a stupid turn. Overall, it is difficult to feel characters that, to your knowledge, will die. All in the same way. And they can not do anything. It does not look like a cruel fate that awaits them. It's just boring, because you know what's going to happen. If they had something to fight, it would have added suspense, even if they had failed. If there was hope, it would make the fears more justified. Now, you just wait for them to die. <br /> <br /> Kayako was really scary in the first film, but this time, we saw it too often and it took away some of it. I was always afraid during certain scenes, but I got used to the huge eye and the blue face. The manufacturers obviously understood that this would happen by adding other scary ghosts. Yes, I was scared on the school psychologist scene - although I knew where it was as soon as she said "I went home". A nice touch. Toshio, however, was not scary at all in this movie. I was much more frightened by the non-blue Toshio with black eyes and an empty look that sometimes appeared in the first film. A blue boy sitting in a corner does nothing for me. <br /> <br /> Some characters seemed really useless - the famous milk scene with the girl I do not even remember the name comes to mind. I was not scared, it was just "huh?" I do not know if schoolgirls were really necessary. Karen could have brought the grudge to the United States with her. It could have killed people related to his life, everyone at the funeral, or something like that. Even then, it would have been boring to watch them all die, but being introduced to so many unrelated people was really annoying. I hated the scene "I will not call you mother". Aubrey's mother's problems were just as boring. The little boy, however, was a touching character. <br /> <br /> The sequel to Ju-On was a lot more scary than this one. There were new twists - dreams and reality fading, for example - and even if it left me feeling weak, I was happy too. I have to think a little and be left to wonder. This film only provided cheap breaks.
