I bought Jack-O a few months ago at a Blockbuster video sale and at the time I was not expecting anything exceptional. Looking at it, I realized that I did not get less than I could have hoped for, but much more. It sounds strange, I know. And it's. But that's quite appropriate if you consider that the strange strangeness that is "Jack-O" <br /> <br /> The film follows a boy named Shawn Kelly. In one way or another, through his ancestral ties, he is condemned to death by a manic pumpkin man of madness. This pumpkin man was killed by his great-grandfather, uncle, cousin, etc., and now that the villain has been resurrected, Shawn's death is apparently crucial to his mission of revenge. Anyway, a lot of "horror" ensues as Jack-O makes his way through various neighbors before beating Shawn to the finish. <br /> <br /> I'm not here so much to discuss the plot as I am to determine who can find value in this movie. Honestly, I can tell you that Jack-O is one of the least well-done films in history. The acting game is impassive (except when it should be), the scenario is apparently a 1st year group project and the production budget should not exceed $ 150. Some of the most ridiculous death scenes take place in this anti-thriller, and they are even more humorous than the director Steve Latshaw seems really serious in his film. <br /> And yet, I really enjoyed the movie. I can call it a terrible horror movie, yes. But I can also say that I had fun watching it with my friends and that I have watched it several times since that first fateful look. Many people (including some of my friends) will find this film intolerable and time consuming, and that's understandable. If you're like me and you like the ridiculously bad horror movies that are taken seriously, you'll find that Jack-O is an instant classic, which is also understandable. <br /> <br /> That's why it's so difficult to evaluate this film. If I evaluated Jack-O's quality as a movie, I would not give it to him. In fact, the studio owes me stars. However, if I think it's on the pleasure principle alone, I'll give it an 8 or a 9. I'll give it a 4, to be somewhere in the middle. I recommend everyone to go out, praise this and form their own conclusion.
