An excellent cast that does its best with a horrible storyline, inept direction and some of the worst scores I've ever heard. More TV movie of the week than serious dramas. Which is sad when you consider that the source material is very serious and very real. The filmmakers decided that instead of creating drama and character, it was better to show only the most graphic and violent elements and to hope that the audience would be shocked with sympathy and compassion. In my opinion, one of the most flagrant forms of cut and paste film fits.
