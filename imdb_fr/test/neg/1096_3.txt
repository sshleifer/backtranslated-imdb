... And the boy is sweet <br /> <br /> I saw him on the Bravo cable channel on a Saturday night and here in Britain, we often have those awful erotic films "Erotic" coming out late on evening on Bravo. This one follows a WEIRD SCIENCE type plot of a couple of college geeks who build a virtual reality headset that gives you sexual fantasies. <br /> <br /> When you saw one of these movies, you saw them all with a group of bimbos resembling advertisements for silicone implants. Come on, I've actually seen breasts in real life (I'm sure, others have them too) and they're shaking like here where they defy the laws of physics, if not gravity at least. Sex Scenes are those tedious stuff where a well-sanded geezer rubs against his co-star without dialogue or sound except for a few muzaks and when they reach their climax, it looks like they both have a bad constipation attack . The girls themselves are very pretty, especially Brandy Davis and Nikki Fritz, but they are wasted in this type of soft-hearted movies. <br /> <br /> And if it's fantastic, it's after I recommend the trilogy LORD OF THE RINGS
