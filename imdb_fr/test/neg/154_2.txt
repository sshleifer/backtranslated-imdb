Shakespeare would have been scandalized. The writers mutilated the amazing work of Shakespeare. Ariel is the only credible actor performance. African voodoo, the isolated swamp and the character of "Gator Man" make this film a parody of the true Tempest of Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> Do not lose sight of this movie.
