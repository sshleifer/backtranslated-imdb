Before I really split this movie, I just want to say that I loved it. <br /> <br /> First, how many times in the movie have the characters used the phrase "Are you right"? I counted well by the hundreds before giving up and seeing the film again. <br /> <br /> Secondly, what's up with these blue monkey stuff? OK, the Dansen family had very private lives and had a brown eye, a blue eye, but since when does this turn people into subterranean carnivorous zombie creatures? <br /> <br /> and finally, 'Old faithful here protect me' hahaha :)
