Well, I probably agree with all the bad comments about this movie, because honestly, I thought it was such a shit. I mean the actors did a dramatic job and the scenario was terrible. Although the special effects are not a little bad, I think they should have thought much louder than that. I want to say how Clara Bryant was successfully integrated in this film. She would do a lot better if she looked a little further and that's the same with Kristen darling, I mean that her character dies and she does not bother to try. to defend myself I mean that it must be a total joke. She should at least do much better than she would like to become a soldier or more a heroine or something of the kind of bravery. But the fact is that the actors have done a completely zero and soulless work, as well as the director and the author who made this film. they should have gone to film school to find better ideas and I hope everyone agrees with my methods because they probably think the same thing.
