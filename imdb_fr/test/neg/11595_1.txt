As a total geek with the lucky job of video store manager, I tend to watch all kinds of movies, from good to very, very bad. It was a movie with so many lines of corn-ball, CGI effects and predictable scenario intrigue that I ended up laughing well before turning it off after 30 to 40 minutes. The kind of movie "creature" has produced quite awful things in recent years (Godzilla 2000, anyone?), But this film makes me think that the creators did not even try. It may be worth looking for the potential to "make fun of me" (counting the shots!), But I could not, in all conscience, recommend this film to anyone.
