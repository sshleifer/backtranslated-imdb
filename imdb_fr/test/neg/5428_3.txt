Oh my God. Why does Nickelodeon have such a hard time producing a half-decent movie? I mean, this film could have been good, but it was: <br /> <br /> A. Too short B. Somewhat superficial, stereotyped and insulting to some C. Ultimately useless and VERY insulting. He has the stereotypes of nerds: stupid faces, glasses, never kissed, holidays with his mother, etc. Well, maybe the reason this guy never kissed a girl is because he's gay! Does this mean that all gays are nerds? And what's wrong with your mother's friends? <br /> <br /> The worst, by far, was the end. The whole drama of the movie revolved around Zoey, discovering that Chase loved him and blah blah blah, and then, when Chase finally decided to tell him, <br /> <br /> A. he did not tell him in person because, just when he was about to receive the usual distraction, he tried to send an SMS, but his digital assistant fell into a fountain and died before receiving the message. /> The End. <br /> <br /> HOW LAME IS THAT ????? I mean, why can not designers just change anything in the show? Many of us want these two people to meet. Why can not we see it? I mean, are the producers really so creative that they can not imagine new problems that come with changes in the series? So they have to stick to the same plot and the same outlines and make as many episodes as they can just use them? After a while, it becomes boring and frustrating. <br /> <br /> I WANT TO SEE SOME REAL ROMANCE HERE HERE, MAKE IT! <br /> <br /> Okay. I'm done with my speech.
