And now, for another point of view: I did not like. I have not finished actually. I know that "Unforgiven" is considered by some to be one of the greatest Westerns ever made. I know he is a star and was directed by Clint Eastwood, one of the icons of American cinema. I know he has won many Oscars. Yet, I did not like that. I do not like westerns, and it's clearly a matter of taste, but I do not admire Eastwood's acting. He is not and has never been an important man. He is neither Burt Lancaster, nor Paul Newman, nor John Wayne. In this one film alone, he is dominated by Richard Harris and Gene Hackman; they are both actors. No, Eastwood is a tall man, with a reedy voice, who usually plays the tough guys. Here he plays a hard-to-retire. When I see him on the screen, I see a man working on his acting. Then there is the western anti-Western plot. It is all too obvious that the intention is to inject contemporary values: respect for the role of women, blacks, natives and single parents; a lack of respect for violence and alcohol; the healthiness that accompanies marriage, including interracial marriage, and adorable grandchildren - in a century in which these values ​​have not necessarily been accepted, at least in this way. By promoting these values, the film appears as mannered, even preached. Then come the stereotypes of the film: prostitutes with a heart of gold, the child who can not shoot, the new city in the Wild West, the sage brush that shimmers on a summer afternoon with a musical accompaniment. major chords. Finally, there is the pace of Eastwood management. I gave up after an hour. Eastwood was still rolling north, arguing with Morgan Freeman and the kid who could not fire right, sixty minutes after the start of the plot caused by the slaughter of a prostitute. It was too slow. Someone had to find these non-binding elements. I'm afraid it's me.
