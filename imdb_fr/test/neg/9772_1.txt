I think the "Bone Snatcher" should target anyone who is associated with this movie. Looking at it will seem like one of the longest 90 minutes of your life. The plot is boring and stupid. No scene was horrible, even from afar. If you manage to support this beautiful work of art from the cinema to the end, you may be very disappointed or die of hysterical laughter. I bought this movie based on other reviews I read. I would love to have my money back. What skunker. If you are looking for a horror movie that will interest you, watch "U Turn". It may be based on a zany plot, but it is full of frightening scenes that keep you from jumping from start to finish.
