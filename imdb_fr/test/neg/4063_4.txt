I would have given this film a vote of a star if there had not been bursts of laughter. Some of the dialogues were so simple that they made you laugh! How could someone have talked like that? Not to mention the fact that the majors bodyguards (Antonio Sabato Jr.) flew a 747 like a pro and that the team of whiners Michael Pare was able to dig a trench filled with gasoline and blow up a huge rock very quickly . Has anyone noticed the lame homage to "Fantasy Island" with the guy saying "Boss, the plane !!" to Michael Pare, just as the 747 comes into view. <br /> <br /> Only the pretty girls and even the most cute pirates are to be saved. Not to mention that the main hijacker deserved to die from the lame death he made to be such a joker !! Imagine escaping to be tied up by a "crossbow". Hello. <br /> <br /> The poor pilot probably died on the plane while everyone ate steak and drank rum !! Just for fun, they should do a sequel to show us how they spend all night in the middle of a Category 3 hurricane on Neptune Atoll. Did I hear Michael Par√© calling it "the best honeymoon resort in the Pacific"? Now, that would make an interesting movie !!
