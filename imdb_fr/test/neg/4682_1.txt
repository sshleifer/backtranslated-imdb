As I write this user commentary, Tim Burton's interpretation of Sweeney Todd's story earns a lot of money at the box office and the film has even won two Oscar nominations if I'm not mistaken. I have not seen it yet, but I sincerely hope that Burton did not look for inspiration or stylish brands in Andy Milligan's good old Bloody Shirsty Butchers. Yes, even if the title clearly mentions the butchers, the main characters in the plot are a barber (the famous Sweeney Todd) and a baker. Together, they form a vile alliance where he kills customers in his store and transforms bodies into his famous London meat pies. In other words, a premise from Andy Milligan to his most typical, derivative, delusional and amateurish. I think the IMDb rating of this movie speaks for itself. Although the actual story is not really the worst I have ever seen, Milligan inexplicably attracts total ineptitude. The production is a gigantic waste, with an incoherent narrative structure, a really hideous photograph, a mediocre lighting, unhealthy staging and staging, a tension or a laughable atmosphere. More than half of the footage is purely quilted and the words do not describe how the film is BORING, even with a duration of only 80 minutes. Ed Wood, Ted V. Mikels and Bruno Mattei; you do not have to fear anyone other than Andy Milligan ?? fingers in the nose ?? the worst director of all time, but I do not think he cared. Maybe if you have a very high level of tolerance, "Bloodthirsty Butchers" is worth the trip.
