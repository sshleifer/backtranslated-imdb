Nickelodeon went down to the bathroom. They have kids who say things like "Oh my God!" and "We are screwed up" <br /> <br /> This show promotes hatred of people who are not beautiful or who are not among the crowd. Sexual promiscuity is said to be good, drooling girls on shirtless boys. Not to mention the overweight boy who takes off his shirt. The main characters prevent anyone from getting out of the ordinary. Carly's friend, Sam, who may be a lesbian, beats the bleak of all the people who cross her, which proves that it is good to be a b ** ch. This show has so much negativity that no one should watch it! I give him a 0 out of 10 !!!
