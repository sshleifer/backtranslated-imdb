Martin Lawrence could be considered a talented man, but those days are over. Runteldat shows a man who tries both to play the sympathy card and to assume his responsibilities as soon as he thinks it will benefit his ego. The sad truth is that at this point in his life his best days were behind him: his half-funny show was dead in the water after his co-star's departure and he's facing a career as a comedian and terrible action movies. . <br /> <br /> It seems that this concert film was not designed to give a new impetus to Lawrence's career after his humiliation, but rather to a childish attempt to purify the air by trying to save pathetically what was left of his life. and, in a way, to make something of which he can be proud, a decisive moment in which he has shown himself to have "won" his glory. Unfortunately, the concert is nothing more than a serious Martin, incoherent, who tries to make laugh, invokes pathos, then affirms that he does not care at all because he is hardcore. The sad truth is that this is the real embarrassment of the public for Lawrence: his way of speaking by invoking a sad and pitiful laugh makes you wish that he wears his underwear on stage, waved a pistol and the reproduce again. . There is no idea of ​​his performance. Like the childish title, Martin tries to make his last moment of truth his own and fails miserably. It would have been better to wait for E! True Hollywood Story instead of going on stage and pretending to be an idiot for the second time. <br /> <br /> The saddest thing about this concert film - or rather of his career praise - is that Martin do not think about it. What was this film supposed to prove? Unfortunately, his fame was ephemeral, he was a fist before the incident of underwear and now that he can get work only through Will Smith or a Pixar production. They might as well call this concert 'Tombstone' because that's what it is. Martin Lawrence just died on stage, and his career could have been interesting. Now? Just a pathetic secondary note in the story.
