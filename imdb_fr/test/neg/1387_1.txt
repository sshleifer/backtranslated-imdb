Did you find the title funny? Oh, did not you? Well, it's because you're stuck. Learn to laugh because if you do not laugh, you do not live. So, please, lower your criteria for what you think is funny to a mere child. Now, do you find that funny? Always not?! OK, it's because you're full of yourself and you're offended too easily. If you do not laugh, you do not live. And if you do not like me, send me a hate mail so that I can write another comment and indicate the number of hateful messages I receive and try to turn that into believing that I am a bad ass. Do you make fun of my hilarious title? Always not?!?! Ok, it's over! You are racist! You must laugh or you are racist. Why would not you want to laugh? Oh, it's not funny! No, that can not be why. I want it to be funny, so it's the case !! Laugh fucking !!!! Please!!! Deedeedee !! Durdurdur !! Please!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Ok, it's over. Where is my notebook and pen? Where is my Richard Pryor DVD? I have to write some jokes for my show. <br /> <br /> And ...... scene. Thanks thanks. <br /> <br /> This is essentially what you will get from Mencia for about 23 minutes. Please, do yourself a favor and change channels when this guy's show starts. Even basic cable channels have things 100 times better than that. I do not even say that because I hate it. I am for real. This show is like watching the grass grow. Not sure though, at least the grass does not steal jokes. I honestly try to earn YOUR time. I even tried to watch his show. I thought, maybe he's not that bad. But no, he is. I zone completely when I watched his show. I tried to collect myself during the commercial break and concentrate on the series, but I could not. I left, I think I was thinking of something more interesting, like redoing my bed, vacuuming or folding my socks. Before I knew it, the show was over. Yes, it's so serious. <br /> <br /> Here's my last thought: there are so many things you can do with 30 minutes plus watch this guy shout about nothing for half an hour. Do not watch a show that tries in vain to boast racism. I can support programs that try to ease the tension of race wars, but this kind of thing only reinforces racism rather than stopping it.
