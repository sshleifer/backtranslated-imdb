"De Dominee" is based on the life of a real Dutch gangster, Klaas Bruinsma! In the film, his name is Klaas Donkers! I have doubts that the events presented in the film have something to do with what really happened! But it does not really matter! Because it did not catch my attention! This movie bothered me shit! It lacks substance and style! The stuff could have been forgiven if the acting was good and the director was trying to do something original! Without substance, you must at least bring style or decent action! Do not we need to entertain ourselves? That would have helped if the director had seen more gangster movies! It is obvious that he did not do it! Otherwise, he would not have done that as he did! This film has been widely publicized because of a little scandal surrounding Klaas Bruinsma and a member of the Dutch royal family! This scandal has nothing to do with the movie! Without him, "De Dominee" would never have been a success! I am sure!
