I happened to see this movie on a Paris-Boston flight and it reminded me of the food on the plane: generic, tasteless and obscure. French cinema seems to have lost its feet these days and it is a good example of how a motley scenario can ruin brilliant actors. While some may find that the script is playful and in line with the precepts of European post-modernism, the whole project is more like a post-mortem on the death of the golden years and truly fabulous talents of the Euro-cinema. Bunuel is vaguely reminiscent here, but without charm or wit.
