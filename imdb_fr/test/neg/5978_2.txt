This film is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. This movie hangs around again and I almost put it out, but I gave it a shot. I was not expecting much, but I was expecting more than that. Good thing I work in a video store and saw it for free, because I would not spend a dime on this movie. I gave this movie a 2, only because I saw worse. If I were you, I would stay away from it.
