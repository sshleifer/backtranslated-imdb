Corny and some very bad actors but for a Golan-Globus movie about. I saw this movie in 1985 mostly because I loved sword and sorcery movies (what was I thinking?). Arnold plays a great lord who tries to destroy an old talisman before exploding the world. Brigitte Nielsen is the main character who was at the time the daughter of Sly and a very bad actress. Producers of movies like to interpret the genre Playboy women who can not play in low budget B movies. Brigitte pretends to be Sonya and Arnold for Wood Kalidor. Sandahl Bergman (who was in Conan's original film as Valeria) plays here the wicked Queen Gedren, an obvious side for his role in Conan. And then one of the most irritating child actors on screen (ernie reyes) as Prince Tarn, who should have been slapped and sent to bed. Some of the sword fights are not too bad, but the music is really bad. The special effects are cheap and look very 70s, like the explosion of the castle of the evil queen at the climax of the film. <br /> <br /> Overall, a very weak movie, but movie buffs may like his lifestyle.
