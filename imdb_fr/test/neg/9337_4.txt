Right now, I'm watching this movie on TV here in Tokyo. Beautiful landscape, beautiful sets of biblical proportions, beautiful costumes, beautiful color, beautiful Gina. Great culminating scene when God destroys Sheban's idol and much more with Millean's wrath at the moment Yul and Gina are about to consume their love. Yul does a pretty decent job delivering his lines, although he looks a lot like Yul delivering his lines as Ramses or Taras Bulba. George Sanders looks like George Sanders playing George Sanders. Given the limited range of roles she is invited to play in this role, Gina does a good job, although at the end of the film, she is completely converted into a docile girl and full of remorse and looks like this. that she could play in a biography of Mother. Teresa I guess lightning will do that to you, but it's almost amazing how quickly she's getting rid of her own beliefs about her new religion. Supporting players are mostly awful, lacking emotion and credible timing. The usual big battle scenes, which went for lascivious dances in 1959, and an orchestra resounding with many trumpet sounds behind a huge choir singing a lot of "Ah's," but none of them were worthy of Hollywood. The final sword fight between Brynner and Sanders is at a ridiculously low skill level for a high school game. The film is a big piece of candy for the eyes, but not much more.
