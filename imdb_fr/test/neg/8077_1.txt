This is the worst movie I have ever seen. The scenario is a joke, the effects are terrible, the cinematography does not match the tone of the film, the dialogue is cheesy, and the actors do a good job to mess up the rest. People simply do not act in real situations. My question is: who would pay for such shit? <br /> <br /> The film begins when miners fall into a mine shaft after a firefighter fails to save them. We then join bikers in a forest that stunt their bikes. A guy falls and breaks his leg or something. The firefighter arrives to help them. Meanwhile, someone lights a fire. Some more waterfalls on the bike. Blah blah blah. <br /> <br /> I lost my time. <br /> <br /> Do not watch this movie.
