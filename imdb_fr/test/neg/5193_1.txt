Although the film has a redemptive characteristic, namely some striking shots, eg. the shooting of the sheep hanging from the tree, the scene of the funeral procession on the raft or the scene of the boats leaving the village (which seemed to be influenced by the scene when the warships approach the fantastic "Fellini Satyricon") , were more photographic than cinematographic, and would have been better liked hanging on the wall of an art gallery than integrated into a painfully slow film that barely reaches 162 minutes and suffers from a terrible dialogue, an extremely poor development character, actor, uninspired symbolism and heavy stylization. This is the first movie I've seen of Angelopoulos and his reputation before it, I was expecting a lot better, but I can honestly say it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen seen, and I'm not going out. my way of looking at one of the other works of the director in the future. The four friends I went to see him agree.
