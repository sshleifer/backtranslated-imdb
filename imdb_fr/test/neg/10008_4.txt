The rich horse breeders of Buenos Aires have long been practicing a policy of non-exchange with the Manhattan Crawfords, but what happens when the Latin mustached son falls in love with a certain Crawford with shining eyes, hair blond and some movements on the dance floor? The musical 20th Century-Fox has a brilliant veneer but seems a little faded around the edges. It's very heavy on frenetic dance, like gymnastics, extremely thin on the story. Betty Grable (a replacement of Alice Faye at the eleventh hour) gives her a boost, even if she is paired with Don Ameche lead (with tanned makeup and smooth hair). As well: Charlotte Greenwood as Betty's accursed aunt, a limousine driver who is constantly sleeping at work, and Carmen Miranda is playing herself (who else?). Argentina's archival plans far outweigh the action filmed on the Fox's backlot, and some of the side performances are rather dreadful. At the time of the grand finale of horse racing, most viewers will have enough. * 1/2 of ****
