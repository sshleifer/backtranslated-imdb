A supposed stupid teen comedy that revolves around a serious misunderstanding, including (but not limited to) confusing a prostitute with a foreign student, a battered girlfriend, a girl loving a gay man and the straight guy who love him and talkative gossip. None of the following is funny or even fun. Nation Lampoon used to be hilarious at the time. Now the name is unfortunately synonymous with shit. And this one is no exception. I used to think that Topenga was a bit cute when she was on "Boy Meets World", but it seems like she let herself go (and yes I know she has a name, but in her does all that is worth, she will remain as Topenga) <br /> <br /> My note: D <br /> <br /> Sweets for the eyes: Kati Lohmann becomes topless; Boti Bliss relies on a double body (BOOOOO !!!)
