by Dane Youssef <br /> <br /> I was a little eager to see this one. I really appreciate Eddie Murphy and I love the moment when a star makes a car for himself or when someone who writes decides to make his debut as a director. But when the star's head becomes too big for the rest of his body, there is always a risk of producing Hollywood vanities with big budget. <br /> <br /> Will the filmmaker stay real? Or will he just waste money (the studio's, ours) and time (studio, ours, and his own) patting his back for an hour and a half? Unfortunately, this is the last case here. <br /> <br /> Another thing that I really like is when someone breathes a new and fresh life into an exhausted and dry kind. None of this here. The movies of discotheques at war have become so worn that even parodies are dreary and deadly. <br /> <br /> Murphy does neither one nor the other. It is the most cliché: it connects to a conventional gangster routine image and plays it as seriously as if it were "The Godfather". It's like a script where the next project they put jokes and new ideas. But it looks like someone with influence has looked at her and said, "No, that's fine." Probably Murphy. He is credited everywhere. In the foreground, composed of beautiful sheets of white satin, his name appears about five times in the credits. <br /> <br /> The plot: a young orphan saves the life of Pryor and Pryor adopts the small ragamuffin. <br /> <br /> 20 years later, the Pryor dump has become a first class hotspot. They take a lot of money and a gangster wants them to act. He even has a dirty cop at his job. But Pryor proposes a scheme, at "THE STING". <br /> <br /> Murphy's scenario behaves like an unfinished first draft that nobody could recall. The actors are not really allowed to stand out much, if at all. Even the all-powerful Murphy seems to be on autopilot. <br /> <br /> Pryor is as rigorous and kind as Sugar Ray (perhaps it would have been better to name his character BROWN Sugar Ray? further proof that he needed a varnish), but everyone here is just vacation. <br /> <br /> The Oscar nominations that the film has received are well deserved (Joe I. Tompkins's best costume), but the values ​​of the production are the only element that gives the 1930s an impression of authenticity . <br /> <br /> Some decors seem a bit fake, but it's supposed to be a kind of comedy. It's rare for a film to be nominated for a Razzie and Oscar (unless it's one of Lucas' new "Star Wars" chapters). <br /> <br /> We are in 1938 and everyone is talking like in 1988, especially comedians. This is the formula of a prehistoric white man. And with all these comic and black satirists, you expect them to fit the genre or at least give it a new life. Nope. Murphy is about to walk around here. <br /> <br /> The great Roger Ebert summed up the situation when he commented in his report: "Murphy's story is more like a costume party in which everyone has the chance to grope. through a plot that has not been fresh since at least 1938. "<br /> <br /> Jasmine Guy is perfectly cast and seems to indulge in his role. Michael Lerner has all the looks, the evil and the boss manners of the prototypical crowd. And there are times when Pryor gives you an idea of ​​what a more interesting leader and authority figure would look like. It gives each scene a sense of dignity. <br /> <br /> Would it have been too much to ask Della Resse to sing? Or at least, stop bothering about all his "Kiss My Ass?" <br /> <br /> And the late Redd Foxx will not leave a lot of swan songs here. He had exchanges with Resse, which could have been a great thing. Nope. Murphy loses once again the opportunity here. <br /> <br /> The fast Murphy is charismatic and friendly. But these moments are rare. Murphy has never been so beautiful and has never been so dull. His character made me laugh twice throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> Stan Shaw's boxer, with a horrible speech disorder, is not only painful and embarrassing, it's boring. Comedy is not limited to showing something unpleasant. You have to incorporate some kind of light touch and a fun situation. Watching him struggle even the easiest words, we're sorry for him and bored by Murphy. <br /> <br /> Can Murphy write a screenplay? Well?? there was "Raw", but it was really stand-up material. He wrote outlines for "Boomerang" and "Coming to America" ​​for sure. But she did not have the last word there. Maybe a team of emergency-like scenario doctors could have revived this one. <br /> <br /> Murphy's direction is so slow and so quiet that you'd swear he's sometimes drowsy at the wheel. He has too many static shots and does not seem to know how to build and release the suspense. At one level, I think Quick is the real Eddie Murphy. Angry, young, piquant and ambitious. But from time to time charming. Now, if he was only funny at one point. <br /> <br /> There is a scene in which Murphy has a fairy tale in bed that plans to make love to him and kill him. You can probably guess what's going on. Like all the rest of the movie, it could have been better, but ?? <br /> <br /> "Surprisingly", Murphy has not made a movie since (he was nominated for Razzie). And he no longer writes the final draft of his films either (he WON the Razzie for writing that!) <br /> <br /> It's great to watch and the music is beautiful, and there's some really cool scenes. But this simply falls into the category of "jewels among all scrap". Not enough of them. <br /> <br /> Could have been. Should be. Was not. Oh good. <br /> <br /> by Dane Youssef
