I watched this movie after seeing the original "Spoorloos" several times, in anticipation of the scary end. <br /> <br /> I can not even begin to explain the anger and disappointment I experienced when the end came and went, and the film continued to have a happy ending. What a waste of time was watching this American remake ... <br /> <br /> If you have a choice, please ignore "The Vanishing" and watch the original Dutch "Spoorloos". The suspense is very well built. You feel Rex's frustration, looking for any trace of what might have happened to his girlfriend Saskia, after entering a gas station and never returning to his car. The search takes him three years and when he finally contacts the person who knows the truth about what happened to Saskia, he must agree to undergo the same thing as that suffered by Saskia. The end leaves you speechless in your chair ....
