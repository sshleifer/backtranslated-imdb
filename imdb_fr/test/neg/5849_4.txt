This film was very well written in the new Blockbusters attraction. I was looking forward to the release date, 08/07/02. The plot seems reasonable, the cast alone should have guaranteed a side splitter, but whoa there; This aside from the sports betting events "off the wall". <br /> <br /> This will never become a comedy classic, and I'm afraid it did not help John Cleese's good comedy reputation. . Rowan Atkinson, now he was quite funny, in a kind of Rowan Atkinson!
