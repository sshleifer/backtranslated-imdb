It's the voice of a person who just watched the second season of Rome almost at once and seized the opportunity to see "what happened next" - this film takes off where it ends Rome. If you find that Rome is an abomination, a feast with a bad mouth, you will appreciate Imperium: Augustus. But if you think that Rome is a good thing, if you like complex intrigues, the atmosphere of decadence and the work of the actors, then Imperium will obviously appear to you as an extremely timid soap opera, superfluous and tedious, with few redeemers. factors. <br /> <br /> There are actors who, for my taste, are a little better than those in Rome. I particularly hated the image of Rome that Cleopatra was a drug addict. There must have been a lot of strength and dignity in this woman, and the Imperium actress is much better suited. O'Toole and Rampling are good, as are others. But then ... If you know - and love - Atia as a super cool bitch, you'll find her portrayal in Imperium - a stung mother wanking in an apron - absolutely ridiculous. There would be bitchy characters in Imperium, but these actresses rely heavily on men and nothing more. You will not find any interesting female characters in this epic. There is also the painful comedian Maecenas, whom we see as a screaming drag-queen, although there is little historical evidence that he was (he was once dubbed "being effeminate in his pleasures" in the annals). br /> The interiors are rather meager and rely on clichés on clichés. Cleopatra's great room looks like a computer game or a children's playroom in an Egyptian theme park. There is a profusion of very bad 3D graphics, not conforming to the norms of 2003. <br /> <br /> The action takes the form of a series of flashbacks revisited by the old Augustus. So we have a quick overview of some historical events, some of which are well presented, others not. One loses a disproportionate time to show Livia the "eternal flame" of Augustus. This case does not sizzle even for a moment, the dialogue is superlame and everything is seasoned with a music score inducing tears. No matter how much reality the show seeks to capture, each dubbing is destroyed by dry-synchronized dubbing (most actors do not speak English). <br /> <br /> Everything is lukewarm in this epic. True, there is more historical accuracy than in Rome, but dramatically, it's boring. The characters lack depth and clarity of dialogue. The work of the camera is often reduced to static shots and the lighting offers nothing that could please your eyes. <br /> <br /> There is really no one to love or hate Imperius. Whether you like Rome or not, there are much better movies and miniseries. Ancient Rome: The rise and fall of an empire would be something I recommend.
