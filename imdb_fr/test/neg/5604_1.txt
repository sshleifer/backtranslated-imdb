What production, what a waste of screen time and money. Here's what some so-called European producers think of a scifi movie. Take the old model, Alexandra Kamp, associate her with a class C American actor and get one of the most notorious movie producers, Harry A. Towers. Towers then finds an obscure prod based on munich. house, tandem communication, Rola Bauer, and mix it all without any script and you'll get "Sumuru" - an invaluable jewel among the worst movies ever made! Get people live and do something else, no matter what you do, no movies please !! To top it off, the producers went to South Africa for filming. What you see on the screen is a giant sand hole, where "action" takes place, between extremely bad actors and extremely bad effects that any film student would do better.
