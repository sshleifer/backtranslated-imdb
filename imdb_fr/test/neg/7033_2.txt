It was a horribly bad movie! Ashley Rose Orr was awful, she did not have the charm of Shirley Temple at all! Those horrible smiles she would make when she was frowning at her little pork eyes in a way that, I think, was "supposed" to be cute and compel the public to surrender - "aahhh bless!" It made me want to slap her. She had to simper "Oh my God!" about a hundred times throughout the movie. Besides, she could barely pronounce a sentence without accompanying him with a false laugh. Horrible horrible movie .. If I could rate minus 10, I would do it. Do not waste your money on this garbage, go out and buy a real Shirley Temple movie!
