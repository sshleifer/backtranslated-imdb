This is the sad story of the self-absorbed affair between two inimitable people, one of whom is married to another. It's high on my list of the most boring movies of all time, and I'm an unscrupulous romantic. My husband retired after the first hour of his three hours, at which time little had passed. The desert landscape is spectacular, with the endless sand and the sun on Katharine's golden hair. However, cinematography is not a brilliant film, unless it is a National Geographic travel diary. The beautiful Saharawi landscape of this poorly designed tale is like a smell of perfume on a pig. <br /> <br /> The film revolves around a broken and dying pilot, Count Laszlo de Almasy, left in the care of a Canadian. Army nurse, Hana, during the Second World War in Italy. He seems to remember little of his life, but through a book in his possession, his story is VERY SLOWLY revealed, with the help of a man from his past named Caravaggio, who mysteriously appears on his deathbed. Almasy was a Hungarian cartographer employed by the Royal Geographical Society to map the Sahara Desert. He had an affair with the wife, Katherine, of another explorer who turned out to be a British spy. Meanwhile, in the present, the Laszlo nurse has his own business with a sikh nicknamed Kip, involved in the dangerous work of disarming the mines. <br /> <br /> My arguments with this film are numerous, tedious and tedious. I do not blame the acting game in particular, it's just not a good story. Caravaggio seems useless, his connection with Almasy is summary. It provides a scene of torture but does not seem to have any essential purpose in the film. <br /> <br /> The essential problem is that the two parties to this affair, Almasy and Katharine, are terribly unfriendly, superficial and monotonous. They are just not very nice, so there is no one to encourage. Almasy is cool, distant, haughty and possibly possessive in a disgusting way compared to another man's wife. Katharine is also detached and nasty, not to mention the deplorable lack of guilt or feeling for her imperfect but loving husband ... except for managing a tiny tear at the corner of his eye when he dies. <br /> <br /> It's a LUST tale rather than love, with pearls like "I can still taste you". Almasy ridiculously expresses to a colleague her erotic obsession with the indentation in the neck of her beloved, which is undoubtedly more revealing of a focus on Katharine's body. The victim of this unrepentant adultery is Geoffrey, her unfortunate husband, who is treated as a mere nuisance. It's utterly sordid and disgusting, Katharine's charade to feel weak so that these lovers can indulge in their vaunted, wild passion, all while Silent Night is sung in the background. I do not know if the intention was to contrast the purity of the singer with his selfish lust, but I was really not impressed by the sacrilegious tone. We have face nudity with Katharine, but their sexual scenes are cold, selfish, lustful and sometimes downright hateful ... not hot, loving, generous or even passionate. If one or the other feels an emotion for the other, it is a totally selfish attitude and certainly NOT love, in the sense that I defined the word. <br /> <br /> The return of Almasy to the swimmers' cave to recover the body of his beloved appears as artificial rather than moving. Katharine must have expired a few moments earlier because she shows an excellent color and seems barely dozing, not at all a corpse. Of course, all this has a dramatic effect, because the romantics who look at this story (normally I would be one of them) would not appreciate a rotting putrid corpse. In order to recover the body of his adulterous lover, he betrayed his comrades and the Allies by giving his cards to the Nazis, the English being considered the villains of the play. Whether he respects his last promise to Katharine or not, his act of betrayal is not something I admire much. <br /> <br /> Kip seems to be a nice man and Hana generally friendly, but their love affair is by no means appealing, it's just a brief wartime adventure, with the parties showing little trauma during the separation. Coming back and forth between the two contexts (past the Sahara desert and present-day Italy) proved troublesome and unpleasant, but in reality both stories were as boring as lava water. The disarming scene at Kip's mines was the only spark of interest. <br /> <br /> Not being totally heartless, I had sympathy for the critically burned and dying state of Almasy. However, my main complaint with this film is perhaps euthanasia in the end, when Hana forces her patient into giving her an overdose of morphine. We are supposed to feel that this is justified and morally acceptable because she obviously cares for Almasy, cries while she prepares the deadly syringe and reads aloud her supposedly passionate book of Herodotus to comfort him while 'he is dying. <br /> <br /> Do not insult the masterpieces of director David Lean to compare them to this pathetic and immoral tale. Yes, Lawrence of Arabia also has a desert, but in the Lean films (Doctor Zhivago, Brief Encounter), those who embark on business are sympathetic characters displaying admirable restraint, guilt and a certain respect for the betrayed wife, as opposed to the total absorption of this pair. In Ryan's Daughter, the cuckold husband displays a touching loyalty and forgiveness. <br /> <br /> This film is a so-called intellectual, extremely disproportionate and disgusting, which unfortunately presents itself as a great love story. His best Oscar film does not speak well for the Academy. For those who wonder why people are so tough with this film, the answer is simple. It's horrible.
