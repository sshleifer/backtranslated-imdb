This movie was absolutely one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The plot could have worked if the movie had been better written. The acting game was among the worst I've ever seen. I was very slow and made me want to leave / turn off the movie several times. I watched the whole movie in the hope that the end was worth it, but that's not the case. I think this movie should be noted in the negative numbers. (In my humble opinion)
