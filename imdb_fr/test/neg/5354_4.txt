A Time To Kill is based on John Grisham's first novel, the one he wrote before his celebrity and the one that did not propel him to fame. (This would be accomplished by "The Firm"). That's why this film was shot until much later, after Grisham released meaningless books with the signs of the film in mind. Unlike most of them, this book was about something. He had meat, he had weight and he had a heart. <br /> <br /> But he also had a fatal flaw, and this fatal flaw is translated into the film. "A time to kill" prepares you. <br /> <br /> Here we have a black man (Jackson) on trial for the murder of two white men who raped and tortured his 10-year-old son. girl. We have an outsider lawyer (McConaughey) who is fighting the big system to save his client. And, by the way, all this is against the backdrop of racism in Mississippi, with hooded KKK men burning crosses. <br /> <br /> In other words, we are supposed to sympathize with Carl Lee Hailey. . We are supposed to believe that a father who loves his daughter is entitled to kill the men who raped her. We are supposed to feel the injustice of a system whereby a jury made up entirely of whites and racists could judge a black man trying to avenge a brutal crime. We are supposed to have the feeling of being at the side of people chanting "Free Carl Lee". <br /> <br /> But the problem of racism is a smoke screen and everything is artificial. Carl Lee Hailey was a vigilante. Yes, there were extenuating circumstances for what he did, but the fact remains that he was not innocent. That would have been true regardless of his skin color, or that of the assailants of his daughter, the judge, the jury or anyone else. <br /> <br /> And how is the film so hard? he paints anyone who believes that Carl Lee should have been convicted is a racist. The message seems to be that if you believe that the law should not be in the hands of people, you might as well be burning crosses on a lawn with a hood. <br /> <br /> This is not The first time, a strong dose of sentimentalism is inserted into a story like this, and it will not be the last. As a movie, A Time To Kill stays true to the book and the acting is not bad. But he played the hand, he had been treated, really. Even a good cast can not raise the bad source material.
