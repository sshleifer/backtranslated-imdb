I felt like I was looking at an example of how not to make a film. I think the director has filmed it in his backyard! There was no real plot. <br /> <br /> Terrible script. <br /> <br /> Terrible actor. <br /> <br /> The worst production I attended. Some bad CG effects, then the rest of the movies were spent walking around in what looked like a scrap yard. <br /> <br /> Normally, I do not write film reviews, but I was moved to warn everyone about it. One. <br /> <br /> Life is too short to waste your time with this movie!
