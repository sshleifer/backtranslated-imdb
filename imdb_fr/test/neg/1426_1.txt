Just see What way to the front? on TCM (UK), it's a really awful movie. If I had paid the photos, I would be out. <br /> <br /> A terrible mess of film. Byers (Lewis) and his comrades are prancing in the uniform of a 1960s Italian science-fiction film. Should the insignia of the CND / Peace symbol on uniforms be ironic? The sets were pure in 1970, I think a Hollywood TV record could have provided a more realistic setting. <br /> <br /> The film is full of racism. The film removes the mickey from veterans. <br /> <br /> It's not funny to see how Lewis managed to make another film beyond me.
