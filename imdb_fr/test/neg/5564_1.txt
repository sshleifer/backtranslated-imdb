I hate this movie !!!!!! I have never seen such waste in my life !!! I live in France, so it appeared that I was on the front line to watch this horrible film. At first, it seemed cool, a bit like a cursed forest that cheats people. Unfortunately, it turned out to be something very different: a good start with a girl meeting a guy and all the rest, then the girl receives threatening messages in the form of crows locked in her closet (ridiculous ), and then, the film begins to slide very quickly with many desperate blows in the process. The film ends with a profusion of druids and ugly, stinking creatures that come back from the past to kill some people. At that moment, there were many questions around my head: why on earth did they bring back this disgusting monster? Do druids look like maniacs dressed in sheets? Why did they even bother to make this film? The "climax" of the movie was so crazy that I laughed: the "terrible" stinky monster is fighting against the two young women (who seem to be expert kung fu masters) and the teacher is cut in half or something like that. What surprised me was that the monster was so slow and clumsy in battle, was not he supposed to be a war god or something? Anyway, the film in its mortal blows was a pitiful sight. A brief summary of the content of this film: Kung Fu Mayhem + Druid Stones + Mysterious Murders "Thriller" + Ancient Prophecies + Shabby Ravens + Old Clumsy and Boned War God + Professor of Hazelnut = Complete, Complete, Ill, Boneless , eaten worm, GODFORSAKEN, GODDAM, RECYCLED, FALSE, WANNABE, LUDICROUS SH * T !!!!!!!!! What I learned from this movie: - The ancient gods of war are ugly to kung fu. -All young women studying archeology at the university in France are experts in kung fu. - The teachers are so resistant that they can survive without being injured by cutting in half by a sawtooth.
