My wife and I watched this after the release of the DVR Encore action this week. It must be the worst horror movie we have ever seen. Predictable dialogue (my wife and I guessed the lines before they were spoken), special effects hokey, a scenario that slipped in every direction. I think the part that was the most annoying was the stereotyping of the different characters in the plot, not to mention the free sex scene between two of the young heroines of the film, who had no real purpose if not to put in naked parts. of their anatomy for the cameras. This film should be classified as a comedy and not a horror because the villains of the movie (spiders) were animated in stop motion and not very credible. I can not say I would have done a better job of making a film myself, but it was very amateurish and was not even a movie "B", somewhere closer to a movie "d" , or "f" if it is possible. I think even Science Fiction 3000 should pass on this one!
