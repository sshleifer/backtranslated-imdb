I can not believe that this terrible movie was directed by the same people who directed Lepa Sela Lepo Gore. Look at that and skip it. The plot is confusing and the characters are mainly two-dimensional stereotypes. I suspect the editor is going on vacation halfway through the film because fast, unstable cuts are starting to appear that are only confusing things instead of elucidating them. The end does not make sense either. <br /> <br /> This is mainly a propaganda film designed for the Serbs to feel sorry for and vilify America from NATO bombing in 1999. They do so by perpetuating lies according to which the Serbs our allies during the Second World War, claiming that the whole world was unfairly against them and completely ignored everything Slobodan Milosevic said and did, as a war against three neighboring countries. They seem to want to make a political film but show only a few seconds of Milosevic on a television screen without sound. A nationalist agenda obviously supplanted any consideration of art that was not the case of Lepa Sela. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I recommended this film to a teacher when he played last week at the Seattle International Film Festival. He also cited the bad editing and the confusing plot, and I had to apologize for the bad advice. You have been warned.
