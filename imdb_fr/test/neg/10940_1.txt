My friend and I rented this movie and in the first 5 minutes we had no idea what was going on. It seemed like it should have been done in the first 15 minutes. It was a terrible movie, my little brother could have been a better actor than some of those in the movie, and the plot (if you can call it that) was full of holes. I would never recommend this film to my worst enemy, but to everyone I really love.
