I could not believe how terrible and annoying this Hollywood remake was. It's so awful. This is easily part of my top 10 of the worst movies of 1998. Just about all, Bruce Willis, who should stick to action movies, is a killer without any emotion that would kill his own mother at the right price. But I would rather listen to Robbie Coltraine speak American for a week rather than listen to Richard Gere's nauseating Irish accent. back to the quarry possible. One for fully filmroll-footie purposes.
