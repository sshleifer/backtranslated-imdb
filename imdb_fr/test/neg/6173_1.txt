Really appalling waste of space. My friend and I tried to watch this movie until it was done, but we had to turn it off about 30 minutes from the end. And I can count the movies that I turned off before the end of one part. <br /> <br /> The scenario and the realization are heavy and deeply without interest. I would not be surprised if they found the script in a pile of postponed scripts dating from 1983. For example, the irritating throat that threatens the real estate man from his home phone. I mean seriously. The police would knock on his door in a few minutes. Scenes and events just wash you like dung in a river. It's hard to understand the real thrust of the movie. The narration slips between the characters in a seemingly random way, interrupting the pathetic attempts to build the characters. Oh and what "characters" they are. The protagonist played by Rourke is terrible. He could have just sent a cardboard cut into his skin and stay in bed. After sixty minutes of the film, I had absolutely no attachment to this character. He is neither friendly nor hateful. Just a mannequin disfigured in a window that runs through each scene. His motivation is impossible to discern from his generally emotional and emotionless speech. Is he happy? Is he sad? Angry? No idea. Just those same dead eyes that fix you from a disfigured piece of flesh. And the Native American theme is simply awful and useless. <br /> <br /> The good guys are at best inimitable. A dull white-collar stereotype and a stereotype of nostalgia for an ex-wife. Cue archetypal woman with shotgun facing a villain, "you're not going to shoot me" which is both boring and original and boring. <br /> <br /> The richie character nix seems interesting at first but soon falls into an irritating psycho character on one side. This seems to contradict the apparent intention of making villains somehow sympathetic or at least realistically motivated. <br /> <br /> The character of Roasario Dawson begins with a certain promise but quickly enters a disgusting parody and child gangster. scenes of Jackie Brown's chicks. Do you really want me to believe that his character was SO attracted to Rourke's? Or worse, she's just a floozy who sleeps with anything that moves? Realistic female characters FTW! <br /> <br /> In summary, the complete mess of a movie. Characterizations and performances without hope. A leaded and disjointed script with uninspired direction. And finally extremely dull. It's not even bad comedy. Laughing with a haggard face becomes very old after spending the first 15 minutes of the film.
