As you may remember, the three trilogies in the trash seem to be all three, and the first film is the only one to be watched closely. The second part was low-quality sewage and this slice is slightly better than two, but remains a pile of steam from something I removed from my yard last Monday. The premise makes no sense, why the monks murdered this poor old lady and even in 1921 I think someone would notice a group of oily types where lived a lovely little old lady. Secondly, this scarecrow is pathetic in relation to their physical appearance in the first film. These are just old clothes and a jute bag. Let's face it, the series is a trash and should be forgotten. The nose!
