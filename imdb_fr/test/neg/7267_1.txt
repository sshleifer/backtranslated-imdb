Honestly to God, the scheme says just about everything. The planet Andromina (not to be confused with Aunt Jemima) is represented by a cheap L.A. strip club. There is no stripper, so the last male visitors will recruit. <br /> <br /> Men are mistaken for kings or arrested for spying on women (although despite being a women's planet, we only have two women participating in all girl-girl sex scenes), and finally, as always in sci-fi clich√© films, women are convinced that men are good for something. Finally, not the men who made this film, anyway! <br /> <br /> But damn it, can we see a lot, in prodigious quantities of softcore sex and nudity? This one has less intrigue than usual for such films, so change channels if you do not like this kind of movie and clench your teeth if you like that kind of thing.
