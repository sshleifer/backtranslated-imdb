Attention, possible spoilers <br /> <br /> This film is so ugly that it becomes really funny. The director has put in place all the clich√©s that have always harmed the movies of the series B. The stupid bimbo (beautiful rack) is caught again and again by the bad guys, the chief villain smiling and revealing his intrigues before they do not happen, to be ruined and who, of course, has intimidated / killed the father of the hero in an unknown past Kick as a policeman - small, bald and whose only preparation for the last battle (another snapshot) is to turn his baseball cap upside down, etc. <br /> <br /> The end of the film really surpasses it. After the death of the chief villain, when the hero, Paralised Stoneface Jack or something like that, throws him off the roof of a ten-story building, they come out of the building. Which, from the outside, has only three floors and looks a lot like your usual town hall. <br /> <br /> When they come out of the building, the side kick can not work because his right leg seems to be injured. How, nobody can say it: ten minutes earlier, he fell from a bullet in the shoulder and his feet were fine. There is no other explanation to the curious mind of the spectator who would be curious to know such trivial things as "Where is the body of the wicked that should rest near the building?" and "Why are there no policemen or even curious people gathered around the body?" <br /> <br /> I could go on indefinitely with the list. Why does another villain claim to have invented the martial arts when he gets kicked in no time? Why do bad guys in general make ridiculous moves when attacking? Why does the hero look so fagot? Does anyone really think "yes, these characters and this plot make it a movie to remember"? And the actors are void. Our hero and savior of the day wears the same expression on his face. The whole movie. This disgusted-trying to be a tasteless smile must be a copyrighted feat of him. <br /> <br /> In addition, think that until now 12% of people who gave a rating to this film gave him a 10 scares me inside. They could have been serious and we would be doomed to failure.
