"Dead House 2: Dead Aim" (2005) is the sequel, although you really do not need to see the first "House of the Dead" to get this movie. That said, the value of production is indeed at the rendezvous, with excellent effects of zombies and it is quite well modified, with a very effective sound design. However, that said, that's about all that is good here. <br /> <br /> The story and the script are awful. . . there are flagrant conspiracy holes everywhere. It's also fun to see how soldiers do not mind having blood on their faces (unlike 28 Days Later where blood in any part of the body can infect you). Also realistic how little order there is with the soldiers here in contrast to the usual US military discipline. <br /> <br /> A 4 out of 10.
