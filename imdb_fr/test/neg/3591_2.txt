Echoing the good words of my friends, I hired this film, hoping it would at least match the laughs of the similar movie, "House Party", but I was very disappointed and very bored. <br /> <br /> Falling asleep while watching a movie is never a good sign. I do not know if that did not bother me because I do not live in da hood or if I'm not black, but it's probably one of them. <br /> <br /> It tries to parody some movies, producing only a few bursts of laughter, but in the long run, it fails miserably. Miss that.
