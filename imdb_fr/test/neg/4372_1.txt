I really do not know why I agreed to watch this movie, but I'm a fool and I deserve to be filmed! I had seen the original Killjoy, well I say I saw it ... I started to look at it but I found it so bad that I ended up watching it at 4x speed for finish and get rid of annoying dialogue, but I said I would look at it and I would do it even if the speed was 4x. <br /> <br /> To make short, Killjoy 2 starts where Killjoy stopped. By that, I do not mean the plot, I mean the complete and total bag of dirt known as actor and cheap. I have nothing against low-budget movies, in fact I appreciate them a bit, they are something different from mega-budget blockbuster movies, but this movie is just terrible! The acting is diabolical and the scenario ... well, I think you could give Stevie Wonder a pen and some paper and that he would produce something much better! This film is just annoying, not to mention the annoying laughter of the clown who is so obviously doubled! Anyway, I did not manage to cross this film, it was time to extinguish it three quarters of the time and throw it out the window. It may have been a scam to buy a DVD, but as a frisbee, it was a very good deal! <br /> <br /> Please for the sake of humanity itself, do not look at this mud, it's maybe the worst thing I've ever seen and seen a part the mud that I saw is saying a lot! <br /> <br /> My opinion on this film would be .... Nail to the head / 10
