Okay, I have not read the book yet, but I have to say that the main character was a bad idea. How can I say that such a thing has not read the book you are asking? It's simple. As a spectator of this miniseries, the mannerisms, the gestures and the look of the main character, Fannie Price, made me angry. It's one thing to be a good person, but it's another to be a stick in the mud who refuses to look at someone in the face or to meet his eyes. In addition to the exaggerated "Susan B. Anthony" profile, she seemed intent on refusing to look at another person. The scene where Edmond offers her heart, she looks all the time before him, forcing him to do the same. As a result, it was just embarrassing and I could not imagine anyone in love with her, let alone Henry and Edmond. Many said it was true for the book. If so, I find it hard to believe that Jane Austen would create a character like her main heroine. It is possible to create a character who has been attacked by others and who has managed to gain their trust and affection, but the representation of this character in this miniseries just did not do it for me.
