That's what Disney Channel shows to kids more stupid than posts. It suits them well. It's not funny, acting is the worst I've seen in many years, there are more stereotypes than actors and everything in this show makes you groan and roll your eyes. you want to know why? Not only is this show a loss of airplay, but lead actress Selena Gomez looks like a pig. The character of Jake T. Austin needs Ritalin. The character of David Henrie must visit a strip club and get lost. In addition, the author of the show is incoherent. In an episode, the security officer is called "sir" by a character and is referred to by the term "woman" by everyone. <br /> <br /> Hello? This is called proofreading and editing. Do it sometimes, Disney. <br /> <br /> Has anyone ever seen the promotion of the new "four-part saga"? Disney wanted his own version of the Twilight affair against Harry Potter. Except a million times. The wizards of the movie Waverly Place ?? Think about it for a minute. The family goes on vacation and his 16 year old daughter wants to be independent of the parents. SAME PLOT from the film The Proud Family Movie etc ... <br /> <br /> The worst thing is that all Emmies and ALMA'S he had. And most of the spectators are between 4 and 13 years old (and no teenager for life). how many more years? before Selena Gomez shows her breasts? <br /> <br /> and Disney shows are all fools..writers hack..hack shows..drunting the spirits and wallets of today's youth ..
