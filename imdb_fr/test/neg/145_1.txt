This movie is really a big piece of trash that tries to pretend to be a Hollywood production. A mediocre story outline (stupid robot story) ... ultra bad idol actor of pop without talent ... and they try to "FIGHT" !! ! My God ... these miserable actors use threads to make them look like "good fighters" ... :( and I hate this arrogant Edison Chen ... the worst actor I've ever seen !!! will never do it Touching his movie again.AVOID this movie at all costs !!! I wanted to give him a negative value out of ten ... not even worth a 0/10.
