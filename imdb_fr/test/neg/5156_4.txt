This film presents cockroaches like super flesh killers. This may have been the first film where cockroaches were the leading cause of death, but not the first film where cockroaches are killers. "Damnation Alley" featured a scene with killer cockroaches and "Creepshow" has a story that had them. In this one they are the star. Not as good as it could have been, this one does not count many victims. However, I can be wrong on this point because I have not seen it for long enough. Cockroaches have become murderous and this very strange looking woman is in town to study them. Yes, she's quite strange because at one point she has her hand in a box on the killer roaches and she's like, "They bite my hand," and she says that almost ecstatically. There is also a very big cockroach at the end of it, as in so many insect films. It's not a good movie, but it's worth checking out a night when you're bored.
