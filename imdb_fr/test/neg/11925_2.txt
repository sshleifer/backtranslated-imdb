Critics have started calling the Oscar winners' club, which is understandable. After that, Halle Berry won for Monsters Ball and then went straight to the devilish Catwoman. Hilary Swank triumphs in Boys Do not Cry and follows him with The Core. Jamie Foxx takes the nose as a pilot in the Stealth Stealth after receiving a gong for Ray. It seems now that Hollywood star Charlize Theron has a crush on her Oscar "Monster" with one of the worst sci-fi shows ever made. <br /> <br /> The film loses public interest after only 20 minutes, making it the only one that is really worth staying, is the fact that, despite the fact that the movie is hogwash, Charlize Theron remains an outstanding actress who clearly makes the most of a raw and laughable place. Not only is Fluxon Flux ultimately superficial, but for an action movie, it's also very boring. This will only really appeal to Horney's comic book lovers and teens who like the idea that Theron runs half naked for 90 minutes. Flux only really fails. <br /> <br /> Against the 2011 virus that kills 99% of the world's population, and in the last city of the world, Bregna, the survivors, about four hundred years later, in the year 2415, continue to live in the Goodchild dynasty, the name of the scientist who developed his treatment. <br /> <br /> Everything is not right in this utopia and it is not what hides behind its high walls that protects Citizens from the endless jungle, but what an unspoken taboo, unwritten, that holds and binds these unwritten taboos, which holds and binds all those unfortunates who find themselves in these walls of paranoia, conformity and indisputable obedience. Ironically, this film shot in and around Berlin is a story of a totalitarian state, a walled city where its people are no longer able to reproduce itself, and its sinister and secret plot that helps to sustain life. <br /> <Fluxon Flux is the assassin that has been instructed by the underground rebels to change the course of humanity forever. This is the story of his fight for justice, freedom and revenge. <br /> <br /> Fluxon Flux combines unpleasant narratives, sneaky stimulation and truly disastrous effects. It's more like an unrealistic video game than a movie. The only thing lucky with this failure is that no follow-up is planned, Flux could be the beginning and the end of what could have been one of the worst franchises in history, thank god for the meager recipes at the counter. <br /> <br /> My final verdict on this really ugly feature? There is really no story here, just Charlize Theron jumping in a black suit like a hopper. The acting game is very moronic and emotionless in wood compared to other cinemas that are today. It's too much to try to be an adaptation and it does not take much to cartoon, that's what I expected, the only thing that was done half-right and that pays homage to the drawing -animate, it is the scene of the flight of the eye. Avoid at all costs.
