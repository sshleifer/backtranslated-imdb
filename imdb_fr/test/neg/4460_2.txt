"Dracula A.D. 1972" by British television producer Alan Gibson is one of the less appetizing entries of the Hammer Studios series on the immortal blood of Bram Stoker. In fact, this was the first time since Terence Fisher's memorable "Horror of Dracula" (1958) that Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing fought each other as deadly enemies. They would resume the same roles a few years later in the last hammer Dracula: "The satanic rites of Dracula". In addition, it was the penultimate Dracula for Hammer in which Lee played the role of the famous fangster. For the record, "Dracula A.D. 1972" was Hammer's seventh Dracula. <br /> <br /> The exciting prologue of 1872 prepares you for something very different from what the rest of this disappointing horror film brings back. Count Dracula and his teacher Nemesis Lawrence Van Helsing, eternal rivals, literally look at each other at the top of a carriage in Hyde Park, London, for a vigorous opening scene that gives a relatively anticlimatic to everything else. The car breaks down and Dracula emerges by squeezing half of a wooden wheel with broken rays drowned in his chest. Of course, Christopher Lee has to grab that broken wheel against his body, but the imagery is striking enough in his own way to come to the fore. The count expires, just like his opponent Van Helsing. However, one of Dracula's disciples grabs the count's ring and retrieves a portion of the vampire's ashes in a vial to keep it safe. <br /> <br /> Don Houghton's screenplay tells the action a hundred years before swinging London in 1972. Meet a very experienced young man, Johnny Alucard (Christopher Neame of "No Blade of Grass "), who likes to raise hell with a group of hippies who crushes the parties and leads the British police with his antics. Alucard is the descendant of one of Dracula's servants. Now, Alucard has the count's ring and a vial of dehydrated blood. Alucard chooses the sight of a desecrated church to organize a black mass. He invites his trendy friends, including Laura (the super sexy Carolina Munro of "The Spy Who Loved Me"), Gayner (Marsha Hunt) and Jessica Van Helsing (Stephanie Beacham) to attend this Black Mass as she tells them proposes something different. Unsurprisingly, they resurrect the count, and the perverse leech casts his eyes on Jessica. Meanwhile, after Laura's body was found drained of blood, Scotland Yard Murray's inspector (Michael Coles of "Doctor Who and the Dalkes") seeks help from Lorrimar (Peter Cushing), the offspring modern Van Helsing. Dracula wants to take revenge on Van Helsing by taking his granddaughter as his wife. Lorrimar follows Alucard; they fight in his Chelsea apartment and the young vampire drowns in a basin of water. Remember that running water is as deadly for vampires as the sun and the crucifix. Van Helsing finds Dracula in the deserted church with his daughter waiting for the count. Van Helsing and Dracula entanglement. Van Helsing throws holy water on Dracula's face. The vampire falls into an open grave with a stake waiting for him and he decomposes again. <br /> <br /> The main problem of "Dracula AD 1972" is that we do not get enough of Lee as a count, although they get a lot more from Cushing than Van Helsing. In addition, screenwriter Don Houghton keeps Dracula confined to the dilapidated church and never allows the vampire to venture into the city. Despite its low budget, "Dracula AD 1972" could have been much better. The scene where the contemporary Van Helsing should note Alucard and spell it upside down to get Dracula seems almost laughable. You would think he would know about this spelling trick back. Unless you're scared of horror movies, this one will make you yawn. From time to time, Gibson presents a beautiful close-up of Dracula with his bare fangs and bloodshot eyes, but it's about as scary as this cooler becomes, and it does not say much.
