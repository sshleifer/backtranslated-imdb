I loved this film 10 years ago when I was about 16 years old. My biggest mistake was to watch again, 10 years later. This is not the worst film "I want to be a pilot", but it has so many flaws that you can hardly ignore them. <br /> <br /> Queen's "One Vision" (with the rest of the soundtrack) makes this film better than the average patriotic nonsense that you're used to seeing;) <br /> <br /> [**** ------]
