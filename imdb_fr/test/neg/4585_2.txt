Like another user, I got this cheap - I thought. 85 crowns (Â£ 8). Although not worth this amount of money, it is a total classic that, like other users, I saw for the first time when I was a child and I could not wait to see him again 20 years later . The story is incredibly thin (that's why it may have worked for kids), but the whole language of the radio and the tricks of the trucker make up for it. It will be fine on my DVD shelf in the years to come. First reading (1980): 10/10. Second viewing (2002): 4/10
