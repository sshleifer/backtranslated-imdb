I can not really think of a good point in this movie. The story is absolutely terrible. The acting is as direct as a carrot, and the scenario is so bad that it makes you want to kill yourself. OK if you like (and you have to like that to understand), snowboarding may be better under the microscope, because it has great mountains and some nice moves, but other than that, it's terrible. He has absolutely stupid and racist ideas. Whites and blacks insult each other. You will laugh only when you make fun of stupidity or feel embarrassed about the movie. I have seen a lot of movies and I must say that this is the worst movie I have ever seen. If you have this movie, I would advise you to bring it back to where you bought it and get your money back.
