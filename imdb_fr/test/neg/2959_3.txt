Based on the true story of two young Americans who sold national secrets to the Soviet Union at the height of the Cold War, "Falcon And The Snowman" is both suspensive and philosophical and ends up failing in both departments. . It's less the Square than the one who cares. <br /> <br /> Timothy Hutton plays the role of Christopher Boyce, a former seminarian who, disgusted with Watergate and the values ​​of the middle class around him, is probably the wrong guy who was hired by a company operating spy satellites for the CIA. Sean Penn plays his drug dealer friend Daulton Lee, who is Boyce's courier, delivering secret files to the Soviet Union's embassy in Mexico City. A quirky synth-jazz score, a lack of sympathy or emotional attachment to anyone, as well as many scenes of guy anger in theaters, help to stifle what could lead to a decent moral thriller. <br /> <br /> It's really Penn's movie despite the second billing; His character speaks with the Russians while Hutton plays with his hawk. Hutton appears to have woken him five minutes before calling "action". With Penn, it's a breeze whether you get a brilliant performance or superior performance. Here is a bit of both, but especially the last one, especially in the second half when Lee goes from coke to heroin. He screams. He sniffs. It blocks the holidays of the Russian Embassy. He gets screwed up with phone books. He spits on it in a mirror, a big goober he had to save for a paparazzi. "I do not know who my friends are anymore!" He shouts. It's exhausting to watch it. <br /> <br /> Penn seems to have modeled Lee on Dustin Hoffman's Ratso Rizzo of "Midnight Cowboy", with excessive readings of nasal lines and constant eye movement. John Schlesinger directed this film as well as "Midnight Cowboy", but he seems to have thought of another Hoffman film, "The Graduate", telling scenes from Boyce and Lee scene by scene, trying to decide how to live their lives. their golden cage. Too bad nobody suggested plastic. <br /> <br /> According to the early plans, the American film on American decline juxtaposed with Boyce and his bird, "Falcon" clearly indicates that it is a movie message, although this message is far clear, probably because the characters are never developed. Is Boyce supposed to be an idealist? Or is it just a mercenary? Hutton and Schlesinger do not seem to know, which makes the task more difficult for us. Meanwhile, the opportunities to build suspense, such as Boyce stealing documents from the highly secretive "Black Vault" where he works or Lee playing games with the Russians, are interrupted by cuts in the couple's scene with their families. and friends. It is the normality of history that Schlesinger finds interesting, but it is the least interesting aspect for us. <br /> <br /> Good thing: it's interesting to see a film that works as early as the mood of the 1970s, referring to Maria Muldaur and Tang. Dorian Harewood, memorable in "Full Metal Jacket", plays her role well as Gene, a paranoid colleague of Boyce, who shows Boyce how to make margaritas with a shredder, but that presents serious problems of "Nam". Macon McCalman is also doing very well in a totally different way as a wise boss who gives Boyce his highly secure job. David Suchet as head of the Russian embassy who deals with Lee is a fascinating mix of threat and friendliness. <br /> <br /> But "Falcon and the snowman" stands out or falls on the question of the two titles of the title, and neither the actors nor Schlesinger are able to find many answers. Worse, after more than two hours spent in their alternately wild and catatonic company, you do not really want answers. You just want these credits to roll.
