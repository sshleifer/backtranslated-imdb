This film is simply nil. I must say that I am an expert on garbage films. I reserve the score "1" for films that are void, but funny, but this film is boring and certainly not shitty in a fun way, but crappy way crappy. He gets a "2" so that those who work there can distinguish between those who make you laugh and those who make you fall asleep. There are scenes in this film where actors watch something, their expressions are amazing and their wide eyes and their open mouths tell the audience that what they are watching is going to be deeply amazing, it's just not closet or even more desert. It must be pretty damn awful for me to go out, let me tell you, I went out so I did a lot of people.
