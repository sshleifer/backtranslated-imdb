I witnessed less painful operations than watching this movie. <br /> <br /> If you're trying to think it will look like a Guy Ritchie movie, think twice! Production, dialogue, theater, screenplay, film and plot were about the worst I've ever seen in a movie. In all honesty, my favorite part was the closing credits. In the history of cinema, there has never been a better excuse to turn off the TV and go out, and do something better with your life. <br /> <br /> Make root canal work instead of wasting your time and money this!
