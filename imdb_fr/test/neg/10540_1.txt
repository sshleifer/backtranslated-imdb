The best thing about the movie is its name because it describes both the plot and the acting of the actors. At least they can not say they did not warn you ... A bit like the "Do not press this" button. <br /> <br /> Segal must be at a loss for things that move like planes, trains, and ships, but the plot remains the same. A hidden guy who fights slowly but beats like 40 mercenaries and does not even blink. What surprises me is that Segal is now as big as a barn and that the bad guys still can not hit him in a hallway with a machine gun and 50 rounds of ammo. Where are all these bullets going? The only reductive feature of this movie is to watch Nia Peeples pounding Ja Rule (her real name Jeffrey Atkins does not look so punk) on the ground. I could spend days watching this woman kick her on the shoulder like that ... especially wearing an outfit like that! It was just a bonus to watch Jeffy get kicked, and have fun hoping that one of those shots landed. Sorry, it's about time we got stupid, a tough guy can not play the role of rapper outside the cinema. PLEEEEEASE! Who had the idea anyway? I would bet it was the person who decided that Cameron Diaz and Drew Barrymore would be considered athletic and spiritual angels. <br /> <br /> The only surprising feature of this film is that they do not do the politically correct thing. and bring in Jeffy and save the day. There is no doubt that if Snoop (known as Calvin Broadus by his mother, who does not look so cool when called Cal) had been in the movie, he would throw her placards and probably save the life of Segal or whatever thing.
