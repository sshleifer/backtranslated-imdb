I could not understand this movie. I am surprised that people are praising it for their "realism". How many people in your school have been victims of incest? How many gay jocks were there in the closet? How many silent people you never noticed committed suicide? Hmmm. OK you would not even know if that was the case. But, in reality, these are explosive problems that many people never treat. And yet, there are so many teenagers with subtle problems that could have been explored. But where is the "entertainment" in all this? <br /> <br /> Regarding the girl who committed suicide, I found it was exploitation. In fact, I think a LOT of people in high school sometimes feel invisible, ignored and unwanted. But what does someone have to commit suicide violently another day of ignorance and unnoticed? The filmmaker decided that this girl would commit suicide to make the film more provocative. And the graphic nature of suicide to make it even more provocative. I did not buy it as a real life scenario. <br /> <br /> And the problems of other students with whom I was not fully aware. Bullying is explored, but it was done until death, we all know it continues and it is really a matter of resolution in this person. Homosexuality in the closet? Pfft, another snapshot is deployed. It's the thing really, too many clich√©s. I guessed the end early. There was predictable unpredictability if it made sense. You have all these characters with explosive problems, and one with apparently none. And I thought, what is the interest of this character unless she is the victim of an unsuspecting suicide? And surely, enough. <br /> <br /> One thing I'm going to say, and that's the saving grace of the movie, is that it does NOT glamorize suicide. Suicide is very graphic and distressing to watch. It is a powerful scene (no matter how it is designed) and considers suicide an easy option. But the film is really not very imaginative and uses stereotypes. <br /> <br /> Not bad but certainly not revolutionary OR worthy of a standing ovation of 17 minutes in Cannes ???
