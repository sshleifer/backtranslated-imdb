It must be the most terrible bullshit I've ever watched. That makes Mel Brooks' films worthy of an Oscar in comparison. Jim VanBebber must be publicly slapped for attempting to pass this for ANY type of entertainment. <br /> <br /> Some may say that this film is true to the low-budget genre of classics such as "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre". "or" Night of the Living Dead ", the value of the production is not in question.It is VanBebber's ability to found and present a plausible story.The casting is deplorable.For the role of Charlie, he must have chosen the first actor he saw with a beard and long hair.It does not matter that the hair of this actor fall to him halfway in the back (Manson has never exceeded him much the shoulders), this actor was expressing himself in a dreadful monotonous without a fraction of the personality that Steve Railsback or even Jeremy Davies lent to their interpretation of Manson .. The actor chosen to play "Tex" Watson had blond and curly hair instead of black hair and smooth, a fact that everyone who has shown any interest in the Manson affair knows it looks like a Minnesota farmer in "Little House on the Prairie." The actress playing Susan Atkins has a wider ass than the one Oprah, while those who knew Although family members know that "Clem" has been considered somewhat delayed, the actor who represents it has made it such a country and chaplinesque way of looking at an old act of Vaudevile. Instead of Sharon Tate looking like a beautiful pregnant woman, the actress looked like an inflated and alcoholic trailer basket. In some places, VanBebber speeds up the shoot for an artistic effect, but this technique has not proved useful since the appearance of "The Munsters". The end credits list all the known members of the family, but the majority of them are never presented to us. We are not sure of their identity. <br /> <br /> The facts are also destroyed in this film. . "Lotsapoppa" is not dead in real life, Steven Parent has been hit four times, not twice, Abagail Folger has not had his throat cut. Where were Mary Brunner and Bruce Davis during the murder of Himnan? Patricia Krenwinkel has never worn a "Dorothy Hamill" hairstyle. <br /> <br /> The most disconcerting aspect of this film is what modern "monsters" have to do with this movie? Why was the girl wearing a rubber mask with a dildo? What was their problem with the reporter? What was the meaning or purpose of the final confrontation? Why were they included, period? The spectator never knows! <br /> <br /> Sacred mackerel, I could go on for a long time but space prevents it. Do not try to eat popcorn during this trash because your hand will be too busy scratching your head while you repeat "What's the f ---?"
