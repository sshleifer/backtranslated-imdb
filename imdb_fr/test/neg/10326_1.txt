I LOVE Sandra Bullock - She's one of my favorite actresses of all time - but it's a movie she should have paid for a long time to be canned. I realize he is almost 20 years old - but my dead grandmother can do better than these people. Beware, it's not even worth $ 5.50 WalMart rack ... You know that when the actors play stinks as much as it's not worth a few dollars - the sound quality is terrible - there There is no subtitling to even hear the hideous dialogue, and it looks like the film was shot with a budget of $ 1.98. I thought I'd like to see Sandra start playing a part to see how she was evolving as an actress, but YIKES is a word too nice to use ...
