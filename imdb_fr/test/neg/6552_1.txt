This bin belongs to the basement of an old moldy mansion where she will never see again. The only thing that scared about this junk was the price of admission. I was only amused when the end credits began to roll and I was free to leave the auditorium. What unmixed boredom! a complete loss of 1 hour and a half. When I die, I pray that I can come back as a ghost and give a fever to the moron who wrote this gibberish.
