I am relieved that the latest reviews have turned sour - reading all the positive feedback, I began to worry that my understanding of movies (and life) was completely different from that of everyone else in the world. Everything in this film sounded wrong to me ... the characters, the dialogues, the manipulative soundtrack, the naughty storytelling, all that. As each scene unfolded, I thought, "People do not behave like that." It's ruthlessly heavy and dastardly. In a way, I think the film makes you love or pretend to like it, because it's serious and it's about real people and it's about problems. But man, it really did not work for me.
