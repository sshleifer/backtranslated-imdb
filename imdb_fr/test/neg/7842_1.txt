One commentator said that if you like Austin Powers, you will like this movie. I liked Autin Powers and I was disappointed by this movie. The film works hard, maybe too hard to laugh. Maybe it was all the bad guys in this movie screaming as if shouting in themselves was supposed to be funny. I arrive where they were trying to go with this movie. A cross between Zorro and the Scarlet Pimpernel, but it just does not work. Austin Powers so silly but smart, Zorro the Gay Blade lacks the know-how of Austin Powers, Big Lebowski or Kingpin. <br /> <br /> I was still waiting to laugh and while I was waiting, I was surprised that someone was really paid for the script. My 15-year-old daughter also thought the movie was flat. My 17 year old boy who chose this movie on his title left after 20 minutes. <br /> <br /> It seems that a lot of people on IMDb liked this movie, but for me, it was missing the good timing or the jokes of a good comedy. .
