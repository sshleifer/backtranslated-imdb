In writing this review, I have trouble trying to think of what to write. Nothing happens in this movie. The scenario is a South Asian woman who falls for an English Londoner. The problem is that he and his friends have had a racist tendency. At the same time, her friend at work unconsciously has sex with her brother and the situation is getting worse. The problem is that this movie is very predictable. As soon as all this happened, it's pretty much all standard. It trails slightly even if it lasts only about 90 minutes. This is more of a Chick Flick than anything else. So, if you are a man, I do not recommend this movie.
