After the pleasantly atmospheric original and amusing second ridiculous, this unbelievably boring, slow and uneventful sequel appears as a major disappointment. Once again, the infamous criminal criminal, the bat (martyr Luis Aceves Castaneda), is trying to steal valuable jewelery from the Aztec mummy Popoca. The bat builds a heavy and hilarious robot with a human brain to achieve this obnoxious goal. Conducted flatly by Rafael Portillo, with a talkative and tedious scenario of Alfredo Salazar and Guillermo Calderon, raw continuity slow writing, an excessive amount of archive footage from the first two films, a sinuous narrative, a depressing lack of action and momentum, a rather dreary voice that passes through the movements (no) of an actor understandable and disinterested, and a badly organized climate battle the mummy and the robot (the film ends up bursting a stupid life with this big party, but alas , it lasts barely two minutes and is therefore far too late to mitigate the severity of the overwhelming general boredom), this rate of snorefest dry, dripping and glabrous is a complete wash.
