* spoiler alert! * it makes me nerve that some people have to redo (and I use the term vaguely here ..) good movies. In the American version of this Dutch thriller, someone decided that the original ending was not sufficiently pasteurized for the American public. So what are they doing? they create a new one! a stupid, improbable, I'm pretending-I'm-dead-but-come back-to-life-if-the-good-guys-can-kick-my-butt-even more of a genre. do yourself a favor and get the original.
