I am shocked and surprised to find critics running out of miserable for this horrible film. I rented this "movie" or droppings, as you wish, with several friends and after thirty minutes we had to stop watching. Just listening to the dialogue has left a horrible taste of sour milk in my mouth. This movie was about as smart as an ass button. I hope I never see such a Juliet (Julianne Nicholson) without bra and disgusting. It was like watching the most putrid driver for a sitcom that will never get to the TV, but instead of being 30 minutes quick but painful (all I could strip) was 90 awful minutes.
