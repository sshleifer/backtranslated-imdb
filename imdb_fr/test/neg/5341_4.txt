"Black Friday" did so much better than this plot, so we remember it and "The Man With Two Lives" is just a forgotten potboiler. "Shed No Tears" was his title and he would have been better because he was a completely perverse character for most of the movie. <br /> <br /> Philip Bennett is recently engaged when he is involved in an accident traffic. Dr. Clark (Edward Keene) participated in experimental animal operations, bringing them back from the dead. His colleagues urge him to try his operation on Phillip, who has died. While he operates, a dangerous criminal, Wolf Panino, sits on the electric chair and soul migration occurs. When Phillip wakes up from the operation, he has the soul of Panino. He is a person who has changed, he is rude to his family and starts hanging out in the old hangouts of Panino. He takes control of Wolf's old band - named after Philip Bennett, he's also Wolf's old girlfriend, a romance - who smells like a rat. Bennett, as Wolf, is determined to equalize the points and start eliminating his enemies. The bodies pile up, including the girlfriend and a policeman, and then his own family begins to become a victim. these movies "bad dream" - you always feel let down. This film would have been better if he had stayed in the character of Panino and had had one last shoot. Eleanor, his fianc√©e, would have ended up being sadder but wiser with his brother. <br /> <br /> Edward Norris, the star, had a great career mainly in B movies. <br /> <br /> Not really recommended.
