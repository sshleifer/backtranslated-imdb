Jack Brooks (Trevor Matthews) is a student with serious anger issues. His family was brutally murdered when he was a child by a monster and now he is putting his anger on everything and everyone. <br /> <br /> So when his teacher (Robert Englund) begins to show signs of a monster, learns that he must control his rage and use it for good instead of evil, and to fight creatures who haunt his nightmares since that fateful night. <br /> <br /> He really deserves his grade B, but it was cool not to focus on poor quality CGI graphics. In fact, 0% of the film was in computer graphics. The monsters were decently set up, and although the scenario was absent, it was somewhat observable ... just once.
