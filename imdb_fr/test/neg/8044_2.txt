Political action poorly done. Poorly photographed, played and directed. Each scene is underestimated, including the very rare scenes shot during the day. No matter the location. At a major conference in the White House, no lights are lit and the only lighting available is a dark blue filtered through some windows. The Chinese prime minister is conducting a heartbreaking telephone conversation in such intense chiaroscuro that he should consider a bust of Homer in a Rembrandt painting. Honest. It's as if he had a tiny spotlight on his face and was in total darkness. Slow dead are now mandatory in all bad movies. <br /> <br /> Roy Scheider and Maria Conchita Alonzo are doing their part, but Scheider is rarely on screen. Other representations are fictitious. There is a pretty oriental woman wearing a short, tight skirt that comes out of a Bond movie. Her accent suggests a childhood spent in Basset, Nebraska, which should have remained the model she probably started. Whoever plays the surviving secret service agent aboard the cruise ship was probably chosen for the role because he looked more like Johnny Depp, not because of his talent. The Chinese villains, representing both Taiwan and mainland China, hiss and smile when threatening the heroes. <br /> <br /> The scenario is pretty horrible, recycled other, better movies. There is a lot of shooting on the ship and almost everyone ends up eating ground meat. Two-thirds of the way, the ship explodes in the expected series of fireballs. Then the film splits into two linked parts. Part one, another shootout, this time in a warehouse at the water's edge. The second part, an exchange between the Vice President, now Interim President, and the Chinese Oily First, was created by both "Dr. Strangelove" and "Fail Safe". We launch our missiles without knowing it. They launch theirs in retaliation. We can not convince them that our launch was accidental, even though we offer to help them destroy our own missiles. There is even General George C. Scott / Walter Matthau who argues that their "nucular" arsenal can not match ours, so we should inflict on them all we have. No more fireballs. <br /> <br /> The end does not come too soon.
