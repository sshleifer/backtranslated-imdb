Seeing this movie in preview, I thought it would be witty and cheerful. Unfortunately, it was a typical case of "funny snippets figured in the preview", not to say that everything was bad. But "the good sides were in the overview". <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a teen movie that will make you sleepy, watch this movie.
