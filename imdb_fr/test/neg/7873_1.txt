One of the worst movies I have ever seen. When I tried to watch that, I had the flu and I was rather open-minded for all brainless entertainment. Unfortunately it was too much. How can so many unsorted actors be in a movie? This film makes porn look like a European art film. Cast just speaks their lines without any emotion; We especially thank Charlie Snows (Baldwin), who will soon become his ex-wife, who talks about his divorce as the rest of the company talks about the weather. Simply horrible (and funny). <br /> <br /> With a lot of alcohol and friends, this could be a background entertainment and a few laughs, like Ed Wood-movies. The plot is a joke and a soundtrack from a cheeky soap opera. <br /> <br /> Hopefully nobody paid to see this movie. <br /> <br />
