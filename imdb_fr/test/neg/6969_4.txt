Directed and written by the famous / infamous Edward D. Wood Jr, using a pseudonym (Daniel Davis) starring Glen / Glenda. It is an almost radical documentary on transvestism; Wood himself is a transvestite with a fetish for angora pullovers. It seems like miles of archive footage and an incoherent Bela Lugosi is being used to stretch this strange and delicate film to 67 minutes. Police Inspector (Lyle Talbot) seeks clarification from a psychiatrist, Dr. Alton (Timothy Farrell), to better understand the emotion and disposition of transvestites. <br /> <br /> Also in the cast: Delores Fuller, "Tommy" Hanes, Captain DeZita and Sister Evelyn of Wood. Note: Farrell also plays the role of narrator. And Fuller later helped write songs included in Elvis Presley's films such as BLUE HAWAII, KISSIN 'COUSINS & KID GALAHAD.
