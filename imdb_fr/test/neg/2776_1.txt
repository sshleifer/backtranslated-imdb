In the Muslim country of (fictitious) Khalid, his benevolent leader / dictator, Reed Hadley as Amir, is dying of cancer. Amir dies and a desperate plot takes place. His body is wrapped in aluminum foil and subjected to a clandestine operation (the population does not know he's dead), made up of his doctor (Nigserian) and Mohammed, out of the country, to perform a brain transplant at risk. The operation is practiced by Dr. Kent Taylor, a dishonored man who feels that there is no chance of failure and that he has two assistants. One of them is about 3 feet tall (Master Blaster actually led Barter Town) and the other is a mutilated and traumatized giant named Gor. What could go wrong ?? <br /> <br /> Did I forget to mention the death bed of Amir, the American wife of the blonde-Barbie girl, Tracy, or the fact that Dr. Kent has a dungeon with subjects of Slave test and illusions of grandeur? How about a brain transplant that did not take? There are a lot of duplicates in all this and people are killed, but I will not lie to you: MISSION COMPLETED. The ends justify the means. If you can accept that, you will not lose 80 minutes. I hope it's pretty warned. Do not say I did not warn you. If you have to watch, then do not look alone and keep away from many medications. <br /> <br /> -Celluloid Rehab
