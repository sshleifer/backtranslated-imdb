This is a children's TV series about a Mary-Sue who is both naughty and bitchy. I could not sit across 3 episodes of Zoey101. Not to mention that Jamie Lynn Spears can not act to save her life! What message does this show bring to children? If you are not perfect like Zoey, you are unworthy * Rollseyes *. <br /> <br /> It's absurd to see that Zoey's character is exactly the type of person that would be scorned in real life, but she manages to become so popular. . Then there's Chase, who's basically a lovemaking puppy who worships the ground Zoey is walking on. Then there is the fact that all the other characters seem to have been silenced to prevent them from surpassing Zoey. I'm sorry but the characterization in this show = extremely unrealistic.
