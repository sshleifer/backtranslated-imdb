(This could have a spoiler) <br /> <br /> When I started watching this movie, I thought it was OK. The music was good and this bizarre sequence of dreams that I was ready to forgive, but the lack of looks of the main character and all the other characters did not interest me to watch the rest of the movie. (I know, totally vain.) At first, the music was lively and appropriate, I was thinking of a Gothic novel. But go! Saxophone music for a film of the early 19th century? It did not correspond at all. This movie was totally boring and if you're looking to watch a vintage movie or an Austen, do not rent Northanger Abbey! I give him a 30%. 30% = a failure note!
