The next step in our journey through the calendar-slasher scene is ... oh yes, "Graduation Day"! All of these seniors, bursting with possibilities and ready to venture into the real world and become adults. That is to say, however, if they manage to graduate without having to get confused with the crazy campus running around, stealing the life of students with his sword of fencing ... Yeah, everything it comes from a high school runner who falls dead from a blood clot during a race and a year later, his older sister returns from the navy for graduation. The coach holds the blame and rumbles his downgraded position in the workshop class while the little girl's boyfriend still mourns his death a year later ... All of these characters are prime candidates for the "Serial Slasher of the Year "and you just have to sit through this movie until the end to find out who did it. "Graduation Day" is fun, although it is absolutely not original and it does not lack memorable memories, but there are enough to entertain you a little. Like Linnea Quigley who smashes the music teacher and gets fucked by a 30-year-old mixed-sex actor who plays teenagers, and of course ... Rollerdisco! I must love this shit! You can do a lot worse than "Graduation Day", kids ...
