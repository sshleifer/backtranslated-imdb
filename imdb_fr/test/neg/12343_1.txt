Eleven years after the release of this film, only 5 people have commented here on IMDb. There is a reason for this total disinterest for Across the Moon. It is coherent but lacks any cinematographic virtue. See this movie for examples of terrible production in all respects. Opening credits, for example, are white letters that come out mechanically from a red background. Michael McKean looks at the prison window as a conclusion: "There are a lot of mysteries out there." followed by a video clip / video montage of all the edifying moments of the tragically bad movie. Julinana Hatfield. Everything in between is awful. I had a hard time finding value in this movie and I was left empty. Although it's hard to believe, even a role played by Burgess Meridith (always a pleasure for the crowd) only disappointed me more. This film is like a parody of what is special in movies. On paper, the film is below average. Women living together in a caravan. But what was really produced was almost unassailable. The film tries to diversify in many directions, but never gives effect. The unattractive conflict of having their boyfriend in prison is never solved. No conflict is ever resolved. There is really no conflict. Women are trying to become prostitutes, but this never happens. Instead, they get jobs as a bartender and storekeeper. Do you like it? It was not. It was stupid. And most of the film, it is the two women who speak and generate artificial conflicts. Women are capable actresses, but the scenario was beyond the poor. Needless. It was a terrible movie, but it's even worse that they decided to take Burgess Meridith out of her retirement home. Bad from beginning to end. Like the lion without teeth, this film has no bite.
