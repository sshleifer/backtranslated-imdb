The quality of the subject, the director, and the cast is in a way a truly abominable film, told in a flat, semi-documentary style that was so popular at the time of its making. (And hello, it's NOT a movie noir!) The story dull, too complicated and overcrowded has no bow, no point of focus, little enthusiasm, and staggered from a scene to the other without a perceptible goal, except for a Valentine's Day in the supposed and highly dubious cooperation between the US and Mexican governments on the issue of illegal immigration <br /> <br /> The scene that made me hate this film is the one where Montalban and Mitchell boldly escape their captors, in a race to rescue Montalban's wounded partner from an armed murderer driving a piece of farm Montalban says something like "quick - you have to try to save him" "But instead of doing it, they lie on their belly and watch with agony for about 5 (!) minutes of screen while the machine is based on Murphy and FINALLY, the short on (or at least we suppose it - the machine simply stops, another moron detects the presence of the two "rescuers" and shoots them as they escape again.) The scene is over. The whole thing is so horribly filmed and totally anticlimatic. There is nothing worse than a protagonist (apparently, Montalban, although he is off the screen for more than half of the movie) who does not even try. Jeez, Ricardo, do SOMETHING! <br /> <br /> I know it's Anthony Mann, but damn it, all his movies are not classics, but people. How old should an old film be here to get a score below 6?
