I did not expect too much from this film, but I was always disappointed. It's supposed to be a comedy, but there are only four or five scenes where I really laughed, and I think it's pretty poor. There is no real plot either, I always felt that most of the scenes could have been put anywhere in the movie because there was no connection between them. But the worst was Kim Franke's "game". He has a facial expression throughout the film, as if he were supposed to play a retarded guy, but I think that's not the case. Overall, I rate it four out of ten, I've seen worse movies than that, but I would never spend money on it again.
