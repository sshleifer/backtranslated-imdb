The first Robocop had a cynical sense of mind and a sick sense of violence. It was a good way forward, but Paul Verhoeven was successful and the film was so successful that they did a sequel. How awful. (Spoilers possible to come - though anything that could spoil this is beyond me.) <br /> <br /> Irvin Kershner is not the director of this type of film. He obviously did not understand the spirit of the original and, as a result, the insane and senseless insane violence really looks really terrible - and the worst is very unpleasant. The score is even worse. Leonard Rosenman was an old man from another era and the heroic and light music does not match the images on the screen at all! What was he marking ?! The great American hero ?! Worst of all, he completely eliminated Robocop's theme from the first film, which was so memorable and perfect. Can you imagine a fanless Superman movie of John Williams, Indiana Jones, etc.? How could he do that? !! <br /> <br /> The plot is just a collection of ideas that do not gel. At first, we see Robo "stalking" his old wife. Well, good idea. But they drop it completely after that. Then there is a stupid idea of ​​the company reprogramming Robo to be nice. This lasts 10 minutes, then is immediately deleted. Or again, the idiotic idea that the repugnant 10-year-old drug lord reminds Robo of his son - Again, a weak motive that is briefly shown twice and dropped. This may seem in a comic strip, but not in a movie. Frank Miller, unfortunately too inexperienced at the time, threw each idea into the kitchen sink. It does not work as a whole. <br /> <br /> Some people here seem to praise corporate criticism in this film and the privatization of the police. This is the best part of the film that is consistent with the first. However, in the original, the old man was a hard businessman looking for a profit, but ultimately just. In this film, he is purely evil in his thirst for money and power. You can not change character like that without reason. And the character of Nancy Allen is useless in this film, while in the first it was essential to the research of Robo. It is as free as violence in this movie. <br /> <br /> And violence, yes violence. I enjoy a lot of violent and bloody movies when they serve and tell a story. Irvin Kershner seems to be attacking human beings in pieces, bales, death-thirsty children, torture and aspiring drugs. He does not know when to stop. Do we really need to see all the latest innocent bystanders (even people trying to help others) get shot at? We deduce when we see the bad Robocop shoot repeatedly! Instead, Mr. Kershner proves that he has very little taste for this type of work and creates an abominable mess that is a terrible piece of pop art and, worse, a disgusting message of violence for any young person looking at it. movie. <br /> <br /> No, this movie is not meant to be a message and I certainly do not watch Robocop movies or Alien or Predator movies for that reason. However, when you go too far and cross the line, much of what you do has to be questioned. And as for this film, according to the last words of the evil child drug dealer at the time of his death, "it still sucks".
