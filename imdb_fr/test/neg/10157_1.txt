There are a lot of films, mostly 80s, that are so terrible that you can not help but love them. The Last Slumber Party is one of those. I hate this movie so much, but it remains one of the most watched movies in my collection. I watched it countless times and I burst out laughing every time. This is the perfect example of how ALL movie could be released in the 80's. <br /> <br /> Our name killers is Maniac Randles. (Scary, huh?) Randles is an escaped psycho killer running into doctor's gowns and a doctor jacket that cuts people with a scalpel as they go. He ends up falling in a house of girls who organize a slumber party. One of the girls is the daughter of the doctor who tried to operate Randle, and this one ended up pulling him down into some sort of sexual position. (lol looks at the movie to find out what I'm talking about.) Now, I know what you need to be thinking: this must be another ridiculous little budget hack and a slash like the Slumber Party Massacre or the Slumber Party Massacre. Valentine's Day, right? NO! This movie is horrible! First, the quality of the film changes throughout the film. Sometimes it seems that the film could have been filmed this year, but at other times it is so granular and blurry that it is not even visible. The funny thing is that some specific camera angles will be blurry and grainy, and other specific camera angles will be clear and perfect, which is absolutely ridiculous and proves that they do not care at all. <br /> <br /> The director played the killer (as if it was not funny enough) but because he was not talented enough to play and direct at the same time, he just shot a picture of him walking towards the camera with his scalpel, and then, just replay this clip every time someone is killed. <br /> <br /> The characters in this film are completely ridiculous and implausible, and these people supposed to be between 16 and 18 years old are more like what they are 25-45. I know that slasher films commonly use adults as teenagers, but I have never seen a movie where THAT was obvious. I guess the reason why none of them are still part of the film industry today is that they all died of old age ... Or maybe it was just because this movie was so horrible that they never wanted to show their faces again, and that's a good thing, because I doubt they could watch other movies even if they tried. All I can do is hope that Tyler will one day be the last party of Slumber Party 2: The Final Conflict and all the original actors come back. I'm sure everyone would like that. <br /> <br /> The film was directed by Stephen Tyler, (no, not the singer) who never took over the staging, and it was released by B & S (that I am it wants say bull and ****) Productions. Bull & S only released another movie, "Forever Evil", which was rather horrible, but not as serious as the last movie "The Last Slumber Party". <br /> <br /> A horrible film, horrible, horrible ... Highly recommended.
