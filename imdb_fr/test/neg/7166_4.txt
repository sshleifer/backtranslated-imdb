I saw pieces of this film on television once, and when a friend recommended it, I started looking for it, even though it seemed that no place nearby had it. I finally found it in an antique shop and I could not wait to watch it ... Oh, I saw it a few years ago and I really could have enjoyed it. I was surprised that this film only lasts about 80 minutes, and I think that's what made the plot and history so lacking. The plot seems really good, both on the trailer and on the movie's comments: a teenager, Angus (Jesse Bradford) and his new wandering laboratory, Yellow, are abandoned on an island during a storm when a boat trip with his father (Bruce Davison). Together, they manage to survive in nature and wait to be found and saved. Yet, what is never mentioned is that everything is shortened and that the events of the plot are very rushed. There is a possible love interest between Angus and Sara, but they are never shown together more than a moment. Yellow is a mischievous dog that parents are reluctant to keep, but after a few days, it seems to be appreciated enough to participate in a boat trip. The scene of the mother (Mimi Rogers) vaguely mentioning what death is for the youngest boy (Joel Palmer) is not going anywhere. In no time we learn that the island has spent 9 days, then 14 and 19 days. Of all the animals a castaway could be exposed to in the wild, only one type - a wolf - attacks them. Why could not something else be a problem instead of having the same type of animal - maybe even the same - can it hit twice? There are few views on how Angus prepares meals, except when he discovers fruits and roots and roasts a trapped rat. If he knows as much about survival techniques, why did not we show more scenes with? The only thing that made me empty was why the dog did not have much of a hand alone. When he is saved and the dog is left on the island, there is no scene showing how he survives without the help of a human. I would have liked to be more open to it when I watched it, but I liked some of them. The acting game was good and the score was nice. However, I wondered why the father looked so much older than his family and why he and the main person in charge of search and rescue share the same name. It's a good movie for kids, but although the protagonist is 14, no one over 10 would be interested in that.
