The plot of the film is quite simple: a viral epidemic has turned the population into flesh-eating zombies. Those who left became "hunters". <br /> <br /> Well, first of all, it's NOT the worst zombie movie ever. Among the worst are "Zombiez" and the famous "Zombie Lake". <br /> <br /> In fact, I think the idea of ​​"Quick and the Undead" was very good, but poorly executed. Given the budget with which they had to work, this film looks very good. I was not bored at all by looking at him. The special effects were strong, although they used a single computer image (a big zombie being shot in the head), but everything else (gore, guts) was pretty good. Playing is terrible, though. Our main character looks like young Clint Eastwood, other "actors" do not even deserve to be mentioned. Regarding the plot, they have not worked enough on the development of the story. <br /> <br /> Bad: play, low budget. Good: special effects, idea for the film. <br /> <br /> Overall, this film deserves 4/10 from me. It's not as bad as people say. Imagine a WESTERN ZOMBIE, then watch this movie.
