Sending creatures into space seems like a fun idea, but was there really a third film, let alone a fourth? A movie with Brad Dourif can not be so bad, is it? Well, maybe in this case. This inexpensive sci-fi effort features the charming Charlie Don Keith Opper, who is about to eradicate the last two remaining eggs of the Critters species when Ugh (Terrence Mann) announces that it is about to break a kind of trans - law on endangered species. So, at Ugh's request, Charlie places the two eggs in special brackets inside a space module. Unfortunately for Charlie, the damn thing takes off for space and he's stuck inside. The smoke under his feet puts him in a hibernation stasis and he wakes up 53 years later in a decrepit space station as Captain Rick, with his big cigar, his coarse alcoholic malevolence and his thirst for heart that opens the doors Space pod trying to see what's new inside for a possible sale or exchange. Rick, unknowingly, lets out the two critters who feast on his flesh. You see that Rick and his team found the space boat drifting and that there were flashing dollar signs in their eyes, so they tied it up. Ugh points out to them (now in a very interesting position as an adviser) that it is possible to make money if they land on a space station under the Terracor organization. Once the crew moored, they discover that this station is in ruins and that many corridors are in bad condition, but the worst is the computer station Angela. Angela is a real backbone for the crew because she was left unrepaired without proper maintenance for a while. It takes a few quick tips to open and close doors, not to mention elevators and computers. Brad Dourif is Al Bert, pretty much the computer functions impresario (.. and pretty much the real leader of the group because he is the smartest and most weighted in the world). He seems to be a father figure for Ethan (Paul Witthorne) who only wants to arrive on earth to find his father. This story does not necessarily reach its zenith. Bernie (Eric DaRe) is mainly in the movie to be a victim of drugs for the creatures to nibble. In the movie, Charlie, after a creature enters Rick's mouth and gnaws at his throat {yuk}, becomes the crew's guide to understanding what he's fighting against. The film contains elements that I found quite confusing (or for a better word, ridiculous) .. the two critters grow quickly, are somehow able to coordinate a ship for the Earth, not to say grow enormously in this laboratory the space station. The crew is able to tap into Dr. McCormick's diary {Anne Ramsay, whose badge is found in a coat thrown to the side for which Ethan discovers her access card} which shows signs that Terracor was trying to create a species to exterminate. worlds and people. Knowing this disturbs Al Bert who wishes to leave Angela and his bleeding station for greener pastures. Things do not work that way because well-intentioned Charlie (thanks in part to Albert's "old" Colt .45) kills an on-board creature, but by firing several bullets he hits the ship's main guidance systems. There are so many repairs in order, but they stop them when Ugh and his assault troops have moored to Angela and prove that they are not what Charlie thought they would be. Ugh is a changed man and Charlie realizes he is completely pervert. Its mission is to preserve the Crits for cruel purposes (representation of corrupt government types). This betrayal is what changes Charlie .. He may have grown up a bit and now understands that some people are changing for the worse. Charlie and Ugh will be face to face with these critters. Can the crew escape from a space station that programmed self-destruction? This film does not really exploit the critters as the other three films. I think we can clearly see this as the true end of the franchise. The first movie was a joke .. a really fun madness. But by the time this sequel appeared, the creatures had simply exhausted their welcome. The cast, however, gives a boost to the film. Creatures feed a little, but their plans for global dominance are underdeveloped. Their role in the film is not established at the highest level. I told myself, you have this huge space station with unfortunate trapped on board .. can not you take this idea and run with it? Unfortunately, they do not do it.
