No matter what you heard, "Fame" is not a good movie. It is not worth the investment of more than two hours to watch stereotypical teenagers in trouble dancing, singing, learning and watching girls in the locker room. <br /> <br /> Every shot finds a cozy little house in this movie. A gay teenager seeks to be accepted. It would have been great if it had been treated as something other than a secondary element of the plot. There is a kid from the ghetto who has too much attitude-- what, were I surprised? And guess what? They all want to become stars, to find fame and fortune, and they would be ready to crawl on the corpses of their smoking mothers to get it. <br /> <br /> Curiously, we remember this movie for its music. But in reality, the only moderately good song is "Hot Lunch Jam", which is still too old to be of real quality. The two most popular songs are nothing either. "Fame" is a meaningless stuffed drunk by the spectacle of a huge dance scene in the streets. And "I sing the electric body" (what does Bubba mean ?????!?!? (After all, from the director of "Evita") are only marginally helped by Michael's ordinary photographic work Seresin: But cinematography alone can not carry a film, especially a film that is meaningless and meaningless.
