Now, among all the shark movies I've seen, this one is taking the cake! The plot of the film was good, but the excitement factor has somehow nibbled afterwards. Antonio Sobato, Jr. does an excellent job as a son looking for the shark that killed his father. A megaldon is one of the biggest sharks and the most dangerous. The view of the shark was indeed frightening from certain angles, but the effects were fuzzy and the scenes were a little weak in some places. With the weapons of the mini-submarine there, it would eliminate a whole school of sharks. It was great that the son got the exact revenge on this monstrosity, although it would also cost him his life. As they say, revenge has its price, but was it worth it? This answer could continue over and over, and this movie was a major disappointment. The beginning was good, and in the end, it worked like the Titanic. 1 ON 5 STARS!
