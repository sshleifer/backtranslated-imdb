This movie was really bad. I mean really bad. The scenes were like a parody and a special effect sucked a lot. And it was filmed in 2003 !!! I think it was a big waste of time and money and Michael Shanks with his picture "Shaggy from Scooby Doo" made me laugh. Never waste your time with this image ... I really do not know what the director thought after seeing the final editing of this film, but the fights were so unrealistic that it hurt me to watch them. The fighters "latex cat women" were like sheep rolling on the stage and seemed frightened as if they had no idea what to do on the stage ... I think this is a beautiful example of the photo of Bottom 100.
