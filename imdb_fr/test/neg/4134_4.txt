when Miss Brook became skinny, she left the water wearing a white bikini bottom and had already removed everything to join Cabin Cabin. It could have been a good movie without Miss Brook, fake accent and a year on the island please. How do you think Kelly always looks clean and ready for an FM photo shoot? What started with the premise has become soft pornography. And Billy Zane, you can not be so tough on movie offerings. When people took her, she mocked her face and after all this time she did not feel like throwing up. I suggest to Billy to find decent scenarios, Kelly sticks to photo shoots and the cabin boy plays Zorro's son in a sequel. .
