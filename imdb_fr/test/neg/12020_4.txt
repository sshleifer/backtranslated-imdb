and nothing else. <br /> <br /> A friend of mine bought the Problem Child Tantrum pack (contains the first two "Problem Child" in a disc) and we decided to watch more because it was funnier. . <br /> <br /> There have been many fun moments in the movie (the vomiting scene is all I have to say.), Nippy the dog after eating CHOW DOWN and many more. The film is just the humor of the toilet, but it's hilarious. Aside from the fun times, though, this movie has little to offer. <br /> <br /> John Ritter annoys me, because he seems to read a book. The man can not play in this one, sorry. <br /> <br /> Although I can not say if I would find the funny movie now ... (we were stunned when we watched it), it's a perfect movie for a rainy day. .. but nothing else. Do not expect Oscar material on this one, guys.
