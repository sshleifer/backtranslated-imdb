I just do not understand. Why call this a sequel to the movie "American Werewolf" when he has absolutely no connection with him? The first movie was funny * and * scary with innovative special effects. (If I remember correctly, the Oscar category for special makeup effects was * created * for this film). "Paris" is none of that. Horrible effects and not much else. Do not see this movie. Rent the original "Werewolf in London" instead. You will be much happier.
