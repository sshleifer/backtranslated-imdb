What an idiotic movie. Even if it looks nice, it does not make much sense. On the one hand, the film suggests that Juana's "madness" was that she was only a woman ahead of her time. On the other hand, she has an obsession that comes straight from the worst romance of the woman victim of the Victorian era, and this seems to be a kind of mental problem, like that of Miss Havesham in a castle. This film would be what Elizabeth would have been if she had not managed to overcome Essex's sexual attraction.
