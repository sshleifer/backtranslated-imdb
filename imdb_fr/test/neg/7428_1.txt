I had this thing on the sci-fi shelf because I remembered seeing the first one in the series when I was a kid. I rented the second one and it was a good science fiction "B". This one was completely odious. The "special" effects on the cars looked like something my 4-year-old cousin could have done. The two cyborgs assistants were so terrible that I literally collapsed every time they came to the screen. The plot left so much to be desired that it made me sick. I do not know what everyone thought when they agreed to be part of this movie, but I'm sure they would have done better to have left it to 2 movies. The films in this series range from good to decent to terrible. I only hope that no terrorist group has access to this film because it is an excellent torture tool.
