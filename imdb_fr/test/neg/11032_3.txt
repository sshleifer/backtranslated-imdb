Taran Adarsh, a renowned critic, praised such a movie dubba <br /> <br /> The film tells a strange story in which a lover sells his love to a brothel because he wants to money to save his mother and get forgiven too. LOL </ p> The movie is shit <br /> <br /> the whole first half is centered on romance, comedy that does not work. The twist shocks, but the entire second half is a disaster and the climax is cliche. <br /> <br /> The staging by Aditya Datt is bad The music is typical of Himesh <br /> <br /> Emraan plays well his serious role but his wardrobe, his way to browse songs.etc is similar to his previous films Geeta Bhasra annoys Ashmith Patel fails to convince this actor that he was good in MURDER, but a Mithun downhill a little while in front of the screen and he's fine, but his fall in song is forced. Ranjeet is fine
