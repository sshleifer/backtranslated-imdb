Oh man! I really threw Manhunt into space. I think this flopper is rightly worse than Manhunt. This leads nowhere and the growth of mushrooms was more exciting than this tripe. <br /> <br /> Poor Cleolanta. She is so misunderstood. Smug Rocky struts and luckily, Winky makes no mention of his "gay nightlife". There's a lot more talk, a really awful space wedge on the rocks (to watch), and some shitty space effects cut-outs. Then there is Bobby. You decide who is the most annoying: Bobby or the Winkster? Personally, I would throw them out of an airlock into a black hole before submitting them to extraterrestrial mutants killing killers. <br /> <br /> At least there is Vena. She's just a cosmic girl!
