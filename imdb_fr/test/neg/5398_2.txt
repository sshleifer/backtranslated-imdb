This can contain *** SPOILERS *** <br /> <br /> Where do I start on this empty wasteland? Well, it would have been nice if they had a plot. Actor's talent, decent dialogue, suspense, humor, and even free sex would have helped this film. Unfortunately, there was only a lot of coolness (even if it was not done well), automatic gunfire and missing. <br /> <br /> There seemed to be no reason to link the basic principle, a cursed Native American to protect the bodies of the tribe he murdered, and to be found by a team of federal special forces dressed in civil (?). Most of the time, it was about violating one of the basic rules of conduct in a horror movie, to part with the group so that you could be eliminated one by one. One would think that this team would be better informed, especially because it is actually the third team to investigate, the other two teams disappearing without a trace. When they finally realize that they have been abducted, they take places on several stands and shoot their weapons only to hit the trees very often. The tree scene is constantly being repeated in this film to save money. <br /> <br /> When they do not shoot at trees, they follow that mind that leaves no trace (who knows how they follow it), and gushing out a lot of macho BS. By the way, have I already mentioned that most of the members of this team are women? Interesting to listen to them speak hard. Not very entertaining, but interesting. <br /> <br /> Overall, you can find better movies in the bargain box at Kmart.
