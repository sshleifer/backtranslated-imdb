This film, along with several other religious movies of the 1950s, such as The Robe, Quo Vadis, and Samson and Delilah, unfortunately represent all pagans or anyone who is neither Jewish nor Christian, morally depraved, and decadent. The focus is only on Bible stories that ignore the world outside the Bible. As far as they are concerned, nothing good has come from Egypt, Greece or pagan Rome. <br /> <br /> Every film that preaches about the "only true god" gives a brief overview of religious freedom. The films ignore the fact that the lack of religious freedom in ancient Judea made it fertile ground for religious extremism. Most religious films of the 1950s also ignore the loss of freedom that took place after Christians took power in the 4th century.
