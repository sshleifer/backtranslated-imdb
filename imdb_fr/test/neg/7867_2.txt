I hate being too critical, but this one was really bad. I love the Baldwin brothers, I just wish there was more talent equally spread among them. I liked the general plot, but there were too many "attempts" and not enough "to do" when it came to the game of quality actors. <br /> <br /> My favorite character was the bald cop. He reminded me of Dmitri Valtane (Jeremy Roberts, I believe) from Start Trek 6: An Unknown Country. Just without the hair. <br /> <br /> If you have the Hollywood Video MVP program and you really want to get your money's worth, then let yourself be guided by one of the three MVP movies you have chosen. It is worth it for a few laughs. <br /> <br /> The most impressive special effect of the entire show is the sound of Stephen Baldwin's rifle shooting. I guess this allows you to know a little about the quality and excitement of the rest of the series.
