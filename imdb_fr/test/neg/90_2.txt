The only reason this movie did not get a (dreadful) vote is that Ida Lupino and Robert Ryan's role play is superb. Ida Lupino, charming, becomes, as usual, more and more upset in search of various ways to get rid of a madman. Robert Ryan is terrifying as the threatening stranger whose character, guided by his troubled mind, changes from minute to minute. In appearance simple and docile, he suddenly becomes intelligent and threatening. Mrs. Lupino's character was more threatened by the house in which she lived and by her own stupidity than by anyone who had visited it. She could not get out of her house: the windows did not open, the front and back doors were locked and unlocked from the inside with a key. You could not have created a worse fire trap if you tried. She did not take the precaution of even having an extra key. She also could not figure out how to call nearby neighbors or get out of her own basement while she was locked up and out of sight of her kidnapper. I do not know in what war her husband was killed, but if it was the Second World War, the furniture of his house, the style of the clothes, especially the children and the car of the repairman of the company of phone, are clearly anachronistic. I recommend watching this movie just to see what quirks you can find.
