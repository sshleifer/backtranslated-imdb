I have never felt the need to add a review on this website so far, but after listening to the movie, I found it necessary to warn parents who might think to show it to their children. Please do not! It's not a Disney movie. This film tells us that life is cruel and that if you show it to your children, in my opinion, you are too. <br /> <br /> The video box describes the film as a "delight for all ages" and the plot of the IMDb plot describes it as a "family film". I had to find a definition of "family film" and came across the following: "Usually composed of comedies or adventures, these films are often based on children's literature and may involve a large number of useful animals, sympathetic supernatural beings and fantasy worlds, all designed to stimulate and appeal to the imagination Whatever the situation, there is little or no offensive material and, in general, a lesson is learned along the way. " This is not an appropriate description of Tarka The Otter, which contains completely unpleasant scenes, totally inappropriate for young children and an ending that qualifies the film as "negative feeling". The lesson learned? As I said, life is cruel. Family Fun? I do not think so. Unless you hate your family, it is. <br /> <br /> You can find another review, more revealing than that, but that deserves to be read, by following the link "External notices".
