It is a completely forgettable image. A friend of mine picked it up in a basket at a local rental company for $ 50. He should have asked for a refund. Or at least a reduction. <br /> <br /> The plot looks something like this: a giant monster threatens the Earth and the aliens decide that the most average human being on the planet must be chosen to save it. Thus, a tiny alien appears in front of a postal worker and tells him he is "the". <br /> <br /> The devil is in the details when it's time to evaluate a movie, and on that account, Zarkorr! The invader fails miserably. The monster Zarkorr has only a few brief moments on the screen, totaling perhaps 5 minutes maximum (with a generous estimate). The beautiful alien hologram still has less time on the screen and could be the most interesting character to watch, and only because she wears a stereotypical outfit "teeny bopper", completed by a short pleated skirt and pleasant. The final battle with the monster is over before you can say "Whiskey Tango Foxtrot, Finished". In a moment, you must ask yourself if you have just experienced a train wreck or if someone has just emptied you 3 liters of blood. <br /> <br /> Of course, this film provided a line that my My friends and I have to this day still repeat and laugh and was pretty much the only positive point of this otherwise abysmal picture. While the cast of the "protagonists" is "interrogated" by the fuzz, one of them answers the questions with the affirmation "What are you, a kind of asking question?" It comes so absurd that if you sit with a group of friends (who will not be your friends long if you actually make your friend look at it), you can actually feel one or two screams of laughter incredulous. <br /> <br /> Even if it's not about Manos or Eegah (it's not even serious enough to be classically bad), this movie will bother you with its awful dialogue, his unimaginative characters and his nonexistent special effects and still deserves to reside in the bottom 100. <br /> <br /> 1.5 / 10
