I saw that "The Foreigner" was in the list of films "The last 100" on IMDb. I did not expect much when I listened to the American channel a week ago, but I was hopeful. "Belly Of The Beast" (which was released a month ago) was a mess, but there were some beautiful landscapes and photographs and some pretty cool moments scattered around, so I thought this movie might have the same features . <br /> <br /> Alas, this film hardly respects the basic standards of watch. The script appears as the bastard of a novel by John LeCarre and a film by Richard Ludlum, but made by people who do not have the talent of these writers worthy of intrigue and characterization. Instead, what we've got is a dark, nihilistic, cryptic nest of confused motivations, entangled alliances and shootings. And shot in the chest. And bombings. And eviscerations. This corresponds to the director's style, which is based on shots stripped of "gritty / sluggish shots" every 10 seconds, as well as overwork and hyperactive jump cuts. These cinematographic devices were obsolete 10 years ago when MTV filmmakers used them for Whitesnake videos, and the director used them as a punch press, hoping to inject some cool into the techno thriller. the art house. <br /> <br /> Segal himself is really awful in this regard. He spends the whole film talking in a raucous and guttural half-whisper alternating two expressions: seeming to suck on a lemon while someone is shaking a little dung under his nose or looking constipated. And he is so stocky (and vain about it) that he never removes his feather duster to the length of the knee in front of the camera. I understand that it is difficult to keep control of the size of a male actor (although Denzel Washington and Paul Newman never seemed to have this problem). But you treat it by being honest about it and becoming an actor, you do not hide it with carefully chosen camera angles and long dresses. <br /> <br /> So I can not really know what's going on, and the movie gives me no reason to be interested in what's going on, and the protagonist is completely unidimensional and visually unappealing. Not a recipe for a good cinematic experience. <br /> <br /> Strangely, most of the sets and decorations are atmospheric and striking; In fact, if you filmed the film on almost any scene that was not a close-up of Seagal, you would be struck by the care and professionalism of the lighting, the colors and the composition and the beauty of the 'Eastern Europe. the parameters are. But dressing a rotten egg like a Faberg√© egg does not make it edible. And the procedure is rotten in the soul. <br /> <br /> There are "cool" movies (like "Versus"), visually striking but emotionally cold movies (like "Underworld") and paranoid conspiracy thrillers (like "The Bourne Identity" and his remake with Matt Damon). And then there is this thing, which can not decide what it wants to be, claims to be all that and fails because it has neither courage nor soul. <br /> <br /> This is a professional film with a real budget so you can not really put it in the same class as "Manos", "Killer Shrews" or "Hobgoblins". But I prefer to watch these three movies several times in a row than to watch "The Foreigner" again, even once.
