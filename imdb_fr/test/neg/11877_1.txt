I have seen some bad action movies in my life, but this one is just awful. I think it's even a waste of time to write this, but I'm going to make it short. Why this movie is nil? Here are 10 reasons: 1. Very amateur realized and cut. 2. Bad Bad Bad actor of the entire cast. 3. Silly dialogs and too many clich√©s. 4. Too many holes in the plot, many scenes do not add up. 5. Bad photography (and many continuity problems). 6. Ridiculously bad performance on the part of the main actress. 7. Unreliable action scenes (and not too good either). 8. Even for a Snipes movie, it shows a big lack of theater material. 9. Scandalous accents (of all actors). 10. Last, but not least - too much improbable fact, such as a football tournament in the US, the CIA must check its track record for new information about its employees, an explosion-proof mattress, and so on. Essentially - it's a waste of time, it's not funny, not fun, not even a joke - DON''t WATCH OUT !!! Seriously, do not do it.
