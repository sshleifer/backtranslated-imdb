Jackie Chan's first film where there is no sign of Chan's personality as we know it. This is Chan in a full story of traditional revenge genre that has been cloned and cloned again by countless producers and studios across Hong Kong, Taiwan and Mainland China. It's a very serious story that shows nothing of the humor and warmth that would catapult Jackie Chan to fame. It is also clear by looking at this that if he had not reinvented himself, we would never have known him, because his career would have been terribly short. As a full-fledged film, it is a beautiful but rather innocuous film. I was looking at her, in the middle of a martial arts marathon that mixed with all the other movies I had seen that day if I had not noticed Jackie in the movie. Honestly, I do not think the movie is really worth boring (there are too many other variations), unless you're interested in seeing where Jackie Chan started.
