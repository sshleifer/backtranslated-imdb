I have always hated this delayed show. I liked Cartoon Network's shows like "Dexter's Lab" or "Megas XLR," but I never liked that piece of shit, mostly because it has stupid characters (the good guys or the bad guys) seems to be mentally retarded) they have silly voices (especially Bubbles, she's supposed to be the "cute" character of the show, but she's incredibly boring) the story lines are very, very stupid, some episodes could have been interesting, but almost always the show becomes childish and cheesy, there was no nice character, the music was awful, and the animation was the worst I've ever seen.Even a five-year-old could draw better! do not see why everyone seems to love this trash can. "The Powerpuff Girls" seems to be one of the worst caricatures ever made, and luckily, "Foster Home for the Imaginary Friends" by the same creator was far from better .
