Sometimes, halfway through a movie, I begin to wonder what the creators thought was the reason they decided not to burn all the movie sequences, but rather to release a movie that has no real merit. And I mean any type. This film does not even stand up to pornography made for cable. In fact, Heaven's Tears is completely boring and sometimes a little disturbing in its naivety. The girl, who is eighteen, remembers me, masturbates thinking about an older Nazi who hit her with a car - the "bumping into the hall as a way to introduce herself", a syndrome drawn from sitcoms and movies by Robert Zemekis. Then, at their second or third meeting - get this - he's the shy, the one who resists the girl's sexual advances, and yet all she has to say is, "I'm old enough. I 'm wanting, "and he takes her to bed. Then, after having slept with this girl he hardly knows, he feels finished, as if he could die in bed with her and he would have lived a busy life. It's like "Lolita" without a bit of social and personal comment. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is the most boring part of the film. No interesting angles or originality, not even for sex scenes, supposed to be the main attraction of this kind of films. The scene of masturbation is just a camera surrounding the bed of the girl (very wrong, as if it was on a stage), and it is interspersed with his fantasy of the man taking a shower in a waterfall. The scene "I'm done" is just a close-up of the right side of the girl (upside down) with the guy on top of her, and it's the same plan for all the time, even though There are repetitive cuts a scene quite different from the elder sister of the Nazi, who has an incestuous crush on him (she is ridiculous and stupid, so it does not matter). I think everything lasts between five and ten minutes, and it's neither instructive nor exciting.
