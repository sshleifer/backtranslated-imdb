I had a bad feeling when I saw the cheap title work. It only took a few scenes to confirm that this movie is a real evil! The only pleasure I could get from it is to laugh at technical flaws (for example, the background audio "car sounds" simply disappears during the scene with Danny and Dog in Dog's car). The production shows a total lack of imagination (example - the firing of machine guns in slow motion is repeated several times). Sandra Bullock plays a vital role, totally useless for the plot. To say that this film actually has a plot more than just deserves writing. The ancient computer equipment is quite interesting. This film was released in 1982 (and not in 1987, as the IMDb database indicates), then the current "advanced technology" was an orange screen on a 4.8 MHz IBM PC with floppy drives. Maybe the PC was the real star of the movie ... at least it was interesting. <br /> <br /> We had this on DVD for a few dollars in Walmart's bargain baskets. As the other reviewer notes, we paid too much!
