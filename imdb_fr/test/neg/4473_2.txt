Hollywood will stop at nothing to make money on a film even if they have to continue to drag the stereotypes and put them in the most impossible and stupid situations. This effort is a clear example of that and I truly believe in my heart that a film like this is irresponsible racially. The story tells the story of a divorced lawyer, Peter Sanderson (Steve Martin), who was chatting with a woman on his computer. When he finally meets her, she turns out to be the opposite of what he expected. Charlene Morton (Queen Latifah) is a stocky black woman who does not intend to go out with Peter, but wants him to examine his case where she was found guilty of robbery. He wants her to leave permanently, but she does not stop showing up at inappropriate times and, to save her job, he reluctantly agrees to look at the facts that concern her. <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILER ALERT *** ** <br /> <br /> Peter asks his children to stay with him and Charlene has been helpful in raising them, but everything suddenly a news bulletin announced that an escaped convict, Charlene Morton, had left prison. Peter tells him to leave when the FBI comes to search but he realizes she is innocent when his old boyfriend arrives and threatens him. <br /> <br /> This film is directed by Adam Shankman who makes things happen. at a good pace and it's a beautiful movie technically speaking but the screenplay is so improbable and each character is a stereotype to the point that a 1970 film entitled "The Landlord" is clearly more in sync with racial relations than this mess . I have always been a big fan of Martin and I think he is one of the most talented characters in the world, but he likes to work constantly and sometimes seems to choose the script that is given to him. On the other hand, I have always had a problem with Latifah and his way into Martin's life is so excessive that it immediately becomes unrewarding. The basic principle that Hollywood loves to use is the trendy black person showing a white pallor at the easing, then a street logic that will help them in their life. That's basically the story, but of course, they have to let Martin get dressed in black and do like a late Eminem, because Hollywood knows that's what viewers want. Well, everything about this movie insulted me a lot and it's not because I do not have a sense of humor but unfortunately (for Hollywood, anyway), I use the logic and the good meaning when I watch a movie. Yes, I appreciated Eugene Levy's speech, but are we supposed to believe that he would be immediately attracted to Latifah? I suppose that weird things have happened and how often does a main actor get killed before being saved by something in his pocket? Would not a cell phone break if hit by a bullet? Even if you are the most fan of Martin and Latifah, I would not recommend it. I know I've said it before, but it's not an attempt to make a good movie, it's an excuse to try to make money!
