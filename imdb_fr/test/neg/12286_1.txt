The adventures in Dinosaur City, although it's a creative idea, was a nauseating attempt at filming atrocity. To be sucked into a television and into a new world is interesting. Three teenagers obsessed with half-animated dinosaurs are not obsessed. Do not waste the time or power of the brain to see this certain loser. I would not even let my kids watch it.
