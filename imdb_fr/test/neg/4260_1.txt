it is by far the most pathetic film that Indian cinema or any cinema has invented. It's totally a shit. The scenario does not stand up. it is shameful for such a respectful actor to make such a shameful film. the little respect he had is lost forever. he should have retired a long time ago instead of ridiculing himself and losing all self-respect. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. In addition, I would suggest that Amitabh should already be retiring. I wonder how IMDb gave recommendations to this film. there are no films so horrible that recommendations could be made. seeing movies such as Devdas in the same vein as this movie is a serious injustice to a decent movie. Overall, I could say shamelessly.
