After the death of his father, a widower, in a riding accident, the young Tom Burlinson (under the name of Jim Craig) is entrusted with the management of his Australian farm "Snowy River". Only his seasoned and armed prospector, Kirk Douglas (under the name of Spur), can help. Times are tough, so Mr. Burlinson goes to work for Mr. Douglas's wealthy brother-breeder, "Mr. Harrison" (also played by Kirk Douglas). When a big job comes up, Douglas (older?) Silver-haired feels that Burlinson is too young and inexperienced to do it; Burlinson stays behind and falls in love with the boss's daughter, Sigrid Thornton (as Jessica Harrison). <br /> <br /> The least satisfactory aspect of "The Snowy River Man" director George Miller is low scenario. Observe, for example, the sequence of events "Jessica is lost". The girl is lost in one of these "storms", fleeing. Her anxious father gathers a group of drunk men to find her, after predicting the bad weather. Miss "Jessica" rolls on the edge of a cliff that seems convenient. Father and suddenly sober men do not check Burlinson's farm. The hero Burlinson discovers the girl. After making a fire, he decides to kiss her. <br /> <br /> "Romance" is played too innocently for a man and woman as attracted as Burlinson and Mrs. Thornton. To make matters worse, the Douglas brothers have a "dark story" that is revealed before any mystery is built about it. The main attraction here is the Australian landscape. <br /> <br /> **** The Snowy River Man (1982), George Miller ~ Tom Burlinson, Douglas Kirk, Sigrid Thornton
