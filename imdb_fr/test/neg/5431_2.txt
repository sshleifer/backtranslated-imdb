CONGO is probably the worst big-budget movie of the '90s. It's so bad that you can watch it again and again. A group of people with different agendas bury themselves deep in the darkest Africa, where they meet a temple of wealth, as in MINING KING SOLOMON, but with cannibal gorillas that keep these riches. For their part, humans have a "talking" gorilla named Amy who helps save the day at one time or another. So much for the plot. The dialogue is meaningless, the actor is almost uniformly atrocious, certainly campy (Tim Curry and Ernie Hudson are both present to ensure ham factor) and the special effects are catastrophic. Wait to see the cannibal gorillas. And lava! Oh yes, did I mention that there was a volcanic eruption to crown the grand finale? Laura Linney, from all over the world, is here for this bumpy ride. What could she think? It's about the same time she appears with Richard Gere and Ed Norton in PRIMAL FEAR, a movie that kept her famous.
