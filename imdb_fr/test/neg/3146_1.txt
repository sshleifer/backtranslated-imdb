When I was younger (oh about 2), I watched Barney for the first time and liked it. BUT, at the time, I did not really have a brain either. And now, I look back and see what is a horrible show "Barney": First of all, everything on this show is scary. Barney, the main character, is a horrible talking purple dinosaur who teaches 13-year-olds what to do by "imagination". (* Shudder *) BJ (I know what you think of his name.) A smaller but more scary yellow dinosaur that's set up to be "supposedly" cool. But in fact, it is exactly the opposite. After watching a few episodes with B.J. walking sneakily with his cap slightly turned over and making some not-so-funny jokes, I wanted to scream. Baby Bop-oh-oh-god! (* Vomit *) oh-oh-oh-anyway Baby Bop is the worst idea of ​​a character of all time. It's a green triceratops (it's a dinosaur) with a yellow cover. His remarks of "hee-hee-hee" and Barney's praise for "super-deeee-doooper" make it difficult to miss every episode, as grade seven students become familiar with forms and manners. <br /> <br /> And that, my friend, is what makes this show really horrible.
