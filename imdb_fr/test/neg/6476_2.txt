I was 12 years old when I saw the original movie (I lived in Italy and the Italian title was "FBI, OPERATION CAT!"). It was a fun movie and not just for kids. This terrible remake is pathetic even for a child of 5 years! What has caused Disney to ruin its reputation and the memory of a beautiful film that I do not know and I can not believe it? Even the title track of the original film (the original version and the Italian version dubbed) was extremely enjoyable and created the atmosphere of the story. On this remake, the title song is even worse than the movie itself. It was nice to see Dean Jones even though, for an appearance like a cameo, he was a regular at Disney movies. Honestly, I do not see anything positive in this film redone.
