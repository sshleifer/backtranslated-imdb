After seeing the Blues Brothers DVD release and their mention of "Wired" on Belushi's biography, my boyfriend and I were hungry for additional information about John Belushi. I had heard about "Wired" but did not know much about it and found it at the back of the local rental store. I understand that Dan Akroyd was really impressed by this film and I thought it was because he did not describe them well. But that has nothing to do with it. <br /> <br /> The movie starts well, until they find themselves at the morgue in John's body. When he wakes up on the autopsy table and decides to run, she begins to have no taste for this film anymore. John is subjected to criticism of his life and all the turmoil he created with "Angel", a Puerto Rican taxi driver with a sense of naughty humor - subjecting him to criticism and trying to get him through. "> <br /> The two actors who represent John and Dan are nothing like the proximity of the real actors (not to mention those who are close, Lorne Michaels, for example), which makes any attempt at concentration on them difficult. and how they were in real life ... but that's the tip of the iceberg. <br /> <br /> I think it was supposed to be an "artistic" film - John being constantly tormented by drugs (ie soap powder in the bathroom being cocaine), so that it was also difficult to follow, the flashbacks are agitated, which also makes it difficult to understand. <br /> <br /> The most tasteless scene is probably the one where John is (literally) forced to undergo an autopsy and suffers as he withdraws his heart to weigh him., saying that it was unusually large to because of drug use, obesity, yes, we get the point his In the grotesque representation. <br /> <br /> There are very few actors known in the film, (where is Carrie Fisher And for example, they were incredibly close. And Jim Belushi would have been a great person to show), it seems VERY inexpensive, (we had the impression that the graphics are from the early 80s or the late 70s). the film was shot in about a week and, overall, did not show the side to John at all. I felt like I knew a little more about him watching episodes of Saturday Night Live. <br /> <br /> On a last note, Bob Woodward discovers a narcissistic feeling by placing himself in the film, arguing with John for writing his life story. For someone who was supposed to be very high up, with respect to Nixon's collapse, his caliber of person could match any National Enquirer writer, and thereby lose any interest in one of his work from now on. <br /> <br /> PASS THIS FILM. If you want to know more about John, watch his films, watch excerpts from Dan Akroyd talking about him or hope someone will have the taste to make another film about John that is an extension of " Man on the Moon ", we expected. I guess it was a kind of "moral" movie - you know, do not do drugs, but I guess the creators of this movie did not understand that his death had forced a number of people (like Carrie Fisher,) to stop doing drugs altogether for this reason.
