It is extremely rare that I see a 1955 film that I do not like. Black, JD, Sci-Fi, Drive-Ins; I dig all the more. Robert Aldrich is a director who has done a lot of great work, and most of the actors have great performances under their belt. So what was wrong? <br /> <br /> When I was working in the independent film world, we were talking about something called "actor movies". Actor films are films that can only be visited by other actors. The actors like "actors' films" because they have the chance to see ACTing - a completely exaggerated melodrama. Actors like to have the opportunity to let go completely "give everything they have" and they get a great satisfaction from watching other actors do it. In many interviews with actors, they said "he was an excellent director, he never embarrassed me in any way". In fact, it is the opposite of the good staging, because the goal of a director on the set is to prevent the actors from making a fool of themselves (which, if he has the opportunity, will always be the case). <br /> <br /> Apparently, Robert Aldrich forgot about this project. Or maybe he was sick. Or maybe he thought there was no hope of saving the script in the first place, so what? Anyway, here's an example of a less known movie that you'd better forget. The characters gesture, pontificate and usually block it all along. One thing I can say is realistic: it's happening in Hollywood and everyone acts as if their little problems are the most important thing in the world. It's not fun to watch, but it's realistic. What is unrealistic is that a producer who is desperate to keep his actor under contract will do his utmost to frustrate him in almost every conceivable way, including forcing him to engage in illegal activity. But this contradiction and other plots lead only to melodrama, which increases the possibilities of cruel and crying accusations. <br /> <br /> I came to the end of this film, which is no worse than a "3" out of 10 in my book. But why test your own stamina when there are so many things to rent?
