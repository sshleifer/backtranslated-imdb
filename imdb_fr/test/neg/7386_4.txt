Even if it is the first film of the group of broken lizards, it is the last film that I saw. Having taken advantage of Super Troopers and managed to sit in the shit dred and beerfest club, I was surprised to learn that they had already shot a movie. Now, I did not sit down with high hopes, but I was hoping for a fun party on campus. My friend asked me to keep in mind that they are younger (obviously) and that this is their first foray into the cinema. I did it and I was always disappointed. Not taking away the acting and comedy skills of the BL guys, they were OK. All the film was tiring, clich√© and frankly boring. Some of the other actors in the movie were really mediocre. And the game of rugby did not even look like rugby. Poor showing. They have improved considerably with Super Troopers and have since decreased. Hope they get in shape with Super Troopers 2
