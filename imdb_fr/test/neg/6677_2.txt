After eating "Human Pork Chop" and having digested it well, I felt myself being asked and obliged to inform potential viewers that chewing this product was not fun and that its substance had low nutritional value. <br /> <br /> nature of this movie, the following is going to be a WARNING more than a REVIEW. This is the first time I wish there was a button "I do not care to score this movie" on IMDB, because the only reaction to this annoying piece of TRASH is stasis and indifference. Each possible note would do an injustice to all the other items listed here, a "10" is out of the question anyway, "1" might persuade some readers that this is one of those cases where "it's so serious that is REALLY bad and it's kewl! ", and" 5 "is not satisfying too, people might think, it's an OK-flick and okay if you want to have fun, but this is not ... Honestly, it's not a "10", a zero or a 5, it's nothing, a black hole, A FUTILE WORK DESIGNED BY AN EMBRYO. I bought the DVD of area 3, which was cheap ($ 7 !!!) and at least good image quality. I bought it mainly because of the positive and promising reviews published under my own entry. Oh, my boy, should I be disappointed? This film is neither shocking, nor disgusting, nor annoying, nor ... it's not even laughable, it does not take too seriously, but serious enough not to be comic. A really amateur and passionless effort. The only sequence that I found disturbing is that two sneering thugs put a naughty dog ​​in a bag and hit him against a brick wall ... but even such a cruel place only leads to bad execution. TOILET SCENE cited later is unrealistic and filmed without any sense for suspense, suffering or humiliation - the droppings look like painted marmots !!! There is a butcher's scene at the end of an 85-minute loooong where three men dressed in a plastic raincoat (a montage that is also found on the cover of the DVD) begin to get rid of the body of the wife. It reminded me of "American Psycho" and "Shallow Grave". Now, these films deserve to be viewed and are true masterpieces. <br /> <br /> Let's be realistic for once and do not rush to make every Asian myth a myth. Horror movie, as seems to be happening lately ... <br /> <br /> If you're looking for an Oriental horror, try Danny Lee's masterpiece with the same title (English) "Ba Xian fan dian zhi ren rou cha shao bao "(human pork chop), it dates from 1992 and has been compared - not without reason - to" Henry: Portrait of a serial killer ". There is also a similar film telling the same story of another film crew called "Ren tou dou fu shang" ("There is a secret in my soup") of the same year, somehow a rival production. It is available as a DVD of region 3 and by most people considered superior to "Peng shi zhi sang jin tian liang". I might add a few words about special effects ... What special effects?!? ... there are some cut members, they look awful - in a bad way - probably "Made in Hong Kong". <BR /> <br /> That's about all the information I can share on this topic, hopefully it will be useful ... ENJOY YOUR MEAL!
