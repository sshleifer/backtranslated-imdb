You must see this movie, it's a big bottom note in the movie's story. When this film was made, the American film industry reached the bottom of the sucking. Watch this movie, laugh and regret having wasted the last two hours of your life. It's the worst acting game I've seen and even worse the achievement. The bad guys laugh as if they came from a circus of clowns and if the guys who played "Scary Movie" want to make a parody of superhero movies, they just have to take the screenplay of this movie and make a remake, called Black Scorpion III: The threat of very bad movies that somehow manages to attract production companies in a consecutive suicide.
