The film uses random events of historical importance as a backdrop and is happy to travel through the life and chronology of its three central characters. What can we ask? The problem with this film is that the screenplay becomes the "story", not the characters or their lives. <br /> <br /> It starts with a group of rich and aimless children (and a wealthy couple too) drawn to the Naxalite movement. Case, rejection and separation follows. People are doing, apparently. Only until the heroine imposes on them. Not once but twice. After a pause in the "Movement", the next obstacle for these three people is the urgency imposed on the country by Indira Gandhi. Many political figures roam for no obvious reason. Secondary intrigues are too artificial and do not give a logical total. <br /> <br /> The film tries to impose a false look but never reaches a real rhythm. Barely consistent at times, there is no maturation or growth in the arches of the 3 ex-college buddies. Even after being presumed married, betrothed, settled or something else, they are always too eager to drop everything and go to a village to sleep with the ex-lover or the ex-flame. What a fertile imagination the screenwriter possesses. So many words of 4 letters are used without rhyme or reason that it is downright abusive! <br /> <br /> Chitrangda Singh has a horrible American accent that she does not try to hide. It's hideous to hear his dialogue cliche in his mouth like, "What's up? I did not think you would come "(this, after the infernal nightmare she just went through) or, at first," I appreciate your concern but I can take care of myself. "Beurk What kind of clown has written dialogues for that? She invites her friend to take a cup of coffee 'South Indian' (not less), wishes a hello to someone and then wishes another night to the family.Now what is happening with CELA?!? <br /> <br /> The countless villagers and uncredited tribes are the best actors.The editing is really erratic with too many cuts.It is obvious that Sudhir Misra has bent over backwards to make a bold statement.
