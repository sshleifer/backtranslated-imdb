I do not understand how this trash was found on the shelves of the movie store, it's not even a real movie! It was amazing, me and a group of friends decided to watch it one night and it was the stupidest thing that none of us have ever seen, I could not believe it! We watched the first 15 minutes with fear that someone really thought about it and then made a movie. Are they on crack? I guess so, at huge doses. I doubt that anyone can love this trash. Is it supposed to be science fiction or comedy or what? I do not think the idiots who took care of that, they just decided to make a movie about nothing and see how many cuppers they could cheat on to watch it. Well, we put something on film, so let's bring it to the movie store and see if it actually puts it on the shelf - no, no, no. It's not a movie. Acting is like watching wooden puppets move and reading a book is how bad it is. I want to go to the movie store and complain and get my money back, no one should have to bear that shit. So I'm here to warn you - DO NOT RENT THIS FILM, it's the stupidest thing you've ever seen!
