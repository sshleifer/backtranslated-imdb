My father insisted that I watch this movie with him and I regret that I lost my time watching. I want to find this hour and a half! The little film "funny" is about the old Don Ameche lodged with his son, Tom Selleck. It turns out that Ameche is not just "forgetful", as has been said, but suffers from dementia (this is very similar to Alzheimer's disease). And, because daddy is so often "out for lunch", he has so many more problems - almost like the adorable tyke of BABY'S DAY OUT. The problem, however, is that you know that BABY'S DAY OUT is a fantasy and that the baby will be fine. Plus, you do not make fun of the baby for a malformation or an illness. But, in this case, we encourage you to laugh at a man who slowly loses his mind - and where is the humor in all this ?! If this film had been more successful, would the producers have made movies that made fun or people with cerebral palsy or a carnivorous virus?!?! Many people should have been ashamed to have made this movie.
