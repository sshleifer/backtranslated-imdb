I can not believe this show was ok-ed. First, P. Manoux does a horrible job replacing David Spade and the voice of Pasha is too serious compared to that of John Goodman. The theme song is so boring and the intrigues of the episodes are so stupid !!! The only good thing about this show is that Eartha Kitt and Patrick Warburton remain the voices of Yzma and Kronk. This show is a waste of money and a waste of your time. Half of the episodes are copied from the film. In my opinion, The Emperor's The New Groove was one of the best children's movies in years, but they were completely ruined by the realization of Kronk's New Groove and this show. You should watch shows such as Spongebob, Fairly Oddparents, Danny Phantom or Kim Possible, but not this show.
