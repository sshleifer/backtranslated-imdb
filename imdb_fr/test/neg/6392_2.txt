The character of Michael Caine has problems. He is an ordinary man, shortsighted and insecure, in his forties. He is married but his wife does not seem to like him anymore. He has a bad relationship with his only daughter. But his most immediate problem is that a surprisingly beautiful young lady, played by Michelle Johnson, pursues him too ardently, kisses him, fiddles with him and tries to initiate sex at every opportunity. What must the poor boy do? <br /> <br /> This film should be released from the Comedy section and placed under Science Fiction. Only an intergalactic brain chip can explain the actions of Michelle Johnson's character. Let's see - 3 billion men in the world - she can very well choose herself - she goes away with a clumsy and aging loser. It goes beyond a middle-aged male fantasy into something so delusional. You simply hope that all the people involved voluntarily submit to therapy. <br /> <br /> There is not really anything funny here. There are some quick-witted attempts by Caine, who often seems to play Hawkeye Pierce more than a new character. Joseph Bologna is like nails on the board. Michelle Johnson is not an actress - she has a crying scene that is sure to be a high school play - but she is beautiful and undresses. So buy the DVD, go to scenes 4 and 9 and forget the rest.
