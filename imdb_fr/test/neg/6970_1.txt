Considering that the film's reputation was really the worst of the worst, I was eager to watch Wood's Crappus Opus (my word); it's not necessarily more inept than the other Woods I've seen. However, being from the REEFER MADNESS film school (1938), GLEN OR GLENDA does not look as nice as his genre endeavors. In addition, it surely appears as the nadir of Bela Lugosi, legend of horror (his first of three "collaborations" with the director): one wonders if he was really aware of the type of film (given the story of the actor). heavy drugs and lack of sense of his cameo). In addition, Lugosi's idiosyncratic delivery is perhaps the most embarrassing here ... although Wood's script is mainly to blame for this - given the impossible dialogue (with repeated absurd allusions to "puppy dog ​​tails" and to the "big snails"), he handed him star! By the way, Wood himself plays the central role (under the pseudonym of Daniel Davis) - and, being just as useless in this area, he turns out to be a versatile dog! Dolores Fuller - his wife and co-star - was just as talented (she would also appear in JAIL BAIT [1954]) ... but, at the very least, the image where she finally lets Glen wear his sweater in angora has served Tim Burton's tender love. biopic ED WOOD (1994) his famous poster! <br /> <br /> Incidentally, this last film tells a meeting likely fictitious between Wood and Orson Welles - well, GLEN OR GLENDA constitutes, for all purposes, CITIZEN KANE (1941) Ed Wood, given its beautiful tendency to gimmicky technical narration: in fact, the plot's finest yarn is crammed with archive footage galore (many of them are irrelevant, such as the mind-boggling cases of S & M) and unsightly dream sequences (highlighted by the presence of a spy demon sporting thick, bushy eyebrows that would make Martin Scorsese crying with envy)! The film's sincere attempt to advocate for tolerance and a psychological analysis of the affliction / phenomenon of transvestism is however sabotaged at each turn by the pure amateurism of the process. <br /> For what it's worth, the edition I watched the "extended re-release version" which included six minutes of "depraved" footage (directed by W. Merle Connell) censored at the initial release! In addition, my copy was out of sync from time to time (which forced me to go back slightly so that the sound becomes as before), although, fortunately, this is due to the conversion of source to DivX format, unlike to the film itself. .
