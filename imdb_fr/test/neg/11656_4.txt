This was included on the disc "Shorts: Volume 2" - a rather dull collection of short films. Short films are part of my favorite movie styles, but the people who made up this second collection had a hard time finding quality content - and it was not as good as the first volume or other collections of short films. <br /> <br /> This short film gives the impression that it is terribly incomplete. There is a story, but so much left over that the viewer, like me, feels left out and dissatisfied. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a woman, her boyfriend and her Westie (a dog, by the way) going to an isolated beach. The lady speaks with an accent that is sometimes difficult to follow. Since I am hard of hearing, I would have loved it if it had been subtitled. Anyway, the boyfriend will swim while she takes a nap. When she wakes up, her dog is gone. She panics and asks the guy to follow her before looking for the dog. They spend most of their time arguing and being uncomfortable. Then, unexpectedly, they stop to make love. Later, they find the dog - the end of the story. <br /> <br /> Regarding the characters, both seemed rather dysfunctional and implausible. She was a demanding and demanding woman and he seemed to despise him. When we wondered why they were together, their little breakup of sex showed what link kept them together. <br /> <br /> Some would like the characterizations - I kept finding irritating and unreal people - more like caricatures could meet or know. In addition, the gain for all this is just not worth the wait (unless you want to see the guy naked).
