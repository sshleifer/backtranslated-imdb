What can I say about Ocean's Twelve? Who thought it would happen one day? A gigantic mess that gets lost halfway and can not go back. I surprised myself how bad it really was. Really! I have never seen the end properly because this film is simply unbearable. I am a big fan of the first but it is a lame excuse for a sequel. <br /> <br /> What was the interest of the holdup if they would return the money? The movie is just boring and lags so much that I can not sit through it. It's really bad. Stay as far, repeat, as far as possible from this movie. It's worthless.
