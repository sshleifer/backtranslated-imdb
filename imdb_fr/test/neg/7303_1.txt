The classic "Plan 9" by Ed Wood has been considered for many years as the worst film of all time. Forget that. The Roller Blade Seven is infinitely worse. The cast is composed of brothers of famous and almost famous people or has been actors and actresses. The plot with the budget and the script are non-existent. The runtime is not composed in the classic Ed Wood style of using archive footage. Instead, there is an endless slow motion and repeated actions. And as for The Roller Blade Seven are not even seven of them! <br /> <br /> You have to watch this movie to know how bad a movie can be. Give independent filmmakers hope.
