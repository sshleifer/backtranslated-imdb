Most people have the luxury of grabbing the title of a film and learning before watching it, but unfortunately, I have never been part of that kind of people. I would not even read the synopsis for fear of the tellers, but there are two aspects to that, because if you ignore these warnings and even give a chance to a movie after it appears in theaters, you come at your own risk and Finished with a bad taste in the mouth, that's exactly how I feel about this silly movie. <br /> <br /> Honestly, the only good thing about Shakalaka-Crap-Crap, these are some of his title title songs). Even the always promising talent of Kangana Renaut's talent (Metro, Gangster, Woh Lamhe) is seriously ruined as she embodies Ruhi, the woman who caught the attention of the two main characters of Bobby Deol (who plays AJ, a music producer without roots). and Upen Patel (who plays Reggi, an upcoming artist who crosses AJ's path). Celina Jaitley is supplying the right amount of OOMPH required by a mobster who is being put in jail by Reggi (whom she helped put her foot in the door of the record industry). It does not look like a mix or a movie that should include Anupam Kher, right? Well, you're wrong because he's Reggi's father (another spoiled talent). <br /> <br /> The film might not have been so bad if it had not killed too much the writing behind Deol's character. The moral message was too preached (revenge had a deadly dark side) and the end was too exaggerated for you to wonder why you sat in front of such a stupid film. Really, it's the quintessence of shit.
