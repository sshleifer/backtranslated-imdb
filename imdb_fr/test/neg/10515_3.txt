Ron Hall fires a triple threat as he writes, directs and plays in "Vampire Assassins". Derek Washington (Hall) is your shot of a police officer on a mission that is up to his neck in a mad vampire action. Throwing his badge, he looks for the latest vampire killer (not Buffy!) To take back the streets and defeat the leeches in the grave. <br /> <br /> "Vampire Assassins" is a horrible film. He snatches so many movies (can you say Blade?) That he never even tries to establish his own identity. The script is non-existent. The action is horrible. Who said that a micro-budget stimulates creativity? There is nothing interesting here. You will not get anything but a headache. Avoid it at all costs.
