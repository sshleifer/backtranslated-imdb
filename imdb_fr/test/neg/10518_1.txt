There are some excellent Canadian films. There are crappy ones. Last night, I watched one of the crazies. This is not the typical Canadian movie where he tried to be so different in being artistic. This movie tried to be a kind of Hollywood gangster movie. It was terrible. <br /> <br /> From the beginning, I felt it would be a bad movie. There were some of the best dialers a film could have. There was this voiceover for a scene and then she never came back. It always bothers me when filmmakers use voice over when they can not think of another creative way of telling a story. <br /> <br /> I know I'm in the Canadian film industry, I should support my brothers, but this film is undesirable. The premise looks like a soprano episode, but it's not realistic. The boss of the mafia of a banker is on his death bed and orders the son to legitimize the company. Not so original. And the workers complain, but they just take the fact that they will soon lose their jobs as if nothing had happened. To make it legitimate, they use extortion. Irony. But not the good kind. Then, a girl who had a terrible wig and a birthmark of Elvis covering half of her face steals the main character and rapes it a little. Anyway, this guy for whatever reason now likes to dress as a girl. Then this banker connects with a prostitute, while he has a beautiful future wife at home. But he falls in love with the prostitute because the prostitute dresses like a man and wears makeup. She makes him sing with pictures of him wearing a bra and panties. Still, he still loves it. He also has no reason to leave his fiancé, but he does so to be with the prostitute. <br /> <br /> For a movie about organized crime and the sexual fetish, there was no action or sex. It was like a late-night Cinemax porn movie without the good stuff. The potential sex scenes were neither hot nor sexy. It was too amateurish The film had nothing to envy to the lame plot. <br /> <br /> I do not think it's the actor's fault. I think they had a terrible script to work on. What stands out the most are the ridiculous characters. The villain's name was Uncle Bunny or something. But the name was not important. It was that they were all clichés. The dialouge was laughable throughout the film, and other moviegoers were laughing at certain "serious" moments of the film. Then, the worst of all. It must have been the least expensive end. If you remember, you played like a kid with imaginary pistols or toy guns. It was essentially the end of the film. But I was more than happy that it ended, and I had to warn my Canadian compatriots not to waste time or money watching this film.
