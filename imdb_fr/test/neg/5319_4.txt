Peter Hunt started as a very talented film editor and got his first wrist shot when he directed James Bond's film "The Secret Service of His Majesty" (considered by many Bond fans as the best of the world). series). Other titles in his filmography include epic scale adventure films such as "Gold" and "Shout At The Devil", both adapted from Wilbur Smith's novels. "Gulliver's Travels" is a strange on his list of films; it seems strange that a director of Hunt's style and expertise chooses to make such a movie. This film looked twenty years old, even when it was shot, and in all honesty, it just did not work. And there is nothing that Hunt (with his usual eye for quick action), or star Richard Harris (who can usually animate the most oversized roles) can do to save this one. <br /> <br /> Lemuel Gulliver (Richard Harris) is a brilliant medical student who lives in Bristol in the 17th century. His father (Norman Shelley) wants him to go to London to make a fortune. but Gulliver prefers the idea of ​​receiving a lower salary, but much more adventure as a ship's surgeon aboard a ship called "Antelope". During a trip, the Antelope is washed away by a storm and hits a reef. The ship is sinking and everyone is lost, except for Gulliver ?? who finds himself stranded in the Lilliput realm. When he turns around, Gulliver discovers that the strange territory where he ran aground is populated by incredibly small humans, no bigger than his toe. For them, he looks like a giant. They persuade Gulliver to help them in a war against another race of tiny people living on an adjacent island. But Gulliver does not like to be manipulated for purposes of war and devastation, so he plans to escape. <br /> <br /> It only remains for Harris to wear the entire film here. His first two scenes involve other actors, but once he is shipwrecked in Lilliput, he spends the rest of the film treading the knee and playing alongside his animated counterparts. The idea of ​​mixing real action and animation was not new at the time, but it was certainly not widespread. Some Disney movies like Song Of The South, So Dear To My Heart, and Pete's Dragon had tainted the idea, but it was still in its infancy. "Gulliver's Travels" is not a particularly animated film, but the scenes showing the interactions between Harris and his co-stars of the cartoon are at least performed with skill. From time to time, the film tries to stay true to its satirical origins (there is a scene in which we learn that Lilliput went to war with his neighbor because of the eggs!?! - and it seems that wars can begin by the most ridiculous of things). But basically, it's really a children's movie and the satirical nuances are barely inserted. Everyone involved did better things during their career? "Gulliver's Travels" could fill an otherwise empty afternoon, but other than that, it's an unforgettable and disappointing experience.
