Police Officer Michael (Tomas Arana, "The Church") has his hands full as he investigates a serial killer who left some of the bodies of the people he murdered at Tracy's (Joanna Pacula), recently widowed. Mike needs to find a way to prevent the corpses from accumulating, while perhaps finding love at the same time. <br /> <br /> The film "giallo" of old pervades this film, even if we know who the killer has just started, and the film contains some good pieces of scenery (a particularly memorable scene in a school of the blind is especially memorable), but it does not make much sense when everything is over. say and do not either. In sum, not as good as Bava's previous "Macabre" nor his first two movies "Demons", but pretty nice if you can forgive the rather scandalous plot towards the end of the film. Too bad the DVD Image Entertainment lacked extras because I would have been interested in some. <br /> <br /> My note: C-
