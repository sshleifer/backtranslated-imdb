It's a nicer and sweeter Cyborg movie with a love story. Awww. It's not as bad as it sounds. The action, when she's here, is decent and Jack Palance, Elias Koteas and Angelina Jolie are always reliable. It's the fact that it's a sequel to Jean Claude Van Damme's dreadful film, or is it a capper to the Masters of the Universe trilogy? I am always confused about this. Anyway, there really was no need for this movie. What was the need? Angelina Jolie. She may be playing a robot assassin able to explode mid-coit, but what a way to go and even if this is her first film, she still has the presence that makes her a laureate.
