Glenn Ford, a New York boy who saved his money, his thumbs and his money to get to the ranch he bought in Arizona, where he hopes to find THE SKY WITH A BARBERE WIRE BARBEC. <br /> <br /> A movie with A Scenario and a Story by Dalton Trumbo, made by the awesome villain Ricardo Cortez and starring Glenn Ford, often agitated, and Richard Conte, restless, should not be as nice to live. Although the system - generally perceived as wicked cops, railroad bulls and real estate crooks - is as horrible as one might think of the leftist Mr. Trumbo, every proletarian is so sweet and kind and so salty that he feels nauseated. It does not help that the heroine - a sweet blond girl who is an illegal foreign refugee fleeing Franco's Spain - is boring for the sake of scenario and action. <br /> <br /> So why look? Richard Conte, in his first role, already has his character and a very good role. And there are moments in the leftist camp of the 30s that are quite amazing. (Did Dalton absolutely have to play a big part of the film in the Russian Worker's mission? Only the portrait of a radiant Joe Stalin was missing!) This is also the main role of Glenn Ford (although his performance is not good). <br /> <br /> Why not look? Essentially, the film offers an unconvincing view, fits into a laughable political perspective and the two main actors have made much better films. In addition, Dalton Trumbo's strengths as a screenwriter are nowhere else. Instead, we get a movie that the Coen brothers, Barton Fink, could have written in a flash (and avoid that infernal fight with the writer's block).
