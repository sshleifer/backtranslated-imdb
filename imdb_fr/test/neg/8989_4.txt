I read a lot of hopes of readers of the book that it would be a faithful adaptation of the story of Nora Roberts. Not having read the book, I do not know if this adaptation was faithful but I know it was not good. In fact, the script was the best part of the movie, so congratulations to Nora Roberts. <br /> <br /> I planned and watched Carolina Moon because of Claire Forlani. I never knew if she was a good actress. She has been decent in some movies, average in others and really bad in this one. But Forlani was not alone. The performances were everywhere. Oliver Hudson was wooden and boring. Josie Davis was a hammy. Then, in the middle of all this role play on B, there is Jacqueline Bisset! She had nothing to do but to represent bitterness, but even when she slept, she was one step ahead of the others. <br /> <br /> Still, Forlani remains one of the most breathtaking women in the film industry has not been disappointed with this ability here. I think Forlani can be more than candy for the eyes, but until she makes a good performance in a good movie, she continues to excel in this area. And, I will continue to look closely at everything she is involved in. Fandom is fun that way. <br /> <br /> This movie, Carolina Moon, was pretty bad. In addition to the bad action (the false accents of the South are really troublesome), the direction was pedestrian. It was not horrible. It's simply the caliber made for boring TV that you're used to seeing in Lifetime. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of one of the stars, you can probably enjoy Carolina Moon, for this reason. I did. If you are a fan of the book, you may want to see the story on screen, albeit in a dull form. Otherwise, this film is tasteless.
