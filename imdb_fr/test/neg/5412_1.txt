Thanks God for the DVR and the high speed of his fast forward. Even with that, I could not sit in this parody anymore. When they met the old Indian asking for beans, I gave up and I erased it. Is this the best channel that SciFi can offer on Saturday night? How about old classics instead? The idea of ​​a joint special forces unit was bad enough. Looks like they want to save money by filming everything in the woods. What more can i say? It was so awful that I do not think I could find enough lines to make enough space to review it. But, it seems that one more line will do it. Save your time, let alone your money on this dog from a movie.
