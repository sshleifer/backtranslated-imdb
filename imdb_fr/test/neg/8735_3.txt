First of all, I would like to say - for the record - that it is incredibly stupid to call your film "Embryo" when the subject is exclusively devoted to scientific research on fetuses (animals and humans) aged 12 to 16 weeks . The embryonic stage is completed at the end of the eighth week of pregnancy and from that moment, the unborn creature enters the fetal phase. Okay, honestly, I did not know all that, but I took the effort to look for it and it's also the least thing that the creators of "Embryo" could have done. Do not worry I'm not just stumbling over details or being overly bitter, there are several other reasons to say why "embryo" is a huge failure. Real science can be considered boring and inaccessible. Science fiction is therefore a cinematographic genre created specifically to make educational science subjects, moreover tedious and yet more educational, more interesting and more understandable for a wider audience. By describing ambitious scientific experiments that go terribly wrong or space missions that encounter diabolical extraterrestrials rather than light-years of emptiness, filmmakers generally manage to entertain people with spectacular special effects while teaching them useful little stories about Science. To make a good sci-fi or at least half-decent sci-fi movie, writers and directors need to adhere to one basic rule: do not be boring! If they can not fulfill this condition alone, the viewer might as well read a theoretically accurate book. Something went wrong during the production of Ralph Nelson's "Embryo". The basic premise is potentially fascinating and even interesting because we are all concerned about saving the lives of unborn babies. Some important names were also involved in the production, such as the main stars Rock Hudson ("Giant", "Seconds"), Diane Ladd ("Chinatown", "Alice does not live here anymore") and the director Nelson himself even being responsible. for the acclaimed classics "Soldier Blue" and "Charly". So what went wrong? Simple. The script is irreparably boring, cliché and everything is incredibly stupid, because the laboratory's decor and scientific equipment are clearly too primitive to allow any medical breakthrough. <br /> <br /> Rock Hudson, in a very bad performance, plays a doctor who has not put any passion into his research since the death of his wife. When his car hits a pregnant dog on a rainy night, his passion comes back and he does everything possible to save the fetus from dying animals. He manages to keep a fetus alive, impressively accelerating his growth process and form to become an extremely intelligent dog. Because of the success of his intervention, Dr. Paul Holliston convinces his friend at the hospital to repeat his tests with the human fetus taken from the womb of a pregnant teenage girl who committed suicide. Unexpectedly, the woman continues to grow at a rapid pace, and after only a few weeks, she has become an adult woman, beautiful and super intelligent. The good doctor naturally falls in love with her, but the revolutionary treatment of new growth also begins to have horrible side effects ... Nothing happens absolutely during the first 45 minutes of the film, apart from a bunch of gibberish too improbable and too melodramatic and one or two deeply impressive turns made by the dog. The second half of the movie contains some (grotesque) action and suspense, but the stupidity of the dialogues and the incredible intrigues have already ruined the potentially fabulous idea of ​​Sci-Fi. There are really cool scenes, including the confrontation between Victoria and Roddy McDowall (in a memorable and extremely obnoxious role of support). The grand finale is absurdly grotesque and literally ridiculous. It's almost like Ralph Nelson played this last disastrous blow, as it was the general rule in contemporary thriller and science fiction cinema. The last sequence, including the horrific freeze frame taken at the end, certainly does not match the tone of the previous 100 minutes of the film. But anyway, my sincere admiration and respect for the dog and his trainers. An animal with so much intellect and talent would surely deserve to prove itself in a much better movie.
