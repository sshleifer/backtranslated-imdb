I do not know why people are so crazy about the show. It's so boring. The jokes are not even close to what we usually say funny It's as if Alex was saying something that is neither funny nor interesting and then suddenly there is a background that laughs. My friend and I simply looked at each other with an empty look, as if we were wondering, "What's so funny? !!". Seriously, every time we watch this show, you do not hear laughing or coughing. Just an empty look. So we stop looking at him. Personally, I'm a fan of sitcoms, so I tried to watch the show. But that shows us such disappointment. This show could be one of the worst comedy sitcoms ever organized ...
