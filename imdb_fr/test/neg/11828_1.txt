Ah Animorphs. I loved the series of books and I devoured them enthusiastically in college. When I learned that there was an adaptation on television, I was very excited. <br /> <br /> What a pity the final product was. I think for me, this is the time when Nickelodeon has stopped being a great and generic programming. <br /> <br /> So what was the problem with the series? Let me count the means: 1. The characters were horribly bad. In the books, the Animorphs were between 12 and 14 years old, the TV distribution was at least 18 years old. I remember being horrified when I saw the pictures of the cast for the first time. <br /> <br /> 2. Horror game / bad writing. I do not know who was to blame, so I plunged into the lumpy mass he was. Maybe it was due to the fact that the accelerated age of distribution hindered the humor, at least cute, that came out of age 13 because Marco - it's not funny. In fact, I do not remember a single comical moment of the band and there were a few. The actors were certainly not helped by the writing that was bland at its best and the slightly pathetic head in the worst. <br /> <br /> 3. My Lord, they were stingy with the budget. The final result of the Andalites should have convinced Viacom to remove the catch ... Their heads had slots that clearly indicated who the helmet was. <br /> <br /> 4. Back to the casting - Rachel was by far the biggest disappointment, far from being the warrior woman in the books, the best equivalent of the TV series was "the scarecrow". I also know that Cassie was an idealist, but there is a difference between "idealist" and "idiot". <br /> <br /> 5. One of the worst opening titles of all time. Should the music be so obvious? 6. Answer question 6, "yes", because everything else was silent, so why would the supposedly less intelligent viewers not hear a song like a brick by a lame rap-rock scam or something whatever else. Since then, there have been greater disappointments (Iraq, 2004), but in case I have not said it clearly - this show was void and was an abomination for the series of books on which she was supposed to be based.
