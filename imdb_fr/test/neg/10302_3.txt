This film starts badly and never really starts. The first scene shows a Life Flight helicopter landing. Just outside the window, you can clearly see the mountains in the background. For those of you who may never have been to Houston, there is no elevation change. The city is just above sea level and a 5-foot slope is considered a big hill. To go with this landscape, any shot outside the hospital immediately tells the viewer that he is not in Houston. The trees all have missing leaves or are pine trees, which Houston does not have much. Even the hospital, outside, is very incredible. Memorial Hermann Hospital is one of the best hospitals in the United States. It is located in the middle of the medical district, a few miles from downtown Houston. However, every shot outside the hospital suggests that this hospital is in the suburbs or even the countryside. <br /> <br /> It is obvious that the one who was responsible for the part of the film under the tropical storm has skimped because the many radar shots are wrong. The first radar image of the film is that of Hurricane Hugo hitting South Carolina. We'll see Kris Kristofferson later leave and one of his assistants tells him that Alison will be heading south through Houston. Yet, the radar image he shows clearly shows Alison moving to the north of the Gulf of Mexico to reach Houston ... probably the initial landing of Alison. <br /> <br /> As far as acting is concerned, it's not that bad. JoBeth Williams, Kris Kristofferson and Rick Schroder all do a decent job considering that it's a straightforward televised film. The plot of the story is decent and the fact that it is based on a true story makes it a little more entertaining. My only problem with the acting is the portrayal of Houstonians with thick thick Southern accents ... the actors all sound like they're coming from Birmingham, Alabama and not from Houston, Texas. <br /> <br /> The film does well and at the general audience, it does exactly what it is supposed to do: entertain. If you are looking for a factual account of what happened to the city of Houston in June 2001, you will be disappointed. One thing to keep in mind before watching this film is that it relies solely on the evacuation of Memorial Hermann Hospital, and not on Tropical Storm Alison, and the impact on the Houston Underground. If you want to get a factual account of the impact of tropical storm Alison on the Houston Underground, let me look at The Weather Channel's storm stories about Tropical Storm Alison. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 on *****
