I rated this film at 3 and it was generous. The landscape is heavy and loud, the acting is terrible. I think Peter O'Toole did a good job (Tiberius), but he must have been mortified when he saw the final editing of the film. John Gielgud, whatever his brevity in his appearance in the film, still seemed to play a role in Hamlet. Portions of basic pornography were neither erotic nor contributed much to the advancement of history. Ok, Malcolm McDowell had a nice ass and the guy who played Macro was handsome. The guy who played Claudius, looked more like Nero's traditional portrayal and was certainly at odds with Robert Graves' Claudius photo. The decisive murder (?) Of Caligula, wife and child, is inaccurate to the extent that he shows it after his death lying on stairs in an open-air area, while he was murdered in the underpass of the Palatine Hill that ran along the Domus Flaviana that still exists today. There are places in this film where almost everything has caught my attention, merciful distractions. If you want history, read Suetonius or Tacitus, if you want pornography and sadism, look at Passolini's "Salo", but stay away from this movie.
