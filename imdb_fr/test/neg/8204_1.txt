This distinction must go to the Harrow Dungeon. At least, Ed Wood's misguided attempt to make a sci-fi quality movie had the dubious power of "star" Bela Lugusi, Vampira, Tor Johnson, Criswell and Lyle Talbot. THE DONJON DE HARROW has no redeeming quality. What could have been an interesting and suspensive plot about an aristocrat stuck in a leper colony, perhaps in the manner of THE ISLAND OF DR. MOREAU or MYSTERIOUS ISLAND, is upset by the heavy dialogue and the monotonous sound of amateurs whose lines sink like pellets into an ocean of stupidity. The "special effects", which took place in someone's bathtub, further condemn this film to the dung pile. Even the treatment of leprosy derives from a Victorian interpretation of the Bible. The fact that leprosy can not be contracted in an individual in its final stages belies the plot of the plot that the aristocrat Fallon and his lady, Cassandra, contract the disease and eventually become the first occupants of Sade Castle , condemned to madness and inhuman cruelty. It is interesting to note that no member of the cast made another movie. No wonder, talent breeds talent; the lack of talent breeds forgetfulness, it is there that this film should find its deplorable end.
