I am a big fan of "Auntie Mame" with Rosalind Russell. She was really the ideal actress to interpret this character. <br /> <br /> I heard that Angela Lansbury was very good on stage in "Mame", but it's hard to imagine anyone defeated by Rosalind Russell. <br /> <br /> Lucy was such a great actress that her comics saved her performance in this movie where I think she was misinterpreted. Really, they should have nicknamed her voice sung. Hearing these songs sing at a faster pace and with loud voices really changes everything. effect. <br /> <br /> I just saw the revival of the scene in Washington DC and I think Christine Baranski was very good. Mame, Harriet Harris - the ugly smoking chain agent on Frasier - played Vera and she was particularly good. <br /> <br /> Both would be a good cast for a TV movie from this show. Maybe if this production reaches Broadway, they will consider filming it. <br /> <br /> I also think that Tracy Ullman would be nice like Agnes.
