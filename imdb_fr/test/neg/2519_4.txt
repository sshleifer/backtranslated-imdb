OK, it's a strange movie! Fans of Ed Wood Jr. will appreciate the "inventive" techniques that director George Barry uses, such as archival footage and cheesy vocals. He can make a crack in the wall in a conspiracy device! There is more humor than horror here, but I found the mix uneven. You will laugh and cry and you will probably wonder why you got your hands on it. Barry explains in the introduction that filming began in 1972 and ended in 1977 at a price of $ 10,000. It's 59 months and $ 9,900 too much! If you love your cheese from the camped side, with the vintage gore of the 70s, you might find an irresistible and weird snack.
