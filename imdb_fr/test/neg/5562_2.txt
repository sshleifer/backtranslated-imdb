Yes, absolutely horrendous, and it comes from someone who likes bad movies - but there is a limit. I enjoy all kinds of horror / suspense films and have seen wonderful works by European filmmakers. Broceliande is unfortunately not part of these wonderful films. The work of the camera is worse than the amateur. This is not the kind of very fashionable and fragile photographic work of MTV "the cameraman needs Ritalin", so many filmmakers use to camouflage their lack of talent. It's just a bad picture composition and a terrible picture composition. The acting is ridiculous if it is not entirely two-dimensional. The dialogues are elevated and unnatural - even more so than your usual horror / suspense film that plunges into pseudo-mysticism. I think the thing that upset me most was the horribly choreographed fight scenes at the end of the film. These were bad to the point of being ridiculous. I saw what a small budget can do, and it can work wonders. It was just a bad achievement. Very very sad.
