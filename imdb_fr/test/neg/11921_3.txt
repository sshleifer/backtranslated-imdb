I started to look at it but I did not believe in any of the characters. In particular, the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just did not work for me. The scenes between the owner of the bakery and the assistant were nice, but the rest was very slow. It was a very superficial film and it made me feel like watching a play rather than a movie. The characters were very "scenic" and the scenario was very much like a theater joke. At the moment the arsonist assaulted the assistant, I was bored and I did not care what happened next, so I turned off. Happy not to have paid to see him. Do not laugh or even smile once. There seems to be a strange tendency for Americans to classify their movies in the "comedy" category when they are weird funny rather than funny ha ha. I finally learned to avoid what the Americans call dark comedies, which are generally horrible, strange and insignificant. Now it seems that I will have to be a little more insightful when they will also qualify a romantic comedy movie. Maybe comedy means something different when applied to a movie rather than a series in America. I do not understand why the United States can produce incredibly funny comedies like Will and Grace, the King of Queens, but do not seem to be able to produce really funny movies without resorting to toilet humor. This movie was not rude or anything. But it was not at all a yawn ...
