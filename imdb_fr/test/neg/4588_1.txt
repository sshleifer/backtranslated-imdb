The hockey game I play and watch has something called "speed" that the actual hockey scenes in this lame movie can not even capture. Add to that a story that is clich√©, predictable and more stupid than stupid with some of the lurid music of the 80s that numbs your senses in every scene and you have "Youngblood". Oh, Keanu as a French Canadian, yes, it does not matter. Give me Dunlop, Braden and Hanson at any time ... ONE in ten.
