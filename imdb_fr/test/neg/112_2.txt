Now, I love Italian horror movies. The cheesier they are, the best. However, it's not old-fashioned Italian. Here's a week-long spaghetti sauce with rotting meatballs. It's amateur time at all levels. There is no suspense, no horror, with just a few drops of blood scattered around to remind you that you are watching a horror movie. "Special effects" are lights that go red every time the ghost (or whatever it's supposed to be) is around, and a string pulling bed sheets up and down. Oooh, can you feel the chills? The quality of a DVD is that of a VHS transfer (which actually helps the movie more than the hurts). The dubbing is below the lowest standards "bad Italian movie" and I gave it a star just because the dialogue is so hilarious! And what do we discover when she finally looks in the attic (in a scene that runs from minute to minute and night to minute) ... well, I will not ruin that for those who really want to see, but let's just say that it is not very "novel"!
