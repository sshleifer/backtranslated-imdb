This P. de S. was highly recommended by two friends who have a good taste <br /> <br /> (similar to mine) in the movies and who have seen more than anyone to my knowledge. <br /> <br /> I have no idea what they saw in this movie. Sad, cruel and repulsive is fine in an entertaining film, but it's a tempting effort to pretend to be a lowbrow movie. Is it a lowbrow highbrow? <br /> <br /> The Clich√© of Generational Gap Redemption of Social Value "comes to mind - Bill Pullman is trying, maybe a bit too loud, and aside from the kid, the rest of the game seems rather shy and a little lame. <br /> <br /> Save yourself from this and watch a movie called "In Cold" Blood "and" The Hitcher ". <br /> <br /> As someone said, it would not have been possible if Jennifer Lynch was not David Lynch's overrated girl.
