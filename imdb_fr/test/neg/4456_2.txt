Of all Alistair MacLean's book adaptations, I think this is the worst, but do not blame MacLean! It seems that everything this film shares with the novel has the same title. We have no suspense, no sense of apprehension of the mystery, no chance to really sympathize with the main characters. We spend all the time (or at least I did) waiting for Charlotte Rampling to get rid of her clothes (for Charlotte, it seems to take a remarkably long time!). Yet a glance at Charlotte Rampling's breasts really can not save this disastrous film. MacLean was once again dumped in the gutter to endure the sniping of these bitter and picking hacks who seemed to blame him for all the evils that occurred during the attempt to film his books. Poor old Alistair had to crawl into a corner and moan when he came out. At least "Bear Island" - which also uses the name Maclean but apparently none of his novel - was a little exciting. The excitement is here in expectation of the final credits.
