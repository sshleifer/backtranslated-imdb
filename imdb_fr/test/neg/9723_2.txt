Most of the reviews on this movie have been very accurate. It's an hour and a half of time wasting, after a group of very beautiful high school students moan and cry over life. There are about twenty minutes of magic and absolutely no scary or exciting moment. Our actresses are treated like buttocks and seem perfectly satisfied with their position. The main characters, these ipsmith threads are traveling posters in any pop culture clothing store. You can not understand with them, you can hardly understand them. The story is overflowing with itself and when it finally arrives at the final battle, it's nothing more than a volleyball match that does not last long enough to catch up with this torn scenario raped by the O.C.
