If you just watched All Dogs Go To Heaven and learn that there is a sequel, do not look at it. It's horrible. It's absolutely awful. They rush the characters to develop. Sasha, for example, starts singing so you can count her for love. And in the end, it sounds more like a dramatic romance movie than a comedy-adventure movie. They tear Charlie out of his character and replace him with a gushing, sweet but still rebellious version of him. <br /> <br /> The humor behind the character of Carface is completely lost. It's a totally different dog. He no longer has a cool voice, he is no longer the bad guy you love to hate, he's just a fad expressed by none other than Spongebob's Mermaid Man. Speaking of actors in the voice .. <br /> <br /> Charlie has a completely different voice. And even if it's not horrible, I do not like it. This is terrible compared to the excellent work of Burt Reynolds for the character of the first film. Dom DeLuise is beautiful as always, like Itchy. This character remains true, and that's why this movie gets a 3/10. Simply because Dom DeLuise was still expressing Itchy. <br /> <br /> Oh, and my last complaint. I know that Ann-Marie's movie was over and that he was gone, she now has relatives, etc., but did Charlie completely forget her? No mention to ALL of her in the second movie. I mean, even a small mention of Itchy would have been acceptable. (Ex. "Charlie, we have to go in. You can not take care of every child that needs to be saved.) Or something like that, I mean, he died living with her, she deserves a mention Particular. <br /> <br /> Do not look at this if you are looking for a wonderful sequel.
