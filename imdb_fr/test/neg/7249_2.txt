I bought this movie at Blockbuster for $ 3.00, because it sounded interesting (a bit Ranma-esque, with the idea of ​​slipping someone around a skeleton), because there was a pretty girl in a mini-skirt at the back and because there was a restricted viewing sticker on it. I thought it would be a sweet or at least a sincere story with a weird indie edge. I was 100% wrong. <br /> <br /> After looking at it, I wonder how he obtained the restricted vignette, because there is almost no foul language, little violence and the closest to nudity ( Honestly! I do not usually go in the hope!), It's when the girl wears her nightgown and we see her panties (we often see her in this movie, because anyway, she is wearing a miniskirt). Even anti-religious humor is tamed (and lame, caricatural, sincere, derivative, unoriginal and certainly not funny at all - it would be better to listen to "Would Jesus wear a Rolex in his own way?" This would hardly be called PG-13 (it is not classified), but Blockbuster refuses to let a person under 17 rent this piece, as if it were pornographic. could go and rent the modified version of Requiem for a Dream, but they insist that Zack and Reba are worse. <br /> <br /> It's like that, but not that way. <br /> < In a way, it worries me - the only thing that could offend people is the idea of ​​suicide at the beginning - if anyone needs to see movies that honestly portray suicides (not this one , but better movies like The Virgin Suicides), it's a lot of teenagers. R classified solely because of the suicide aspect, then I have little chance to turn a story I wrote in PG-13 film (the main characters have eleven and a half to twelve years). Suicide is one of the top three causes of death among adolescents (I think it's number 2). It is therefore likely that most adolescents have been or will be affected by it. <br /> <br /> Say no to this movie. , although. 2/10.
