After watching this film on a boring Saturday afternoon, I did not understand why so many people liked it. It was not "comforting" or "smart"; it was an amalgam of all the other "mismatched film getting together for a vacation and despite their ideological differences learning something from each other" movie never done. <br /> <br /> The characters are a bouillabaisse stereotype - We have the Blacks, Hispanics, Jews, Asians and Homosexuals - and they never do anything except what everyone expects of characters from a movie like this. The black mother states that "everything is fine, then" when it is mentioned that another black character is at church instead of helping to prepare dinner (because all blacks love the church), Hispanics only seem able to speak Spanish when they greet or greet each other. exclamations, lesbians just cuddle and kiss (and one of them wears a bandanna because all lesbians dress like Ani DiFranco), and the Vietnamese family owns a video store. In L.A. Imagine that. <br /> <br /> Oh, and the movie is called "What's Cooking" because every ethnic family is preparing a different version of what they think the Thanksgiving dinner should be! The black mother wants cornbread and macaroni and cheese, Hispanics are rolled with tortillas, the Vietnamese family fries spring rolls; I am surprised that there is not a bottle of Manischewitz on the Jewish table. All this is demonstrated by the ancestral tradition of "musical editing", where they play the "Wipeout" of Surfari, quickly changing the instruments used in the melody to reflect the respective cultures. Is not it cute? Be that as it may, once the director has finished establishing how different everyone is, he tries to show to the inner humanity that we, as all peoples, share all races , of all religions and cultures, by inventing unlikely and overly dramatic conflicts for each family. It would be a murderer to mention each of these conflicts, but rest assured, these are surprises, that is to say if you slept during the first half of the film. The theme of "dishonoring the family" is pretty strong overall. <br /> <br /> In summary, if you're the kind of person who loves these new movies, which revolve around stories of unlikely characters that intertwine, well, you still will not like this movie. If you like to circulate food for long periods around a table, you need to put it in your Netflix queue. But if stereotypes and clich√©s appeal to you, be sure to ask for Christmas. Or Hanukkah. Or Kwanzaa.
