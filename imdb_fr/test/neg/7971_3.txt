I must first say that I read everything about it and that I know it thoroughly, and I was excited to see it at last. But you have to read only the book on which this mini-series is based to realize that this is not the true story of what really happened almost 90 years ago. It is vaguely based on the facts, the rest is taken from the imagination of the screenwriter. And unfortunately, these changes are anything but successful and mostly totally useless. <br /> <br /> Where do I start? Vita and Violet did not use the names of Mitya and Lushka before the beginning of their affair, and meanwhile Violet also called Vita Dmitri and Julian. It was Violet who chased Vita with a dagger when they were teenagers. The "seduction" scene at the beginning of their Violet binding was much more passive than the one pictured here and certainly did not kiss Vita first. I could go on and on, these examples were all included when the series had just started. In addition to all these changes to the facts, the characterizations are all wrong. Sometimes Vita behaves like a crazy woman. Especially the scene where she saw the announcement of the engagement by the newspaper Violet is simply ridiculous. Vita kept her emotions inside. It was Violet who was capricious and showed her feelings (good or bad). All Vita did when she read was that she almost fainted, that's all. Being a gentle nature, Harold avoided clashes in real life, but here he is sometimes quite stern and accusing. Harold and Vita have always discussed their intimate things in letters, not verbally. And Violet ... I know this series is deliberately focused on Vita and Harold, but that does not mean that all the other characters must be mere marionettes on the sidelines. Here, it has a totally unidimensional character and the lines that have been given to it are mostly embarrassing and shallow. In fact, she was smart, talented, a pretty extraordinary woman who rarely gave the credit she deserves. I always thought that his person was much more interesting than Vita. In this series, his misery, his loneliness and his problems with his mother are totally ignored. The viewer also has few clues about her background and family, her relationship (and marriage) with Denys Trefusis she tied up, or how much she fought with Vita. Vita was the only love of his life, his reason for being, and if Harold suffered during an affair, Violette too. After that, his life was in shambles and it took him a long time to recover. Statue could have played the role of Denys, as deep as his character has. Lady Sackville-West is a caricature poorly drawn; an annoying chatter with an exaggerated French accent. <br /> <br /> The series ends with a totally badly written scene in Amiens, and that was the end of this affair, according to the scriptwriter. No, it continued a year after that, and its end was much longer and sad than what was presented here. But what do we care about the stupid end if the entire series has been stupid since the beginning. I have to give credit to the actors, they have tried to make the most of these roles, even though Janet McTeer as Vita is the only one who really shines. We can not complain about the settings either. All complaints go to the director and especially to the scriptwriter. Instead of insightful studies of character, there are too many sex scenes and insignificant conversations. Most of the scenes are too long, some are useless and do not add anything to the script. On the other hand, many details are shortened or completely omitted. In particular, there should have been more information about the young people of Vita and Violet and the development of their friendship. It's a fascinating story that deserved a much better adaptation. Maybe someday someone will do it. For the moment, much more can be said of this story by reading the book or letters from Violet to Vita, which are brilliant.
