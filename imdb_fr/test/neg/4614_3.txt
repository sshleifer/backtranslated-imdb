Ok, I thought it would be horrible. But when I saw him .. I was proved wrong. Emily Bergl did a superb job, as did Jason London. Sue Snell was underused and underwritten. The bad guys were ok, Dylan Bruno and Rachel Blanchard are definitely the stars. As for the things that teenagers do and how people claim that everything is wrong. It does not matter. My friends and I use the term "swank" a lot, I drove a car and I had someone run while I changed. That's about all there. I've never been to a post-match party in such a big house with its own light show. The dead are good. The best is a pair of glasses, a rifle and a pool ... all in this order. I must say there will be people who hate it ... but I'm not one of them.
