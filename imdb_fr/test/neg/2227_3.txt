Aside from some good moments of pretty raw violence, this painful film is particularly remarkable because it gives 68 minutes as being two hours. <br /> <br /> It begins with an interminably long intro where the Leeds family is presented, including two unbearable Tykes and their adult brother and sister, completely cliched Pa and Ma, and incredibly boring grandfather (played by Charles " Chic "Sales". During dinner, the family is disturbed by the shots and rushes to the window in time to see two men shot by criminals in the street. The gangsters flee into the family home, leaving them witnesses to the crime. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film is made up of Walter Huston, the crusaders' prosecutor interrupting from time to time protests against the crime trying to protect the family from the crowd. Everything ends predictably. <br /> <br /> The good points of the film include some decent penalty shots and a really nasty beating, Nat Pendleton as one of the gangsters, and the superb Sue Blane in a small role as a Leeds girl. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch Huston play his first crusade advocate, trademark, try the "Beast of the City" of 1932. Avoid this one if possible.
