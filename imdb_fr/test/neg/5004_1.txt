This film was a total cheese. It stank. The only good thing about it was acting. Otherwise, nothing remarkable. <br /> <br /> Great spoilers to come! Do not read anymore if you have not seen it! <br /> <br /> This film is centered on a family whose happy and wonderful life was broken as a result of their youngest son and later on discovering their eldest son. were abused by their child care providers. Although they call themselves liars before the court and the defense lawyer is a real sting, the jury convicts them and condemns them. <br /> <br /> In the end, all I can say to the director is: "Next time you want to make a film like this, do it differently".
