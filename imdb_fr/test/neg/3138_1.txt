I saw this at the Fantasy Filmfest in Cologne and I left the cinema halfway through this "movie" (with many other people), so maybe I'm not good at commenting on it , but I think the fact leaving "SC" is reason enough to do it. "CAROLINE FROM THE SOUTH." is a different film. People who need coherent narration, characters, or plot do not find anything in it. It's supposed to be an experimental film that focuses on the power of images. But these images have no power. They are so forced in their intention to swell people that they have nothing else to say. The narration of the narrator is simply boring, the visual effects are cheap. OK, the effects are good, but if it's the only thing to do, why be interested? Husseins' film is shocking and thought provoking - it is boring and boring by its non-creativity. Note: All storyless movies are not works of art and there is absolutely no creativity to break taboos - especially if everything is done as badly as in "S.C." I would suggest that director Hussein should visit a psychiatrist or film school before taking up bullshit for art again. Note: I never want to see a baby being cut at birth.
