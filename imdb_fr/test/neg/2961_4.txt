I saw Shallow Grave many years ago, and * it was * one of those movies that I remembered for a very long time. It was intense from start to finish and with a lot of sudden twists. But all that made sense. <br /> <br /> I can not say as much about corpses. Above the title is a subtitle that says "even better than Shallow Grave". It's a big lie. <br /> <br /> Dead Bodies loses its strength and becomes much less convincing during the film. <br /> <br /> Two secondary characters, for example, turn out to be far less innocent than they seemed to be the first time. It might work as a surprise, but it did not surprise me. I could see him coming a few minutes before, and * it's * a big difference with Shallow Grave. <br /> <br /> Another thing I must mention is that the characters in this film often respond in an unrealistic way. They behave more often when the movie ends. <br /> <br /> I would have found that much more interesting if some characters had remained completely innocent without knowing what was happening. It would have been better for the contrast with, for example, Tommy and his friend who must carry a * huge * secret with them. <br /> <br /> But no, for some stupid reason, the filmmakers decided the characters must show their darkest sides. It does not work in a movie like this. <br /> <br /> The end was very much like an open end. This left me with an unsatisfied feeling. I was expecting a lot more. <br /> <br /> At first, I would have given six stars to this movie because it's not quite a bad movie. I liked to watch it. Most of the time. <br /> <br /> But from time to time, I've seen scenes of really mediocre and unrealistic acts, and because of the disappointing end, I'm four stars this time around. And because it's a mistake, I spent my time and my money. Unlike Shallow Grave, I will probably forget Dead Bodies very soon. It's just not such a special film. <br /> <br /> The directors could have done a much better job with this movie. It's a pity they did not do it.
