I absolutely can not believe my fellow critics IMDb. All the praise for the originality of this film is as if they had never seen "Ring" or the million imitations that appeared in the last 10 years since this film. And some of them claim to be horror moviegoers! I do not think so! "Shutter" agrees. Medium, I would say. I gave it 5 out of 10, but it's just impossible that it's original, awesome and "the scariest thing I've ever seen," said a reviewer. Puh-leeeze, people. This one is simple. It's predictable. <br /> <br /> I swear if I see another ghost movie where the hero retraces the ghost's past to find out why she's so angry and after them, I'm going to scream. <br /> "Original"? Leave me alone. You need to go out more. Or at least, stop calling yourself "horror movie fans".
