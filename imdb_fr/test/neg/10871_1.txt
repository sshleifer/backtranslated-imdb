Larry Bishop directs, writes and directs this soft core movie, plot without a biker movie on nothing to do with anything. Calling this one of the worst movies of 2008, it's being nice with the garbage that I spent money in cinemas. It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I felt especially sorry for the girls, who probably think they're doing a feature film, when in fact they make a porn. They walk on the plateau for four days, say some sexual lines to disgusting old men - thirty years older than them - then take off their clothes and run naked for four days. I can only assume that was the only way for Larry Bishops to get laid. You see one after the other directly on a girls' donkey. Bishop's shots of each other walking to a random girl and grabbing his most intimate parts as if he were shaking her hand. The way this shit has been financed goes beyond me. Why does Tarantino bear his name, it's beyond me, but it has slowly faded since 1994. So I can not say that I was surprised. <br /> <br /> After 15 minutes, you have this horrible feeling that only (and I mean horrible) movies give you. When you see it in theaters, the pain you feel is amplified. After 15 minutes, I wanted to cry to be so stupid and waste time, but also to earn 10 dollars hard. There is not a quality that redeems, or a moment in the film that creates any reaction or shows any inclination that these people have an idea of ​​what they are doing. If you do not see naked women so often, then I guess this movie would be for you. If you are eleven, you will probably like it. You can not even laugh at it, because every idiot who made him laugh at the shit he was doing. The acting is dreadful, the writing is awful, the production is awful and the staging is awful. You do not even have to rent it to see the car accident. Stay away, stay far away. You should not even read these reviews. I should not even write one.
