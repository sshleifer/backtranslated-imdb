"Ghost Son" is the best film of Lamberto Bava and, at the same time, its worst. I guess this statement needs some clarification. This is his best because he is well directed, ambitious, approachable and very elegant, but his worst because it is a dull film, not original and undeniably a huge disappointment for all the true fans of the past efforts of Bava. Let's face it: many fans, including myself, would not have been interested in this film judging by the plot, the famous names attached to it and even the boring title. Lamberto Bava was the only motivation. He brought us a lot of Gialli's complicated movies and amusing screenings in the past. "Ghost Son" is a bit of his return film, alongside "The Torturer", and although the latter is really not a good movie, it is at least up to the expectations of his fans, with excessive amounts of blood, blood and sadism. "Ghost Son" is a weak and intolerably mild horror film, which even talks about mainstream ghost stories. The focus is too much on sentimentality, which affects the already limited number of horrific and scary atmospheric moments. The basic principle may include one or two good potential ideas, but the film is generally dull and too clich√©. John Hannah and Laura Harring are a happy couple living on a remote ranch in South Africa raising horses for a living. Joy and happiness could not possibly improve. It is therefore natural that something tragic should happen. Mark dies in a car accident, but Stacey, inconsolable, stays at the ranch where she is constantly in touch with Mark's mind. She even falls pregnant with her child, but soon after the birth of her little Martin, mysterious events begin to happen. It looks like Mark's selfish and agitated ghost "owned" the baby and used it to encourage Stacy to commit suicide. By focusing on the relationship of the couple, many events and sub-plots are underdeveloped and / or unexplained, like the background of young maid Thandi. There is too little action and the only true moments of dread are too clearly borrowed from classic movies such as "The Exorcist" and "Rosemary's Baby" (vomiting a green goo, freestanding furniture ??). Purely speaking in terms of horrible entertainment "Ghost Son" is a painful failure, but it must be said, it is a beautiful and enchanting failure. Cinematography is extremely elegant and many camera angles are really inventive and suggestive. The moody score sometimes manages to create a disturbing atmosphere even if nothing important happens on the screen. There are several beautiful images of South African wildlife to admire, but if you're interested, I guess you'd better watch National Geographic instead. Not much to recommend here. Fans of atmospheric ghost stories have a much better choice. Hard-core Bava fans are invited to (re) watch "Demons", "Macabre" or "Blade in the Dark".
