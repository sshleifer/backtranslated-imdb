I made sure to see this movie because it's a 50s science fiction movie - one of my favorite genres. Unfortunately, while I waited impatiently for bug-eyed aliens or power-crazy conquerors, the aliens of this movie were a MAJOR disappointment! First, you only see one very brief at first (and it looked pretty ordinary) and you only have a tiny glimpse of a spaceship! Secondly, the extraterrestrial was neither the evil conqueror nor the benevolent friend of humanity, but a real weird balloon. Finally, the plot itself seemed so stupid, preached, and brutal that it gave rise to more yawns than thrills. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the film, five people from five different regions of the world (Germany, Great Britain, Russia, China and the United States) are kidnapped by a stranger. The stranger gives each of them means by which they CAN destroy all life on the planet if they wish - because the stranger recognizes that his race would like to inhabit the Earth, but they themselves would not kill for the world. 'get. Then he makes them all. While it is 100% obvious that no one would use these devices, the alien then announces on television the identity of the five without saying that his weapons are so powerful! All the militarists of the world therefore want to find the five and force them to reveal the operation of weapons. The rest of the film is largely composed of five people hiding and one being tortured to reveal the operation of the device - as the Soviets want! This part of the movie just seemed stupid enough. Of course, the USSR was a perverse and corrupt nation (sorry, but it's a fact - especially under Stalin), they would never have thought of using it as they did in the movie! Later, one of the five scientists (the German scientist) understands that these devices can also be used to kill only all the evil ones who hate freedom. So, he uses it to eliminate all the evil Commies and probably others who were anti-freedom and the world becomes a paradise !! Predict, silly and full of intrigue - this film is simply not worth your time, although it is an interesting relic just for the way it tackles communism - especially the tensions between NATO and the Soviets.
