Barney is that dinosaur idiot who (unfortunately) did not die with the other dinosaurs a long time ago. Instead, he sings stupid songs and has a stupid morality about life that is 100% worthless and / or extremely dangerous: "Strangers, your friends, you have not met him yet. ". The reason I say it's diabolical? Well, on YouTube, there's a video of a Barney song on toy balls. When played backwards, it comes out "We'll all come hang up! LET'S STAB THE KNOCKERS!". Do not believe me? See for yourself! I also read in another article that they were now reading folklore and PC fairy tales. Now, it's just stupid with a capital S! I mean really! Anyway, I do not recommend letting your kids look at this dirt because it contains a stupid morality, as strangers are your friends (as said before), there is never any reason to be sad and if you are sad eating junk food, being a taboo individual, magic can solve all your problems and lots of other ridiculous crap.
