A box with a button offers a couple the opportunity to be financially free, but the cost is the life of someone they have never met. It's a very tedious movie to watch. Richard Kelly, who wrote and directed it, decided to make a film without any profit. We take you on slow climbs, one after the other with at best minor revelations. At times, I thought it would have a major meaning at the end, but nothing has done it. The film simply suggests: "This story could have been told in 30 minutes, without all that nonsense." I hope that you will avoid this horrible film and that you will maintain your sanity.
