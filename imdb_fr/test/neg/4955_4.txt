Looking at George Romero's Creepshow, I've learned one thing: if you come across a mysterious old crate, it's obvious that someone has gone to great lengths to hide, but stay calm: there's probably some nasty thing inside. /> <br /> Of course, Professor Gordon Crowley, the character of Robert Englund in "Jack Brooks, Monster Slayer" is not a fan of Romero, because he works the old wooden box that he finds buried in his yard, to discover only? "Surprise, Surprise", a former demon who owns his body (causing him to initially eat and vomit a lot). <br /> <br /> When the demon ends up popping out of Crowley's body during chemistry class and begins to turn the students into heartbreaking and heartbreaking beasts, it's up to plumber Jack Brooks (Trevor Matthews) to try to stop the filthy creatures, armed only with a long pipe and fed by a perpetual hatred of all that is monstrous! <br /> <br /> Jon Knautz's monstrous low-budget movie DVD pack promises A fun-filled driving hell, offering sensations and sensations worthy of what you'd expect from your average creature character from the 80's (toothy bugs, rubber monster costumes, gore macabre and absolutely no CGI!) and for the last 15 minutes that's exactly what viewers have: non-stop splatter effects; a stupid and demonic thing to the Jabba; and a lot of macho monster! <br /> <br /> Too bad, therefore, that the rest of the film's shooting time, about 70 minutes, is mostly spent following Jack while he's bored, daily work: doing the plumbing, going to see his shrink, go to chemistry class and upset his girlfriend. If you think you'd like a film that focuses on managing the trauma and anger of your childhood, buying replacement boiler valves at a hardware store, and the chemical properties of sodium, this is the movie for you. but if you are looking for a massive dose of monster chaos, I would recommend looking elsewhere!
