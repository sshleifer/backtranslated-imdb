The narration was clear and concise but, overall, the film never caught my interest - the scenes were flat and uninspired. Ghengis Khan, historically, lived in a very interesting / epic life, but the film failed to capture that. He focused instead on small skirmishes. youth and a love story, I think I have seen her disguised in a multitude of other films. I never felt sympathy or empathy for the lead role - yes, he had to defeat slavery, but it seemed easy to kill, kill, and double his way to the top. The quality that redeemed was photography - the landscapes certainly contributed to the dark atmosphere of the film, unfortunately, combined with the gloom of history - I remained impassive and disappointed ..
