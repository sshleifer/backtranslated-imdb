It's really, without exaggeration, one of the worst Slasher films ever made. I know this came out in the '80s, following a trend started by "Friday the 13th". "The Prey" copies the aforementioned film in many ways. Wooden setting, killer, dumb teens, gore, etc. <br /> <br /> But "The Prey" is as bad as you might expect. I did not even remember if it was not a coincidence. <br /> <br /> The murderer is actually a human being, so do not expect a supernatural murderer like Jason. The rather boring situations and the lack of tension, coolness, violence, etc. It just does not work for a slasher movie. <br /> <br /> The acting game is simply horrible. The score is horrible! a combination of boring instruments with 80s cheese tunes ?! I will not even mention the technical aspects of the film because believe me, it seems that it costs only 20 dollars. <br /> <br /> Please avoid this one like the plague. It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen, and it's something to say. Thank God, he seems to have disappeared from the earth.
