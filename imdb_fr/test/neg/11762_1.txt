The few scenes that really try to represent the revolutionary struggle resemble a shady troop of boy scouts crisscrossing timidly between two pools. When Sharif or, please God, Palance tries a flaming oratory, it looks like Kurtz is swallowing an insect. The Strategic Shine demonstrations incorporate a map of Cuba filled with smiling fish in the ocean and a positive assumption vaudevillienne about how the Bay of Pigs was created. What does this leave us? A scene of comic dentistry; an excess of posh Hollywood peasants addressing the camera as if it were a moving train; and, just for kicks, a pass of homoeroticism that is not limited to the maniacal and incessant folly of Cigar Cigar. Never trust Medved, but even a broken clock is right twice a day: it's a HISTORICAL film.
