Well now this strange movie. It was a comedy, but I certainly could not find a laugh. In fact, I struggle to find something positive to say about this film. Oh, I'm going there. Alex Ferns is not bad in the main role and I did not choose the end for a change, but other than that, it does not have a big direction and two-dimensional characters. decent drama form. I would really avoid having to see this movie again and think that it does not benefit any of the characters in the working class it is trying to represent. I had trouble understanding one of the characters and I did not get enough information about the main character Jimmy to believe his motives. Better to avoid.
