Michael Caine usually appears in very good comedies ("Blame It On Rio", "Sleuth", "Without Index", "Gambit", "Dirty Rotten Scoundrels") or in real bad comedies ("Noises Off", "The death will become "", "Harry and Walter go to NY"). This falls into the latter category. <br /> <br /> TA is a comedy that only succeeds in two things: ruining a cast including Caine , Gambon and Richardson, all of whom have comical abilities, and succeed in their mission of not making the audience laugh.There is not a single really funny moment here.The main reason is the ugly script, there were so many unsuccessful efforts to write a story unnecessarily complicated and too awkward to follow (given that it is only a comedy) that the writer or writers forgot to make this damn thing fun, which, as far as I remember, that's what the interest of a comedy is supposed to be <br /> <br /> I have never seen this moron before. Some people even say that "if you're a fan of Moron, you'll love this" blah blah blah. A fan of Moron? Does this non-qualified person really have fans? A comedy as badly written as that requires a mega talent to burst out laughing, like Steve Coogan and not your average moron. <br /> <br /> If you want to make a comedy about the actors then at least make them out to be the morons they are usually. The characters of Caine and Moron are not stupid enough. <br /> <br /> The most annoying thing about this series of funny scenes is the little girl. Only a really horrible writer might think that to spice up an ugly scenario, it's wise to include a super smart wise kid. Smart kids ** are not even fun for Bill Cosby fans anymore. In "Little Miss Sunshine" we had a totally normal child and she was very funny. This fool of shtick belongs to a centenary film of the Marx brothers.
