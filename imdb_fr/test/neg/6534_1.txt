Field: <br /> <br /> - An eBay chair <br /> <br /> - Random people <br /> <br /> - Random people are talking ("Dude, it's true. "" I'm feeling it. "" Let's get married now! ") <br /> <br /> - If you're a" hippie ", then you'll love this movie. (You must be high or drunk, otherwise you wonder about your life by looking at this junk.) <br /> <br /> This movie was clearly not thought from beginning to end, and the other comments are probably those of the team the critics. If it was not for my people, I do not know what it's for. I found the daily plot boring. It's something I would do, and believe me, it's not worth filming. Going on a roadtrip and filming half the silence does not make a movie!
