Let's start by recognizing that there are probably three types of horror movies: the good, the bad and the most embarrassing that make the whole thing suffer. Dark Harvest promises great things with its Artisan DVD jacket, but rest assured that the show ends there. After a grueling initial montage, we quickly discover that the film consists of a very poor script, extremely under-qualified (even for a beginner film), acting, disastrous lighting and even worse special effects. Seriously, could not anyone afford more than a mask for the bad guy, or did he think it was good enough for Jason Voorhees and Michael Myers, so it's good enough for us? Well, it did not work at all to create a scary villain. Anyway, it's one of the movies that makes you watch your watch, sigh and curse your own credulity. The timing of each scene is painful, and all the production has a feeling of college (to think about it, I saw better productions of scenes of college, until the special effects). I'm trying to find a way to end this criticism on a positive note, so let me suggest that all copies of this train wreck be given as coasters, Frisbees, wind chimes. ..... I would say "Go see your own", but it would be cruel. <br /> <br /> Check out the rest of the critics of this production company and you'll find the same thing for each of their films. They claim to honor the contract between the film and the audience (ie please the fans) but all they have done is to laugh and throw a charge on our heads for the money (which I am sure they have seen very little for it). <br /> <br /> Sorry, the high marks and the favorable comments are obviously published by those who are directly or indirectly related to this parody. <br /> <br /> 1 star out of 10 because it is the lowest note possible. To give that even makes me angry.
