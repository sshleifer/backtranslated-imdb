It's horrible. No really, it is, without exception, the absolute worst ... the worst ... I hesitate to call it a @ & $% in '_movie_. It is a visual canal canal of ninety minutes. The plot is virtually nonexistent: a mad scientist who looks like the leader of the band "The Cars" permeates a woman in her secret lab, a lawn chair in what I think is a garage, via an injection of Palmolive. In a few hours, she gives birth to an adult monster that is unleashed. It's the whole movie. The scenes of death: these are poorly prepared, take _forever_, and the acting ... how can you ruin _screaming_ ?? The victims stand there as the congested monster moves forward, grunting, breathing, and strangling them limply for about three days. The sets are tacky, most of the film is lit by a single maglite (yes, a big flashlight), the sound quality is mediocre, there are only forty words of dialogue for the whole film and the game is generously described. in wood. The footage is recycled shamelessly to complete the film. And the special effects would prompt any BBC sci-fi production to shake their heads and proclaim "They have not even tried". The "monster" is nameless in a 3 dollar rubber halloween mask with some bandages glued together. In his meeting with the film's lone policeman, the policeman fires invisible, smoke-free, flameless bullets, apparently traveling so slowly that the monster can dodge them five steps away. Do not see this movie. No, it's not a challenge. Do not see this movie. The director should be shot. The writer should be chained to a giant rock where Ed Wood will devour his liver every morning. Sufficient rentals and there could be a suite, do not let it happen!
