A clumsy disaster puts a team of scavengers to meet SSP Poseidon overthrown, hoping to loot it before it finally disappears. Irwin Allen's sequel to his 1972 blockbuster "The Poseidon Adventure" has hit cinemas SEVEN YEARS LATER! It does not matter that nobody cares anymore, why give us such a mediocre production, filled with dark characters and miscast actors, to empty the memory of your biggest hit? We could be really sorry for Michael Caine, Sally Field, Peter Boyle, Jack Warden, Karl Malden and Shirley Jones without their words lost at sea (good for a few laughs). There is a moment when St. Jones is tempted to grab hold of treasures just for herself and begins timidly to stuff her pockets, which is an unintentional excitement. The film was a career smuggler for everyone involved, especially Allen, who never really recovered from it. * from ****
