I saw this only because my 10 years were bored. He and his friend hated him, but of course, they liked being in the movies. This is the first time that I have strongly disagreed with Ebert for many years. There is not one thing to recommend this movie. Willis is good, as always. But the story stinks, is incredible, there is no real story, no action, no interesting cinematic sequences, no surprises, and worst of all, the child star is a completely disgusting slug guaranteed to extinguish any parent who does not have a big slob dweeby for a child. Of course, stay away and save your child - unless you want to punish him. There is no excuse for such an ugly performance or writing and it is hoped that these filmmakers will suffer as a result.
