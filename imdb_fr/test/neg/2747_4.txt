AfterLife talks about a rather arrogant and wealthy man who discovers that his mother is dying and cares for his sister with Down syndrome. He can not be disturbed by her and just wants to get rid of her hands; he has better things to do. At one point, he discovers that he has to take him by car (she does not like flying) across the country. <br /> <br /> If that sounds familiar to you, it's probably because you've seen `Rainman, 'a far superior film to his imitator,` `After Life.' 'The fact that he copies the principle of base (heck, some nicks and even scenes too) is not the fundamental problem of the film.The fundamental problem is that I do not care about these characters. <br /> <br /> The brother, Kenny (Kevin McKidd), is a bit of a womanizer, has a girlfriend who comes and goes in history, and learns to love the sister of Down's Syndrome (again, this is from 'Rainman' He is a journalist and seeks an interview with a doctor who is facing a scandal.When he ends up taking care of Roberta, the sister, he does not have much time for her and sometimes leaves her alone. When she goes astray, he becomes even more angry with her.I spoil anything by saying that he becomes a person more kind and affectionate at the end of the film? <br /> <br /> Roberta is not determined to be "normal"; she is "normal" and wants people to stop treating her differently. She is played by Paula Sage, an actress who suffers from Down syndrome, and her performance is by far the best in the film. why did the screenwriter not explore her character more? Well, probably because it would mean that the characters would get in the way of the story. Anyway, when we already know the story, did not the filmmakers see the problem they created? <br /> <br /> For a film about a dying mother and her disabled daughter (the father is absent, I think he died, but I'm not sure), it's surprising how little impact of the film on the emotions of the viewer. The scenes are interpreted so standard, so boring, with a dialogue so standard and predictable, that I found myself rolling my eyes. <br /> <br /> I have nothing against sentimentality in movies, but it only really works if you care about characters. Here, the characters are so uninteresting and two-dimensional that I did not really think there was much to do. "The man of the rain" has an emotional climax, but it moved me, because I cared about the characters. <br /> <br /> Speaking of climax, this movie has an odor. There is a sequence at the end of the film that starts as an incredible situation and ends in an even worse territory; a cruelly unforgivable trick is played on the public. The sequence is designed to move the audience, but ends up being horribly manipulative and offending the viewer's intelligence. Spectators are not stupid and know when the movie is cheating. What a low blow. <br /> <br /> There is not a scene in this film that has the impact it should have. There are some funny sequences, yes, but when the characters are talking to each other, I can practically see the scenario in front of me, move in a predictable and uninteresting way, never touching anything that touches the mind or the heart. There are these false arguments that are specifically reserved for movies, where the other character knows exactly what the answer is. Why do not supposedly "realistic" movies realize that in real life anger can be irrational and that sometimes people can not express their emotions, and they can say things that are meaningless, or not be able to say anything at all? All actors in this film deserve better material. This film is not based on facts, but I think a documentary on a family with a member of Down syndrome would be much more interesting. In this way, we could have had the truth and the emotion. For some reason, the characters in this film think that an emotion is only about saying something strong and giving an appropriate facial expression. <br /> <br /> ** (out of 5)
