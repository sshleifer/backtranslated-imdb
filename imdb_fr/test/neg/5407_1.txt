This ranks as the worst movie of all time. No research or thought at all has entered this film. The action scenes were projected at random intervals, which made no sense in the context of the film. Objects appeared and disappeared at random, etc. It is obvious that this was led by a "stunt coordinator", who should resume his old job. The skeleton man rode horseback throughout the film, which, surprisingly, could change color at will. Either that, or someone who thought that the public would be color-blind and would not notice it. Blood would be on the actors in one scene and the next would disappear miraculously and then reappear. It seems that all people related to this movie have forgotten to check the inconsistencies.
