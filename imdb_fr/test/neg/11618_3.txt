Uh, oh! I just said that this "classic" movie has a plot that STINKS! Well, that's right, so take that back! This film was a vanity project by Joseph P. Kennedy in which his mistress played the main role and where money flowed to make an even larger star. There is only one fragmentary copy today - a copy that was restored a few years ago. However, even if the film was in perfect condition, it could have seemed bad for many reasons. And, without further ado, here are some of my reasons: <br /> <br /> First of all, Gloria Swanson, 31, plays a girl in a convent school, maybe 16 or 18 years old. years! Come on, she looks old enough to be the mother of many children. <br /> <br /> Second, the film is based on the stupid concept of "love at first sight". Although some people believe it, it is ridiculous to believe that a prince would throw ALL on a woman he did not even know! What a hooey! <br /> <br /> Third, the film is histrionic and the plot is crazy! After leaving school, Kelly goes to East Africa and becomes the "queen of whores". Later, after the death of the devilish queen in Europe (it's convenient), the prince can get out of prison. Kelly and his wife, then she becomes the queen of a real honest country! Give me a break - it's RIDICULE, even at the time of the silent movie, this plot was a grunt! <br /> <br /> So, in short, it's a mediocre film with a high production value) that scrolls like a classic! There are so many BETTER movies out there - watch them first and avoid those guts.
