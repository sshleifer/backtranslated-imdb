I just watched for the first time Ed Wood Jr.'s autobiographical film, Glen or Glenda, after hearing so much about it for so many years. Nothing I had read or heard of this movie could prepare me for what I saw. This film must be the most weird ever made. Buffalo stamped, women in slavery, Satan prancing around him and Bela Lugosi, walking only as far as possible, "Bevare, Bevare ... pull the rope, pull the rope ...", it was totally crazy. The acting was awful and the dialogue unintentionally hilarious, exactly what you'd expect from a film by Ed Wood. Having said all that, as horrible as this film was, I have to give Wood a credit ... he was way ahead of his time. You must remember that when this film was made, the transvestites were not even discussed in public, much less the subject of a film. I read that Wood was a transvestite in real life and I'm sure this movie was based on his own experiences. It was sad to see Bela Lugosi having to say the ridiculous sentences he had to say for this film, but it was a little Ed Wood Jr. to give at least to Mr. Lugosi an acting job at a time of Bela's life when he was penniless and a drug addict and no one else in Hollywood would hire him. If you've never seen this movie, you should see it, especially if you're a fan of Ed Wood Jr.
