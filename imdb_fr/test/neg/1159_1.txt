Ed Gein, one of the most famous serial killers of all time, has inspired famous movie killers like Norman Bates, Leatherface and Buffalo Bill. He is also one of the sickest and most disturbing killers of all time. I watched a documentary about him so I know his story pretty well. When I saw this, I was curious because I thought it was supposed to be a documentary reenactment, but I must say it was just a pathetic waste of time. First, the facts are completely wrong, with a few minor exceptions, and secondly, it was a stupid Hollywood story when these horrific murders actually took place and they really did for their money. Not to mention the fact that if they wanted to make a horror film, it was badly played! <br /> <br /> Ed Gein, he lives in a small town in Wisconsin called Plainfield, but he has a little secret on which the whole city is being touched, he digs up corpses and brutally kills people . Bobby, a member of Parliament, is on the verge of looking for Ed Gein, only, nobody knows who the killer is at first, just to find one crime scene after another. But things get "personal" when Ed starts playing with family and friends of the police. <br /> <br /> Of course, this movie was just ridiculous and a total insult to the true story. I always thought that bad acting was a necessary tool for a horror movie, but for this story, it should have been a better interpreted movie, not to mention the fact that it should have been more of a movie. documentary that a stupid horror movie based on clich√©s. Stay away from this film, it is completely pathetic and false to tell the story of Ed Gein. <br /> <br /> 1/10
