Dead Man's Bounty (American title of the film) looks like a classic Italian western. Cinematography, costumes and sets look great. The cast is sturdy, not a pretty face among them. At first I was preparing for a rather cool movie, but what I witnessed was an absolute disaster. <br /> <br /> The scenario was absolutely awful. There was no suspense and very little action or drama worthy of interest. <br /> <br /> Despite its beauty, the cast spoke (English) with a heavy and often unintelligible European accent. <br /> The final nail in his coffin was the broad band of pretentious who painted most of the painting, concentrating heavily on the character of the waitress who figured in some very clumsy sex scenes. Moreover, his speech towards the end was rather repugnant! <br /> <br /> The only novelty comes from the cascading of Val Kilmer in the role of the deceased, in the continuity of his recent performances of DOA!
