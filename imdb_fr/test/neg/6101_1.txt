And again, Columbia Pictures decides to simply "hash" using the original version with Curly and without any gags or jokes to boot! Towards the end of this dreadful film when Joe is stuck in the bull, the studio has not even done much to re-record the sound, because if you listen carefully, you can still stay here. Also, when Moe and Larry throw the darts in order to "slow down the bull so he can descend", this is directly related to the original because you can actually see Moe and Larry appear "magically" 15 years older. youth. Why oh why did Moe allow this to happen? This is a burning question that we probably will never be able to answer because, as far as I know, he was very sensitive to any type of criticism and had rather strict criteria for his work, just like Larry, Curly and Shemp. Do not waste your time on this one.
