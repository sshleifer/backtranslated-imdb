As a person who knows the filmed ship and some other ships, I can not see the film as a film. As a film, some beautiful photos of the ship are made, most of them on an existing ship - with the exception of those on the scene of the disaster, of course, and a certain piece under the bridge. But in terms of history and dialogues, I can only call it crap. None of this would happen in a real boat. No wonder, the film had a negative impact on the existing ship - if I did not know it better, I would not be tempted to sail. For Europeans, I recommend going out once the ship has failed. After that, start the American part, very emotional, that I could not bear anymore. The pictures are really, really great, no wonder in a Ridley Scott movie, but if you can avoid listening to the text, it will get a lot better.
