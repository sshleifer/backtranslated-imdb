Consider "I know everything". The action hero lights a cigarette in the darkness. While trying to hide / seek the bad guys. (Probably to give a traffic light to say here that I'm coming) <br /> <br /> This is one of 100 scenes that make you laugh. (I think the film should belong to the Comedy category.) <br /> <br /> Dreadful director, deplorable scenario, Bad acting, Economic special effects. (They used a tunnel to hide in the dark.) 3 out of 10 (that also made me laugh while watching these pathetic mistakes)
