I saw it on a selection DVD a few months before its release. <br /> <br /> I liked the main characters and the story in general, but some scenes are rather sloppy and confusing. The sets were well suited, but some of them looked like Freaks & Geeks' remnants or reminded me of a picture of a mobile phone filmed in a middle class house. That's really not what the DVD cover says, "Destined to be the next Stoner classic", barely. <br /> <br /> The wardrobe and hairstyles are well done and, yes, there are very pretty girls in this place, always nice to see. a nice distribution. <br /> <br /> Almost all scenes contain guitar that constantly buzzes. The sound design was a little poor. I think less would have been the best.
