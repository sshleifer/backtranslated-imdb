I read this movie online and after seeing the generally positive reviews he received and seeing the trailer, I decided to check it myself. What a desappointment! It starts well enough. the opening scene was rather tense, but from there, everything is downhill. I can see that the filmmakers were trying to do something different with this film, but in doing so, they took the pleasure of watching it. These choices combined with the editing "C.S.I", the use of music and editing, lack of suspense, fears or humor really make this film slide down. There are too many prefigurations and "subtle" clues. So, when the first turn comes early, you already know how the movie will end. I gave the film three stars because I think the cast did a good job, other than that, I can not recommend this movie.
