If you're a fan of the original ten commandments, this movie will make you cry inside. I agree, I am currently only about half an hour, but it is so painful that I felt it was my duty to warn the ten true commandments before they were submitted. to this bastardy. I did not think it was possible to make the special effects worse than they were in the 1950s when the original was shot, but this remake of 2006 proves me wrong. I can forgive some lame special effects, but the insane dialogue, the melodramatic game of film style, and the stage play embody wax characters that make me hope that they will rewrite the plot and drown Moses the Red Sea.
