This film is not at all like City of God, you may have the same feeling but it is not the case, there is no intense shooting or intense drug scenes, you have the idea. If you ask me, I think this movie was a waste of time, there are many other films that give 100 times better meaning and teaching to "Wooden Camera". Yes, I may be the only one to have made a negative comment for this film, but that's only in my opinion. It's one of those movies where I can feel overwhelmed, but when the credits start to play the role of my friends and I, we all looked at each other, and we all laughed at the ridiculousness of that movie. So to conclude this case, I advise not to look at it. <br /> <br /> Personal note - Making Africans speak English was a big mistake. In City of God, they used their mother tongue, which gave the film a lot more power and reality.
