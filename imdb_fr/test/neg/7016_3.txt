Who the hell had the idea "brilliant" (?) To launch Lucille Ball in this film ??? It should have been Angela Lansbury's baby from the beginning. At the very least, Lucy should have doubled her. <br /> <br /> There is some compensation in the fact that the score of Jerry Herman is rather well preserved, except for "that's how I feel", and we get representations members of the original Broadway cast, Jane Connell and Bea Arthur. <br /> <br /> I suppose you had to give a song to Robert Preston, hence the inferior "Loving You". <br /> <br /> Overall, I think that in this one, the bad redhead was thrown.
