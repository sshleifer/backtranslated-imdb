Ok, I like to give the benefit of the doubt. I watched his show. <br /> <br /> It's not funny for me. All I could remember was a lot of "strange" noises and screams. I do not even think I have a smile. The only thing that looked a bit like humor was her little Anjelina Jolie / Jennifer Aniston. I think you can get stupid by the minute by looking at it though. <br /> <br /> And also, what's up with the "Ask Whitey?" section? Is this a scam of "Ask a Gay Dude? / Black Man?" Chappelle's show? Is not that so obvious? But when Chappelle did, he revealed the ignorance of the subject. Like Borat. But what better than picking whites at random and shouting things to them? It's not funny, it's just silly. <br /> <br /> And I'm sure I've heard some "jokes" from his elsewhere ... it seems a bit like he's "joking", throwing in some shouting "loud". <br /> <br /> Anyway, it was not funny. Seriously. Do not even waste your time.
