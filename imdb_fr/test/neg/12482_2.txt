It's just terrible. I regret every second of the 80 minutes I spent watching this mess. I think it's supposed to be a comedy, but I do not remember laughing a lot, except for some flagrant inconsistencies and blatant mistakes. <br /> <br /> An unattractive man, called Lester, meets wealthy and unattractive middle-aged women via solitary-heart ads, then kills them for the money he needs to feed his addiction The game is all the plot, and that's really all that happens. Along the way, there is an intrigue attempt when Lester begins to receive phone calls from a mysterious stranger who taunts him about the secret of his secrets, but his application is so poorly implemented that you can not realize not be what is supposed to happen. The sequences in which Lester murders wealthy widows are all pretty brutal but also seem to be dressed in comedies. In a sequence, a woman is clubbed with a wooden pole, then put in an oven. He is very cruelly represented, but he plays against the big-band percussion waltz music, Lester playing with his head and adopting comic poses. The victim was murdered in another scene, while she constantly sings strident opera songs ... you have to see that to believe it! In fact - you do not have to see it at all, in fact, I strongly recommend you avoid this flop. Fulci does not seem to know what hat he wears and nothing proves the flair of his previous career. A sequence appeared to me particularly miserable: the revelation when Lester suddenly realizes that he has no shadow. Fulci seems unable to conceive a visual representation of this phenomenon on the screen. It is only filming the actor as normal, shadow and everything! And so totally blows the whole angle. Either he had a zero budget for the effects, or he did not care enough to find a way to show it. Whatever it is, this should give you an idea of ​​the lame of this project. I did not even understand most of the movie, and nothing on the screen deserved to be watched half the time. Even the end was as flat as a pancake. A real failure.
