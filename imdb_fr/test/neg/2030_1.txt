OK, I wanted to see that because there were some good reviews, but this movie was horrible ... just awful. The characters were in 1 dimension and nothing the actors could do could give them life. The story was abominable ... The wind stopped becoming a conspiracy tool midway ... It is completely forgotten. The pictures were cold while we were well drawn ... 5 minutes of a guy crawling on the floor, 3 minutes of a girl wearing makeup. I do not know what this guy is trying to shoot ... it's like he does not have a script, no dialogue and the film should be filmed so long, so do not shoot any scenes at all .. Foreign films are perfect for creating a story without using a lot of dialogue, this film makes me think that it is impossible for American cinema to do it. I want to stop watching movies ... Bad Bad Movie!
