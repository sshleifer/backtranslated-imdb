When I watched this show for the first time on Cartoon Network, I found it uninteresting. Then I read a lot of good messages on this show and decided to watch it. The show was so boring. Each episode was predictable. Moreover, this show has no logic. Hypersmart girls, who go to school and sometimes do such stupid things, 99% of the episodes start with a monster attacking Townswille, then mayor (he's really crazy, he's NOT funny, he's so stupid, that I can not imagine how he became mayor). Professor, yes, supposed to be the smartest person in the show, but actually ... He did not even find any difference between Monster and his brother. The narrator's comments also make this show boring. Because they also have similar lines at the beginning and end of each episode. Also the animation is very strange. All but the main heroes are shown in an ugly way. Moreover, in each epsode, this program gives you life lessons, which means that it is intended for little children, but if you take a closer look, you will see that there is a lot of violence and even blood (!!!) during their battles.
