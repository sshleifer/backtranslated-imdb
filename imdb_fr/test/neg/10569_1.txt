It's terrible! It's as if someone had given a child a faulty video camera and $ 30 and told them to make a movie. Even then, you'll get a better and more professional movie than this one. The story is so stupid that you can say that it does not exist. I do not think the guy who did it knows what to do: watching foreign art all day is not enough to make someone an instant director. The acting game is very bad, really the level of kindergarten and writing is just awful. The only scene I did not hate is that of the caravan accident, but even that means it was just a little less awful than the rest of the movie. How do people get money for this stuff? Alternative films do not bother me, but should not they at least not be a big pile of smoking cow manure? I would call amateur the price of milk if it was not an insult to amateurs. It would not even be a good movie if you were drunk or drugged!
