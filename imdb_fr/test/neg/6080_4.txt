I am always interested to see neglected films that seem to have good references, but in this case, the negligence of the film seems justified. Obviously, based on real incidents during the Second World War, the film has no connection with the viewer for some reason, it is not entirely clear to me. One of the most likely reasons is that, in any case, in the printed copy on the TCM, none of the scenes in which the Germans spoke were titled. This interesting director concept - letting the non-German-speaking viewer guess what the Germans call each other - is, in my book, a total failure and helps to block the viewer. In addition, the way the film begins - we dive into a very confusing situation without much configuration - is disorienting. Brian Keith is very good here, but the reputation of "The Great Escape" and "Stalag 17" will not be questioned by this film.
