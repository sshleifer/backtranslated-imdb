If you are a sensible person and have seen movies before, you can not tolerate this act of idiocy for more than 20 minutes. And if you stay longer, it will not be because you expect an akshay or a paresh (not govinda please!) But because you value your money too much and want at least a short nap on the soft seats of the multiplex in return for money they stole you! It's hard to believe that the director who gave us a cult film like HeraPheri could fall to such a level ... well, he's repetitive, but now he's coming out of every third-class floor and expecting us laughing because he brought Paresh Rawal and Akshay Kumar. ..! No sir it will not work now .. especially with your stupid scenario! Even comedy movies can have meaningful scripts (Lage Raho Munnabhai anyone?). <br /> <br /> Govinda did not have Akshay Kumar was boring, Paresh Rawal cracked some of the worst jokes possible. Lara Dutta had real opportunities to act in it, but she failed miserably ... the only highlight of the film. (maybe) is the role of Tanushree! But it is only present during the first 10 minutes. <br /> <br /> I do not think this movie has more value ... (probably not even so much!). Last warning, do not look at it!
