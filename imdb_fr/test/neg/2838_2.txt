Now, let me see if I'm right, a whimsical serial killer walks around killing realtors ... okay ... what a problem with this scenario, I can live with that. <br /> <br /> Then, a slasher with tax inspectors massacred? Traffic officers sliced ​​to death? Are we supposed to have sympathy for property people who are obsessed with money and who are obsessed with money? Uh ... no. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, joking aside, it's just not a very well shot movie with a mediocre action game and raw effects, the climate scene is particularly ridiculous. You can almost see the director screaming "action" at the stunt as he falls through the window glass. <br /> <br /> As rightly said another critic, after playing in "The Fog", nadir of the career of Adrienne Barbeau. That's why I was happy to see that she had revived it by becoming Catwoman's voice in the animated series Batman, while watching the extras from Catwoman. NB: it is not quite the film that it was conceived. <br /> <br /> This is a bad movie, think of a poor episode of 'Kojak' or 'Streets of San Francisco' and you will have an idea of ​​what is proposed here.
