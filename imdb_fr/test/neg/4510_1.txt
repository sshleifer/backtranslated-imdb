I have rarely seen a literary work so badly translated on the screen. The hysterical distribution of B-movie and sitcom supplements simply gives the impression that the characters are bad Jewish stereotypes. The worst of all is Melissa Gilbert, whom you hate from the scene one and never develop any sympathy for. Performances like this should be noted and used against actors who want to work again. All in all, a shady, low-budget television film that gives a bad name to films made for television.
