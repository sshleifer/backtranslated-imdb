I watched 5% of this movie tonight and you can tell me that I need to see the whole movie to understand it, but frankly, I do not think so. <br /> <br /> What is the hell of this story? movie? I saw many people running in a factory and shooting at everything around them. <br /> <br /> Where to start? Ok .. <br /> <br /> 1) They were shooting around the place as if it was the Terminator or something they were trying to kill. The place is entirely made of metal, but not a single bullet is lit on metal surfaces. <br /> <br /> 2) No ricochet. The metal against the metal will inevitably cause ricochets, but apparently no one has been hit by a stray bullet. <br /> <br /> 3) Magic balls? In one scene, a villain stands right in front of a nice guy when another nice guy appears behind the villain and the metal pump. You see the bullets coming out of her chest as she explodes in a bloody haze, but the good guy right in front of him does not hurt at all! 4) After splashing a human everywhere on the wall, the two good guys tell each other jokes and laugh and look like teenagers playing with knives. <br /> <br /> 5) The sound? At one point, the gentiles cut a wire and an alarm goes off (who the hell is cutting a wire just to trigger an alarm?). The lady yells "Alarm in the blah blah sector" and the boss of the villain says: "Ok .. that .. is .. not .. an .. exercise .. blah blah" in a very very amateur way. Ooh, we are being ambushed by terrorists, it's not an exercise, but I'm going to look like I'm not bullshitting. <br /> <br /> 6) Focus !! First, you see the bad guys loaded with weapons. For some reason, the same guy gets the same Uzi twice. Already seen or loop of scenes? You literally see that all the bad guys are given the same type of weapon, that they lock and load in the same way. The arms trafficker appears in the clip and the nasty extra no. XX locks and charges. When they have started to open fire, you MUST see the barrel blink. Drop !! 7) Actors or void? One of the alleged good guys throws a smoke grenade for some reason and of course, the bad guys are suddenly in the smoke because they are blind to the smoke or something not to see it coming. They cough and moan as if they were Anthrax in the pomegranate. Then a bad semi-boss comes in and he does not even cough when he gets into the smoke, he just pushes out the other bad guys and they suddenly realize that the smoke is not Anthrax anyway. <br /> <br /> 8) B film? I think so! A guy who slips on a metal pipe brandishing a Uzi right hand pulling someone at eye level, it seems. I'd like to see a guy shoot an Uzi with one hand and I'd like to see him pick up his hand afterwards. An extra bloody mess in a B movie a bit. A little * pop * and a red hole with a torn shirt indicate that this guy is dead. Even if the first bullet touched his heart, the brave guy, a well-trained green beret, still feels the need to empty his staple into the dead. <br /> <br /> 9) One of these trained soldiers mentioned jumps from his skin with an empty clip! How can you be stupid !? Always check your clip before facing an unknown number of enemies! 10) boring scenes. Like barrel scenes and scenes of locking and loading, the film is full of time-wasting scenes of people running in a seemingly empty building. If you are shooting a B movie, do not hesitate. <br /> <br /> My two cents on this movie.
