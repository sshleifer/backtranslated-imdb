Lord! This film must have a new classification on its cover "Look only if you have absolutely nothing to do!" I'm disappointed I was looking forward to a good horror movie this weekend ... I needed an adrenaline rush and an impressive tingling sensation on my back. But this movie did not do it. A pretty good story but an acting, a dialogue and a rather awful shoot. It was disjointed and sometimes completely stupid. We had actors looking in the wrong direction of the camera, people talking aloud and telling what they were feeling and what was going to happen, shadows of equipment in some shots, idiot cliches like "I just need you to hold me "In places and situations totally wrong. Thank you for allowing me to unload and sorry for offending anyone, but it was a waste of time and money.
