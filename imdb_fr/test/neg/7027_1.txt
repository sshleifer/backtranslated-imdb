"Mame" is a shame for a lot of things - for Lucille Ball, for a story that has been better told over and over, and for the musical genre as a whole. Mrs. Ball does not understand her character at all and she seems to be heavily sedated. Bea Arthur is good, but it's not enough. The production is very mediocre and not expensive, the songs are mediocre and almost all the jokes are missed. Moreover, Lucy could not dance well, so the music had to slow down at a dramatic pace. Avoid at all costs, but do not see the delicious "Auntie Mame".
