Excellent game, good production values, good direction. <br /> <br /> But the scenario starts with a lot of drive and interest for the first half, then collapses in the second half. We are clear on the character and motivation for the first half, but the second part leaves many unanswered questions. <br /> <br /> The conflicts raised are convincing but the monitoring is poor. For example, we are very clear that Rudyard Kipling is pro-war, but we do not know if this philosophical position will change in the course of the film. <br /> <br /> This is the kind of photo that makes me want to look for facts in history books. I do not think I can trust the film to get a clear idea. <br /> <br /> The description of the war itself is heartbreaking, although the lack of enthusiasm of women does not reflect the hysteria of war. which swept Britain at the time. Perhaps this is historically accurate; I like it so much in this movie, I just do not know.
