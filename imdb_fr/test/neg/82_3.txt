DMHS! It's not a terrible movie, but it's totally forgettable. The lighting is intentionally insufficient in many scenes and unintentionally insufficient in all the rest. So you risk getting out of a viewing with a headache or eyes. The special effects are imaginative, but obvious. The essential free nudity for teen slasher movies is there, of course, with the archetypal teens, but the entire movie just does not freeze. What was needed was a brighter dialogue and more ironic humor. <br /> <br /> I really can not recommend you waste your time watching this movie. I often wink at a film based on a scene or two that is imaginative or humorous, but these are sorely lacking in this film.
