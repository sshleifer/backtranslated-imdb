One of the worst things a film studio can do is exploit the tragedies of others by selling a shock factor or "gore" to sell tickets to buy a new diamond necklace from their birch. . Another worse thing is to give a totally false picture of the facts of an incredible saga by making events, dialogues and images as the director wants. Finally, one of the worst things a film studio can do is to call in actors from the bottom of the barrel and turn everything on a sound stage rented at 50 cents a day. The authors of this film are guilty of these three disguises. It's the worst film I've ever seen, and I've seen thousands. A score of '1' is too good for this celluloid waste. Filmmakers should not only be ashamed of having done so, but also of having exploited negatively the heroes of this story, who are the people who experienced this tragedy, both the living and the dead.
