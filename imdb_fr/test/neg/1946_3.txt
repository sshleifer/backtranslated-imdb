The film had an interesting surprise. A little psychologically striking. And the producers could have ended it with taste without making a new series of films published by Hollywood to promote homosexuality and / or other sexual deviance. It could have ended with a "return on investment", but the pen had other reasons. What makes me quiet is that the mud stuck to your face AFTER you saw the whole movie. Like the disappointing "The talented Mr. Ripley". Yes, of course, I am only a Puritan. This gay content has tarnished the whole movie. I would not judge positively that a film has artistic or entertainment value if its sole purpose was to promote a subsequent political motivation, even more so.
