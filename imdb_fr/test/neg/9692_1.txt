I could not believe what I saw ... (once) brilliant actors appearing in this terrible effort that should never be done. The intrigues are appalling and the dialogue is similar (at first, I thought it was a travesty), and the game epic. Everything is bad, inexpensive sets with spooky decorations, a group of paintings enlarged. Respectable filmmakers have a hard time understanding their vision. Yet this blasphemous and pathetic mini-series attempt is featured on television, with three Academy Award winners. I can only guess that everyone involved hurt the screenwriter and the director and was forced (perhaps under the threat of a gun) to play in that worthless basket of T.V.
