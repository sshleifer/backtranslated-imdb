This film is a low-budget production, but I will not say anything more because it has already been covered. I give this movie a low note for story alone, but I met the director the night I saw the movie and it gave me an extra reason not to like the movie. He asked me how I liked it and I told him that it was not easy to love. My main objection was the lack of foundation for the relationship between the two main characters, I have never been convinced of their proximity. I also told him that the scene in which the main characters were portrayed as children becoming friends was too late in the film. <br /> <br /> He told me that backtracking scenes were not included in the original script. That they were added because he had the impression that it was the case, the two main characters did not appear close. He then explained that these scenes were not filmed to his satisfaction because they were short of money. I agree that they did not do much for the film. <br /> <br /> Another fact I did not know about the movie is that the actor who asked the script to write the script is based on his personal experience. This is usually a bad move because some authors do not take into account the emotional reaction of the viewer. The story is so close to home that the author writes too much of the presuppositions about the public's reaction to his own tragedy. And the story is tragic. However, it did not work for me because I was never interested in any of the characters, much less in his main role. What was presented was that two evil people were trying to make money by any means, no matter who gets hurt. When Ms. Young's character decides to give up her bad manners, she seems to be doing it because she is ineffective, not because she knows she is wrong. If the movie contains a message, I guess only the author is aware.
