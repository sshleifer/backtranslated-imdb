Of course, the concept had already been done with Alf and the Charmings: project modern society on one or more displaced characters. But I loved both series and watched them religiously until their end in 1990. When I heard about Scorch, I was really very optimistic about something new, because the new TV in the 90s did not had not impressed yet (but at least Star Trek: TNG and the Simpsons were still going). <br /> <br /> What I got was a big disappointment. The acting was awful, but given the ridiculous dialogue and the absolutely incredible writing, I can not blame them too much for what they had to work with. There were some humorous moments, but most of the deliberate jokes seemed forced into their execution. The entire production work of the show seemed too small budget for what was on television at the time. In the 80s, it would have corresponded perfectly. <br /> <br /> However, it was the first episode and it was necessary to present the characters and establish the basic principle of the series; I gave him the benefit of the doubt. The second episode was not so bad, and I was beginning to find hope that once in the process, the series would improve. Unfortunately, my VCR ended up not recording the third episode aired, I could never see it and the series then disappeared from television programs. I only have the first two episodes recorded live on a VHS tape.
