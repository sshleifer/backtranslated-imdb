I was just watching a Forensic Files marathon on Court TV. The episode was identical to the plot of this film, to the secret of incest and secondary intrigue with her friend. I do not remember the disclaimer based on True Story, but MOW is registered in the folder. Apparently, it tells the true homicide of Ruby Morris by her husband Earl, sentenced to 25 years in perpetuity for his murder. This only shows you that the truth may be stranger than fiction, because I thought that Lifetime's scenario was artificial and more than a "stretch" as far as credibility goes. I'm with the other posters who said the acting was bad. I did not notice it with all the players, though. It was really the main character, the girl, whose performances were bad.
