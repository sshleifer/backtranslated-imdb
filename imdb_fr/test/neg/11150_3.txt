To summarize, go past the end of days and look rather rent the ninth door of Roman Polanski. This film is the perfect American stereotypical film vs. Ninth Gate, which is the perfect European stereotypical film. <br /> <br /> Ninth Gate: Black-ish, intelligent, well-rated, atmospheric, excellent acting (Johnny Depp, esp), beautiful scenery, good cinematography, funny one-liners, intellectual, minimal coarse language , prompting reflection. The only fault is that some people did not understand the open end and said that the film was "crap" because of that and that there were some dubious scenes. <br /> <br /> End Times: Overly violent and liberal use of vulgar language, NO musical score except for a mediocre commercial soundtrack attempt that was only heard when Gabriel Byrne parade in New York under the name of Satan had nothing to do with intrigue, violence, incredibly predictable, violence, and did I mention a lot more violence? I guess some special effects were good, but that's about it. <br /> <br /> Well, maybe I'm wrong, but I thought Ninth Gate was a lot more interesting, original, original and smart. But maybe the Americans do not need it. * dripping with cynicism * Even though I'm American, I sometimes ask myself questions.
