The story of Farewell to the King is intriguing. An American "deserter" (I had the impression that he and his 3 comrades were only trying to escape the Philippines because their desperate raft flight to Borneo is not your classic desertion). But they barely land when they are discovered by the Japanese. The character of Nolte (a sergeant) has just walked alone a few moments before on the beach and has not been noticed. And, incredible thing, no one noticed his footprints in the sand that would have brought the Japanese to his right. Anyway, Nolte is supported by a tribe of headhunters and becomes their king after defeating another member of the tribe. So he is out of the war. Then the British commandos introduce themselves and want the tribe to assist them in their fight against the Japanese. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Nolte's incessant wounds ruin an interesting story. Instead of acting like an old soldier plunged back into war, now led by a tribe of warriors, Nolte acts as if he were raised by the tribe. He speaks as if English is almost a foreign language and rarely uses contractions. When he speaks, he makes big gestures and acts as if he were one with nature, as if he had been raised in the jungle. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of action and many interesting scenes with the British interacting with Nolte and the tribe. But Nolte's character is never credible. It always looks like he's too active. He needed to be a little more an American soldier and a lot less a member of a tribe. As such, he falls not as a royal king, but as a madman who has forgotten who he really is. But this is not the intention of the film, because the scenario makes him admire and trust the British commandos. There is no indication that the British thought his behavior was strange. The British simply consider him the de facto leader of the tribe. So, it still seems that the character of Nolte does not correspond to what is supposed to happen in the film. <br /> <br /> Another actor might have done a good job with the role, interpreted his lyrics in a credible way it's an exceptional film. But Nolte ruins the film by hiding every scene and not seeming to understand what her character is supposed to be. <br /> <br /> What a mess.
