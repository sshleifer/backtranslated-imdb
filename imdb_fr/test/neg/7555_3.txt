I have never watched a film that frustrates me as much as Lord Of The Dance. Frustrated because it could have been fantastic. Frustrated because the dance could have been amazing. Frustrated because the women could have been beautiful. How could I know though ?! By the time your eyes moved to the area of ​​interest on the screen and focused appropriately on the place to be admired, the foolish editor moved the shot! I completely agree with the other comments about the unpleasant lighting and the terrible work of the camera / publisher. It makes me feel nauseous to watch ten minutes of this movie would be spectacular. <br /> <br /> Give me the opportunity to attend the first place of the concert and I'll be there at once! <br /> <br /> Nicholas T
