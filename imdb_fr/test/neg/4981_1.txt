I remember seeing the very first trailer for Underdog back in March. I also remember that time when I smiled slightly. Of course, it was a nerdy idea, but I really thought that at the time, the concept could work, but hey, it could not be worse than the disappointing Cats and Dogs could not they ? Then, in December, I suddenly remembered the movie. I realized how bad the film could be. The delay in the UK gave the inevitable impression that it would be terrible, but the disappointing reviews made me realize that it was almost impossible. for the film to be good. Still, I swallowed my feelings and went to see the movie with a friend today. Entering my screen, I was mortified, it was the first time I saw a movie with a friend and be the only two on the screen! I did not know what I was going to endure. To express things bluntly is horrible, it really is. Imagine how badly you think this movie is bad and then get ready for an even worse movie, that's how pathetic the movie is. Although the goal is to entertain children, it seems like an embarrassing mess that seems to insult them rather than allowing them to enjoy the movie. The fact that the story is beyond the gloom, that the acting is generally mediocre and that the film looks like a Saturday cartoon very long, tired and downright boring can not help. After a brief five-minute moment when I thought the film might be passable, the film suddenly seems to die and then limp towards the final already reported. I'm just amazed that the movie was really out, it's an embarrassment for Disney, half of their gods are much better than that! What is even more terrifying is the fact that the end leaves room for a sequel! <br /> <br /> Then let's move on to the actor (cracks). Ok. Let me be honest. Jason Lee is ok, his voice is good for the dog, and if he had a decent scenario, he might have managed to make the performance work. However, with such a dubious script, he seems to be wading. In many ways it reminded me of Bill Murray in Garfield, Murray was doing what he could with what he had, but what he had was not enough to make him passable. Then, we go on the human actors, and well the majority of atroces. Alex Neuberger plays Underdog's friend, Jack. My biggest concern is that anyone would even take it seriously at an audition. The scene where he flies with Underdog is perhaps the craziest scene in recent years just because his game is so mediocre. Not once, I did not think he was a real person, in fact, a part of me is still convinced that he was a robot specifically designed for the movie! James Belushi seems half-dead in the film, he has nothing to work with, no decent line, he just seems to be wandering the scene waiting to become relevant to the plot, what writers are trying to do in the end but do it that way. a bad way its laughable. Fortunately, Peter Dinklage is the factor who redeems the film, he is great as Dr Barsinister and seems to laugh at this role. He steals every scene in which he is, although it's not difficult when he shares the time spent on the screen with the very annoying Patrick Warburton. The rest of the cast is even worse, especially Taylor Momsen. She must just end her acting career now! <br /> <br /> Underdog also fails dramatically in producing such a funny scene. When the most fun scene involves Underdog biting a tin can and blowing up dog food everywhere you know there is something wrong at all. This could be easily ignored if the movie had a decent action or a good story, alas the movie is even worse in these two terms. The effects are so simple that any scene where Underdog flies seems simply absurd, and the dog uses his powers with such little effect that you often forget that he has super powers. What is the point of making a movie about a super dog if this damn dog never looks great? The final fight is also embarrassing because of its ten minutes of nothingness, the dog flies away, other incidents occur, some elements are put in the trash, all this is irrelevant, these events being aimed at to accomplish what is happening. The scenario is also dubious at best and a direct pain inducing at worst. When someone says "Look, it's a plane, no it's a bird, no it's a frog ...", yes, you read it right, I just wanted to burst into tears. In fact, I wanted to leave and I had to see if it could be lower than that, it almost happens at the end, so it's not going well. <br /> <br /> In general, Underdog becomes the worst film from 2008 to 2008 this early period, and is actually as bad as the epic film of previous years. Fortunately for Underdog, Meet the Spartans is coming here soon and I expect it to be even worse. So, in case you did not understand the meaning of my comment, avoid the film at all costs, if you want to see a movie with a dog and then watch Cats and Dogs, buy a real dog if necessary, but do not see it not!
