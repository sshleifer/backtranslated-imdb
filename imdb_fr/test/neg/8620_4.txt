In Thailand, Americans Connor (Colin Egglesfield) and his girlfriend Amanda (Meredith Monroe) compete in a Muay-Thai fight, and Amanda leaves Connor alone. She asks the hotel manager for a stranger, the nasty vampire Niran (Don Hetrakul), and she is bitten and kidnapped by her gang of villainous vampires on a motorcycle. Connor joins a clan of "good" vampires led by Sang (Stephanie Chao), trying to save Amanda from Niran's clutches. <br /> <br /> I was expecting "Vampires: The Turning" to be a good movie. The places and the cinematography are beautiful; the very heavy score is excellent; Stephanie Chao is beautiful and attractive; but unfortunately the screenplay and the director are terrible and Meredith Monroe's loose-fitting costume does not help her sagging breasts. The story is very short and the unknown Marty Weiss uses long scenes of boring motorcycle races, fights and flashbacks to complete a minimal shooting time. My vote is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Vampiros: a conversation" ("The vampires: the conversion")
