Okay, last night, August 18, 2004, I had the great regret to meet Mr. Van Bebble during a screening of The Manson Family at The Three Penny in Chicago as part of the Chicago Underground Film Festival. Here is what I have to say about it. First of all, the movie is an obvious rip-off of all Kenneth Anger's films, Roman Polanski, Oliver Stone and Terry Gilliam that I've ever seen. Secondly, during a short question-and-answer session after the show, Mr. Van Bebble immediately stated that he had never made contact with actual members of the Manson family or with Charlie himself. the film was based on his take of Van Bebble on the lawsuit after seeing everything from his TV and news show (and I suppose autobiography and the book Helter Skelter that were directly imitated through the story). So, I had a second question on the questions, I asked if he was trying to present the foreign version, Mtv, sexual drugs and rock 'n roll and not necessarily the true story. This question has obviously annoyed the director, who has now all chicked, who began to shout: "Fuck you, shut up, that's the truth! All these other movies are bullshit!" <br /> <br /> Well anyway, I did not even think about how ridiculous it was until the next day, when I read the movie's slogan: "You've heard the side of the laws of history ... now listen to the story as told by the Manson family. "Excuse me, if this guy has never even spoken to the family and considers it to be are liars with whom he does not want to have anything to do, how, in the name of God, can he tell the story for them? This is the most ridiculous statement I have ever heard! The film was obviously aimed at the public of sexual drugs and rock'n'roll, which it had no difficulty attracting to the dimly lit theater, and it was even more obviously engendered by sexual drugs and the spirit rock'n'roll of a man who could not even watch his own movie without getting up every ten minutes to fetch more beer or shout a kind of Rocky Horror line to the actors on the screen. This film only transforms the public's image into events (which helped to shape the state of America and the world at the moment) into a kind of fantasy Slasher / Comics / Porn / Violence imagined by an obviously superficial individual. <The movie was really very impressive to watch. The soundtrack was refreshing because it contained concrete examples of Charlie's work with the family off of his Lie album. The editing was nice and unstable to simulate the nauseating uncertainty of most modern video clips. Overall, this film would have been a much better addition to Mtv's catalogs than the underground film festival or intellectual observers. I felt like I was at midnight Rocky Horror watching how the audience was dressed and behaved (probably the best part of the experience). The cast was very good, with the exception of Charlie who looked more like a kind of stunned Dungeons and Dragons fanatics than the actual role he was describing. The descriptions that the film gives of him as bursting with energy, throwing you ten things and being very physical about him do not correspond at all to the slow, lethargic and chubby representation that has been presented. <br /> <br /> All in all, the movie basically explains itself as Sadie (or maybe Linda) said at the end: "You can write a bunch of Bullsh books ** or make a lots of Bullsh movies ** ... etc. "Case in point. Even the "Based on a true story" warning is a dead gift, indicating that somewhere under this pile of psychedelic garbage, lies the foundation of a real story with content that will and will have made a difference in the world . All you have to do is a bit of alchemy to separate the truth from the crap, or maybe you could just avoid it together and read a book instead. <br /> <br /> All I can say That's right, when the movie came to an end I got a free beer, so I'm glad I was there, but not so happy having spent fifteen dollars on my ticket to be told to shut up for asking a question to the director. Peace.
