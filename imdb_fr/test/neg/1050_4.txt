It's really a movie of two halves. The first details the life and friendship of two boys (one privileged Pashtun and another undisciplined Hazara) in the late 70s in Afghanistan, before the invasion of the USSR. The young actors achieved convincing performances and saw Afghanistan as it once was, which made the current situation very relieved. <br /> <br /> The real problem arises when we enter the last phase of history where we join the Pashtuns. as a man living in America. Old debts to his young friend have led him back to his homeland and it's really at this point that things are falling apart. The central adult character is clearly supposed to be sympathetic, but actually appears as a lazy and wallow in self pity. It's hard to really care about him and you can not help thinking that the really interesting story is the one we can not see - that of his childhood friend. <br /> <br /> Once he returned to Afghanistan, the story gets bogged down in a series of very artificial coincidences. More remarkable still, he manages almost immediately to find his enemy of his childhood after all these years (even if he does not seek it), in spite of the chaos that has since consumed the country. This allows him to confront the demons of the past in a way that is too convenient to be credible. The resolution of the story is also crossed by a cursed and horrible sentimentality that undermines all the really serious points that the film tries to make. <br /> <br /> Although it's possible to start seeing characters and abuses of their lives as the symbol of a state torn apart by world politics, it's hard to really see this as a film that engage in a broader political discussion. Instead, the narrative becomes reduced to a character's emotional journey of self-discovery and healing. Unfortunately, this character is so dull and wrapped up in himself that it's hard to really engage in his story, as the opportunities to make a really interesting film about Afghanistan are ruined.
