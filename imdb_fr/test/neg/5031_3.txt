I did not really think it was a very, very gratuitous adaptation of Eça de Queiroz's work, and I must say that this free adaptation formed the book as a lot of good ideas and possible characters. The problem is how it is done, without any care, without any taste, just a roar of clichés of bad taste everywhere. The scenario is so false and the characters so unreal that to see actors as friendly as Unas, Bryner, Morgado, Lagarto and others are lost in a network of everything except cinema or story. To my surprise, newcomers Jorge Corrula and Soraia Chaves bravely stand by their performances, but you can see them lost like a boat adrift without any direction. And speaking of direction, this seems to be something that is totally missing from this film - where is the director? Everything is in bad taste; the frames are what you want, and every time you use a portable camera without a justified reason, the design of the light that should create environments does not exist (and you can not pretend that the whole thing is a dark story and real). The general problem in this film "trying to be" is that there is no taste, no very, very bad taste. It's sad to see Jorge and Soraia blend into such fake and gratified sexual scenes, painted here and there through the film as narration holes or used as false transitional motifs. Maybe Carlos Coelho da Silva should see the adaptation of Carlos Carrera in 2002 from the same book of Eça and understand how to build a real movie.
