It's clearly a French film. This is a young group of idealistic / revolutionary / anarchist people. It moves very slowly. Long takes. LOng close-ups. A minute or more for an attempt to light a pipe filled with hash / opium. A long look at how a group spills a car and burns it. It's a black and white film. The subtitles were white, so they were unreadable about a third of the time. (Why are they doing this?) I came out after about an hour and three quarters when it became clear that this picture was not going anywhere, slowly. I was not the first to go out. It was the first time I came out of a picture of my long life. (Well, maybe the second one.)
