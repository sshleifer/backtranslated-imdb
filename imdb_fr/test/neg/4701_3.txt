This western / comedy / comedy is not one of the best of the genre I have ever seen. I found it way too slow. Here, Richard Bridges is the star and Lloyd Bridges is also a star. But for my money, Edgar Buchanan is the best of the group. Buchanan appeared in many Westerns in his day, often providing comic relief, as he does in this picture. I also liked Ann Dvorak as Rita. Otherwise, I can not recommend this film too much. the same name in 1939, redone in 1966 and again in 1986. The 1939 version of Stagecoach is, in my opinion, one of the best films ever made. Anyway, as for Abilene, my vote is a 3/10
