Whenever someone tries to tell me he thinks that a movie is the worst (and that it's usually a "cool" movie to hate, like "Manos, the hands of fate" or "The Avengers "), I ask them: to film a comedy about an orphan who is constantly trying to murder adults? Does anyone say "I'd rather eat shit in this movie?" <br /> <br /> This movie is MUCH too childish and stupid for adults, and far too violent and irresponsible for kids. so much money in the Beavis and Butt-head demographic groups to make a series of movies like this? There's a child problem 3, but I have not seen it, I'd rather eat shit.
