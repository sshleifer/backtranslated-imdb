What's wrong with Disney in recent years? Are there totally short of good ideas? Where is the magic? Where are the good animators, the good songwriters, the good directors, the good ones ... Well, I know, Walt himself and the famous "old nine" can not come back. But is this a reason to launch countless of these inexpensive suites and slowly but surely destroy the ideals of Walt Disney? However, I have never rented or purchased a Disney suite from this movie. Because I had read enough about his (lack of) quality. But "Atlantis: the return of Milo" was broadcast today on television in Germany and I look at it. This confirmed my doubts about the suites. It was absolutely boring. Fault animation, primitive color rotation, simple characters, some unsuccessful attempts to simulate the famous Multiplan-Camera with a computer-generated image, a mediocre music and a patchwork of simple and different stories. It does not look like Disney at all! Not like Disney I know! It looks like one of countless, simple and inexpensive animation series, like "DragonballZ", "Beyblade", etc., broadcast daily on TV for kids. <br /> <br /> My first reaction after showing this shit, to load "Bambi" in my DVD player, to see the magic, the depth, the spirit and the immortal charm of Disney, to see Disney on its heyday , see the impressive art of animation by hand. "Bambi" was the first (and until now the only) film I give 10 stars out of 10. But "Atlantis: the return of Milo"? No magic, no depth, no charm, no spirit ... It deserved only 3 out of 10!
