I saw the trailers of this film and found the cinematography and what was presented interesting. I saw the IMDb rating and 6.8 confirmed it above average. So went to see him. <br /> <br /> The story is about Mandy Lane (Amber Heard) ?? a beautiful girl in high school who is a subject of male sexual desire. The provocation of Mandy's friend, Emmet (Michael Welch), to another student to show him his love for Mandy, leaves the pupil drunk and lifts himself to death. Nine months go by and Mandy is invited by her teenage friends for a summer weekend on an isolated ranch. three girls and three boys go there! There is a security guard Garth (Anson Mount) who works at the ranch. During the first night, killings take place ?? one by one, the members of the group are killed. Who is behind the killings? I will not say here to spoil the sports? Did I like the movie? NO. After the usual interesting opening ?? the film takes a downward turn with each event unfolding. At half-time, when the murderer is revealed, we lose interest in the rest of the process. There is one last twist in the story to shock the viewers, but it made me rather shake my head not to believe and laugh! All this for suspense? Huh ?! Amber Heard plays and plays her role as a shy and conscious girl? who is aware of her beauty and the desire of men for her. The remaining actors are usual ?? nothing to say about. There are so many movies showing boys and girls going to an isolated place and slowly, someone killing them one by one? that the movie does not interest me anymore. <br /> <br /> Director Jonathan Levine strives to make the film interesting by using contemporary chats with teenagers charged with sexual overtones, but does not allow the film to overtake the mundane. . <br /> <br /> The only and most interesting thanks to the film is its cinematography by Darren Genet ?? who captures beautiful images perfect images!
