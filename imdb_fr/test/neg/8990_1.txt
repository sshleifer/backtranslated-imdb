This fantasy was a total trash. I thought Michael Moore had trapped the market with ridiculous anti-government movies, but this one was way worse than anything he ever did. No wonder critics in the British media complain that he is motivated by tabloid journalism. This film is the biggest fantasy of a fool left coming to life on the big screen. Anyone, even slightly to the right of those rabid Bush demoisers, should be appalled by the fact that funds are allocated to him. I'm sure it will be good in Syria, Iran, Pakistan and North Korea. It's hard to believe that in these days of crazy Muslims blowing up innocent commuters, anyone in the UK thinks Britain should go to war on terror. I guess it's no longer the country I admired for fighting alone against the Nazis almost 70 years ago. All greet Neville Chamberlain and the political pathos of appeasement!
