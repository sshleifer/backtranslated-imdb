I had just discovered before writing this review that "Komodo vs. Cobra" and another movie titled "Curse of the Komodo" were both made by the same guy, Jim Wynorski. This could explain why these are almost identical local films. Both present an army-controlled island, a colonel more concerned about covering his tracks than the lives of his employees, people running to a helicopter lying in a field somewhere on the island, and dragons komodo giants created using genetic experiments run amok. What are the differences? Well, the intruders of the island are now capitalists who want to reveal the secret of the government. There is also a giant cobra on the island, hence the title "Komodo vs. Cobra", even if the conflict between the two monsters is irrelevant ". "Komodo vs. Cobra "is more or less what you would expect given its title and the origin of its channel: the channel Sci-Fi. Although from time to time, you find one that, for a reason or another, you may like it (I liked a film called "Komodo"), I have no doubt that it will do it. <br /> <br /> "Komodo vs. Cobra "It's not just a boring movie, it's also one of the least enthusiastic sci-fi movies I've seen in a long time, and in some of these films there's an air that says the filmmakers have given at least some level of effort, but I see very little here.This is further indicated by the fact that it is simply a repetition of "Curse of Komodo". synthesis for monsters seem to come straight out of a second-rate video game, cinematography and shooting scenes are mediocre, the acting is going from fair to mediocre, the action scenes are dull, and then are, frankly Imperfectly bad, I see a lot of movies in which a person will shoot a weapon several times without reloading and I can handle that, but in this film, where Michael Paré takes a single thirty-eight gun and pulls it about fifty times without stopping , without recharging once - Well, at first I laughed, but even in those moments, it became tiring. It would be action. A monster appears, people scream, Paré fires without stopping, without reloading his weapon once in the whole picture, and someone is being eaten. <br /> <br /> "Komodo vs. Cobra" is a very bad movie. The only thing in the film that deserves to be mentioned in a charitable way is an actress named Michelle Borth, who is not only very beautiful, but also a surprisingly strong performer. Even with the sneaky dialogue and lack of enthusiasm in the script that has been entrusted to her, Michelle Borth has managed to achieve a surprisingly good performance and it is really shocking that an actress as good as this one can get stuck in a movie as complicated as this one. She obviously took that for pay, but it's not going to boost her career, I'm afraid.
