This is the worst kind of movie. <br /> <br /> The plot is ridiculous, the characters are unrealistic stereotypes that never give the impression to believe it themselves. Are whites such monsters that they will continue to call "two good boys" two young white rapists in their twenties and must be convinced that this could be a cause for provocation? Are blacks universally inspiring? Does the Ku Klux Klan really stand in the courts and shoot at lawyers without anyone intervening? Do judges really think that a fair trial can be conducted when the jury can hear a crowd outside shouting "Kill him"? Are blacks really with the Klan waiting for the verdict? Do women really have to realize for months that their husband could defend a man from an unfair hanging because he knew he could have done the same thing? Do jurors really acquit people of murder because they feel sorry for them? Do lawyers really use a defense of reason to persuade people that their client was temporarily insane? <br /> <br /> Worse yet, all the high principles of this film have been lost in favor of the completely gratuitous and abusive use of sexual crime to move the public. Was the subject of rape, let alone that of child gangs, really in competent hands? Is this really a subject that belongs to the hands of Hollywood? And if so, why the completely free removal and undressing of Sandra Bullock? And the accusation of statutory rape completely useless against one of the witnesses? It looks like the director does not believe IT strongly about sex crimes after all. <br /> <br /> It was about taking the excellent plot of To Kill a Mockingbird and making it a false flood, shallow and tasteless. Shame on them.
