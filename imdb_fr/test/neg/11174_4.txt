I was hoping to have misunderstood this film, because I'm a big fan of Ruggero Deodato and I really did not want to see him slide. but unfortunately, this supernatural supernatural charge to the Giallo is as bad as I had been led to believe - and it's rather terrible! The plot does not work at all, because the movie tries to mix murders and a supernatural theme through a phone. All this seems very forced and ridiculous. In addition, the plot does not make much sense, and you have to ask "what's the point" many times in the movie. The plot is centered on a young woman living in a building and terrorized by a phone. The best thing about the movie is undoubtedly the presence of the beautiful English actress Charlotte Lewis and, unfortunately, the good things do not stop there. There are a handful of death scenes, some of which are bloody; but all are incredibly stupid, the one who sees someone being killed by coins is particularly noteworthy in this regard. Overall, I really can not recommend this to anyone. Deodato fans are unlikely to be impressed, and Deodato fans will likely find the film depressing. To avoid!
