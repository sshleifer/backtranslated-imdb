I loved the first movie, the second was ok, disappointed. John Cleese was no longer Jean Bob, he was my favorite character. But the third ... what happened to the animation ??? it looks like a small budget like a Saturday morning cartoon! except for the flashback that was taken from the first movie. They really should have stopped after the number 2, the rest looks bad !! Derek's voice has changed, but she's not as recognizable as Bob's jeans..Rogers also seems very strange. I do not understand where Rothbart comes from. I thought he was dead! This film made me want to turn it off, although I like the first film, I was very disappointed with this payment. They will never beat the original! :)
