I'm sorry but honestly, I really do not see why anyone would like that. It's stereotypical and the real school kids are nothing like they were on this show !! Personally, I'm glad it was canceled after the first episodes. I mean, this kind of show would certainly be acceptable if everyone knew that the kids at home were not really like that, and the whole story was just for the show, but unfortunately, everybody is not aware. If someone who watched this movie actually thought that was what was happening in the life of a home at home, then, honestly, I feel sorry for them. It reminds me of the kind of representation they have of home schooled children in "Mean Girls". It's sad, really, that people think that way. This is the full bin, IMHO.
