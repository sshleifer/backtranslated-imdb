Irwin Allen's first adventure in the stars' show was a star disaster. The history of humanity contains some of the most incredible casting decisions of all time. Virginia Mayo in blonde Cleopatra, Dennis Hopper painting the landscape with Napoleon, Peter Lorre dining on the landscape for weeks under the name of Nero, Marie Wilson in Marie Antoinette road show Marilyn Monroe, among them. <br /> <br /> The film is also known to be the latest film featuring the three Marx brothers, although their roles are different. Chico plays a monk who is the confidant of Christopher Columbus, Groucho tells Peter Midnight to the Indians of the Isle of Manhattan, and the most astonishing, Harpo Marx in the role of Sir Isaac Newton who discovers gravity when an apple invades him . <br /> <br /> Bringing together all these representations is a story where humanity itself is judged. A super H bomb is about to be discovered and released will do the job of the world population. The last judgment is coming. <br /> <br /> But humanity has its defenders and detractors. Old Scratch is the representative of the prosecution. For centuries, he has made known the worst in man in the form of Vincent Price. But the man also has his good side and who, better than Ronald Colman, can demonstrate the man to his best civilized. Colman and Price plead their case in front of the judge played by Cedric Hardwicke. <br /> <br /> These three people are among the most beautiful voices spoken by the English language. It is a pleasure to listen when the film is broadcast when they present each exhibited objects. Then, when the focus is on individual stories, you want to scream in agony. <br /> <br /> What did Irwin Allen attack, I always try to understand. Did he deliberately participate in some of these casting decisions? If it was a satire, it does not make sense. <br /> <br /> It was Ronald Colman's farewell film, and even though I would hardly do that, I can not think of any man who could have better defended civilization. <br /> <br /> Thus, when you see the History of Humanity, move quickly in some exhibitions and cherish every moment when the lawyers are before the judge.
