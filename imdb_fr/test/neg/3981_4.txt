It's a good premise for a movie. The whole plot is very original, interesting and sobering. However, a mediocre production, a clearly small budget, a crapy game of the main character and several secondary actors who really derogate would be classic. An aspiring producer should try to relaunch this story and give that sincere player a sincere attempt to try a proper exit.
