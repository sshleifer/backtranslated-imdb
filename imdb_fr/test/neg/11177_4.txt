A breathtaking beauty, Charlotte Lewis, embodies a woman terrorized by ghosts who torment her on the phone. Found on the verge of terror, Charlotte is forced to face this frightening mystery to save her sanity and her life. Ruggero Deodato, the director of "Ultimo Mondo Cannibale", "Cannibal Holocaust" and "House on the Edge of the Park" directed this absurd trash. The story is painfully stupid. The scenario of Franco Ferrini is ridiculous and it makes no sense, the acting is bad and there is absolutely no suspense. that laughable.Do not waste your time with this piece of shit. There are much better Italian horror movies out there!
