It must be one of the weakest intrigues of a movie I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> However, that's not all that's missing from this film. This film has the worst actors, writers, directors, special effects, and it's the worst ever. <br /> <br /> I strongly advise you to devote your time to interesting movies and not waste your time doing it. garbage. <br /> <br /> I agree with a previous article that said "women" were definitely men disguised as drag, and that made me laugh, I always try to understand if they were obvious or if they were really trying to be sexy women. <br /> <br /> Anyway, there is not much else to watch in this movie! <br /> <br /> To sum up: a horrible acting game, horrible scenario, horrible idea for a movie. An hour and a half of my life I want to come back right now !!
