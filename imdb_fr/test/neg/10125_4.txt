I enjoyed the prequels and found the relationship between Tucker and Chan hilarious before. RH3, however, was a reworking of the first two without charm or humor. I think I may have laughed once - and it was during the GNs. Tucker was extremely annoying in this movie and his character seemed to have no other purpose than to tinker in the most irritating way possible. Chan is always nice, but he seemed tired in this movie. I was able to predict ALL who was the bad guy, who was the girl (SPOILER ALERT), who was the bad guy, and so on. I hope to see more of Tucker and Chan's films in their own projects, but more in the aftermath of Rush Hour. It's just too tired. I recommend a rental, but not a purchase.
