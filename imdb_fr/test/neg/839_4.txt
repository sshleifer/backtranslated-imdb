There is a lot of money behind this production, so it looks very good. It includes some interesting appearances by Gilbert Roland, Eddie Burns and a brief preview of the beginning by Christopher Lee. There are some exciting shootings and some humorous passages - the satire of Django, The Man Without Name and Sabata is fun, especially when given the name of the deposed president of the Mexican Revolution. <br /> <The problem is that there is no reason to satirize the spaghetti western as it is attempted here. The key element of Spaghettis is IRONY, which blends easily into comedy; In fact, the source of all Spaghetti is Yojimbo of Kurosawa, universally recognized as one of the great black comedies of all time. Most Spaghetti has easily slipped above reality in a comedy of a very sophisticated variety. The best proof of this is perhaps found in Trinity's films, which are both openly spaghetti and openly slap-stick comedy. So why bother to satirize a genre that, by its very nature, is satire? As a result, I found the entire company unconvincing. None of these characters is a person who would interest me, the story was generic, and the values ​​of the production reflected only the money involved, not the passion of the director. In the end, a banal and vain effort to take advantage of the phenomenon that it makes fun.
