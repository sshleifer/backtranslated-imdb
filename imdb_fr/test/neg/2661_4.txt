Unusually cold and stupid drama by director Sydney Pollack. The soapy plot revolves around an adulterous couple who perish in a plane wreck, letting their spouses meet and connect to their own intimate level. The writing of romantic novels gets a slow treatment, although I thought the performances of Harrison Ford and Kristen Scott-Thomas were excellent. Shiny production arouses interest even if the plot continues to cover the same terrain and never creates emotional momentum. As a result, the highlight at the airport is a big "so what?"
