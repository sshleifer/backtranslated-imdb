I think that is saying that Bollywood's "Bride and Prejudice" has been more faithful to the source material than this version of Hollywood in 2005. I also laughed a lot more at the Bollywood version. (Mr. Kholi? Priceless!) If you read the book or saw the 1995 version of the BBC (and you liked them), you will have a bad surprise then. My friend, however, who had not seen either, was slightly amused by the film. If you are a purist of JAne Austen, or even a film buff who does not like historical inaccuracies, it will be painful to get through it. <br /> <br /> Ugh, the scenario. The script was the biggest problem. I imagine that the actors would not have had such a bad result if they had had a decent scenario, written perhaps by someone who really liked the work of Austen. <br /> <br /> What transvestites have been committed? Well, you'll have to go through such incredulous sentences like "Do not judge me, Lizzy, do not judge me!" and "Leave me alone for once in your lives!" Not only are such lines far from what might come from Jane Austen's eloquent pen, but can anyone honestly believe such words that come out of the mouth of a distinguished young woman from the time of the Regency? The use of modern colloquialisms is one of the many irritating ways the screenwriter uses to slaughter the book. The writer also decided to give the characters lines that, in the book, were said by completely different characters and without any apparent purpose. Worse still, when they try to get a little closer to the writing of the book, the writer has the annoying and useless habit of rearranging Austen's sentences and substituting awkward synonyms for her already perfect words. It was as if the scriptwriter was sitting with the book in one hand and a thesaurus in the other while writing the script. Stick to Austen's words; she did it better than you! I suppose that all this was done in a "revisionist" spirit and in order to distance this film from the iconic version of the BBC in 1995. However, for me, it was also a parody of the true spirit of the work the most beloved of Austen. <br /> <br /> The casting had potential, although it was quickly dispelled once the script came into play. But Keira, laughing excessively and showing off your crooked teeth does not mean charm and liveliness! And I think that Mr. McFayden, although I find it pretty good, misinterpreted his text and felt like he was playing at Heathcliff and not the dreaded Mr. Darcy. I really enjoyed Brenda Blethyn, Kelly Reilly and the actor who played Mr. Collins. Their interpretations were really refreshing. <br /> <br /> Oh, but Donald Sutherland! Someone described his performance as looking like a tramp who accidentally went astray on the set, and I have to say it's an appropriate description. And can anyone tell me why they made Wickham after Legolas? Although he's been in the movie for less than two minutes, I dare, and without his awesome archery skills to improve the film. <br /> <br /> On a dress note, I would kill for Miss Bingley's dresses because they were sumptuous and would fit more with the modern century. (A Regency evening dress without sleeves? Please! More Versace than Austen, for sure) And poor Keira, the whole budget went to her salary and not to her wardrobe! Oh, and I'm sure they finally caught the bastard who stole the hairbrush from the set. Unfortunately, they did not catch him early enough to style the tresses of the actresses before shooting the film. <br /> <br /> In short, with this new Hollywood version, farewell to the eloquence, subtlety and spirit of Austen get the opposite.
