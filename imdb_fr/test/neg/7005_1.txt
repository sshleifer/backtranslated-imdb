I had heard about this film from a friend, it was supposed to be a thriller, but what I saw was not a "thriller". It was more like a weak attempt by a person. Amber Smith was a positive point that perhaps gave him too much credit. The scenes where she was in bed with actress Erika Michels were also lame. The two actresses did not seem to slam at all. Amber Smith was well out of the girls league, and it shows on camera. She did not seem in those scenes at all. I was disappointed because one of my friends, of course, had made this movie a "great" movie, but it was more like watching porn.
