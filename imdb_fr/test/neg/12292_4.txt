I am very interested in extremely positive reviews here. Although the film has good features, I find that this film is generally heavy, predictable and, even worse, not at all scary. The first 30 minutes of the film were promising, the actress did a good job in her performance and the world around her was well thought out and rich in meaning. Unfortunately, from there, the film has entered a downward spiral. I went into this film without knowing what it was - I did not know anything about the actors, the director, the genre, etc. At one point my wife made the comment "Is it supposed to be scary?" movie? "Well, I guess so, because the score of the movie" horror movie "full of squeaky violins and prolonged vibrato could not mean anything else.There did not seem to be much originality in the film, the romantic interest was painfully obvious from the first moment, and the second half of the film went down to the bottom of the ridiculous.A movie like this follows a dangerously narrow path and unfortunately the viewer has to decide he must continue to walk on this path or jump and just laugh at the ridiculous.For the last 30 minutes, I chose the latter.
