I can usually tolerate twisted movies, but this one is really an obsessive egocentric sick movie! all. Secondly, he is also a sick pervert who manipulates and poisons the children's minds! I can not believe my ears when I hear the sick and wicked monologues spoken by the children! <br /> <br /> I'm really sorry for Zane Adlum and Devon Matthews. They are both very talented, but have fallen into Eric Schaeffer's dirty and little-known film! <br /> <br /> And what happened to the beautiful face of Eric Mabius? I mean, he met that girl he's supposed to marry, but he was not at the wedding! In fact, there is this bald guy in his place! Has the weather really gone so fast? <br /> <br /> Anyway, do not waste your time watching this movie, unless you want to be poisoned and manipulated by a sick Eric Schaeffer!
