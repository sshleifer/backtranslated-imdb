I was delighted to see that TCM was showing it, because I really like the 1992 version with Josie Lawrence, Jim Broadbent, Joan Plowright ... This movie had a bright Ann Harding, a great performance of Frank Morgan, but the game other actor the movie more than a farce then the wonderful unfolding as the subsequent movie. Reginald Owen's Arbuthnot is painful to watch and you can not understand why his wife loves him. After watching the film, I discovered that it was based on the play where the 1992 film was based on the book. The original film also felt that it was an excerpt from a larger piece and was incomplete. Too bad it's such a disappointment.
