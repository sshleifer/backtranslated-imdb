Formula film about the illegitimate son of a wealthy Chilenian who inherits a fortune, mingles with the business of villains and falls in love with a beautiful lawyer (Vargas). It looks a lot like a TV movie, not really exciting. The only reason I took the trouble to see him was because Valentina Vargas was inside. No real surprises here, even if it's nice to see Vargas. Beautiful Chilenian landscapes are on display, but Malcolm McDowell's part is very small and does not add much to the film. Michael Ironside plays as usual a villain, but this is not one of his most memorable parts. Hunting scenes are standard fare.
