Fabian (Tommy Callahan), racing enthusiast, smokes, drinks and suffers loss of memory while juggling the feelings of the seductive brunette Annette Funicello (as Francie Madsen) and Diane McBain (as Annie Blaine) . Mrs. Funicello's boyfriend, Warren Berlinger (Eddie Sands), and his father Jan Murray (Pete Madsen), who encourages rash drivers, make things even more difficult. Funicello's cow-eyed performance is sometimes enjoyable; however, his drunk driving scene is annoying. "Thunder Alley" provides little more enthusiasm for NASCAR than its predecessor, "Fireball 500" (1966) *; be warned, it's not a lot. A wild party scene, featuring some sweet striptease, is the highlight of the film.
