A child's story uprooted from a lame Hollywood movie, a dreadful actor's act, a nerdy dialogue and sex scenes not up to par. It's true another great parody softcore! I really enjoyed this movie! Of course, the acting is terrible, but this part of the fun! The story is ridiculous, but some things must be sacrificed when the story has to revolve around girl-to-girl sex scenes. And as this is only softcore (no penetration), sex scenes are a bit bland. But it's as if the big softcore coal god, Russ Meyers, said "who really cares about what's going on under the waist." I do not know if I agree with Mr. Meyers on this point, but what ... the film entertained me for an hour and a half. I give him a C +, it would have been a solid B if they had been able to throw more girls so that they look like actresses Russ Meyers. Vavoom! Vavoom! ~
