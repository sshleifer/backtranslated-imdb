The wildest character in Alfred Hitchcock's career is undoubtedly the director's comedy vehicle, which associates Carole Lombard with Robert Montgomery as a couple who discovers that an error has invalidated their marriage. Where are they really with each other? <br /> <br /> Contrary to what other people say, there is an element of suspense here: the idea that these two miserable people could escape, free to do their horror to others. . another, unworthy companion. <br /> <br /> It's amusing to read here the comments on Lombard's miserable Ann Smith in this film, because Montgomery's role is just as important. He hurts Ann, nibbles witnesses, makes small customers - the kind of lawyer who gives his profession a bad name. Ann is also domineering, of course, the kind of woman who holds her husband hostage to work for six days for a little argument, referring to things like the one he did in Paris at the age of 20 and that he had not even met her yet. "I forgave you that!" she said, as if she were tall of her. <br /> <br /> For David, a revoked marriage is an opportunity to have a little fun with his "mistress" before knotting the knot for good. For Ann, this is an attempt at premarital sex that must be pushed back with a bottle of champagne in her head, then expelled from their apartment and her life. <br /> <br /> The acorn does not seem to fall far from the tree, while Ann's mother is scandalized in apoplexy when she learns what David tried to draw: "Oh my poor baby! Death, your father is dead! " comic unimaginable. <br /> <br /> You can call this an example of the "comedy of remarriage", in which the marriage bonds are disputed to be reaffirmed. You can also call this an example of what Roger Ebert calls the "idiot plot", in which the storyline depends on the main characters behaving like idiots. Hitchcock seems to laugh at American morality, but can not do more than a joke-free scene in which a senior couple is outraged by the sound of plumbing. <br /> <br /> Lombard died in a year out of this movie; it was her last film she had to see. What a pity it could not have been better! She also dominated in "My Man Godfrey", but in such a nice way, you did not just have to go with it, you wanted it. Here she plays for laughter that does not exist while sadly breaking David's chops again and again. Montgomery rolls his eyes a lot like Groucho, a study on sufficiency. <br /> <br /> The only thing really worthy of this film that lasts more than a few seconds is Gene Raymond, David's legal partner, Jeff Custer, who plays for Ann and acts with honor and decency. Raymond under-exploits his many reaction shots, and even a drunken scene, all for a good effect. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILER *** Jeff is a decent guy, but Ann ends up rejecting him for failing to fight David after she incites him to a showdown, calling Custer "a piece of jelly" . Jeff leaves the scene, leaving Ann and David together for their future murder-suicide. Here is a Custer who managed to escape a massacre! *** SPOILER END ***
