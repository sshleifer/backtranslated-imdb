Those who make a film about the Second Coming and the Third Testament should have the right to wait until they have read the other two, or at least they know a little more than miracles and the Day of Judgment. This film contains absolutely nothing of interest to viewers interested in Jesus, religion or philosophy - there is only classical British social realism, with its guttural dialects and fleshy characters in pubs. <br /> <br /> a true Third Testament has been published many times - such as "A Course of Miracles" or "Conversations with God". They all have new insights and insights into Christian faith and theology. <br /> <br /> The most interesting information in the IMDb rating is not the number of stars, but the number of people who have taken the trouble to vote. In four years, only 387 people took the trouble to vote for this film. As usual, enthusiasts are the most eager. For comparison, take a look at "Jesus Christ, Superstar" - original version of 1973.
