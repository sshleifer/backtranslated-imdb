This film seemed to have been put in place very quickly, both in the plot and in the graphics. My two daughters were ready to leave 30 minutes before the end of the film, which rarely happens when we go to the movies. It was a Nickelodeon production and it would have been better to take it out on the set. station. The animation itself in some parts was o.k. but the plot was awful. A lot of children's movies tell the classic story of a son trying to meet a father's expectations, but the animation or graphics must be really good to keep a child's attention. This was not the case with this film. There were also annoying elements between the main male character and the main female character whose plot might have happened.
