I saw a show of 12:45 last night and I would have walked 20 minutes later. in, but there was nowhere to go! Flagrant product placement, juvenile writing, so many talents to sell, denigration of homosexuals ... what did not they do? The movie is also incredibly long (we went out at 3). As a person who rarely pays the full price at the movies, imagine that my grief pays $ 22 for this self-indulgent and nasty nightmare (plus $ 2 parking). I woke up today still depressed and I could not shake it all day. I love Vince Vaughn, and he seemed utterly lost just like me. When Cedric the Entertainer has the wind in his sails, a man so little entertaining that he has to call himself "The Entertainer" to understand what he thinks he's doing, you have a serious problem. In addition, the appearance of Robert Pastorelli is frightening, since he died almost a year ago (March 10). This should give you an idea of ​​how long they have polished this shit. This movie is nasty at the bitter end. We stayed just to make sure they did not give Robert an "In Remembrance", which they did not do. Save yourself! Save your money! Save your soul!
