It was so bad that I can not even comment on it. I will write a few sentences about what I witnessed and it will be up to you. <br /> <br /> Captain Kirk, with his forelock and tubby gut, is climbing the El Capitan River in Yosemete. Spock meets him halfway on a floating hovercraft like a skateboard. Kirk falls. Spock flies, catches him a few inches before Kirk hits the ground head first. <br /> <br /> Later in the night, Spock, Kirk and McCoy eat beans around a campfire. Spock loves beans. Kirk and McCoy then play "Row Row Row Your Boat" and want Spock to join the three-man band. Spock does not want to sing. And later in the night, he does not agree. "But life is only a dream, Captain." Should I continue? <br /> <br /> Alright ... A renegade Vulcan, who happens to be Spock's half-brother, leads a revolt on a sandy planet - taking hostages. The crew of the company lands on the planet and Uhura, who grows fifty-five and weighs about two hundred pounds, attracts the natives with his bare legs. But they can not deceive the brother, who claims to be able to find God. <br /> <br /> He removes the crew and the Enterprise. They go to a planet where a big bearded apparition, claiming to be God, spits fire on Kirk, Spock and McCoy. Spock's brother or sister, realizing that it is not God - but is really a form of himself - or something - joins the apparition to destroy it and ... sparks fly. <br /> <br /> Then, after things too complicated to explain about Klingons resembling Lorenzo Lamas ... <br /> <br /> The Three Amigos - Kirk, Spock and McCoy - return to Yosemite Kirk wore a GO CLIMB A ROCK t-shirt?). Spock playing a kind of Vulcan guitar great, they sing "Row Row Row Your Boat", this time harmonized as the credits run.
