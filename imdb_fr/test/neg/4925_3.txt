This show shows the depths of the drama of British television before the turning point. With these boring scenarios, the mediocre acting, the mediocre intrigues, the awful dialogue, we have to watch a DVD of any old emergency episode to see a quality hospital drama. to be able to act really! <br /> <br /> If you want a TV soap opera style of poor quality, this is the show you need. Personally I like something with more meat on the bone. Unfortunately, as with all other British license payers, I finance these slags.
