We found this film almost impossible to watch. With such a cast, it is a shame that writing and direction are so terrible. The atrocious pace at which the story was told was infuriating. The flashbacks were clumsy. The characters were one-dimensional. The heavy metaphors - the river, the cat - are repeated too often. <br /> <br /> The film Nobody's Fool, based on another novel by Russo, was infinitely better, probably because it was written and directed more closely. <br /> <br /> The photography at Empire Falls was beautiful. Too bad it's not a travel diary. <br /> <br /> I read the novel and enjoyed the writing style, but I had problems with the novel itself. I would give the novel 4 stars out of 5. The writers and directors may have been so impressed by the novel's reputation that they had to incorporate everything into their film. It was supposed to be a TV movie, guys, not Books on Tape.
