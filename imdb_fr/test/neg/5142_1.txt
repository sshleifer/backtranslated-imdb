OK ... so ... I really like Kris Kristofferson and his usual game of easy lines in his films. Age has helped him with his low-energy, soft-spoken style and he will steal a scene effortlessly. But, the disappearance is his misstep. Holy Moly, it was a bad movie! <br /> <br /> I must congratulate the cinematography and the actors, including Kris, for trying to do everything they can to make sense of this awkward and confusing story! None of that made sense, and Kris probably did not understand it either, and he just followed the gestures hoping someone would approach him and tell him what it was! <br /> <br /> I do not care what everyone in this film makes love for love for the project or for such nonsense ... I saw low budget movies that had a plot for the sake of good! It had none, zilcho, nada, zippo, empty of reason ... a total mess of good talent, landscapes and celluloid! <br /> <br /> I rented this trash for a dollar and I want to get my money back! I want my 2 hours back, I invested on this loss of grade F time! Do not watch this movie, do not waste a minute of your precious time playing in a room where it plays or open the box containing the DVD! Believe me, you'll thank me for the advice!
