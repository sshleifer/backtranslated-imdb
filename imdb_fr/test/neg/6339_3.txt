Disappointing dramatic comedy with sentimental coating, Michael J. Fox is ideally interpreted as a former childish star who now runs an art agency for toddlers; Nathan Lane and Cyndi Lauper are his assistants. Looks like all this should not be missed, but too much scenario is reserved for the strident Christina Vidal who plays the role of playmaker, which, according to Fox, will be the next big success. They quickly lock their heads and the sarcastic dialogue takes them into an uninteresting formula. Fox and Lane attract both, but the energy of the first scenes gives way to molasses. Slickly produced, but ultimately bland. * 1/2 of ****
