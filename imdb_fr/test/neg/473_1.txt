Removes one thing from the path. I'm a huge fan of Bruce Campbell, I have the Evil Dead series, I have action figures and I saw Bubba Ho-Tep. I'm a fan of ridiculous and ridiculous horror movies and I know how to enjoy the whole thing "it's so bad it's good". <br /> <br /> I wish I could say as much of this film. I watched this film with great expectations, I wanted it to be good, campy, something from British Columbia that we all know and love. It all started promising enough, but after the first 20 minutes, I decided to watch the rest of this movie excuse, as if I had just been filmed with tranquilizer darts. <br /> <br /> The idea itself is not bad; two men do not get along, both killed by the same psychopathic woman, half of a man's brain is transplanted into the other's head, they argue, disagree and the comedy follows. <br /> <br /> What killed me was how extremely disorganized and boring it was! There was potential, even though a camp movie was so much better than it was. The plot was boring, even Bruce's physical lingon stick could not make it work. <br /> <br /> Words can not even correctly express the ridiculous robot in which the brain of Bruce's wife finally enters. It's the worst robot I've ever seen (even for a B movie). The idea is stupid. <br /> <br /> What was happening in Bruce's head when he created this steaming pile is beyond me. Why Ted Raimi did not rush to his big brother to ask him to make sense of Bruce and not to mention some lessons on making a nice movie on a budget, it's beyond me. <br /> <br /> Shame on you Bruce !!!
