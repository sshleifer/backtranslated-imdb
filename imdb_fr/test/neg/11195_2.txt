This show started well, but it turned into a nightmare. The worst thing about it was the candidates. Most of them were crazy. They did stupid things to make a living and they also did strange hobbies. In the second season, a guy said he talked to his pants. It's sick and repulsive. In addition, nobody cared to make money. All they ever wanted to do was make alliances like "Survivor" or something. Men were always afraid that women would team up. The women were the same too. I just could not stand it anymore. I had to stop watching him. It was really one of the worst shows of all time.
