This schlocker nowadays is a totally abysmal mix that concerns an incurable player (Brett Halsey) who decides in the manner of Bluebeard to repay his ever-increasing debts by seducing some of the worst bitches you'll ever have to watch. and who happen to be rich widows! The script written in Fulci also manages to incorporate some elements of black comedy - which only lead to an insignificant case involving a corpse that does not stay in place, a victim of the opera singer who keeps singing, etc. . doppelganger theme straight out of PRAGUE STUDENT - although, in this case, both people communicate via pre-recorded radio messages !! In the end, I can not say that I am surprised that this film shows no sign of the sophistication of Mario Bava's HATCHET FOR THE HONEYMOON (1970), to which he resembles in many ways and that he is satisfied with to pile up the disgusting gore (but not too convincing) of the effects of dismembered limbs and crushed or merged faces to which, unfortunately, Fulci had become completely associated.
