Oh, there are a lot of Wayne's worst movies. This film is poorly edited, but it has a campy element that makes it enjoyable to watch. The villain is an Anglo actor who wears ridiculous Mexican clothes and assigns an excessive Mexican accent that is hilarious. The girl is dressed like an aspiring Jean Harlow, we are in 1934 after all. At least, the shots are beautiful and enjoyable. <br /> <br /> Look at them and laugh. Do not expect a serious western western, but rather a light and superficial story, with mediocre actor play but occasional flashes of humor. Wayne is almost ridiculously young and handsome and we can see his acting ability flourish years after this unfortunate venture.
