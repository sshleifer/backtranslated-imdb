Too bad this movie is not. Although "Nemesis Game" is slightly entertaining, I struggled to suspend my disbelief throughout the film, especially the situations in which Sara was putting herself. Are we supposed to believe that: <br /> <br /> 1) this hot chick will bang helpless around abandoned buildings and dark subway tunnels in the middle of the night to solve some riddles? <br /> 2) The protagonists are supposed to be such experts that they play riddles for fun, but do not put the whole riddle "I Never Sinned" together until the end .. and then ... and then ... get this ... she must do the miracle to finally put the pieces together ?? I know it was the way the filmmaker used to show the public what was going on, but do they really think we're so stupid? <br /> <br /> 3) When Vern and Sara go to Chez M to interview the blonde, there is not a topless chick all over the building. Nada. Let's go there. I know it's Canada, but I would wait for more than one country that gave us Shannon Tweed. <br /> <br /> And whoever else notices that when Vern surfed the web and discovered this site riddlezone, he had flown over the link the cursor remained an arrow, and did not turn into a small hand (as all cursors do when we click on a hyperlink)?!? I mean, if the Internet is to play such an important role in your movie, at least do the little things well. Geez.
