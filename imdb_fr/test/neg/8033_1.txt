Even Mel Gibson could not save this movie. It was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Why would Mel Gibson make a movie that he surely could not watch and watch? what was that? A total blunder on heavy drugs stalking a schizophrenic lady, who also used illicit illicit drugs. For all cinephiles on heavy drugs; you will love this movie.
