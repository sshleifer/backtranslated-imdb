This film was shot with a digital camera, and it shows. There were enough annoying digital tricks to alienate the viewer, also with a horrendous score. As if that was not enough, the acting was also terrible. Now, in Hartley's movies, the acting is always strange, but here it was simply BAD, especially Satan (Thomas Jay Ryan) and Harvey, who (thank God) did not say much. After all these external problems, it is also very unfortunate that the story itself is not so good either. The jokes are predictable and incredibly simple, and the events just rumble from one incident to another. The so-called book of life with Armageddon inside is no more than an excuse to see the actors scramble to say their aftershocks. Overall, this film is a waste of time, money and effort. Thumbs down.
