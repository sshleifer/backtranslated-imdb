It was something I could not wait to see. The Ultimate Avengers movies had both exceeded my expectations and, since Iron Man was one of my favorite Marvel characters, I thought this same production team would be able to do some really good things with a Iron Man solo title . But the last movie was not satisfactory. I did not expect them to spend most of the movie paying tribute to Iron Man's gray armor. The red and gold armor are visible for perhaps ten minutes. Not a major complaint, but not what I expected from the ads and the box. The worst thing is the story, the acting game and the CGI cell animation for monsters and the Iron Man armor that is not convincing. This was not at all confused with the animation of the cell. Even on his side, it seems like a stick and lifeless. Tony Stark's arc of character, as incredibly slow as it is, is so forced and unconvincing. I wanted to watch this movie because I love Iron Man, but after forcing myself to watch it, I wondered if they could have found something as good as the Ultimate Avengers movies.
