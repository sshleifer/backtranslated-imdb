Predator Island begins with six friends, Eric (Tom Dahl), Chris (Dan Gordon) and Heather (Iris McQuillan-Grace), Kim (Iana Baker) and Denise (Melissa Roby) invited to spend time with Kevin (Michael Wrann The father's boat is celebrating at sea. What could go wrong with such a great idea? Well, for starters, a big green meteorite could crash into the sea near your boat and an extraterrestrial life force might come out and try to kill you all, that's still a ridiculously stupid idea, is not it? this not? <Br /> <br /> Co-edited, written and directed by Steven Castle, I thought Predator Island was a shit and it's a simple, straightforward game. The scenario is of the worst kind, you know the kind of abomination that is full of very boring characters of teenagers who do and say the most stupid things, it's full of clich√©s and is quite predictable, it's not It almost makes no sense, just things that happen suddenly without explanation or explanation, it's annoying even at just 70 odd minutes and it has virtually no entertainment value, or even an involuntary laughter value. The movie does not really have much of what I would call a plot, there is no explanation as to why or how this alien creature can conquer people's minds or why it can be selective in that the person will be a "normal" moment the next day, when the story claims it & for no apparent cause, they suddenly get brilliant green eyes & a sudden desire to become cannibal.There is not enough horror, the scenes of are pitiful and I really do not want to waste another second thinking about Predator Island, let alone wasting precious energy typing those words ... <br /> <br /> The director Castle does nothing to make this thing visible and the "special effects" are absolutely terrible, this extraterrestrial guy would not even fit into a science-fiction movie of the 50s. Filmmakers even play blooper images on the final credits, but that must be be the least fun collection of mistakes of all time. I mean they can not even go wrong if you know what I mean! Forget all decent gore because there is none, there is a little cannibalism and intestines placed on the belly of the unfortunate actors so that another unfortunate actor can take them and pretend to eat them. <br /> <br /> Assuming a budget of about $ 150,000, I must admit that filmmakers were working on a very small budget, it's no excuse to make such a mediocre film. Everything seems very cheap and the acting is pretty bad. <br /> <br /> Predator Island is a shit, I'm sorry but it's like that and I just do not see what anyone could get out of it. In my humble opinion, this is probably to be avoided.
