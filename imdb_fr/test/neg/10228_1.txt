WHAT IS THE NUMBER OF FILMS THAT SHOULD BE IN WHICH AGAINST ALL CHANCES, A RAGTAG TEAM BAT THE BIG BOYS WITH ALL MONEY? !!!!!!!! There is nothing new in "The Big Green". If anything, you want them to lose. Steve Guttenberg had such a good resume ("Boys from Brazil", "Police Academy", "Cocoon"). Why, WHY WHY, did he have to do these kinds of movies in the 1990s and beyond ?! So, avoid this movie. There are many good movies, so there is no reason to waste your time and money on this junk. Obviously, the "green" in their minds was the money because there is no creativity here. At least in recent years, Disney has produced smart movies with Pixar.
