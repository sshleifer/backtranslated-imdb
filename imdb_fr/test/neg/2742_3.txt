It was pretty inevitable. This film borrows from "The Core" and the film borrowed from "Armageddon", borrowed movies, etc. Except this time there is Luke Perry too. This cinematic version of the familiar story of saving the world involves super-earthquakes beginning in the Pacific Northwest and also extending to the whole circle of fire. Its soon determined that everyone on Earth could be doomed. So the army and some scientists are building one of these high-tech drilling machines to go inside the Earth and fix things (it just would not be as fun not to have to go somewhere like space or inside the planet). There is even a line that tries to make the journey in the Earth more impressive than space travel (as in "Armageddon"). It's a Sci-Fi Network movie, so the script is sinister movie painting by numbers. There are fights between scientists and soldiers, there are lasers that melt the stone, people die and sacrifice for the good of all, and above all, there are special effects (weak). Not original and not that fun. It's a movie to watch when you have nothing to do, especially if you have beer.
