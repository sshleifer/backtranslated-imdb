How I deserved to watch this shit ??? The worst of the worst. The acting was awful, when I read that it was a comedy, I was expecting at least a smile, once or twice, but .... If you want to lose an hour and a half of your life, it's the good movie. I just recommend looking in a wall or something, anything but watching this "movie". Yoy can even watch a documentary (if you're a guy) about pregnant women, I guarantee you it will be more entertaining :) role. Anyway, "I want someone to eat cheese with" is the good movie if you want to punish someone.
