Extremely boring..I do not care how many avant-garde bones you have in your body, this baby is bad ... and do not go see it because I mentioned it, keep it for " 'Empire' by Warhol, it's far more entertaining !! I saw other Duras films that were much better, so I'm stunned by the fact that this is considered a "masterpiece". As an art historian, I had to consider the radical works of Marcel Duchamp, Chris Burden and Damien Hurst. In these artists, I can always see the artistic intent, even the quality, and an entertaining aspect in the rendering of their art. Regarding "India Song" - it's not even soft porn genre - Anias Nin was almost there - sex slideshow with G-rated - and a voiceover that has nothing to do with the slideshow / movie. ..... pure shit and not even campy ... unfortunately just a nuisance and a loss of 2 hours. To add insult to injury, the copy I saw was old and scratched !!! (Harvard Film Archive), If I want to see "boring entertaining" I'm watching Bunuel !! Yes "India Song" - keep your head up for late modernism and be really bored !! Watching a porn movie from the 70's with all the good parts cut out and lowering the sound, you'll get "India Song" but with better cinematography and none of the annoying music or screams of the Vice Consul !!!
