Diane Lane, Mickey Rourke, Rosario Dawson and Thomas Jane ..... This is not a bad cast in my opinion, but they have been totally lost in this movie. <br /> <br /> There was no real direction, there was no unusual In fact, the whole movie was very predictable from beginning to end. Mickey Rourke had a really annoying sidekick who has not pissed you off since the beginning. Rosario Dawson was completely lost and it was almost useless to see her character in the movie. <br /> <br /> I really believe that this is one of those movies directly on DVD that everyone will forget very quickly, which is a shame that the film could have been so much better.
