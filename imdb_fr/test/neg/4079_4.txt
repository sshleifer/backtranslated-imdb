EVAN ALMIGHTY (2007) ** Steve Carell, Morgan Freeman, Lauren Graham, Johnny Simmons, Graham Phillips, Jimmy Bennett, John Goodman, Wanda Sykes, John Michael Higgins, Jonah Hill, Molly Shannon, Ed Helms, (Cameo: Jon Stewart as himself) "continued" to "BRUCE ALMIGHTY" with Carell's presenter, Evan Baxter, leaving the television to begin his term as Congress Representative, the Congress representative has his hands full when God (Freeman resuming his sacred role; Jim Carrey wisely avoids the "call") asks that he build an ark like Noah and hilarity ensues (or should have). Steve Oedekerk's Godforsaken script, Joel Cohen and Alec Sokolow are absolutely lame and only Carell's lovable character transcends Evan in something that looks like a human being. The end result is a lot of bird poop jokes and bloating (which would cost $ 175 million for the CGI F / X). Sykes steals the show as Evan's sarcastic assistant. Sacrilege not funny.
