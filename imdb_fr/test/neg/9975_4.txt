I was expecting "Born to Kill" to be an exciting high voltage black film. Instead, there are two good sets of action (one at the beginning and one at the end) and a wonderfully atmospheric cinematography by Robert de Grasse (usually a "glamorous" cameraman and a surprising credit for a black), but the rest of the movie is pretty boring. Lawrence Tierney passes his psycho tour but it's a strictly digital performance, mechanically describing what the audience expects from him after "Dillinger" (an overrated film, but at least better than this one). The character of Claire Trevor is too stupid and unmotivated to seduce the public, and the action (as it is) remains so resolutely inside this damn San Francisco house that the film becomes claustrophobic instead of being truly exciting. This is one of those movies in which the actors - including Elisha Cook, Jr. (whose homo-erotic itch of the character for Tierney is one of the few subtleties of a scenario otherwise quite obvious) and Isabel Jewell - surpass the main roles. That does not help either, almost half a century after Alfred Hitchcock and Anthony Perkins revolutionized the representation of psycho killers on the screen in "Psycho", Tierney is so rude and obvious that he could also to be tattooed "PSYCHO" on his forehead. . Moreover, nothing in the film itself indicates why the source novel is called "Deadlier than the Male" - but maybe James Gunn has made the female characters stronger and more interesting than they are. are in the movie. "Born to Kill" is a real disappointment to Robert Wise, who already had some quality films to his credit and who would embark on a brilliant career.
