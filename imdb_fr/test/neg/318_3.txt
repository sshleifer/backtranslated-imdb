My mother and I rented this jewel a few years ago while she was here to visit Thanksgiving. I rarely laughed so hard. It's a typical low-budget horror movie with stupid special effects, a worse plot and even worse acting. But do you really expect a classic when Linnea Quigley will be at the top of the list? I thought no. <br /> <br /> Since this film has an entertainment value, I give it a 3 out of 10.
