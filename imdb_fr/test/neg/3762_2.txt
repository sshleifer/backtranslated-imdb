I bought "Rocketship X-M" on DVD in a pack of two with "Destination Moon". Now, I see why the distributors did this: anyone who had ever seen this movie would buy it alone. <br /> <br /> I can not understand what the school system has revealed, the critic who claimed that RXM was "awesome" his predictions about how the journey into space would ... "Launch go right, then make a right turn at 90 degrees and go around faster and faster until you reach the exit speed ... I do not remember this from the Apollo program. astronauts should be weightless once the engines are stopped gravity changes direction each time the hatch to the engine room go to the moon, but "missed" that? No problem, it's just jumping-jumping-and-jumping (with a helping hand from divine providence) and you'll be at Mars! -well, if you want to bring life to Mars, given the state of planetary knowledge in 1950, it was a forgivable convention for history, but can you give them at least a little extraterr These Martians looked like extras from the cast of "10,000 BC. "I can accept some scientific errors, but that would not solve the problem with a second grader above average. <br /> <br /> And that does not take into account the squeaky holes of the plot : 12 minutes before the launch (remember constantly by the aggressive voice of the AP who says "X minus so many minutes"), the astronauts give a press conference! I guess the lack of time is the reason why Dr. Eckstrom did not change his coat and tie before going into space, and since it was convenient, even if they planned to go to the moon and had pressure suits for that, they had brought hiking equipment (and rifles!) in case they found themselves on Mars.They are lucky to have landed anywhere, because apparently the method they had developed for landing consisted of asking Dr. E to look out the window and say to the "pil" ote "(Lloyd Bridges) to set the joysticks from time to time. Note to XM-2 designers: how about giving the pilot a seat? <br /> <br /> Same as previous comments on casual sexism that was spicy to the eyes. Dr. Lisa (Osa Massen) condemns them all by repeatedly screwing up her fuel calculations, but hey, it was the early 50s. She was there to fill her sweater, which is not a useful function. <br /> <br /> "Rocketship XM" is one of the first films to say "Ohmigod, we'll all blow up ... with these A-bombs here", but we can note it without losing 77 minutes to watch such a sinking. By the way, this message might have had a bit more impact if there had been money in the budget for the actual sets of ruins in the Martian city, rather than just plain paintings. <br /> <br /> I can appreciate the "good" bad sci-fi, for the unique way the "future" used to look and for the inherent humor (so condescending) that one can to find when we look at the naivety of the public 60 years ago, but this film must have been insulting even then. "Rocketship X-M" does not even fit for a twist of MST3K style. Sometimes the harm is just ... bad. <br /> <br /> Does anyone want to buy a DVD? Used only once, I swear.
