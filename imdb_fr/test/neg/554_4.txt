I'm really sad that this is the first bad review I ever made for a movie ... EVER. I could bear watching this movie, and it's the second movie of all the movies I've seen that's right. ..a degradation. The first is Open Water, which comes without any points. The next karate child had no mention of Daniel (correct me if I'm wrong, please), and this finish line was a shock. It was like, "If must fight ... win." so he showed the bird flying around and the pan flute was playing, and I was like, oh. Well, it'll take time for this next part. AND THEN CREDITS ARE ON THE SCREEN. <br /> <br /> GEEZ MAN !! I hope I will never have to see a film again in a negative way, I apologize for those of you who love The Next Karate Kid, I really do, really ...
