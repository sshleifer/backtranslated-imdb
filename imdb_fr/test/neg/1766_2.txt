I was really excited to see "Cold Mountain". Alas, like most movies I'm really excited to see, it was a disappointment! Without this miraculous invention called DVD, I think I would have put my head in the monitor, I was so bored! <br /> <br /> I closely watched Kidman and Law when they met because their characters were supposedly "destined" for each other. Yet Law's face revealed everything but a stupid love, while Kidman seemed to count the seconds until she could run to her caravan! The character of Zellweger is purely Granny Clampett (as if we did not get it, cornball banjos marked it at each entrance), and so it was all I could do to not laugh! Ironically, his performance serves to emphasize how steep the slopes are. <br /> <br /> Ada almost died of hunger because she had freed her slaves; we never learn why. Even more troubling is why none of them stayed, Ada and her father were exceptionally benevolent and (as one scene shows) it was a very dangerous time for blacks (as they are politely called here). Why did not the neighbors teach him how to milk a cow or grow a crop? Heck, why did not she just sell the farm and go home? And despite all the practical side of Ruby, when she sends off the cock "diabolical" of Ada, it puts the kind of kibosh on them who still have hens! <br /> <br /> By the time her beloved finally returns, Ada no longer needs him or anyone else - that's the big joke! In fact, she may be physically intimate with Inman, but her true intimacy is with Ruby, who turned Ada into a version of herself Über-Babe. Did anyone else notice how they walked holding hands, happy like two peas in a pod, while they left Inman behind? <br /> <br /> I doubt that Minghella recognized this because he was too busy making an anti-Bush movie. Inman tells us that he is "like any imbecile sent to fight with a flag and a lie," and Ada's father says, "I imagine that God is tired of being called on both sides of an argument." These "observations" are historically inaccurate and insulting. While slavery was the basis of the southern economy, the reasons for the war were more complex. It was incomprehensible for a soldier to think that the cause was a "lie" (in fact, most members of the base were indifferent). It is unpleasant for filmmakers to record their point of view at a time when they were foreign to those who lived at that time. <br /> <br /> Structurally, the film is agitated and episodic. Law and Kidman are badly informed and have no chemistry! The scenario is little more than a half-cooked dialogue, and a huge pile of clichés and banalities. "Little moments like a bag of diamonds?" Ugh!
