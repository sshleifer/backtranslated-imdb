See Dick's work. <br /> <br /> See Jane's work. <br /> <br /> Dick and Jane are married. <br /> <br /> They succeed. <br /> <br /> They have a son. <br /> <br /> They have a nice house. <br /> <br /> They have a Latin maid. <br /> <br /> The maid teaches Spanish to the son. <br /> <br /> The son speaks Spanish. <br /> <br /> Ha-ha. <br /> <br /> See Dick get a promotion. <br /> <br /> The pompous CEO is a crook. <Br/> <br /> See Dick take the fall for the pompous CEO. <br /> <br /> Jane leaves her job. <br /> <br /> Oops. <br /> <br /> See Dick and Jane without work. <br /> <br /> Dick and Jane get into crime. <br /> <br /> As a plot, they decide to rob the CEO. <br /> <br /> See the robbery. <br /> <br /> See Dick & Jane finance the company's retirement plan with the money from theft. <br /> <br /> Yay. See end credits. <br /> <br /> Okay, so you have the plot. Beyond that, Dick and Jane move from one scene to another. A connection barely with the last or the next. Everything is terribly episodic in nature. <br /> <br /> Jim Carrey did not bother to bring his material "A", he just seems to be bored and a little ashamed of the whole thing. But, when you receive more than $ 20 million, why bother? Tea Leoni is frenzied. I guess I would be frantic not to be blamed for this flop. <br /> <br /> There's just something wrong with Dick & Jane. Carrey and Leoni are not funny and have little chemistry. The script is not funny. And it's not well planned. <br /> <br /> But it may be bigger than that. The reality of Dick and Jane may be a little too real. Maybe it's not funny that people are losing their jobs in a situation similar to Enron, while real life still lacks a good end.
