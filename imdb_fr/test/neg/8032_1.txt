This movie is just stinky. I know some people will say that anyone who thinks it's not good "just does not understand." I love Wenders in American Friend and Wings of Desire. But it's total shit. The main character is so annoying that I do not care what he does. As has been said in another review, he is like an annoying little monkey. I just could not stand it or force myself to worry about it. This is the case of most characters who just seem to be trying to be too funny or weird. I liked Mel Gibson's character and Milla Jovovich's characters, and I wish they had focused more on them. Milla is of course beautiful, pitiful and you really feel for her and for what she has been in the past and why she is as she is. I see the character of Gibsons almost like Frankenstien. I just hope he saved Milla and set the hotel on fire with all the worthless and boring characters who lived there. Milla Note 10 Movie rating 0
