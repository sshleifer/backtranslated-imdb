Like many of you, I watched a lot of good movies. Between these, we often find, deliberately or by mistake, so useless films that we think about why anyone would want to do it. That's exactly what I can say for the Dead Man Bonus .... <br /> <br /> The least I can do is try to warn some of you. If you like to be entertained by a movie because of its story, acting and intensity, you may want to choose something else. Now, it's not quite bad ..... In fact, if all you want is a creative cinematographic montage, unique angles as well as original background music, you do not think maybe not that it's OK. As a person who values ​​film intrigues, plays and has fun with a movie, the truth is that I thought this movie was so terrible beyond words. I could easily find a place for this on my list of the worst films seen in a while. <br /> <br /> Regarding Val Kilmer, the truth is that it was probably presented as a favor of the director; As a fan of some of Kilmer's films, I do not understand why he was motivated by that. The movie seems to be both a western part and a romance part ... In the end, I'm sure most of you agree with me that it's just about a loss of cruel time. In case you have not seen this movie, my recommendation would be to avoid it completely.
