I do not understand the humor in this movie. I also found offensive the way the Koreans were portrayed in this movie, despite the fact that it is actually a caricature of Koreans in these areas. First, the actors are Japanese and make the coarsest expressions of Koreans in this film. It disgusts me the way these people are expressed. I was just angry watching this scene and seeing how badly it had been portrayed in the movie. The humor lasts only a laugh and you do not understand why it's funny. It's raw humor with the most disgusting representation of society. I found it to be an offensive film overall ... Maybe it was just because I had never lived in the "hood" or seen "hooded" movies, but I I do not intend to do it either.
