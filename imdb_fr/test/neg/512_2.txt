I think vampire movies are (usually) bad. Even though the film itself is not very good, I still like the fact that it has vampires. But it stinks. This really gives a bad name to vampire movies. <br /> <br /> First of all, the price is very high. I do not usually care about low-budget movies - one of my favorite movies of all time is El Mariachi, which costs only $ 7,000 - but I hate it. These actions are also very complicated and involve an "elegant" camera that flickers, which gives you a headache. <br /> <br /> There is not much to say apart from not looking at this. I bought it for Â£ 1.50 because it was an old rental and I feel cheated, even for that low price.
