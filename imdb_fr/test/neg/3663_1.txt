This is not the best movie in the world ???? It was an understatement. Personally, I did not like this movie at all. Not because of the scenario, not because of graphic violence and nudity. Nudity did not really need to be in there, she did not do anything for the story, except maybe the girls were going through a rough time, and being naked probably hurt them even more. But one of the things in the movie I hated ... was that it was so dark. You could not really know what was happening. I think if it was not so dark and you could see where they were, it might not have been so bad. All you know is a basement somewhere. You do not see any house, no road, the killer inside, all you could see was half of his face for about 5 seconds. I want to see stuff in a movie. It gets boring after 20 minutes of twilight and all you see from time to time is a flashlight or wall. Then you will hear the girl sobbing. There was nothing that kept me really good in the movie, maybe the suspense in the first 10 minutes of the movie ... but not the suspense of the end of the movie, but the suspense of .. will I do not see nothing in this film except for some naked bodies and various flashing lights. But honestly, it was a meeting between Saw and Blair Witch Project. Both top quality movies, and both with good lighting to understand what was happening. Forget this movie if you can see ... if you're blind ... you might want to rent it to hear the screams if you like that kind of thing. But again if you're blind, you probably do not read that either .. so anyway ... BAD MOVIE !!!!
