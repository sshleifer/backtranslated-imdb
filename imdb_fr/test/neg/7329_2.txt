This film is available as a special bonus on the double disc of Horror 101 & Horror 102: Endgame. This has nothing to do with these films, except that it shows that producers / directors Dudelson and Clavell are in a rut. As in other films, this one shows young people who go into a building where they find themselves trapped and often run in the corridors, while being removed one after the other. In the end, one or more characters turn out to have another identity. This is by far the worst of the three. <br /> <br /> Here, people are invited to a Halloween night reserved for the Museum of the Dead. The museum does not contain many exhibitions, and they are all related to the ancient peoples of Central America. The museum also contains zombies devouring flesh that spread the infection, as well as a former cannibal warrior and two warriors. <br /> <br /> The film is very repetitive. It kills people fairly quickly, to the point that you wonder who will be left to kill - and at that point, more people will come without explanation to be killed. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, one of the characters has a mobile phone and can call the police, who takes it seriously and shows up at the museum. When one tries to take the lock to enter, the other tells him it would be a "forced entry". If people are stuck in a building and injured, I think it's not relevant. The cops are as stupid as they shoot a zombie in the head, but then they shoot other zombies in the chest and do not come down. They sometimes shoot another zombie in the head and it falls. They continue to shoot the rest of the zombies in the chest. Stupid. <br /> <br /> The opening credits and a nightmarish sequence take place in a kind of animation effect on video, a sort of trick of the poor man Waking Life, but not so caricatural. It's rather interesting, however, some parts of these attacks unfold in the same way, so there is no logic to that. <br /> <br /> Dreadful.
