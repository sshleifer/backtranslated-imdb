Well, where do I start to describe this celluloid debacle? You already know that big NADA is a conspiracy, so let's point out that it's so offensive. It's hard to believe that Frank Oz, the same guy who made us laugh in riots like Little Shop of Horrors and Bowfinger, caused this unpleasant disaster. IT out. OK of course. If anyone says I'm gay, I'll know the truth, even if I like girls more than George Luca $ loves a dollar. <br /> <br /> And how do I know the true nature of my sexuality? Well, if I like classical literature, dance and Barbra Streisand, I'm gay. If I dress up in a hurry like a blind (with half of my shirt hanging), I am straight. Oh, of course. <br /> <br /> And here's the big cliché of clichés: no matter what you look like, there's always a very seductive actor in Hollywood who will love every grain of fat under the skin, or a supermodel who will love your IQ zero, your ugly face and your ears pointed. If all these gay commonplaces were not enough to make me angry, that's what happened. In the real world, appearances matter, and I know it. <br /> <br /> I see it coming: you will now say "Relax, it's a comedy, do not take it seriously!" If being a comedy gives carte blanche to suck out loud, I think the world has a serious problem. Would not it be better (and funnier) to make a movie to deny those old tiresome clichés, instead of magnifying them again and again? <br /> <br /> One of the worst movies I've ever seen. 1 of 10. If giving this note has something to do with my sexual tendency, please let me know. I am interested.
