I was a teenager when this film first appeared in theaters and I saw it in Japan. The plot of the movie was not my cup of tea in the second year of high school, but I went to see it for the 3D process. This has been explained in the press so that even overseas service personnel have heard of it, even though it has never been shown at the post theater. <br /> <br /> at absurd levels with subsequent 3D movies. <br /> <br /> I do not know if this can be called a spoiler, but you have been warned. In many of the films of the day, actors often worked in front of a "rear projection screen", allowing backgrounds to be projected to give the impression that they were in a different environment, such as a backdrop. jungle plan when the actors were actually. sound stage. It works well on classic movies, but seen in 3D, they look like a flat scene behind the actors. There were several scenes in the film where the rear projection was used and it did not work well in the theaters. If we see it in 3-D, that will be another disappointment. <br /> <br /> The only importance of the film is historical, since it is the first of its kind.
