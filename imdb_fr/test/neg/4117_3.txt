Time travel is theoretical, so I can give the script some leeway. <br /> <br /> I also understand the concept that, by changing a single variable, you can potentially change the course of the story. <br /> <br /> What I can not understand, however, is how the change of weather went. We are subjected to a series of "temporal waves" which, progressively, demote the planetary evolution. Although it is a handy plot tool, because it gives our heroes enough time to solve the problem, it makes no sense. Certainly, if you modify a variable, and this variable has considerably, if not completely, changed the evolution of the planet, then at the moment when you return to "the future", the process of evolution is already established and there is no would need more waves. ? After all, why would a change 65 million years ago have to wait until now to be effective? The fact that the butterfly was projected in time gives it some credibility, but the life of this butterfly 65 million years ago has been significantly changed. However, any change in the history of evolution would have begun and would not depend on a return to our present time. <br /> <br /> To solve the problem, the team goes back in time to prevent the change of variable. By doing this successfully, we see that changes in evolution have never happened and that no one even remembers these events! Surely, what works for the solution should work for the initial change? I love a crazy sci-fi adventure, but unless it's placed "in a very distant galaxy", it must have at least some theoretical basis to make it really entertaining. <br /> <br /> Good premise, bad plot, reasonable acting and, in fairness, just a twist on Jurassic Park. <br /> <br /> Not on my list "Look again".
