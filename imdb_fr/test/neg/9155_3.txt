Big book, poorly done movie. Cheesy performances and artificial situations make this film a sentimental celebration. The flat and uninspired works of most actors leave this film in the After School category. There is probably a lot of talent to exploit in this team and the team, but something went wrong. The very talented Gretchen Mol is trying to get this movie out of the quagmire, but even she does not seem to be able to go beyond the silly dialogue. It feels as if everyone has just called it. Even the makeup (Mulrooney is 20 years old during the film) has an amateur and raw look. Do not waste your time on this clunker .... go read the book.
