Teenage girl Tamara (Jenna Dewan) has a hard time. She is ridiculed by all "children" who are popular for her shyness, her sense of reading, her frown and her interest in witchcraft. All football players and cheerleaders are particularly angry at her for writing an article about steroid abuse for the school newspaper. On top of that, her father is drunk, her mother is not there and she is secretly in love with her English teacher who supports him (Matthew Marsden). Popular children organize a cruel joke to humiliate it, accidentally kill it during a fight, bury the body in the woods and make a pact to keep quiet. To their shock the next day, Tamara returns to the classroom, seductive and dressed to kill. Yes, back from the dead and ready for a supernatural vengeance against everyone involved. She also takes the time to feed a bottle of beer to her abusive father and tries to seduce her English teacher away from his wife (Claudette Mink), an educational consultant at the school. <br /> <br /> Actor and writer strictly mediocre. You can also say that the responsible people have seen films such as CARRIE (1976), HELLO MARY LOU: PROM NIGHT II (1987) and THE CRAFT (1996), because they borrow roughly from these three films of superior quality. There is gore (a guy cutting off his ear and tongue, then stabbing him, probably the best thing), a scene of unpleasant vomiting and some characters both campers and spiritual. This is certainly not a horrible film, but there was not much originality.
