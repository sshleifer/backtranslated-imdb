In general, political messages are broadcast on television. If you are a big supporter of environmental correction, pay attention to your heart. Most people go to the movies for entertainment and do not sell poppy political nonsense. The hook here is the big name font. Unfortunately, the sum of the performances is equivalent to an entire movie that went nowhere. The two best performances, Chris Cooper and Richard Dreyfus, have minimal screen time. In short, "Silver City" is to be avoided as entertainment. It's nothing more than a rambling, non-documentary political presentation on illegal immigration, pollution and many other causes that belong to nothing except on a small screen. - MERK
