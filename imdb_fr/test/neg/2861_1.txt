It really looked like CHILD'S PLAY movies, except it was a lot worse. A lawyer tries to rescue a convicted felon for the murder of his son from execution. She fails. The lawyer's daughter then finds a puppet that the murderer has buried with his son and is immediately attached to it. Then, after several people have been seriously injured, the little girl secretly talks to the doll telling her that she has not hurt anyone. Throughout this movie, I wondered why I was watching this cheeze? again and again. The end was so bad that I went to watch the Disney cartoon version right after and slept with the light on.
