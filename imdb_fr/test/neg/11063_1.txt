It must be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. On a par with Blair Witch and just as boring. The flashing lights on the headphones made things difficult to see, and I think epileptics should take this into account because there are stroboscopic moments that make this movie even more boring. I think if they had been calmer, they might have found a way out. Then, when you think the geek might happen, he even resorts to a nervous breakdown. Oh, and when does the guy who has sex realize that when the girl says she can hear something. She can really hear something. One of these guys must at least have seen Scream (where they draw your attention to this stuff). It is also a big disadvantage to leave such a promising place and write the script. I'm really sorry, these people, I had it every week at the video store and I still would like to get my money back.
