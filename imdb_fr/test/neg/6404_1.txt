It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I did not go with high expectations, but as soon as it started, I thought it might be a good idea. It was not. Jim Carrey seemed to be trying, but he kept all his lines as if he were a diabolical cartoon character. The other actors all seem to be doing their best but are in wood. The plot has a good base, but the melodramatic lines make it dull and a little stupid. I laughed for the entire second half of the movie, and after five minutes I was fed up. Most "twists" that you can see several miles away. It's just not worth looking at. I really wish I did not waste my time with that.
