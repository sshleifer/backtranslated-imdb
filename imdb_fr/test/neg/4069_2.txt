The idea that anyone can concoct such a trivial film, as clich√© as comic, is shocking. The last 20 minutes of this movie are a comic glory. with six men digging enough trench in 10 minutes to light up the track with gas for a 747, while a so-called "major" landed the 747 perfectly in a crosswind of 110 mph - driving one to question the misnomer of this movie CRASH LANDING ... <Part of the dialogue was like rubbing me sandpaper, while the only aspect that saved this film for a 1 was the plethora of pretty women filling the screen a lot of the time. Not really a consolidation for that pathetic excuse of a movie, but my dumb button finally got a workout. <br /> <br /> See at your own risk! 2 of 10
