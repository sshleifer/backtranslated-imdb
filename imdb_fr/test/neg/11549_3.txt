Certainly, I looked into the matter in the hope of seeing photos of James Brolin in the beef cake. Unfortunately, there was only one, and the rest of the film was very tame and finally made no sense. <br /> <br /> The story, which is about it, is centered on Nick and Julie Atkins, a couple whose marriage of many years begins to become bland. Nick, a successful businessman is focused on work to the point of neglecting Julie, who tries to fill the void by returning to school. Julie's yearning for her passion for Nick at the beginning of their marriage begins to take shape in the form of powerful sexual fantasies that block reality for several minutes at a time, including burning a breakfast. and to misplace the papers of her husband. At first, she fantasizes about her husband, but as the film progresses, she begins to fantasize about other men and encounters with random strangers she meets. This leads to the realization of his fantasies with disastrous consequences for his marriage. Can she and her husband rebuild their relationship? Is it worth saving? <br /> <br /> This could have been an interesting premise, but the execution is so bland that you wonder why they even bothered. The characters are not developed. The reasons are not explained. Background information is not given. We do not explore how Julie came to the point where she could not control herself, and no explanation is given as to how she will do it in the future. The end product is a confused mess that is as confusing as Julie's fantasies, surprisingly underdeveloped. <br /> <br /> The acting game is a mix. Donna Mills like Julie does well with the material given to her, although her self-pity continues to become strident after a while. James Brolin acts as if reading his lines from memory cards, and even his anger at his wife's infidelity is hard to buy, he shows so little passion for the whole matter. Support roles are mostly forgettable. <br /> <br /> Disappointing treatment of what could have been an interesting story. Even more so, because he does not even offer the candy for the eyes he promised.
