I bought this movie on DVD despite the criticism "obsolete" and it was silly ... This review was completely accurate and I have never seen a worse film "erotic" of my long life! Even if the film was partially filmed and the scenery is interesting, plus an interesting cover ... But my own films Extreme Erotica (c) are more than 100 times more erotic (only in the sweet and delicious aspect), with probably less than 100 times budget movies! The story has no logical connection with the first film or the famous book ... nor any new (exciting) element of slave formation, except for very strange and sad developments ... Then the main character Klaus Kinski, do not look a bit like the second master of "O", he tries to play ... And even the pretty Arielle Dombasle does not look delicious in all scenes!
