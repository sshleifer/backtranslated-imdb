There is no doubt that in a film that this movie is a stupid joke and not funny, but to tell the truth, it is quite amusing (if you are a spectator for the first time and try not to analyze anything). Overall, the film has a very good idea but poorly written. <br /> <br /> The story of the two losers waking up to discover that they can not remember what happened to them the day before. Only to know later that they are after the fact by angry twin friends, aliens, transsexual stripper, alien nerds and some gang members. <br /> <br /> Is not it like Bourne's identity? Yeah yeah, I know - how do I compare the two movies, but what's that mess? They both have no memories; the people were after them and so on. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the movie is stupid and is only intended for viewers who like the stupid movie. <br /> <br /> Reason to watch: · Many talented young actors, · Very stupid (after all, you know it's a stupid movie, why not make it extreme) <br /> <br /> > Reason Not To: · If you like to analyze, then forget this, · Young talented actors go wrong, · A good pass really goes wrong <br /> <br /> Rating: 4/10 (Grade: E +) < br /> <br /> ------------ ------------ ---------- --------- - ------ --- --------- ---- <br /> <br /> "Dude, where's my car", wait for Ashton Kutcher's movie. I think almost all people have had the same answer for this guy - "A really stupid movie". Apart from 'That 70s' shows, this guy really has nothing to offer his fan. (He should thank the series for his reputation). "Dude where is my car", is one of his trademark - "stupidity". In a way, his movie is even worse than Adam Sandler's movies (can you imagine that). The film is really meaningless, no script, nothing. Mara Sokoloff, Jennifer Garner, Alison Sweeney and S.W.Scoot should not have wasted their talent for this trash. They even came with "Seriously, Dude, where is my car". This shows how much film companies are dying to make money rather than quality. <br /> <br /> Max: 4/10 <br /> <br /> Recommendation: Borrow it from your friends or forget it.
