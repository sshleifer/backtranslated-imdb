The Canterville Ghost (1996). The director made this film too wise. Maybe it's the generation, but I really liked Charles Laughton's version. There is a time and a place to "emit" and this production does not translate very well. Patrick Stewart, reciting Shakespeare was very good, but still inappropriate. I would not recommend or look again. Close-ups, padded text and secondary intrigues were lost to me. Adding unnecessary material and scenes takes away a really great job. The screenwriter should find another job to mislead his talent, perhaps serials in the afternoon would be a better opportunity. Discover the very good version and transmit it.
