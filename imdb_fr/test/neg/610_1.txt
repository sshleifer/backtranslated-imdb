This show uses a sitcom formula rather tired of the big idiot blue-collar slob with the pretty woman (and sometimes as seductive) as the crazy step-parents. With this show, the comedic comic Kevin James in the role of Doug Hefferman who works as a delivery for a parcel service. He has a pretty wife, legal guardian Carrie (Leah Remini), and his senile stepfather, Arthur Spooner (Jerry Stiller), who lives in the basement of his daughter and son-in-law. Kevin James' Doug is your typical beer-drinking, sports-loving beer who watches television and looks like a sitcom husband who would rather watch the channel than solve his marital problems. He also has a couple of idiotic friends who lend extra stupidity to the problems faced by the couple on this show. Beyond the few laughs provided by Jerry Stiller's crazy old man character, this show was generally not very funny. The foolish behavior of Kevin James has generally caused the problems of the series that his wife has generally solved. This show continued a series of sitcoms with the stupid fat father / husband and their pretty wives who all seemed to run on ABC for some reason.
