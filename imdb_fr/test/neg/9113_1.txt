I like most movies and I'm a big fan of Sean Bean, so I thought I'd like this movie at least. In addition, I am Canadian and it is a predominantly Canadian film, so I was ready to reduce it seriously. Nothing could have prepared me for the trash "airborne". Steve Guttenberg as action hero? Leave me alone. Throughout the film, the acting was so painful that I will have trouble sleeping tonight. I have only two wishes in my life. <br /> <br /> 1. I hope you never have to go through this movie. 2. I wish I could recover these 6 hours. Oh, wait, the movie is less than 2 hours - it only seemed like 6 hours ... <br /> <br /> Do not look at that. Seriously.
