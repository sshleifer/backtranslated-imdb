The words can not describe how horrible this movie is. Well, maybe they can. I'll try: 1 - Pitiful. Hollywood creates more talking animals in the graphics. Apparently, the script and scenario are no longer needed. <br /> <br /> 2 - Violent. Children's movie but one of the characters is viciously attacked and killed. <br /> <br /> 3 - A blatant stupidity. The film actually describes farm animals as having human abilities. In Nemo, the fish could talk, but for the most part, they are still fish. We only understand English as a translation. In Barnyard, animals actually speak English that other people can understand. <br /> <br /> 4 - Unintelligent - No intelligent story or even intelligent humor. (Ok, the dog with crutches 13 years old was funny). <br /> <br /> 5 - Culturally insensitive - The "black" cow is actually played by a black actress. The pink cow is played by a white actress. The black cow played a stereotypical black character. <br /> <br /> 6 - Ignorant - Nothing like a male cow to my knowledge. I think they are called bulls? If we are going to expose our children to Drek, we might be right to quote the simplest facts. <br /> <br /> 7 - Boring and Borish. My 4 year old made us leave after 45 minutes. He almost fell asleep. <br /> <br /> I'm sure this film will pay millions, which is unfortunate, because it only proves to Hollywood producers that the American public in general is full of suckers waiting to pay $ 8 just to have a little peace and quiet with the children for an hour or two. An unfortunate circumstance. Why should producers spend real money when the returns will be the same in both cases?
