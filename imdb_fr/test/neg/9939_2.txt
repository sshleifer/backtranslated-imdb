Frightening face masks and slasher films have combined like cheese and chive throughout the long life of the cycle. People often assume that it's John Carpenter who started the trend, but like so many clich√©s of the genre, the Italians did it first. Films like Eyeball, Torso and Blood and Black Lace have been behind a hooded maniac in a mystery murder. There were also some American slashers before Halloween that deserved a mention. Massacre in class, Keep my Grave Open and Savage Weekend are clearly prior to 1978, while The Town of Dreaded Sundown is widely regarded as one of the first movies to kill teenagers. <br /> <br /> Carpenter's flagship film may not have been the masked nightmare of the girl, but it certainly launched the race for competition among directors to unveil the scariest disguise of their fools. Over the years, we've seen some memorable competitors, but my favorites should be: Bloody Valentine's maniacal miner, The Prowler's sadistic soldier, and the copper-faced assassin of Wicked Games. I also want a lot of killer clowns who have appeared in the whole category. The final scene of The House on Sorority Row must be among the best. The midnight clown is also among the biggest crazy costumes. <br /> <br /> A leather mask was probably the last type to be used in a slasher film, probably because they are largely related to sexual perversion, which, of course, does not constitute a scary disguise . But later, Blackout and this darkness decide that fear can certainly be incorporated into a gimp trial. Here is how the last of the two behaved ?? <br /> <br /> The screen lights up under the blue sirens, while the cops rush to the place of taking hostages. It seems that a stressed gentleman may be tired of being chosen to be a cruddy turkey with low eyebrows. He decided to keep his wife and child under gun threat. Detective Shine (David Clover) manages to fight with the shooter, but unfortunately he loses the battle to grab a pistol and it seems to be the end of the road for the gray-haired officer. Fortunately, Lisa Ryder (Donna Adams), the best police woman in the California Police Department, saved her at night. <br /> <br /> Heroic encounter has earned the brunette a promotion to the rank of detective class, and it is a feat that is the envy of his male counterparts. Meanwhile, a maniac dressed in leather juggles around the city, slaughtering prostitutes and pouring their bloody corpses around the streets. Ryder and Shine are on the murderous murderer's case and their first call to ask questions is a sordid street photographer named Michael Walker (John Mandell). Lisa is a senior inspector, so normal police regulations do not seem to apply to her. She must soon be out with the cameraman, even if he is suspected of wearing a number. When the bodies continue to crowd around the city, she decides to go undercover to try to flush out the crazy S & M ?? <br /> <br /> On the contrary, Zipperface effortlessly summarizes everything that went wrong with the genre slasher towards the end of his reign. What began as a great springboard for filmmakers and future artists had been reduced to a sewer of film feces by direct-motion movies, zero suspense or shocks, and mediocre and talentless actors. The years of prosperity of the splashed movies of the early eighties have managed to conceal their lack of dramatic line-ups, with sticky special effects and thrilling palpitations. Unfortunately, at this point in the cycle, titles like Rush Week, Deadly Dreams and The Majorettes appeared to have been produced in a plot to put in the category where many characters of the aforementioned feature film were. In an early grave. <br /> <br /> Donna Adams does not even vaguely convince as an officer of justice and her inexplicably silly behavior - which includes stripping for one of the main suspects in a national murder investigation - is more a pathetic and insane spirit than you ever believe. Mansour Pourmand could not direct the traffic and the vast majority of the cast members would have a hard time getting a second reading for an advertisement on the radio. I searched and searched, but I found nothing of merit or note here. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, if you manage to keep the TV on until the end, you may be quite surprised at the killer's identity. To be honest, I doubt that at that moment you pay attention. And another positive point? Well, uh .... the disc is perfectly symmetrical, which means you can use it as a mat to put your cup of tea ?? Apart from that, there is really no other reason to go out and buy Zipperface. Bad Bad Bad and not in a good way, it's been 90 minutes of my life that I could have spent more constructively tearing my chest hair. Terrible.
