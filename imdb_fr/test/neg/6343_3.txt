I know these types of movies sell tickets and are profitable for filmmakers, but that will not be enough as a movie about Vietnam. Viet Nam was filled with horrors for the men who lived it day after day. <br /> <br /> This film is interpreted by Gene Hackman, veterinarian of the Korean War, to form a group of Vietnam veterans return trip to this country to rescue a group of American prisoners of war detained in a camp there. Among these men are a former rat-tunnel, a madman in freefall, a California-tanned blond surfer and an inexperienced child (Patrick Swayze) who has just had a father killed in Nam. They train first in a Texas camp and once in Nam, they are discovered and lose all their weapons. They can find alternative weapons and continue their way to free the captured men. Most of the men are found and saved, but the group of rags is largely erased. <br /> <br /> This film is played as a video game in which you can determine what will happen and will appear. out of what bush, and who was going to die and who was going to live. Viet Nam I guess it was not like a video game ....
