Bela Lugosi as God? Transvestites discussed in a movie in the 1950s? Damn, it must be a Ed Wood movie. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie, I felt a combination of guilt, pleasure and nausea. The story is about Glen (Ed Wood himself) and his alter ego Cross-dressing, Glenda. One way or another, if this movie was done now, I could see Kevin Kline playing Glen / Glenda. Note that all alter ego transvestites are versions of their masculine names (Glen / Glenda, Robert / Roberta, etc.). He tries to portray him sympathetically as the mental disorder he is, rather than as a graphic perversion. <br /> <br /> In one way or another, Wood manages to sneak into Bondage and S & M sequences in his original Glen / Glenda story. In addition to these racy scenes, Satan himself appears, obviously having a bad day of hairdressing. Dialogue and rhythm do not exist, but the film is nice in context - the strange world of Ed Wood. <br /> <br /> Sterno recommends that you wear your favorite lace panties for this one.
