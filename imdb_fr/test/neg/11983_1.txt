Not too good a movie. Of course, it contains action, but the effects are not very good for a film of 2008. The effects of gunshots are downright horrible. To play it is "meh" <br /> <br /> It has nothing to do with Far Cry, except the names and the very basis of the story (super genetically improved soldiers who go crazy) . The super soldiers are very different, the mercenaries are different, the setting is completely different (tropical island in the Pacific in the game, North American island in the movie). <br /> <br /> I loved playing Far Scream. I loved the story and the decor. I hated the movie.
