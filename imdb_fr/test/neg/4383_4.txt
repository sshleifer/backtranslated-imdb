When I was young, I was a big fan of Chuck Norris. I have just started to release all his old movies on video so I can see them through the eyes of adults. I remember that I particularly liked it and thought it was one of his best. Now that I'm a little older, I can say that although it's quite average, I still consider it one of his best films. He plays a policeman haunted by his participation in the arrest and capture of a dangerous serial killer film. Serial Killers are all the rage nowadays, and people would like to think of them as an invention of the '90s. On the other hand, it's good to see where the current craze has sprung up, of course the action movies (as well as Stalk N 'Slashers) from the 70s and 80s. While Norris tries so much humor that any form of human compassion is poignant and laughable, no one can hit anyone in the head like Chuck. As a big fan of Steve James, I can also recommend this film, as well as the legend of the genre Billy Drago, as well as see Mitch of The Blue Brothers in a supporting role. Not great, but it's better than anything Norris did in the '90s.
