This film was completely unhealthy, disturbing and unsatisfactory. Apart from some beautiful pictures of Italy, nothing is recommended for this film. As usual, Hollywood draws the wrong conclusion of a fractured existence: the next guy you meet, with whom you sleep after knowing for a few hours, he must be Mr. True. As for the humor, there is in the film, but I do not see how anyone could describe this comedy as romantic, because about three quarters of the film are totally depressing! My recommendation? Ignore him in the theaters, wait for him to come out on DVD, then skip it too. I want someone to give me back the two hours I lost watching this dreck, this ruckus, this dirt.
