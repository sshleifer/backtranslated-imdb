Bad shot, poorly edited, clumsy dialogue, flat characters, unsuccessful adaptation of a novel. It does not really get worse. Decent acting and a good popcorn saved me an hour and a half - I felt like three hours - of boredom. Occasionally good. One-liners. <br /> <br /> David is a weak-minded young man who has never recovered from the loss of his brother early. He places his faith in a Chinese philosophy video Mumbo Jumbo, although that does not seem to help much in real life. David is a member of a collectors' gang, each of whose members has an IQ below sea level. A missing script, as well as uncreative shots and an even worse retouch, give what could have been incidents pretty funny failure of the collection of debts an allusion to an amateur reality show. <br /> <br /> David rents an apartment in a primary school teacher, Haraldur, who, passing a few sentences on its importance, convinces David that he is facing the most dangerous criminal in Iceland. A script that is sorely lacking offers nothing to David on which to base his opinion. Some scenes showing Haraldur doing something that David might have misinterpreted would have done the job. The film's potential as a medium, unlike the text of the book on which this film is based, is not exploited. <br /> <br /> In the beginning, David's bond with Haraldur gets stronger within the collector's gang, but the paranoia prevailing in the criminal world forces David to show where his loyalty lies. <br /> <br /> The plot of the film is good, but it is based on the book. It could have been a much better movie. A good scriptwriter could have done something of this material. Unfortunately, it is not the case. <br /> <br /> The acting game is generally good. Petur Jóhann is excellent and credible as David. Eggert leorleifsson does not work much, but does his best with the little material he has. Ingvar Sigurðsson and Michael Imperioli (in a tiny role) are doing well. <br /> <br /> General Opinion: What could have been a pretty entertaining and entertaining film about a stupid anti-hero who is part of a collector's gang, becomes a boring and ill-conceived film made after a poor manuscript. Watching the toes for an hour and a half would be more enjoyable.
