All I can do is echo the sentiment already expressed by some of the commentators. It is the city of God that meets on happy days. The bipolarity of the ruthless thug (a minute is a ruthless killer, the next minute an advertisement for a layer of Luv's) is totally unconvincing. You can approach it in one of the following ways: (1) A realistic and realistic film that has become dark; or (2) special clothing, special after school, with blasphemy, violence and cruelty to animals. Anyway, it does not fly, do you? Why then did he receive so much praise? As others have suggested, he gets the "vote of conscience" from the West. Show us images of poverty that contrast with our double-width theater seats and our 44 oz. Cokes, and we'll applaud without hesitation. But - oh - do not forget to cover it with candy, because the bitter pill of reality (as tempting as it is) is hard to swallow. <br /> <br /> I am terribly disappointed that this film would receive so much praise and praise, especially when there are many more deserving films. All I can say is: beware of any award-winning film (Hollywood Oscars = triple tripe syrupy Cannes Film Festival = propaganda without beard and without art). To find the real jewels, you will have to work hard.
