It does not surprise me that the filmmakers of this hopeless film can not find a British distributor, and then have to release it as a free DVD with a Sunday newspaper. Distributors could clearly see what the filmmakers and the Sunday newspaper could not see, it was a film that simply did not cover its costs. <br /> <br /> Since this is a thriller about riddles, it would have helped if they had chosen a lead actor who could spell it out, rather than the whisper Vinnie Jones who seems to pronounce "riddle" like "riell". And that would have helped if the dialogue had not been submerged by noisy places or scenes flooded with distracting and inappropriate music. The plot is ridiculous: the lost story of Charles Dickens would help our hero solve a series of modern murders, but the same would be true of a copy of Adventures Of Tintin de Herge, because the connection between Dickens and Jones is more nonexistent than narrow. And we have the ridiculous premise that a so-called investigative journalist who gets his hands on a Dickens manuscript, which has never been discovered, would take several days to read, so that backtracking to Dickens could continue to be read throughout the film had a connection with it. What they do not do. I mean, if you found a new Dickens manuscript, would not you just sit somewhere in silence and read it? The film ends with one of those surprise revelations that have become mandatory since The Sixth Sense, but in this case, it does not surprise you to insult your intelligence. If the film suddenly became supernatural by the twelfth hour, revealing that Vinnie Jones was a robot might have been more acceptable. It might not have been so overwhelming if the movie was stylish, but it was not. And in many places, it sounds like a real hobby: there is a scene in which a table is laid with a 1960s jumping technique, but they have not made sure that the person laying the table is completely out of the game. frame between the cuts. Therefore, you can see that things are changing at the edge of the frame, so that you are really supposed to see them change in the center of the frame. A good rule in making a movie is this: if you do not understand how to do a technique, try something else. <br /> <br /> The real enigma is why someone thought it would be a good idea to make this movie. in the first place.
