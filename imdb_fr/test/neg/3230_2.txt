Okay, my question Who's the idiot who wrote this movie, giving it the same name as Dean Koontz's great book? its terrible, nothing to do with the book ... you have the dog, and the observer, but there, the similarities end ... maybe well, if you have not read the book, but ... but he disappointed me, really. <br /> <br /> they should make a new one and let konton write it ... now it would be a good movie ... I repeat, this movie made me sick ... absolutely nauseated me. it was terrible, it was absolutely not like the book. I would never look at that again.
