Having read the books and seen the 1982 version of Anthony Andrews / Jane <br /> <br /> Seymour, I must say that it is not good at all. <br /> <br /> According to the books, Percy is supposed to be a <br /> <br /> apparently a spooky aristocrat when he's Percy, and witty and clever <br /> <br /> when he's the Pimpernel, but here he looks bored with <br /> Percy and mean like Pimpernel. Daisy is supposed to be <br /> <br /> the most beautiful woman in Europe, not a tired and shapeless matron (she looks middle-aged, probably because of <br /> <br /> bad makeup). Richard E. Grant has done a lot better, and <br /> <br /> The role of Elizabeth McGovern is not inspired and flat. <br /> <br /> The essence of the books and film Andrews / Seymour is here replaced by <br /> <br /> by a powerful and flashy editing that does not do the trick. <br /> <br /> I would add that, for a person who has not yet seen the previous version <br /> <br /> nor read the book, it would probably seem to go.
