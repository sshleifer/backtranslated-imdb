I just watched this movie. I could not imagine watching that on VHS, because there were scenes where I needed the subtitles to hear through an accent or sound effect, even though the scene itself was in English. <br /> <br /> Visually, the film is quite attractive. The few effects of CG were very obvious insertions, but the effects of prostheses / creatures were not bad. Not perfect, but photography and editing (which were pretty good) made up for a lot. Playing was generally bad, but I can not say how much we could blame the director, having never seen any of the actors before. The exception, I think, was Mr. Gomez (Uxia). She stole all the scenes in which she had played, and not just because of a very pretty face, but there was something like an urgency in her performance that no one else had. The writing could have been much better - the plot was still indisputably Lovecraft, and many details were written in Lovecraft, but personally, I could have done it without most of the dialogue.
