The Ragazza del Vagone Letto or Terror Express! as it was called on the version I saw, begins when various passengers board a long distance train. Three foolish thugs, Dave, Phil and Ernie (Carlo De Mejo), and it is clear that they are there to cause trouble as they verbally intimidate and abuse other passengers and staff. While the train is running at full speed, a prostitute named Juliet (Silvia Dionisio) refuses to make love with Dave, he and his companions decide to take the whole train as a hostage to be able to hold an orgy with Juliet & finally not big something else is going on besides some hero cop and his prisoner who decided to save the day. Uh, that's really ... <br /> <br /> This Italian production was made by Ferdinando Baldi and is completely fucked from start to finish. The scenario of George Eastman as Luigi Montefiori could just as well be described as a really boring porn as much as a horror / thriller movie. It's tediously slow, it takes 35 minutes before anything happens, even a little fishy, ​​and overall, the film lacks the kind of operating elements that both Sleaze & Italian horror. The film can be compared to another Italian production the infinitely better The House on the Edge of the Park (1980) made the same year. This is a very broad comparison, although everything that has made The House on the Edge of the park the famous film that is missing from the Ragazza del Vagone Letto, there is no blood, no gore, almost no violence, there are only two or three really docile rapes, the story has no twists and it is incredibly boring to watch. Italian films and horror films from the late '70s and early' 80s are not known for their stories or their quality scripts, but this movie really tells the bottom of the barrel in every way. The characters are awful, the film spends more than 30 minutes building them and explains why they are on the train, but all this is quickly forgotten and nothing happens. I also hated the lame end and I do not know if I forgot anything, but was any reasonable explanation given as to why these three lame people would hijack a train? I do not think there was any I'm sorry, but since your anger at a prostitute is not a good enough reason, the filmmakers would surely have been able to come up with something more substantial and interesting, if not more plausible. In my opinion, this movie stinks, it's as simple as I fear. <br /> <br /> Director Baldi does a good job. To be fair, he only has one lane and a few train compartments to work with so I'll leave him a little slack, after saying that the film becomes very repetitive. There is no style and he films sex scenes like bad porn with romantic piano music. There is not a single drop of blood spread throughout the film, it's true, not a single drop. Forget any violence or violence, you will be very disappointed if you do it, as I did. There are some rapes but they have been organized in an amateur way and have no impact, the nasty exploitation and sleaze of say I Spit on Your Grave (1978) or The Last House on the Left (1972) is not here. <br /> <br /> Technically, La Ragazza del Vagone Letto is OK and the budget is relatively well done, but the framework has obviously helped to keep costs down. The acting is mediocre, as usual, although since being baptized, the original performances have been lost. Italian horror fans will recognize a lot of voices here. <br /> <br /> The Ragazza del Vagone Letto is a terrible film, it's just my opinion but I was bored to tears waiting for something to happen and when it will ever end I did not feel deceived, I want to find those 80 minutes of my life. This piece of shit is not even worthy of being included in your local Blockbuster's VHS 99p bin, to be avoided.
