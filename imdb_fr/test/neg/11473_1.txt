I had heard that this movie was elegant and intriguing, but I found it just boring. It's been a long time since I've seen it (and I hope I will not discover that all my memories are wrong and that I unfairly condemn this film), but I remember that the filmmakers had tried to portray Leopold and Loeb as the victim of an anti-gay society, and that somehow caused their horrible crime. I totally disagree with this view and think it's unfair to both homosexuals and to Bobby Franks, the true victim of the story. I can not imagine why anyone would want to claim these two martyrs. I also thought that L & L was described as a bit more sophisticated than it actually was - it was after all teenagers who lived at home. The film places them in a kind of fantasy world that seems to be marked by Morrissey. <br /> <br /> I just read an interview with one of the filmmakers who implied anachronisms of the film, like the push button. The phones that the characters used were intended to "add Brechtian distance". That's certainly what they do, but I found it extremely boring. <br /> <br /> Apparently, a number of people have found this film interesting, but I would have preferred a less "stylish" and more realistic review of the homosexuality part. may have played in the Leopold & Loeb case.
