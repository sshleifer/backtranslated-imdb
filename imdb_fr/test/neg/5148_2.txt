***** Spoiler Ahead ***** <br /> <br /> I guess you should not expect a movie made for TV, but this one was particularly bad, the plot was a good idea, but poorly done, the acting was not particularly good. And the end of the movie was just terrible. The main character was perfectly normal throughout the film, then suddenly, when we discover that she is the murderer, she turns into a psychopath struggling with mental health problems. It's completely pathetic. <br /> <br /> There is only one reason to watch this movie, Yasmin Bleeth, even though we have not seen it before in swimsuit? Do not even bother looking at this waste of time, if you want a movie about the world of beauty, then look at "Drop Dead Gorgeous", it's rather infinitely better.
