What I would not do to rewrite this movie. Very disappointing because of the good start, Solo Dios Sabe degenerates into a superstitious bull after mid-race and ends on a note so ridiculous, soppy and melodramatic that I could not believe I was watching the same movie that I had started. The film had many elements in its favor, such as the chemistry between Diego Luna and Alice Braga, so palpable that I thought the screen would start producing sparks, a beautiful soundtrack and beautiful places. Instead of ending with heavy-handed religious mumbo jumbo, the film should have remained centered on a sparkling road movie with perhaps some nuances on fate and superstition against logic. I understand that the director's intention with the film was to talk about religion, but the fact is that it simply did not work and he threw so many great things right from the beginning.
