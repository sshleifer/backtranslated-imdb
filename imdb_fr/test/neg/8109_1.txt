There might be SPOILERS AHEAD but I doubt it. I do not know at all how the scenario of this one managed to exceed the destroyer. It's horrible. Completely unassailable. I hung there for 45 minutes (about half of the total time) and could not stand it anymore. I was a fan of Elijah Wood in the 90s (see "The War") and I learned to appreciate Mandy Moore's passages from sparkling to serious this year (see "Chasing Liberty" which is surprisingly entertaining). I saw pieces of "Run Lola Run". So, with three tracks, I liked that it's going well. It was not. Nobody has achieved a good performance. Wood's Jones was flat. For an aspiring writer, he had almost no imagination (his violent fantasies seemed to have eradicated from "A Christmas Story" and his lustfulness was - eh, a mix of boredom and alarm). Potente is absolutely incomparable from the first second and I would only know that she was supposed to be "THE girl" by reading the box. Speaking of synopsis, the choice of the film has made the film look funny, quirky, romantic and rather pleasant. Whoever this person was, she should have been used to rewrite this script. Midway through, I did not care about any of the characters anymore. Moore is an aspiring actress who is bubbly and a little complicit (for no apparent reason), but her ridiculous play (which is supposed to be funny in her presentation) is tied with the rest of the screenplay. There is a so-called romantic and joyful comedy that ends with this turkey - given the material of character with which they had to work, I just can not imagine it. Save your money. Tell your friends DO NOT watch this movie.
