The story as a whole, while very graphic, is actually decent and reasonably interesting for readers. However, the movie was absolutely horrendous. The story was good, but the acting was terrible. I cried all the time because I knew I could never get my time back. Do not see this movie. If you do, bring a gun with a ball inside and a few balls if you are going with friends. I'm sorry for everyone who has nothing to do with this movie. I am sorry for all those who had to watch the movie. Avoid this movie at all costs and if your mother forces you to watch it, kill it. Hahahahaha! See! I am a psychopath now !!!! IKWTCBS turned me into a psychopath !!!!
