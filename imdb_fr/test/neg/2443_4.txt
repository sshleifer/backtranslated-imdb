Miserable film. Not even be compared in a breath with "To kill a mocking bird", or "In the heat of the night." <br /> <br /> Yes, there are racial prejudices but the film is ridiculous at most. <br /> <br /> Come now. Do you really have Elizabeth Patterson, of all people, keeping a prison to avoid a lynching? Patterson, in his day, played the role of everyone's mother and was the owner of "I Love Lucy" before Fred and Ethel Mertz bought the building. <br /> <br /> Imagine that the body is exhumed the gun of a man did he kill a white man? <br /> <br /> Claude Jarman Jr., who was so fabulous in 1946, "The Yearling" appears in this bazaar. He still had those sad eyes. My eyes would be sad too if I figured in this horrible film. <br /> <br /> For me, it was nothing more than a flop Faulkner.
