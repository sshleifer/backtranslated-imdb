Yes why? Among the filmmakers of the 80s and 90s, Gus Van Sant is one of my idols. There are others, some. Steven Sodebergh, PT Anderson, Tim Hunter, Danny Boyle, Martin Donovan, Harmony Korine, Wes Anderson. Idiosyncratic, exasperating sometimes, but coherent, surprising, unpredictable. Their names make me turn on the television, go to a video store or even buy a ticket and go to the movies. Van Sant's "Psycho" gives me a break, however. Why? I wonder. A one-off massacre of one of the most vivid classics. The color was discordant, the performance atrocious. What was Vince Vaughn doing? Was it a parody? A bad joke? What was this mess? Anne Heche as Janet Leigh? Who dressed her? Viggo Mortensen with a cowboy hat. Viggo is a superb actor but in this case, he could not make us forget John Gavin and if Julianne Moore had been presented to the world thanks to this performance, there would not have been "The Hours" for her, "The Minutes "maybe. So, here I am uncomfortable with the work of one of my idols. The question that remains remains the same: why, Mr. Van Sant? Maybe, as President Clinton said, because he could. I'm afraid it's not an excuse.
