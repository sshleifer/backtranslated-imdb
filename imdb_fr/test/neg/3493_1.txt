This film is bad. Just bad. In absolute terms, bad. <br /> <br /> The dialog pops out of the screen and hurts you in the face with its completely artificial joke, then defecates on your ability to detect even minute amounts of subtlety. <br /> <br /> Racism is bad. Racism in Los Angeles can be particularly serious. I live in the city of angels, I can testify. What is terrible about sectarianism in Los Angeles is its insidious nature. He crawls you with a knowing look or a swallowed word. Until the end of a complete fist fight, he hardly ever goes out and says, "Why did he have to be black!" <br /> <br /> I can see very clearly that the car-jackers are black, the detective's partner is Hispanic, the prosecutor is white. As long as movies are on the projector, I can let visuals, music and words lead me to that conclusion without telling me the conclusion. The characters are emotive and we read between the lines to establish connections and conclusions. <br /> <br /> It's a partnership and a trust between the filmmaker and the public. This trust is violated by this film. <br /> <br /> A good movie guides you as an audience and guides you with the directions to get straight to the point. This film hits you with its tip and insults you and your intelligence along the way. My unanswered question is: why, as a society, have we collectively said "thank you"?
