I got this movie as a purchase we get a deal at troma.com with The Ruining (which is not much better). The main reason why I wanted it to be seen Star Worms II: The attack of the pods of pleasure, the DVD is a dual feature of this movie. I really did not know what Actium Maximus was at the time and when I saw the trailer, I was scared. It was awful. But hey, what can you say about the trailer? Well, apparently, I could say a lot. Honestly, this film does not make sense to me. The special effects were so terrible that you can not know what's going on in the name of God. I understand Mark HIcks had an extremely low budget, but hey, come on. And it's sad, because in the interview, he felt like it was an epic movie that mattered more than you could see. Unfortunately, watching the movie is one of the most boring 15 minutes of life. It's so painful to sit. I really can not even explain the plot because I did not understand it at all and I unfortunately saw this movie twice! Apparently, they used a kind of puppet for "extraterrestrial dinosaurs" as they did in Star Wars. But these special effects are awful, I can not emphasize it too much. And most of the time, the bad effects are acceptable, but this film needed it. It takes place on a futuristic planet where extraterrestrial dinosaurs clash and where bad actors in hoodies run everywhere and it looks like they are in the kkk. And a box with a blue light is the president. I know in the interview, Mark Hicks talked about the possibility of turning this project into a TV pilot. Well, I understand why it was not presented to CBS or NBC. There are two good things about this movie. 1. the music is actually quite good, it has an epic score that stays in your head for days. And 2. Lloyd Kaufman's introduction is, as always, hilarious. Overall, do not waste your time but take a look at Star Worms II: the fun pod attack!
