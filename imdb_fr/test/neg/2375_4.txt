It's not horrible but what a mess ... Lousy gags, bad music, mediocre drawings and animations ... <br /> <br /> Regarding the impressive number of animators and intervals in this photo (of, um ... a Come on, how can you expect something coherent when you make an animated film this way!) I wonder if a guy in the credits = a drawing! The lines are rough, the work in 3D inadequate (I am not against, but not in this film) but the decorations are correct. The scenario is rather stupid, far from the ingenuity of comics, and obviously intended for an international audience. Distributing a movie around the world does not mean taking everyone for a simple-minded guy ... A cultural object is much more interesting when it's difficult, even if it's a foreign film ( to be French in this case is even worse!). <br /> <br /> Some novelties work well (the character of Olaf, sometimes, as in the explanation of the stone, but it is not great) but the modern references are exasperating (music, SMS, not even a verbal joke, just a stupid bird named Short Message Service: does anyone know the imagination?). But, hey, it's a M6 / TPS production with some Celine Dion in it ... pathetic. <br /> <br /> Asterix is ​​under-employed and Obelix is ​​talking too much. Goudurix could be great (as in the book), but he is too clearly a "cool dude" who has a love story (with an uninteresting female character). In fact, only Vikings (except wizards) are fun. Too much action, not enough to laugh. The best part of the movie is the end credits. Not the music, but the few images it contains. BD style. Well, definitely, Asterix is ​​not made to move!
