Roll up! Roll up! It's Big Gay Bruce and his Big Gay Death Cannon! Plausible plot? Useless! Decent actor? Useless! Respect shown to his powerful progenitor? Useless! Yes, it's another stuffed turkey in Butch Bruce's gun. <br /> <br /> I mean, how do you start this movie? Okay, let's start with the lamentable bad idea that people might have, that it was somehow related to the original book or movie, Jackal's Day. It's not. In fact, it's so different (and so bad) that Fredrick Forsyth has asked for his name to be erased. Now, I'm not necessarily a stuffy Briton who can not hack Hollywood doing British movies again. Okay, maybe I'm a little like that, but fortunately it's a redundant point in this case. This film is so different from the original that the name and the odd reference are the only things that survive. <br /> <br /> Now let's move on to the premise. A Russian cheese gangster gets killed during a police raid in Moscow (implicating the FBI in one way or another although nobody bother to explain why). In contrast, a gangster's brother decides to take revenge by killing the US president's wife (although no one worries yet again about why it's a good move, though, to be fair it was before 9/11, so he was not aware that it would have resulted in the US Air Force bombing Eastern Europe). The gangster hires the "nasty" killer (Willis). Police hires the killer "hug" (Gere), the killer "hug" follows the "naughty" killer. The police go around and get killed periodically. The killer "hug" kills the "wicked" killer. The first lady is saved and we all realize that the IRA is just that band of real lovable guys, you know, who just want to kill innocent people. Nice. <br /> <br /> Let's put aside the clever Hollywood habit of playing in the troubles of Northern Ireland as if it were a sandbox in a theme park (I treated this point more in detail on bulletin boards). If Hollywood filmmakers want Belfast's butchers to be heart-throbbing prostitutes, that's their choice. Of course I reserve the right to despise them for that. It's a free country. <br /> <br /> The fact that the film manages to protect and insult the Irish while trying to support them is even more blatant. It's not politically unpleasant, it's worse: it's incompetent. It is no wonder, for example, that Gere has always looked so good, since he slept for the six months it took to make this piece of wallpaper. The fact that Gere's accent is not only Irish from the south, but also a frightful parody of southern Irish shows that filmmakers were not trying to get out of America to make money with this film. Then there is this beautiful scene at the end where Sidney Poitier (a total loss of place in this movie) says he went to have a coffee, offers to take our "hug" IRA, then said casually "Ah, but then you guys Guinness woods is not it. Yeah that's right Sidney; the Irish live on Guinness and potatoes. <br /> <br /> As we speak of Poitier: why? In the original movie, the detective is the tracker. At Jackal, Gere is the tracker. So what does Poitier do? Well, he stays around and looks like, of course. He has absolutely nothing to do except call in the marines at the end, and he only does so because the kind man of the IRA tells him to do it. <br /> <br /> While we talk about Gere: why? I guess it's only a matter of time before Hollywood rediscovers Gandhi with Vin Diesel playing Commando Mahatma Gandhi's former mujahideen beheading his way into India in the 1940s and 1950s (after all, he's a bit dark and therefore very likely to be a fundamentalist Muslim). Let's not forget that Gere's character is a killer and therefore a dirty job. And if he does not know, why does he know the jackal? If not, why does he know all his movements? And if it is, why is there such a soft cookie and such a "kind" person? <br /> <br /> All this shows that the directors of this film could not be disturbed (a) to think about the plot (b) to make the characters make decisions that correspond to their character (c) ) Avoid nerdy stereotypes like having the big bad boss kill his own friend? Honestly, I thought it had turned into a Bond movie (d) giving the "central" characters something to do (e) credit the audience with a minimum of intelligence. <br /> <br /> This film is an insult to the British and the Irish killed at the hands of terrorists, it is an insult to the Irish people, it is an insult to not much, but a very good film that it tears, and an insult to intelligence. But above all ?? and the most unforgivable ?? it's an insult to my past to have to sit for more than two hours of running time. Honestly, you would think without intrigue, without characters and without dialogue, it would be finished in no time. But they did not even have the decency to leave early.
