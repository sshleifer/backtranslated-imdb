I only comment on very good movies and total hogwash. My goal is to help people who want to see great movies to use their time and money wisely. <br /> <br /> I also want to prevent people from wasteful time, and I want to emphasize that the director / producer of these waste films can not get away with it very long. We will find out who you are and vote without feet or purses. <br /> <br /> This film falls clearly in the category of waste. <br /> <br /> The director and scriptwriter is John Shiban. It's always a bad sign when the author is also the director. Maybe he wants two paychecks. He should not have any. So remember the name - John SHIBAN. And if you see anything else from her, forget her. <br /> <br /> I will not say anything about the plot, others have already done so. I'm a little worried about how much the director likes to zoom in on the poor girl's face when she cries and screams. These long shots are a little disturbing and can say a lot about Mr. Shiban's state of mind. Maybe he should have psychiatric help. <br /> <br /> Enough already. It's shit - do not waste your time on it.
