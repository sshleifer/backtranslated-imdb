Wow ... <br /> <br /> Reading these comments, I see a remarkable socio-cultural conflict theme emerge between the United States and ... the Dutch! The United States P.o.V. It seems like a very good little movie, Parker being a friendly hero, the story a light interpretation of what could be a glorified form of reality. <br /> <br /> The three Dutch critics see the world seemingly through a totally different pair of glasses. They categorically agree and in surprisingly similar terms that the film is a disaster. <br /> <br /> Far from me to take sides in what seems to be a dispute between cultures, on this subject as wide as the ocean separates them geographically. Yet, based on factual observations - I saw the film with my own eyes - I guess the Dutch are not far from the target: <br /> <br /> "Parker Kane" is bad quality, totally boring and really not worth the celluloid that was undoubtedly lost in its creation.
