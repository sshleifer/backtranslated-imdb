Tarentino should be ashamed to be involved in this horrible movie. The acting, the staging and the screenplay are all third-rate - the entire film playing as an excuse for screenwriter / director / star Larry Bishop to get laid. The only reason this has been done is probably due to its association with QT. The film's plot is quite fragile, and basically tries to survive with not-so-obscure references to older B movies and a few cameos from guys like David Carradine, Dennis Hopper and Vinnie Jones. Each of them is apathetic in his performances, especially Hopper who is in full swing at this moment of his career. The saving grace, if there is one, is that the script is so ridiculously bad that it can be entertaining. Bishop strives so hard to get this trademark from Tarentino and fails miserably, which can sometimes be quite funny and squeaky for others. I would only look at that one if you like bad movies ... or if you really like biker movies.
