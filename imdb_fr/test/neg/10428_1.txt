The thundering, circulating and sometimes suspicious story of journalist John Woodushi by journalist Bob Woodward becomes a totally misjudged film, a nebulous "fantasy" made by Larry Peerce as if he were doing something edgy and vital. Michael Chiklis (years before his breakthrough in "The Shield") is placed in the unenviable position of portraying Belushi, making a post-mortem journey through his life, recreating these "Saturday Night Live" skits that are now part of history of television. It's like watching someone try to go out - Lucy Lucille Ball - it can not be done. Belushi's death was so sad because he was one of a kind. Chiklis makes a commendable attempt to watch the role, and he's funny in an early scene trying to escape the morgue. Yet it is a difficult undertaking and no actor - no matter how talented - could have saved it. * from ****
