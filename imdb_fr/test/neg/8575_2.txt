I usually do not like to comment on the acting in a movie, because that's the only thing people who have a movie agenda will pursue. In this film, I will make an exception. The actors in this movie are below average all around. I mean halfway through the film, I wonder how the producer and / or the director has managed to stage such a group of people who can not play. Even if the value of the production was good, the badly written story is added to the bad performance of the actors, and there is even an unenthusiastic attempt to change the end of the film, which ends up causing confusion. Are all Spanish horror films so disappointing?
