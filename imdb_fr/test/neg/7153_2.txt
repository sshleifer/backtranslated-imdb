It's a road movie. At least, the film is yellow and I think it suggests a road movie (?). I can not say much positive about The Delivery. It's bad to act, certainly their English. The camera seems to have been made by a child, there is a bomb with a meter and suddenly a beetle falls from the sky. Since it was so clich√©, we laughed all the time - and it was the most fun of the movie. This film should be released in America, but I'm not sure that you should go there, as it might suggest that it's the quality we produce. The explosions seem boring. Basically everything is at the top. Everything is too much: yellow quality, sound, baby, etc. Find the whole cliche in other movies, assemble them and you have The Delivery.
