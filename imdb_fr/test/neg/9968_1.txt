The only interesting thing about this movie is its subject. Examining the Manson "family" from the point of view of the family members themselves is a great idea. However, trying to make sense of the incomprehensible is something that can only really be accomplished in a masterpiece - and that's not it. <br /> <br /> Probably because there was so much information to get into a screenplay, This film was made in a fake documentary style, with reenactments. The problem is that writing and making it impossible to establish what makes a film visible, such as a character, a story, a theme, and so on. <br /> <Worse, there is an incredibly weak sub-plot that follows a small group of last-day Mansonites as they attack a journalist who is working on a story on the anniversary. murders. It's stupid and useless, and a total waste of time. <br /> <br /> In the end, this film is a big opportunity wasted. The only ray of sunshine is the game of Marc Pitman, who plays Tex, who in real life was behind most of the murders. While female characters appear as gigantic heads in the flashbacks of the 60s, Pitman manages to convey a real feeling. <br /> <br /> In short, do not bother with this movie.
