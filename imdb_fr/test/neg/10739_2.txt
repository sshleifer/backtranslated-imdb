The only reason I attributed a 2 to this "Masters of Horror" episode instead of a 1 is because both of the main actors are good and it's not shot in VHS. The story, the dialogue and the plot are ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Speaking / driving the zombies who come back to vote and influence the political trend against the war! Leave me alone! And then, the zombies who come back to skydive? Maybe the zombies coming back to host QVC shows? <br /> <br /> I have never supported the war in Iraq, but I support the courage and sacrifice of the men and women of our armed forces; and "Homecoming" was disrespectful in that he made fun of the TRUE horror of war. <br /> <br /> Zombies being mass-produced in today's market ... it's zombies-related entertainment spam. How "Homecoming" turned it into "Masters of Horror" overtakes me.
