"Season on the Brink" is one of my favorite books of all time - an insightful and insightful look at Bob Knight and his Indiana Hoosiers. And Dennehy is one of my favorite support actors of all time. So I focused on watching this adaptation. <br /> <br /> This has disappointed at all levels. Dennehy's performance was less than inspired, and he seemed not to be ready to play Knight - as if he had accepted the role just before the shoot. The rest of the cast is not much better. <br /> <br /> And it was obvious that this was the first ESPN movie. It was poorly directed, poorly filmed and lack of budget was evident each time games were simulated (smaller gyms, empty seats, etc.). Ignore this adaptation and read the book - it holds up!
