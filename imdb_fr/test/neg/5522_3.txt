"Happy Days" was produced and broadcast from the mid-1970s to the early 1980s and seems to be becoming increasingly ridiculous with age. At the time of its release, most of the viewers who grew up in the 1950s were middle-aged with families, and the Mel's Diner scenes probably gave them an artificial nostalgia. The Fonz was of course the coolest of the cool (although the actor Henry Wrinkler has never learned to ride a motorcycle yet). Richie Cunningham was the young American with blond hair who would probably be elected president of the student body. Potsie was Richie's best friend - the star of the show must have a best friend, I guess. And Ralph Malph was the clumsy companion of the Fonz, if it was not the whole group. I loved it when the Fonz hit poor Ralph Malph. And there was Mel, the middle-aged horn who ran Mel's Diner. And of course, who could forget the appearance of Mork? Was it really the 1950s? Ironically, movies produced in the 1950s, such as "Rebel Without a Cause" and "The Wild One" have improved with age and more honestly represent this period than this show produced 20 years after its inception. <Br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the TV show "Happy Days" is not in the same category as "Rebel Without a Cause" or "American Graffitti". "Happy Days" may have captured some aspects of the 1950s with its burger dinner, jukeboxes, cool cars and checkered shirts, but it's more of a nostalgic idealism strictly reserved for laughter than an honest portrait. "American Graffitti" had something to say about young Americans in the 1950s, while "Happy Days" seemed to be about what middle-aged people in the '70s hoped the' 50s would be. The result has been a kind of diluted manufacturing that really has nothing to do with the 50s. "Happy Days" is, at best, an imaginary comedy set against a backdrop of the 1950's artificial culture. Another critic, Richie Cunningham, an American child, has probably been criticized for befriending a type of abandonment like Fonzie. And Mel would probably ban Fonzie from going to dinner. <br /> <br /> Short story: "Happy Days" was originally a pilot called "Love in the Happy Days" which had been refused for broadcast. The comedy pilots whose sex and romance themes were not aired occasionally appeared on the infrequently broadcast "Love American Style," which was often broadcast in lieu of the baseball games that had more or unexpected program cancellations and / or changes. In short, "Love American Style" was a throw-away series that contained all of these comic pilots in one episode that never reached a leading role. "Love in the Happy Days" appeared as a "Love American Style" show in the early 1970s, but at that time, television executives did not know how popular a 1950s youth show would be. especially during the day of glory. comedy programs centered on middle-aged people, such as the "Mary Tyler Moore Show" (and subsequent spin-offs such as "Rhoda"), "The Bob Newhart Show" and "All in the Family". (How have things changed since most television series are devoted to young people and the industry avoids most of the emissions on middle-aged people, like the plague!) <br /> <br /> By the One of the young stars of "Love in the Happy Days", a young actor of "The Andy Griffith Show", named Ron Howard, had the chance to play in a film about young people that would take place in 1959 and titled "American Graffitti", directed by the relatively unknown George Lucas, whose previous "THX 1138" had bombarded miserably at the box office. Even when the film was presented to movie directors, the studios could not yet see how a film about young people in the 50's could become popular because it did not fit with what was popular before, though they do not realize much of the audience of moviegoers was young in the 1950s. As everyone knows, the movie was a huge success and studio executives acknowledged that they had thoroughly misjudged their audience. Somewhere during the "American Graffitti" drama series, television executives realized that they had in their vault a comedy pilot that looked a lot like "American Graffitti". They brought it back with the original cast, plus Henry Wrinkler in "The Fonz", renamed "Happy Days" and the rest is the story of television, which became one of the most popular shows of the 1970s. <br /> "Happy Days" now seems ridiculous. The characters are flat and cardboard, never being more or less than they are superficially. The problems they deal with are trivial. And their reactions seem stupid and even stupid. Nowadays, the character of the Fonz seems to be a caricature of, well, the Fonz. Was the idea a kind of parody of Marlon Brando's character in "The Wild One"? Looking at the series with fresh eyes, I think the producers really missed a good opportunity to present the 1950s with depth and realism that could still be fun and entertaining. Instead, the producers decided to laugh at a low price. It's definitely a show that has not stood the test of time. "American Graffitti" has many appearances of "Happy Days" but he had an advantage. There was an honesty about the characters and their problems. "Happy Days" took the appearance of "American Graffitti" but failed to take his heart.
