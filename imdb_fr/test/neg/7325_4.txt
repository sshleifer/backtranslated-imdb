I tried to like this movie. I really did. Kevin Bacon embodies a victim of cerebral palsy who befriends a 10-year-old girl whose fantasies of digging in China, flying in a balloon, etc. I admit to having traveled quickly through one of the scenes in which they share a friendship and simple pleasures while listening to soul music on the piano. Okay, three or four of these type scenes. Maybe nine or ten. Okay, okay, he was fourteen. But I sat down and looked at most of them.
