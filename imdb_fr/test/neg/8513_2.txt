In my opinion, this film is not good. It's hard for me to find a good thing to say about it, but I'd still like to explain, before concluding that it's just another bad movie. I decided to watch it because Costas Mandylor plays the main role and this is the main reason why I watched it until the end. I like action movies and I understand that such films are built on the action rather than the story. I know they do not go into detail about the credibility of the story and the events, but even that does not explain why some scenes simply because they do not have the sense of reality, look ridiculous. <br /> <br /> At first, the film seems quite promising: a solid and beautiful specialist and his partner not so difficult but smart and funny must do a job, which is a little different from what they are were waiting. The story takes place on a cruise ship. A disaster occurs, the ship is returned and only a few are left alive. During their struggle to survive, they must escape a shark, a professional killer and the rising waters. <br /> <br /> In addition, the film is quite violent. The main weapon (next to the disaster that has already swept away most passengers) is the gun, which is used successfully in many cases. Personally, I missed a man-to-man fight (or woman to woman if you prefer). Family fun? I do not think so. <br /> <br /> All in all, I think this film was shot in a hurry, with no real vision of what he was trying to say. Do the usual action movie tricks, with a bit of something called love, and without real meaning, it results in a bad movie.
