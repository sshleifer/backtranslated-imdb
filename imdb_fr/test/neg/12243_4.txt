This film is an absurd / parodic comedy, in the lines of The Airplane or Naked Gun, but it is not even close to this two, because it lacks originality and jokes a little smarter, rather than you start with the same old easy jokes. <br /> <br /> You can find some references to other films. First, I identified Dodgeball and Rocky, so you can have fun with that by trying to find out what a movie is. usurped. <br /> <br /> The film also gives you an occasional laugh, but nothing that can hurt you, so nothing really funny. <br /> <br /> I liked the IPod character in some ways (even though some of the jokes with him are part of the classic comedy 101). <br /> <br /> I think this movie (and most of the absurd / fictitious comedies) depends on the atmosphere you are in, so if you think you're laughing at any joke watch this movie. If you're in a serious mood, forget this (re) The Airplane watch instead, it'll definitely make you laugh
