The Giant Claw is in fierce competition with movies such as "Robot Monster" and "Plan 9 From Outer Space" for the worst movie of all time. A giant vulture at the fake attack attacks "Lionel Trains" in this completely unconscious film. The script is so bad that everything the characters say is ridiculous. It is not surprising that this film is a prime target in the movie "It Came From Hollywood", where this jewel is hammered for the line "A bird as big as a battleship", with an endless and joyful needle. The line appears relentlessly throughout the film, so there is no way to escape. Among the other science-fiction films of the 1950s, "The Beast of 20,000 Fathoms" and "The Earth Against Flying Saucers" reinforce the assaults of the vulture. At one point, the great vulture is responsible for a few deaths. The army therefore subjects the whole world to martial law and forbids anyone from leaving his home. Of course, the huge buzzard is primarily concerned with the pursuit of the stars of this classic, Jeff Morrow & Mara Corday, wherever they are. Yet the director is so lame that he does not even foresee some pictures of the pretty Mara in a decent dress and black heels to relieve some of the boredom of this zero-star thriller. This is the second time this blunder is done. In 'Tarantula', Mara Corday struts in a warm dress throughout the film, but is relegated to the pants, 'The Giant Scorpion'. The budget of this film should not exceed thirty or forty thousand dollars and I doubt that Morrow or Corday had more than three thousand dollars to do it. Looks like everything was shot in someone's garage.
