Watching this kind of film, I realized that I did not like them very much. Caged Women is yet another film about women in prison, which looks like the rest of the genre. the plot is completely abandoned in favor of simply showing naked women. Now, do not get me wrong; I like naked women, but I also like that there is a kind of common thread to go to nudity, and since this film only has the basic theme "women are in prison" which crosses it (as well as the essential escape, of course), I got a little bored before the end. The film is good because there is hardly a time when women wear clothes, but that's about the only positive thing. The director (and screenwriter, ha ha) Erwin C. Dietrich likes to show close-ups of the body of a naked woman, but it's never very erotic. The director has been the producer of several trash films, including some directed by Jess Franco. In my opinion, he should stick to production because his writing skills are nonexistent and he does not seem to know how to film a sex scene. This type of material is pretty dry most of the time, but I think Franco could have done more. Overall, this might be enough for people who are really interested in these things; but I can not say that I appreciated.
