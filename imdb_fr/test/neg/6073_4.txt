Yes, I realize that half a dozen other critics have called this movie "Amadeus Copy", but we can not say enough. The scenes seemed to have been raised directly from Milos Forman's script with only superficial changes. You can expect to see: <br /> <br /> -The arrogant scene of the maestro ("I am the voice of God, everything else does not make sense!") <br /> <br /> -The maestro make fun of the mediocre work of the composer (with raspberry and simulated flatulence, as in Amadeus) <br /> <br /> - The dialogue of the mediocre composer with god ("Why do you instill me with music while preventing me from composing? ") <br /> <br /> - The musical dictation of the deathbed scene (" Common time, start with the violins ... cough cough ") <br /> < br /> - and the list is long ... <br /> The problem is even worse. Not only have these scenes been copied shamelessly, but they are not even very well done. Jeepers, if you want to rip an original, you should at least try to improve it in your own creative way. <br /> <br /> Without waiting, there is even worse. It is the fact that the director has tried to transform the story of Mozart into Beethoven's story. People, Beethoven was not a vulgar vulgar slob as this movie describes. Moreover, Beethoven was not a talkative idiot who was taking advice from his 23-year-old music copyist. Unfortunately, such films are responsible for the history of the massacre. <br /> <br /> And something else, Beethoven (in real life) has never called it the "Moonlight Sonata" as it does in the movie. This name was given by a confused critic a few years after BEETHOVEN died, and unfortunately he stayed. But the original title of Beethoven was "Almost a Fantasia". <br /> <br /> AND ANOTHER THING, when Beethoven (in the film) shouts "B-flat! B-flat! B-flat!" and hit the note on the piano, it hits a white key! <br /> <br /> AND ANOTHER THINGGG !!! Beethoven (in real life) was completely deaf for several years before composing his 9th symphony. This film shows him as having barely a minor handicap (say "what?" All other lines, just enough to be boring). <br /> <br /> AAAND !! ANNNOTHER !!! THINGGGG ... !! American accents ...! Oh, whatever. Leave it alone. I have already lost enough time on this subject. Go see "Amadeus" again. Then, if you want to see an interesting biopic about Beethoven's life, see "Immortal Beloved" that takes poetic liberties, but at least these are interesting ideas. Finally, if you want to see something clearer, take a look at "Impromptu", a film about Chopin. But apart from these three, I have never seen a beautiful tribute to a classical composer.
