As a child of the 1980s, I grew up with many educational and diversion programs (or both), and I continue to learn a lot from them now that I admire the wisdom of those who have worked there. After learning that Sesame Street, to name only the best example, was not the only one responsible for me being able to read at an adult level before I could walk, it only increased the level of disgust I felt not only towards the Lyon company and its product. but also those who defend them. As if I had faith in those we assign to protect ourselves or our children, the fact that Barney & Friends continues to pollute our airwaves more than a decade later is a discredit not only for the FCC, the US trade and its creators. it is a discredit for all humanity. In a world where I can be harassed without recourse from police, social services and child protection agencies just because I was born different from the one in power, broadcasters are allowed to send this intrusion at home without question, you must ask badly with people. <br /> <br /> You see, in a world where we expect to behave as adults and to be accountable, what we say to our sons and daughters is important because it will often have consequences well after we are gone. Not only are our attempts to make our children more normal, more alike, more thinking, potentially devastating, but what we are teaching them to become normal also has an important role to play. So the question is what Barney teaches our children to be normal. Apart from lessons such as we are not good if we do not have good feelings, or that someone will change the rules to make us happy when we are up to it, other shocking things that are shown to us in Barney's show include Barney who abuses children. The issue of kidnappings and child abuse is a major problem in our society ever since we try to pretend that this is not the case, but this would be one of the most inappropriate ways of presenting the subject . <Br/> <br /> So far I have only mentioned the emotionally inappropriate and damaging lessons that Barney himself presents. The problem is that the children shown in the show. I use the word children vaguely here, the age range shown ranging from three to fourteen. Yet, no difference in the emotional response manifests itself at both extremes. 14-year-olds respond to Barney and his proposed situations as five-year-olds. The experts in autism in children and adolescents consider in particular that it is an extremely odious thing to expose children. Autistic adults who are facing increasing problems because their needs are not only satisfied but also totally ignored tend to look at this and want to do the kind of things with Barney that would make fourteen year olds cry. As irreverent and sick as programs aimed at the market for older children, like what you can not do on TV, they invade everyone Barney by showing that not only do different ages react to the same thing in different ways, Different persons. <br /> <br /> In response to mdmireles1295, I must say that I hope that, heck, they will not have children. Whenever I see a parent showing this behavior to their child, it gives me a compelling need to report it to the police for abuse. And I speak as a man whose whole education has been dominated by abuse. They may sing about ways, love, care or share, but the examples they show are not only unbalanced to the point of being the opposite of education, they are as unrealistic as they become dangerous, as The Light Triton has already pointed out. . The kind of lessons kids learn from Barney is that people do not vary, feelings must be removed at all costs and the rules are totally arbitrary. Compared to the lessons that variation is what makes the world go around and that even the most bitter feelings have a purpose that television taught me while I was a boy, it's always staggering to see that the authorities have not yet taken the trouble to remove this junk from the government. air. If a parent did their child what Barney does around the world, he would face criminal charges. <br /> <br /> That's why I gave Barney my favorite rating of two out of ten that I give to all waste without any redemption. value. In a world of adults who know how to respond properly to their children, this has no place.
