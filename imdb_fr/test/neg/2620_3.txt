Now, it's a movie I do not really like. It's one of the most boring horror movies of the '90s, mainly because it starts slowly and centers in a boring atmosphere. The settings are not even attractive to the eyes and are not used for the purposes of the film. <br /> <br /> The puppets really look cheesy, not very good as in the Puppet Master 80 movies. What did they do to our favorite toys ?! <br /> <br /> The story is lame, not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets. There are no death scenes like in the previous movies and the f / x are terrible. <br /> <br /> I fell asleep the first time I looked at it, so I can recommend it to insomniacs.
