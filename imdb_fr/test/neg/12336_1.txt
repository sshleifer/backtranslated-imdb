We see who are the good guys. The union. And who are the bad guys, a rich man who steals the election and his spoiled son. The filmmaker forces us to see the good of the bad. All the characters hate the bad guys, so watching the movie can help us hate the bad guys. This is the worst type of film: manipulative and childish. The plot is centered on a cop that is between good and evil, and he's stuck in this ugly film. It's boring and useless. The narration of the star Keach is really bad. And a good actor, Don Stroud, overworked, playing the guy no one likes, and we are not supposed to like. It takes a long time for this boredom to take off and for the title to assert itself; then when he takes off, he hangs a minute later. Boring. One of the worst films ever made.
