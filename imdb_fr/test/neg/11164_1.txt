I do not know what was worse, the dope of the viewer, or the stars of this movie that look like dopes. Do I believe that this woman raised this child for seven years and never noticed that it was a little dark? Do I have to believe that her mother, her father and her husband never said: hmmm, this child looks a little dark? Do I believe, when the courts ordered the mother to consult the records of the adoptive parents, that Lisa Hartman had this moving look, when she told her mother, Christopher was half black! What! Was it really, do you think so? So, not only did the grandmother and grandfather look stupid and stupid never to talk about it, but I guess we were supposed to look surprised and say ... hmmmmm omg he's half black! Movie totally stupid, almost embarrassing even to watch that!
