This movie is so boring that I spent half of its time on IMDb while it was open in another tab of Netflix to try to find out if anyone thought it was one of the most boring movies , heavy and whimsical ever seen. A warning: I could not finish it, so these are my impressions until the minute 54. <br /> <br /> Keira Knightly saves a lot of time on the screen. As others have mentioned, her mother wrote the script (perhaps during a kind of drug-induced stupor where inanities and emotionless statements about emotions seemed to be an interesting dialogue) and it seems that the film is a showcase for Knightly. Oops! Although I agree that she is charming (with her teeth not exposed ... her barred teeth cause me anxiety and fear), I found her reactions forced and poorly synchronized. As in, William or Dylan does something cute ... pause ... HA HAHAHA with dimples and a mischievous arm stroke. Like a minute too late. What? And she can not match the intensity of Cillian Murphy. He manages to look at her and seem fascinated by her and fall in love with her when she seems totally disconnected, almost as if she is interacting with a mirror. It must be torture, acting in front of someone who does not deliver the same level of energy as you. Know what else is torture? This film. <br /> <br /> Knightly looks gorgeous on his cyclic tour "I've got buckles with 1940's pins and a hot dress, watch me sing!" shots, but what's the point? Is she an altar or an actress? When she talks, it's weird, "Ooow, Mehster Deelan, what are you going to do?" This puzzles me because the accent is so mixed and not authentic, yet so thick sometimes that I have no idea what she is saying (or maybe even falling asleep). If no one knows who Vera was or who cared, or so few knew, was it so important to give him that so-called Welsh accent? It distracts from all the rest of the action (I'm joking). <br /> <br /> This film looks like someone who dreamed of a movie, maybe after reading Dylan Thomas a bit before going to bed. But instead of adapting to the waking world, it was: "This dream was so interesting, man" and tried to reproduce it. Then someone warned, "Your script needs work, nothing happens that feeds a story or creates a need" and the author is everything, "But that's how I get it dreaming! " It's like the disjointed fantasy of a child, one of those wild and sinuous sons they spin to get your attention. And then William went to war and then Vera had a baby and then a blonde chick drank too much and there were so many planes and earrings and everyone had ruby ​​red lips and ... <br /> <br /> Regarding the character of Dylan Thomas (so bland it's all I can call him), why did not he have lines in this clumsy biopic? He's just drinking beer, smoking cigarettes and riding with Sienna Miller, who's so wild and artistic that she'll be doing the show in public! Get out of here, crazy poets! (I realize she's not a poet, but she and Thomas are like that nauseating unit of crazy people having gone through crazy times, like a lukewarm sailor and Lula from Wild at Heart.) Someone asks in the table of messages if they should buy this movie. I say do it. Leave it on your shelf and use it only as a weapon to narcotize children, elderly people or people waiting for the house. <br /> <br /> PS to Murphy's character ... when someone asks you if you were "in shit **", you can say yes, because your war scenes seem to have been shot in a dump .
