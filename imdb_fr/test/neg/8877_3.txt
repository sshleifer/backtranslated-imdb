I will also recommend placing this one in the pile "skip it". The concept was slightly excited when my fiance praised it and a little more excited when I saw that Milos Forman had realized it. Oh, well ..... <br /> <br /> The costumes were beautiful, certainly, but typical. None of them said they came from any place, with the exception of the period costume department of all major Hollywood studios. There was no distinction between Spanish, British and French - everyone was dressed as at the court of Versailles. The sets did not evoke the qualities of the sets - the prison did not feel like a prison, the mansions did not feel like mansions, and the outdoor scenes gave the impression that they had been filmed on the stage. background of the film. were probably practical places. <br /> <br /> The score was considerably lower than it could have been. I've been a fan of movie music since I was young, noticing, appreciating, and collecting, what I mean more than John Williams. My fiancée is a professional film composer, a laureate who has seen her work performed at the Lincoln Center and a rising star in the industry. At the beginning of the film, we had high hopes, and everything started well. It quickly deteriorated and in several places - including the place of release of prisoners - it reached a level of annoyance. In fact, I reached the remote control to turn down the volume. The score was never more than the most obvious choice for composing a specific stage tone and did not fit into the "soul" of the film (think of Babel's music and you'll get an idea of ​​what I mean). He never reached the size he wanted, but neither did the film. <br /> <br /> Javier Bardem, as talented as he was, was awful. For the first part of the film, his mannerisms are so disturbing that he takes over his performance. During the second half, all that was his character in the first half disappeared, replaced by a set of completely different boring mannerisms, and he looked like the love child of Keith Richards and Lestat of Stuart Townshend. I never had the idea that he cared about the role (that is, the character cared about his life and his actions), or that the character was ever drawn by writers like something other than an opportunist who, for whatever reason, changes his mind and decides to stick to his principles at the end. <br /> <br /> Natalie Portman was very good, although her performance lacked shades of increasing madness between her release from prison and Lorenzo's taking in the end. that I would have needed to call it really an effective performance. Alicia's character was never defined enough to discern, and if there was not a superb makeup for her eyes and cheeks, someone who would see the beginning of the film and the end did not would not realize that they were not the same character. The prosthetic teeth were horrible, unnatural and embarrassing, but Ms. Portman was not affected. <br /> <br /> Stellan Skarsgård was good like Goya. Not worthy of the Oscars, but useful and generally credible. I do not know much about Goya's life or deafness, but the film seemed to be considered a biographical information requirement, rather than anything that was used in the film. I'm sure this has affected Goya's life far more than just needing an interpreter, but you would never know by looking at it. For the record, words and sounds can only be correctly interpreted about 30% of the time by lip reading. <br /> <br /> Do not get me into Randy Quaid's game. At least he was a minor character. <br /> <br /> The script reads like one of the books "Choose your own adventure" that I read when I was a child: at several moments of the film, several results are possible, and none of the actions that have preceded does not determine with certainty how the film actually unfolds. Ironically, the film is also predictable, especially its meager attempts to lift the atmosphere through small pieces of humor. The joke on the hands? It may be because I paint (not very well) as a hobby and I know what a PITA's hands are for drawing / painting, but I saw the joke coming one kilometer away and the recovery in the second period. Had the baby ever arrived for any reason other than being taken by Ines? There could have been a line of bread crumbs as well. <br /> <br /> Disappointing. <br /> <br /> (note: this review is a copy of an answer I gave to a thread of the forum)
