I had never heard of ONE DARK NIGHT until someone recently mentioned it on a horror bulletin board. As I read it, I started to get interested because of Meg Tilly's involvement and recognition that it was a first concert for Friday. THE 13TH VI: JASON LIVES director Tom McLoughlin. Unfortunately, it's sad to say, it's nothing special. The premise is familiar: a schoolgirl must survive until morning in an old mausoleum to join a sorority. This girl is a young Meg Tilly, in the role of Julie, who wants to prove to her loving and caring boyfriend, Steve (David Mason Daniels), that she can make up her former girlfriend, Carol's sorority (Robin Evans ), regardless of the tactics used. she shoots to see her fail. Carol's group is accompanied by Kitty (Leslie Speights), still with a toothbrush in her mouth, and Leslie (Elizabeth Daily) who does not really want to cause such problems to Julie. While Leslie insists on leaving Julie alone while she stays in the mausoleum, Carol and Kitty plan to torment the poor girl. Meanwhile, Steve is looking for her while Julie, Carol, and Kitty are having trouble they could not imagine. The corpse of a recently sick psychic vampire, whose telekinesis was dangerously powerful, will seek to empty them of their bodies. life force. The only person who can help these girls is the girl of the deceased, Olivia (Melissa Newman), endowed with the same psychic power as him. <br /> <br /> I think what many will find exciting is the unusual harm girls are threatening in the mausoleum, it's certainly different from what you normally see in the slashers who were out at that time . Like the character of Adam West (he was Olivia's cynical husband who thought his father's power was ridiculous), I had a hard time adapting to the plot. , and I have never found anything in the film that excites me. . For me, the mausoleum has never been so scary (it does not reach the same kind of strange quality captured by PHANTASM) and the corpses that are used to attack the girls are ridiculously unconvincing (.. there is a big scene where the face of the corpse disappears). I have a soft spot for low-budget films from this period, but I have never really found any reason to get involved when you have that unsavory corpse of undead who pulls electric lightning from his eyes, which causes other bodies to break free from their crypts obey their master. It's too silly to take seriously. Carol is your typical blonde bitch who wants to punish a nice girl who comes out with an old flame. Steve is your typical American boyfriend, handsome and tender, who becomes the hero who seeks to save his daughter from all the sinister forces that are at stake. To compensate the low-budget director, McLoughlin tries all the tricks of the book to move the public, using a series of ooga-booga effects such as corpses chasing young girls, shaking chairs, closing doors and levitating objects. by themselves. The film obviously has its fans, and I'm happy to have had the chance to see it, but I was a little disappointed that ONE DARK NIGHT was not a horror as I hoped. Adam West plays a very small role as a worried husband, hoping that his wife will manage to get out of his depression with a father who has nothing to do with her. Melissa Newman is Olivia, a troubled woman, grateful that she must stop her father once and for all, otherwise he would continue to indulge in life. Donald Hotton is Dockstader, an associate of Olivia's father who informs him of what he was. Tilly's performance did not particularly shock me (... she was practically scared most of the time), but she would have the opportunity to prove herself from now on. This will undoubtedly be of interest to those who watched it at that time. For reasons of nostalgia, this could appeal to movie fans of that time.
