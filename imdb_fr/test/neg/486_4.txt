Okul "The School" is the result of a new trend of Turkish cinema. After using the same stories over and over again, the directors of the new generation finally came up with different ideas. Of course, that does not mean that they are all great. I think Okul is one of them. It's supposed to be a scary movie, but it's not. He does not succeed either to scare. So what is it? The actors are so average, especially that Deniz Akkaya is rather annoying with the role of the teacher. I'm sure it could have been better if we tried harder. Maybe focus on a topic such as making it scary or conversely. But the directors missed the target this time around. ** out of *****
