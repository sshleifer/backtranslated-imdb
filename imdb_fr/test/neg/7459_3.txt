Before seeing this film, the 1998 version was my only experience of this Dickens story. I did not like this movie, but this adaptation of 1974 continues in a particularly tedious way. <br /> <br /> The actors do not shine, the main couple michael york and sarah miles are wooden lockers. The only character that's really interesting to me is Anthony Quayle's smart shredders. <br /> <br /> The so-called plot is ridiculous, but the story itself is fantastic. it's a real lesson on how your distorted values ​​and obsessional principles can destroy you. live with an open mind and do not worry about what others say, you are what you are, if others can not stand it, **** 'em. pip was told that very early, but he did not listen. <br /> <br /> The girl adopted by the strange old lady reminded me a little of the old story of kaspar hauser, not at the same level horrible, but the way she shaped the child to create the l Executing her personal vendetta against the opposite sex as a whole, she thought she was deceiving her. Pip's childhood did not seem much better. the end did not seem to fit the rest of the style of the story. the sets seemed cheap, and as far as imdb is concerned, I'm not surprised to see that it was a TV movie (which I did not even know when I borrowed it from the library). <br /> <br /> learn. so many good movies, so little time. that's why the critics are here. so YOU ​​do not have to waste time with this kind of movies. <br /> <br /> 3/10
