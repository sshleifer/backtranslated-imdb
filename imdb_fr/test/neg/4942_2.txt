For a thriller to arouse fear, suspense or any emotion, the story must be credible. This film has nothing credible nor realistic. The protagonists have several opportunities to escape or reverse the situation, but they manage to ruin everything. The antagonists supposed to plan this and customize their shuttle specifically to trap people left many improvised weapons in reserve. There is actually a scene where the "smart" girl has a gun on the head of the senior villain and decides to reprimand him instead of pulling the trigger. It was a completely predictable, brainless thriller. Each character was a dimension. The "victims" were the sheep without brains and brains that deserved to be slaughtered. Is there anyone on this planet who can write an intelligent thriller?
