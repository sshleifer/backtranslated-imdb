This unbelievably boring and funny movie made me think that Chaplin was the real Hitler, because only a being as evil as himself could torture people with this tripe. I saw this remastered film, which only aggravated the suffering inflicted by this atrocity. This film is nothing more than a pathetic and repetitive film that, instead of inducing two hours of laughter, induces two hours of suicidal impulses. After the first 10 minutes, I began to wish that the gas begins to filter the speakers of the theater. <br /> <br /> If I could give him a zero out of ten, I would do it with pleasure. To avoid at all costs!
