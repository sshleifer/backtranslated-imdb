technically, this film would have had everything: decent actors, a beautiful landscape, no obvious sign of lack of budget, a celebrity like richard attenborough. the summary of the plot seemed equally promising, suggesting a satire of stupid bureaucracy and ordinary people avoiding it. <br /> <br /> However, he never holds the road. the plot is just too illogical. throughout the movie, not one person does one sensible thing. Crazy politicians, ridiculous soldiers, dead villagers, everything goes from one incredible situation to another. what they do is meaningless in a context other than the current scene. <br /> <br /> Of course, this kind of film must be absurd and exaggerated. However, he is also supposed to have at least one example to emphasize the madness behind splitting a city in the middle. in fact, there are (at least) two attempts that unfortunately fail: the main character, who does not seem to have any idea of ​​what is happening to him, and the "writer", who sometimes repeats jokes about life funny by a public composed only of 12 year olds. <br /> <br /> What I most impressed is that the movie tries to be funny all the time, but did not make me laugh once. I have seen several bad "funny" movies, but so far, each of them had at least 2 or 3 good laughs. So, in this sense, "puckoon" is really remarkable. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a good movie with a comparable plot, take a look at "brazil". Do not waste your time on "puckoon".
