In the near future, a dark stranger walks into a city in southern America battling zombies. Settling in with a group of friendly locals, our stranger learns the harsh realities of urban life. There are two groups of people; the upper classes who live safely behind the concrete walls of the city being provided, at the right price, by the state police. Then there are our friendly-looking inhabitants. These people of the lower class live alongside zombies. The only means of livelihood is to exchange with the police goods for which they feed during the day in exchange for cans. Our stranger discovers why his world is infested with zombies. A new diet pill that suppresses the desire for carbohydrates was the basis. The desire of the human race to lose weight has caused the collapse of society as we know it. These pills have increased the desire for protein, that is meat, even poodle. However, there was another serious side effect, after death, people were resuscitated with an even stronger thirst for protein, namely human flesh. <br /> <br /> With what I feel like an imaginative introduction, I felt that many were realizing this inventive material film. What better way to explain the cause of the zombie race than by a contemporary idea of ​​people's desire to make sacrifices to change their bodies without the arduous work of the gym? However, the imagination of this film quickly stopped after this exhibition. This film falls into the old trap of "I can not imagine what the world will be when society collapses". When you watch this film, you do not escape into a different world, any more than when you watch Planet of the Apes (original), Alien, Mad Max or Texas Chain Saw (original). In this film, the alternative society is defined by people with dyed hair in orange and green. Face painting and leather jackets charity store. There is no hardness about life in this alternative society, just healthy faces and masked zombies. The films should allow you to escape and not to remind you that you have to empty your wardrobe and bring your old clothes to the charity shop. <br /> <br /> Forget some of the pitiful actors, or too much makeup zombies. This film fails because it is too polite, too friendly and too predictable. I watch movies like this since the early eighties. If you're going to make a film of this nature, I suggest you watch films like Dawn of the Dead, Threads or Fulci's Zombie to see and feel that desperation in a devastated society.
