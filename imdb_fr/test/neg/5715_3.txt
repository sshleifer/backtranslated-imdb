It's nice to see Julie Andrews trying a very dramatic role here - something she had not done in a long time - but her character Judith (wise, they did not try to make her look like "Judy") has a refined style. Andrews decrees "adult" as any other actress would interpret coldly. This is a surprisingly bland drama taking place in Barbados and involving Omar Sharif (not the liveliest of the main men - not even in 1974!) Hoping to make Andrews a spy while also guiding her so slowly into the room proverbial bedtime. An unforgettable outing has some value for the camp: credits resembling James Bond at first are hordes. As for Julie: she is calm and contemplative, but that does not do much for the public, nor for the film. Blake Edwards sets the tone for the funeral. * from ****
