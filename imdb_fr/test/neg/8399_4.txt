... now please, continue because it annoys me. <br /> <br /> Seriously, the man behind shiny pieces such as "My Own Private Idaho" and "To Die For" (and other less brilliant films, ie the useless remake from "Psycho") began an experimental phase with "Gerry", which culminated with "Elephant" which provoked reflection. "Last Days" had some interesting aspects, but it was very uneven, while "Paranoid Park", his new film, also has beautiful 15 year olds walking around ... and not much else. Some interesting references to Fellini (the soundtrack includes some great pieces by Nino Rota) and the iconic cinematography of the legendary Christopher Doyle ("In the Mood for Love") are the highlights, but the film is simply too artistic and wacky and meaningless for his own destiny. We had a much better story, and Paranoid Park does not bring anything new. I do not see anything artist to see Gabe Nevins' excessive blows in underwear or in the shower. Or when Nevins and Taylor Momsen (the 13-year-old daughter of "How the Grinch Stole Christmas"), who plays her girlfriend cheerleader, make love for the first time, just because she felt obligated to do it and after it's over, she calls her friend to tell her how amazing it was (and you can tell, from Nevins' face, how traumatic it was). Everyone knows that they start earlier and earlier today, movies like "Thirteen" and even "Elephant" itself (which shows how much their spirit is lost in general, and not just in of sexuality) have made it a better representation. Gus tries to be minimalist and artistic, but the end result is boring and uninteresting. His next project, "Milk," a biopic about Harvey Milk with Sean Penn, should, hopefully, bring back the good old Gus, because, frankly, this obsession for minor children is almost ... scary. 4.5 / 10.
