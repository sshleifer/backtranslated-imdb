A four-and-a-half hour O'Neill play is reduced to a little less than two, and much of that time is devoted to actors with fixed expressions on their faces as they read their characters' thoughts. in voiceover. It may work on stage, but he looks hilarious in this soap opera adaptation, which gently peddles the bad behavior of his heroine and never explains why she so captivated so many men. Norma Shearer and Alexander Kirkland, too ridiculous, are outclassed by naturalist Clark Gable - he is the only one to make the frozen facial technique work. It gets even more funny when the son of Shearer and Gable, a damn moppet, makes the shtick with a frozen face. There's also Frank Morgan's brother Ralph, a non-successful suitor who used to talk about "poor Charlie!" again and again, and a young Robert Young and Maureen O'Sullivan. By the time they show up, the voice-overs have been largely abandoned and played like a ripe soap, with a sentimental fadeout that actually plays "Silver Threads Among the Gold" as background music. The direction of Robert Leonard is heavy and it shows little ability to master hyperactive actors. It's certainly fun - nothing like that, unless you count Groucho's satirical parody in "Animal Crackers" or an old Mad Magazine satire that made Shirley Booth's sitcom "Hazel" out of "Strange Interlude". But it's not good.
