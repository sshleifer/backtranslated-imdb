First, there may be a SPOILER here because I do not know what it means to give too much information. My subject line says it all, but surely people will want to know WHY it's so stupid. <br /> <br /> First of all, this movie follows a group of Yuppies who go to a sports match in Chicago, but end up taking the wrong exit and liquidation in the ghetto. Scary, huh? Well, first of all, Emilio is leading everyone in one of the most crowded RV / Winnebago in the world, trapped with satellite dishes and shit like that. So, these guys are going to a sports match (I forget which, although probably the Bulls or the White Sox since they are near the scary ghetto), yet they can not even get on the highway without having an on-board visual control center that would shame ESPN. Yet they are smart enough to make a living from what to pay, but they love the sport so much that they do not even know what to do to get to the game they love so much. <br /> <br /> I gave up the movie in the half hour that followed, but the reasons were many. They end up in the ghetto, but their main danger for their existence is DENIS LEARY. A white guy. I am not racist, but come. In reality, this film was trying to become an urban nightmare: Denis Leary would not try to kill Emilio Estevez, he would make a trip to get the fuck of Dodge himself !!! /> <br /> It's easily one of the most stupid movies ever created, although I do not know much about the rest of world cinema. If MST3K was still on, they would surely have dedicated an episode to this one.
