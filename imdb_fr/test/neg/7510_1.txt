I work at the video store that rents this video to Lexington and I must say that it should never have been done. I even know some of the people who worked on it who regret it. Bad effects, horror game, bad scenario in particular. I swear that the dialogue would not have succeeded for the original PSX Resident Evil; it's so bad. If you want to know how not to make a movie, watch this movie to learn a thing or two. Otherwise, do not waste your time. And even the director knows that it sucks because he keeps coming to try to make us sell the film. No sir. I watched two-thirds of the horror section, which is even lower than Plan 9 of outer space. Even Ed Eood would have said, "Nope, it's too stupid, even for me."
