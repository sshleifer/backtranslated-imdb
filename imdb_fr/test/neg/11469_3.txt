As a big fan of most modern fantasy movies, I was really looking forward to seeing that. I did not know the character well, although after hearing general stories about the style of comics and good reviews of the film, I thought I should be a real treat ... <br /> < When the main character started talking about her hoarse forced voice, I could tell right away that I was not going to like this movie. I found the story weak and predictable, the acting of mediocre actors, the effects were very good for a low-budget movie, but I did not do anything for the plot as a whole. <br /> <br /> Maybe as a comic book fan, you might get something more from this, otherwise I suggest you jump and not waste your movie ticket in this boring adventure .
