This film starts at A and never really reaches B. Its title promises much more than what the film offers. It is superficial and filled with the usual clich√©s of a story in which a guy questions his sexuality. People are nice, even the obligatory type flamboyant. The leader (Kevin McKidd) exaggerates to the extent that he has a reason to act. Simon Callow, who plays in a hilarious sequel, is always worth watching and is by far the only reason to stay with the movie. However, garbage on the "meditations" of his group of men or anything becomes extremely boring in the short term. They seem to have been thrown into the delicate blend of the film in an ill-advised effort to vary the parameter and the uninterrupted inaction. The same comment applies to a really strange and unconvincing camping trip. Do not worry about the break of the band so you can have a snack. Let the thing run; you will not miss anything. The character of Hugo Weaving is superfluous. He appears in a sequence with one of the smaller sons and does not even meet the rest of the whole. The result of this sequence is not explained, and Hugo's real estate transactions have nothing to do with history. The film is a total disappointment in the end because there is no resolution. The thing simply disappears and we are sent to the closing credits. It is an interlude without structure.
