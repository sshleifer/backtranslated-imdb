This film had to look at the moment when it was launched at the stage of development and to have a Redgrave and a Jacobi on board had to excite the men of money. All I can say is that they obviously did not have anything that week. Jacobi solves the problem in a way that only Jacobi can do and I thought it seemed more to the actor that he had parodied into his role of cameo in Frasier a few years ago. Vinnie Jones is not quite naughty, he is clearly irrelevant as a leader. He's really very friendly and, if it was a pilot project for a television series, he might have been noticed. However, the scipt and the work of the camera were appalling. Why would this "journalist" and a Met press officer never work together ever be explained? This certainly can not be because of the sexual chemistry, of which there is none. There is nothing wrong with a ridiculous and wacky plot that you can call original, but the whole thing is so artificial that the two stories just do not make sense. It was as if two stories were confusingly edited into one story to make up for two hours. Go watch the paint dry for a few hours. Your life will be more fulfilled than watching this garbage
