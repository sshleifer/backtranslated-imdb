It is very sad to see someone of the caliber of George C Scott in a low-budget thriller that would have been better if the original novel had been written by Graham Greene and directed by a somewhat more experienced person in the genre. DO NOT MENTION A BETTER CINEMATOGRAPH. There are so many missed opportunities with the landscape and the carnival simply ignored, rather than captured, to place the film firmly in the exotic setting of the novel. <br /> <br /> Elsewhere in the comments of viewers of this site, a very nifty observer complained about the variety of diabolically evil accents in this film. Ever since I saw George C Scott in the role of Rochester in Jane Eyre, I prayed that he would never accept a role that forced him to assume a British accent. From time to time, he could possibly pass for a British or a South African to the very British sound, obviously played by an American actor. I can handle Meryl Streep's extraordinarily hard-working (both British and Australian) accents - at least she understands everything, even if, at every word, she demands that we marvel at her talent. Well, I'm sorry that Mr. Scott is not Meryl Streep and it just destroys the illusion - as if Michele Yeoh was speaking an atrocious Mandarin with a strong Singaporean accent in Crouching Tiger, etc. than what we see on CSI. Except that he is always very beautiful and more or less thin in this film. He is the Harrison Ford of television. Same old expressions for every emotion, every situation. No, on reflection, Ford has two - perplexed / pained and happy. I have never seen a smile on Mr. CSI!
