This film was bad and the films about how some students stay in a house to get money by renovating it and then discover that the house contains a woman, Deamon, and that there is a portal to hell. In this film, there are loads of silly scenes like at the beginning of the movie how they clean the house and they start dancing on a nasty song and some of the Demons at the end of the movie are just guys in bad costumes who are trying to make scary sounds and There are good scenes gore like when the teacher is tearing his face. I only rented this movie because I'm a big fan of horror movies and it's only worth watching if you're a fan of horror movies. The role in this movie really bad, the only good Actor is Roy Scheider of the great movie Jaws and, overall, this movie has lots of flaws and my rating is 4 out of 10.
