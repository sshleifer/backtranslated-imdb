Put this movie out of its misery and burn the negatives. What do I say? The whole movie was negative. Fortunately, only a few would find this film the least attractive. This is what the vast majority of Americans would call too much sex and violence. It will probably be broadcast one day on a non-paying cable channel, just for the shock, but after removing the nakedness (most of the violence will remain), you will only have 45 minutes of really bad acts, interspersed with 45 minutes. advertising. There are too many hungry actors in Hollywood.
