Meteor of Pete. I saw this called "authentic" and a "jewel". I caught this movie on a Saturday afternoon. I wish it were not the case. <br /> <br /> Apparently, this was Mike Myers' first dramatic role. Unfortunately, it had to be this movie. The first thing you'll notice about Pete's Meteor is the complete lack of intrigue. Or rather, a bunch of little subplots that are not really connected and go nowhere. The young orphan Mickey lives with his younger brother and sister with their grandmother. A meteorite lands in their garden and is finally collected by a scientist named Hugh. Despite the title of the film, Mickey is the one who claims the meteor, and the "scenario" actually has very little to do with the meteor, in any form whatsoever. From there, several other characters and subplots are introduced. But as I said before, they are not going anywhere. <br /> <br /> Things go very fast from the family movie to the black thriller, when Pete (Mike Myers) is introduced and begins to play a role. Micky blames him for the death of his parents, even though we are never really told what happened or why. Hugh has love problems because his girlfriend can not overcome his cosmic fascination. And Pete's drug-related past begins catching up with him and temporarily drives his own girlfriend and the rest of the cast into the mix when shady characters start trying to kill him. This seems to be the main plot, until you realize that it has no role to play until half of the film, giving the impression that everything else is useless. Hugh's daughter problems, Mickey's bad behavior, the meteor ... what does the Earth have to do with that? Not a lot. <br /> <br /> The "plot" is disjoint and half of it is useless. But a good cast of characters can save him, right? Keyword: good. The majority of the characters are terribly inconceivable characters, most of whom you would like to see die horribly. At least I know I would do it. Despite the title, Mickey seems to be the main character, which is a very bad move once you see him in action. He is one of the worst children I've seen in a movie, with a very bad attitude problem. He "borrows" a car, harasses and talks to Hugh (an adult) for taking the meteor, actually tries to burn the man's house when he can not make his way and even tries to stab Pete with a knife. You would think that a child like this is on his way to prison. Unfortunately, one of the worst aspects of this film is that Mickey never gets what happens to her. I do not know when you are supposed to sympathize with his character, because he is still a dirty kid. He is the playmaker of his brother and sister, so they end predictably and eventually take the back seat and follow what he does. Surprisingly, they were so repulsed that I do not even remember their names. They might as well not even be there. <br /> <br /> Their grandmother is pretty much alcoholic limit. She tends to be as mean to Hugh as Mickey and likes to push people out of her house and throw them bad looks by not throwing her drink in bottles of alcohol and not drinking. Pretty ridiculous when you know that she is supposed to take care of three children. Her problems with alcohol are never really solved, although she collapses from time to time in the movie. <br /> <br /> Hugh is one of the few likeable characters in the film, but it's only because he's the punching bag for the majority of characters and takes their mess without making it. The children treat him maliciously, but he always comes back and tries to teach them and do beautiful things with them. He has a taxi driver girlfriend who seems to take every aspect of his scientific life as a personal offense, trying to leave him several times in the film when he comes out of his cosmic jargon or does something to prove that he is not. exactly on the same wavelength as the rest of the characters (thankfully). <br /> <br /> Then there's Mike Myers in the role of Pete. Pete, despite the film's only solid objective and plot, is extremely underused and plays no role until the second half. It is unfortunate that Myers found himself stuck in such a position for a dramatic role. Even when Pete starts to go on screen, half of it is just Myers running through dark alleyways and hiding in nooks and crannies. And even if it was the only real point of this film, when its line of intrigue closes the film, it is a strange and unsatisfactory conclusion that makes all the characters laugh on a good note with a quick and strange explanation behind the title of the movie makes you wonder if they are playing in the movie you just watched. <br /> <br /> The only thing that deserves to be seen in Pete's meteor is Mike Myers' role in Pete, and that's if you can wander this rambling mess long enough without touching another being human because of the extremely improbable characters and the non-existent plot. No sir, I did not like this one at all.
