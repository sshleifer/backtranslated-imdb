I am very attached to Waverly Hills and I first watched Death Tunnel The Movie. It could not have been much worse. Then I heard that the documentary was coming out and I was moved thinking that if it was a documentary, it would be more serious and not produce horrible special effects. These are the same guys who made the documentary and ruined it with effects instead of producing it as is. Waverly Hills does not need help to produce its wacky effects, but that's not what it is. Visits cost $ 20.00 per person and $ 100.00 for an 8-hour night survey per person, minimum group of 10 people for a night survey. Visits must be arranged in advance. Great place for the ghost hunter!
