Let's not kid ourselves, okay? We all know that this film was made because of the success of the "Grumpy Old Men" movies. Unlike these, however, this parody has no humor and has very little heart. <br /> <br /> Gloria DeHaven is the only bright light to see. It breaks my heart that she finally had the chance to show her talents to a new generation of moviegoers, to end up in such a hell. There was a touching scene in which she was represented by a person she was in love with. His great performance was the only quality played in "Out To Sea". Everyone just goes to motions. 2/10
