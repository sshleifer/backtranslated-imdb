End of Days is one of the worst big-budget action movies I've ever seen. A confused direction, a sinuous script loaded with lame dialogs and gaping holes, a fast MTV style edition, and mediocre behavior. <br /> <br /> This does not mean that the end of time is not being watched. The film kept me interested because I found Ah-nuld's latest action movie ridiculously stupid to be so stupid and stupid when it comes to logic. Without logic, the film dies faster, which is why Fin of Days deserved a huge drop in reception at the box office in its second week after opening in the United States. <br /> <br /> I will not go into details. Explaining why End of Days violates the law of film logic, but there are several problems with this movie: <br /> <br /> (SPOILER) <br /> <br /> After the devil's exit, the Restaurant explodes without any trace as to how it did it. No slapping finger, no gas of altered energy to light the fire, nothing. How could this happen? <br /> <br /> Arnold and his fierce acolyte, Kevin Pollack, magically named "Christine York" after examining the expression "Christ in New York" engraved on the body of a victim, manages the database on the computer and, on the viola, Christine York, the only person with exactly the same name in New York! Beyond my suspension of disbelief. <br /> <br /> How did the characters who came into contact with Arnold's character turn against him later in the film? I burst out laughing when I recognized that the mother-in-law who had become a bad-mother was the same actress who had played the role of nanny in William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet. His ironic transition from this film to this one was absolutely hilarious, if you can imagine. <br /> <br /> All these explosions and these shots without great strength. What did you expect in the Arnold Schwarzenegger vehicle? <br /> <br /> The devil took away the body of a man made of flesh and blood, but he is invisible to bullets and explosions by healing through this body. Logically, this is impossible. <br /> <br /> While the Devil demonstrates the illusion in the apartment, Arnold's character collides with the solid Christmas tree that is supposed to be an illusion and * that falls on it physically </ i>. The devil is able to hit the person's brain and twist a victim's head 180 degrees, but he can not kill Arnold's character as he always wants. <br /> <br /> How the object of desire of the devil is dead and why the evil New Yorkers run after Arnold and the object of desire has never been explained. <br /> <br /> In the sequence that constitutes Speed's scam, the object of the desire of Arnold and the devil manages to escape the metro. train wreckage by the short distance to the unharmed interior. This is beyond my comprehension, because strength would be enough to violently throw Arnold and the object of desire around him and die from his mortal wounds a few seconds after his impact. <br /> <br /> Arnold is brutally beaten by the Devil-sanctioned crowd and placed on the cross to hang on the wall, but the devil has forgotten to take the time and opportunity to kill him for convenience. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the movie, after the devil has taken over a man's body, suddenly Arnold is his bodyguard ??? Is this a coincidence or just an example of bad editing? <br /> <br /> Arnold's story about grumpy dialogue in particularly ludicrous scenes like "YOU ARE A CHOIRBOY ABOUT ME!" are the ideal forage for MST3K, just as Eraser did with the classic line "You are the luggage!". <br /> <br /> The whole theory about 666/1999 is downright ridiculous. The same goes for the pseudo-religious babble on Christian theology involving the end of the world at midnight and the fanatical killers who know the location of the object of desire of the devil. <br /> <br /> (END SPOILERS) <br /> <br /> It is extremely ironic that End of Days uses scattered blasphemies that abuse the deity while describing Christian theories. The level of violence in the film is excessive and horrible and is therefore useless to serve the plot. The excessive indulgence of the director is a factor here. He surely does not know how to make a coherent action movie with the Air Force One writer who was only forced to write the script for a large sum of money. <br /> <br /> Therefore, End of Days is a worthless movie, with no redeeming value, apart from the country character - Arnold's worst since Hercules in New York. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
