Rented 3 bad movies to watch with my friends in my dorm. <br /> <br /> Leprechaun 4, Jack Frost and The Prey. <br /> <br /> I picked up Jack and Lep 4 because they are well known bad movies that I have never seen. <br /> <br /> I chose this movie because it matched the guide "How to find a bad movie" on badmovies.org, no real description, no picture of the film on the screen back, and I had never heard of this, had to be a winner :) <br /> <br /> (SPOILERS, but this movie is so horrible that it does not matter: P) <br /> <br /> > This is a REAL bad movie, Lep 4 and Jack Frost are idiots, it's silly despite the best efforts of the cast and the team. <br /> <br /> This "movie" begins a bit like the Evil Dead, even the actors are similar and have the same style of dress. Unlike Evil Dead, he never wins speed. For a movie "slasher" is pretty bland, in 80 minutes, 6 people are killed, but they are so far apart that it quickly becomes boring. <br /> <br /> The director has thrown a lot of boring shots on animals hunting, obviously to go with the whole theme of "Prey" but they do not do anything to advance the story and are quite boring. The gore is horrible. All these additional plans had to compensate for the lack of script and history. <br /> <br /> The last 5 minutes of the film are shot mainly in slow motion, which is another way to add some length to the situation. The "climax" is such a joke, it's hard to laugh so badly. The back of the box says "The end will shock you and haunt you." Yes, it will shock you that someone can put such a "plot plot" on the movie and "haunt" you because you will not believe you paid to watch that shit. <br /> <br /> Also the slogan is "It's not human, and it has an ax!" A person is killed with an ax in the whole movie and he is off the screen. <br /> <br /> A real 1 in 10. I LOVE laughing at bad movies, but this one is so bad that it lacks even camper qualities. No bad movie night is in competition without a real character building movie: P
