This film with beautiful production values ​​presents secrets and how friends use. Henry May Long is a well-played, dimly lit, turn-of-the-century play about a friendship between a fatally ill man and an indebted melancholy drug addict. The Talky show dramas are not my cup of tea, and all the tears are running out. Recommended if you like the independent, slyly intellectual and slow-paced features of Merchant Ivory. <br /> <br /> I suspected that the main characters were in love, but their connection was so intimate that it did not really have the emotional impact of "Brokeback Mountain". There are good writings with a scene that explains how to disappear in life, but it's really a dark and depressing film.
