Boring film. Poor land. Poor actors. The film takes place in a room supposed to be in Morocco but in reality in an American city! The "Arab terrorists" are the patriots, the blond patriot is the "Arab terrorist" ... DAMN! <br /> <br /> There is, however, something positive in this film (that's why the score is 2 out of 10). The director makes the ridiculous stereotype of terrorism that the media feed us every day ridiculous: terrorists are Americans (or Westerners if you prefer). <br /> <br /> The film is divided into two parts. The first part of the film concerns the Dutchman's journey (15 seconds), while the second part concerns the stay in the incredible dark brown room (1 hour and more). <br /> <br /> The Dutch will return the favor In Morocco, the money is paid to a "charitable organization", comes out of the plain, takes the bus and finds himself kidnapped in a dark brown room. He is kidnapped by another guy who was shot after saying "They will not shoot us". The Dutch survivor is forced to play chess with an Arab guy who has been like Morpheus for so long that you will also learn to play chess! In the end, the Dutchman reveals his plot not because he cut off four fingers, but because he is deceived by such a lame game that you should watch the movie! <br /> <br /> Well when you're tired I can not sleep
