It could have been a good TV movie, but flashbacks do not make it easy to understand the movie. As they give the viewer some information on the way (the movie will continue), I wondered why she had never said or mentioned that in the beginning. So the whole track would probably not have been necessary. <br /> <br /> At the end of the movie, you understand why she shot and, of course, she is not guilty. Too bad the producer / director uses flashbacks this way, but on the other hand, the film would not have been worth it. <br /> <br /> Nice movie for a rainy day, big bag of chips to kill at night.
