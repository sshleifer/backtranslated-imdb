I love the TPB but it was a lame episode. I did not have the same impression as the series or the film. It looks like it was set up in a hurry. I did not like it at all. The so-called game was terrible. The actors appeared as if they knew it was an episode of stealing money to get to the market quickly. I hope we will not have Easter special next door, because that will be all for me. The writing of this episode was definitely the worst of Mike Clattenburg in the history of this series. The management left a lot to be desired and I felt almost bad for the actors and the team of this feeble attempt for a Christmas special. As I said, I love BTP, but this one goes in the trash.
