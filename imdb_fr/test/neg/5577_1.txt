I carefully checked if there was another movie named like this, and there is none! But I really do not think we've all seen the same movie! There is no way ! How can you vote more than "1" for this movie ?! The idea of ​​this film, let's say it's acceptable. Oh, and the game of Dan Gordon (Chris) is very good. But these are the only two acceptable things in this project. The others are ... awful? This is a very delicate word to describe the other actors' play, the staging, the "special" effects (so to speak), even the way the team was shooting! I do not even like how cameramen moved to record scenes! It may be the most miserable movie I have ever seen. I really do not remember a movie lower than this one ... Maybe there is one, but ... I do not think so ... Eh, what is it's done ... it's the movie and it's too late for anyone to change anything. I voted "1", but my realistic vote begins with a "-" (minus) before ....
