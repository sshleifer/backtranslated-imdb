Inglourious Basterds is the worst Tarantino movie he has ever made. It's full of its usual ingredient, that is catchy dialogue, brutal and sudden violence, but everything feels already-seen. The staging is typical of Tarantino and nothing seems new. It's almost as if he had just copied his only masterpiece, Pulp Fiction. <br /> <br /> Inglourious Basterds is nothing new or exciting, it's a war drama that is neither funny nor brilliant like Pulp Fiction. Basterds is supposed to be Tarantino's tribute to Leone's Spaghetti western, but seems to be poorly articulated and misplaced, particularly because of the continued use of big captions and its balanced audience.
