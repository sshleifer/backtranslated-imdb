I am a dance teacher and I was eager to see some good dance routines in this movie. How sad to have been subjected to such a painful experience. <br /> <br /> I had big problems with Jennifer Beals and her character. I found Alex extremely repulsive. Beals' face is so young, sweet and innocent, which is very incongruous with Alex's very disturbing observance, especially in this disgusting restaurant scene. She also has the tantrums of a toddler. It is very hard to believe that Nick would always come back to such a sullen teenager after his frequent delusions, especially after opening the door of a moving car and handing him a stiletto, preferring instead to walk home - in the middle. from the road - with only one shoe !!! And what about his idiotic behavior after the night at ballet. In fact, all the romance was very disturbing: a 30-year-old man was looking for a 16-year-old girl. Yuck. <br /> <br /> Regarding the dance, I'm afraid that this style of the 80s is totally old-fashioned. What was this television dance sequence in the club? Who was supposed to dance? I did not even know if it was a woman or a man in a trail! And even this famous final sequence is quite disappointing, especially given the context of an audition for a ballet company. The shots taken by the camera of its jump ruin its effect, because you can not see what it does. And what was she doing when she went past each of the signs pointing at them? And as many other comments have pointed out, she would NEVER enter a ballet company because of this audition - maybe that's why they do not say in the end whether she's successful or not, closing is the fact vanquished his fear in the end. Among the 'Flashdancers', I thought the best sequence belonged to Cynthia Rhodes (Penny in Dirty Dancing). You could see she was a real dancer and her acrobatics were very impressive. This is of course if you can go beyond his costume and appalling makeup. <br /> <br /> There were two good things in this movie - the ballet dancers stretching when Alex goes for the first time asking for an audition - they look so beautiful and elegant, and at least that helps highlight the difference between her current and former dancer's career. The other good scene was the break dancing in the street. I also loved the skater's parents, they were funny. <br /> <br /> Some other random points - who was Hanna and how did Alex get to know her? What was an 18-year-old living on his own in a converted warehouse? How does she afford to buy this pretty bar and all the furniture? Where was his family? Was this scene in the "naked" club really necessary? The person who wrote in his comment that it was a Disney movie needs his head examined. And anyway, what happened to the skater? <br /> <br /> Many people said that the film was poor but they liked the message: do not give up hope, keep trying and your dreams will come true. Look rather "The little mermaid".
