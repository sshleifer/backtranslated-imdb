Ho Hum. Just another movie with Steven Seagal claiming to be a spiritual being, but break his head and kill as if nothing had happened. Of course, he finally justifies it by donating the money to an orphanage. Let the world be lost and we will ignore it if you take care of a little girl. Jeesh! This time he is associated with Ice Cool (Anthony 'Treach' Criss). I have to have someone on whom to put all those lines that make people cringe, man, and there are a lot of them. The dialogue is pure shit. <br /> <br /> They attack the bad guys Nick Mancuso and Kevin Tighe, two people born to play crazy. <br /> <br /> He squeezes Mari Morrow and impresses his star soap Sarah Buxton. How cute. <br /> <br /> I guess if you have to have a little excitement for July Force, that may be enough. If nothing else will help you graduate in Seagalology.
