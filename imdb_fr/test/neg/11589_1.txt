Screenwriter and director Jay Andrews, aka Jim Wynorski, presents more of his typical film with a decent distribution threatened by grade Z reptiles in "Komodo Vs. Cobra", generic as a "Mysterious Island" scam. Jurassic Park "as you can imagine.The main problem with this predictable thread on the monsters that dine on humanity is the incredibly fake special effects.The cobra and komodo are hilarious horrible.However, the graphic designers make a integrating the monsters with their victims, even if this is not at all credible Clearly, "Komodo Vs. Cobra" had a budget so low that virtually everything that is not human in its appearance is also false Everyone's coming out of it This epic monster with cheese is set on a remote island where the US Army is conducting extremely secret DNA tests on animals, resulting in the gigantic Komodos and cobra thriving on this island paradise. At the beginning of the action, the main scientist is engulfed by a cobra who loves to swim, after which we are introduced to a group of 'Greenpeace' as protesters around the world. and Planetology organizer Jerry Ryan (Ryan McTavish of "Hellbent"), pays the captain of the charter boat Jim Stoddard (Michael Pare of CBS-TV's "Houston Knights") with the promise of five more if he will take them to this forbidden island. Meanwhile, the US military suspects that something is wrong on the island, so they send their own team of men who are eaten by oversized predators. Our heroes meet the last remaining scientist on the island, Dr. Susan Richardson (Michelle Borth of "Wonderland"), daughter of the scientist responsible for this senseless science project, who tells them the army is going to target Destruction Island. The title match between the two invading predators comes in the last quarter of an hour after our heroes, who have been constantly crushed by monsters, find a helicopter and take off in time before the army sprays the enemy. 'island. There is no tension, suspense, or anything of interest in this inferior creature feature. The best thing about this musician is the soundtrack of composer Chuck Cirino; "Komodo Vs. Cobra" gives an impression of epic. Generally, Jay Andrews writes and directs tolerable maneuvers, but he is well below his standards. Sexy women are better at surviving than guys. In one scene, our heroic group guided a river and we do not have the chance to see wet t-shirts. Drat! There is nothing like a dialogue or memorable relationships in this neighborhood. I think the military do too much greeting when they come together to conspire. Let's hope that Michael Par√© gets a good salary from this trash. The end when one of the scientists adopts the characteristics of a lizard comes strictly afterwards. It's not so bad that it's good, it's just bad.
