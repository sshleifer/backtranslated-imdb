If you have a lot of time to spare and the DVD has been given to you free of charge by your friend, you still need a lot of courage to watch this film that has neither a good script nor a lot of humor. <br /> <br /> On the acting front, Imran is frozen in time / acting, Tushar Kapoor was slightly better than Imran in this movie Paresh Rawal was good in comedy was usual. <br /> <br /> The story revolves around a university campus where Imran is a bad boy. Tushar is good, they claim to be the opposite of the respective nature and the story continues ..... <br /> <br /> Look at it only if you have nothing to do and the film is broadcast on your local cable TV.
