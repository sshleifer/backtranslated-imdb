- Contains 1 spoiler, the market with: ***** - <br /> <br /> Not showing up as a remake of "The Interview", Five Fingers is in reality. Alas, apart from perhaps the physical torture, it never adds anything to the accomplishment of his predecessor in terms of suspense, conspiracy or performance. In fact, Five Fingers never reaches his level. <br /> <br /> What I found particularly painful to watch was not the torture itself, but the way Martijn (Ryan Philippe) acted. For me, it seemed to me that Philip was trying to give a correct accent to his accent, which made his performance very amateur, which slowed even the performance of a Colm Meaney, otherwise great. Phillipe's accent, far from anything close to the Dutch language, is more like Eastern Europe. <br /> <br /> Besides the role of Philippi (which, to my surprise, went from mediocre to decent at the end), there is also the problem of flashbacks with the rundown Dutch landscape. (If these scenes had taken place in Switzerland, the actors would have eaten cheese on top of a mountain with endless pastures and grazing cows wearing expensive watches). Landscape aside, the way these backtracks pushed the plot did not help at all. It made the service like fries at the wheel and made the suspense flatter. <br /> <br /> It's true that the movie became more enjoyable as Phillipe's role improved, but I could not help but be bothered from time to time by scenes too implausible. Example: <br /> <br /> ************ Start spoiler <br /> <br /> At some point (after days), Philippe is almost tenderly washed by the terrorist . This only to be followed by the raw cut of another finger. Why wash the guy if he is tortured? And the cut of this last finger seemed to serve only the title of this film anyway, I mean, he practically begged to have cut it. No Sens ?? <br /> <br /> ************ End of the spoiler <br /> <br /> What finally kept me watching is the performance of Fishburn who once again turned out to be a brilliant actor, but who also had the best part of the script to work. <br /> <br /> Overall, it is better to see "The Interview" with this other icon of the matrix: Hugo Weaving. And when you do, I'm sure you will not find this review so unpleasant. <br /> <br /> 3.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> "The Interview", 1998 www.imdb.com/ title / tt0120714 /
