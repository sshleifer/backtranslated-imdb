I bought the DVD of this movie because I am a fan of William Devane and I was really disappointed with "A Christmas Visitor". The story of the movie is so boring and slow in development that you simply want to turn off your TV or DVD player after about half of it. The dialogues are really bad and belong to a daily soap opera but not to a TV movie. William Devane was doing well and doing very well, but he did a lot better in other films and projects. Meredith Baxter was awful and could not really bring the warm-hearted mother to the audience. Instead, she played very well and was no better than a middle-aged actress. I absolutely can not recommend this movie. Save your time and money for this one.
