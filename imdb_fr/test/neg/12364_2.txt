My expectations were great after watching the trailer. They were even higher when I saw that the film had the same director as Independence Day and godzilla. The special effects of independence day were much better than in this film. All the movie, I was waiting for the spiders to show up. The rest of the story was really boring. And when the spiders came, they had a very amateur look, as if the special effects came from a movie made in the 60s. I did not watch the whole movie. When it was played for about an hour, I turned off my DVD player. I watch 3 movies almost every night and I never left a movie, even though it was boring. The only thing that is good in this movie is the pretty sheriff :) That's why I voted 2 instead of 1 :) So do not go to see this one, but you should rent and rent instead Starship Troopers. .
