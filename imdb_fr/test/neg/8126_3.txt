The Realty TV team is responsible for covering a hockey team from a small town in a high school who falls on a serial killer wearing a black mask and a hoodie. Numerous interviews in which team members (and some of the residents of White Plains where most of the film takes place) talk to each other, to White Plains, their current situations and showbiz of their life. The storyline is often acidic, cynical and caustic, and Killer Movie essentially makes fun of reality shows, featuring a troupe of characters that could be found in The Real World. If this parcel is attractive to you, knock yourself out. I found the characters boring and satire is the old hat. Outside the cast, Paul Wesley, the director who needs a big break, meeting more than he could not negotiate, Jake Tanner, is a nice guy, very friendly and tolerant of the bullshit he has to face, account prima donna and the immature people around him who often only cause migraines. His producer Lee (Cyia Batten) is particularly boring, his tyrant constantly barking at everyone, his poisoned attitude arousing much tension. history as a forehead to exploit the tragedy happening in White Plains. Those who know Kaley Cuoco know that she has perfected the pampered princess, which she understood, because it is the only role we have ever seen her most of the time. As Blanca, she polarizes the way she asks for attention, making the most of her celebrity status, creating a lot of friction, becoming a source of frustration and having her mouth dirty (Cuoco may have played the role just so that she could escape from her usual televised sitcom roles, blaspheming unrestricted escape) Cuoco, as well as the entire cast, presents Killer Movie as a pleasure to the eyes, but it's hard to find a character you would not want to see broken chopper. Jason London is the sound and equipment guy, a real monster with a sour attitude, who often torments others with his unpleasant comments that are not called. We are witnessing many personality clashes, observing how these self-absorbed Hollywood guys in the casting shoot at each other. The identity of the killer should not surprise anyone, it's pretty obvious. Some minor issues, but most acts of violence take place off screen. Despite some docile lesbianism, even that is not satisfactory. Leighton Meester appears in the film as a cute victim. The director / scriptwriter Jeff Fisher is a rather attractive cast, but I can not distinguish it from the countless slashers that have been stocking the shelves of horror for about ten years since SCREAM. Although I have never liked any of Cuoco's characters, I never tire of watching her, but she must ultimately create a role that does not consist of gamification, sufficient arrogance, moans and complaints.
