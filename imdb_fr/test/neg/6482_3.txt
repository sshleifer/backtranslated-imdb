In the remake of the 1942 movie "The Major and the Minor", Jerry Lewis plays a leading role in the role originally played by Ginger Rogers, but unfortunately, this anemic release misses much more than Ginger. Lewis tries to pass for a child while climbing a train. he succeeds, but the disappointment leads to a series of comical and romantic confusions. Sidney Sheldon adapted the screenplay by adding musical moments to Dean Martin (who still plays in his second banana stable) and a secondary plot of jewel-turning (which is terrible). Diana Lynn, who played the cunning teenager in the original movie, embodies Lewis's love here. She's cute; Jerry is not. * 1/2 of ****
