There is somewhere here establishing a decent routine history at SF. It is thwarted by several factors. First of all, the actor is just awful. Even the competent actors are awful. The dialogue is wooden and on stilts. The plot is progressing as expected. It looks less like a finished film than a movie of actors. Extremely disappointing.
