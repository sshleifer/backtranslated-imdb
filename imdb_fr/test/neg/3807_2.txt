Bart Crosbie (Pat O'Brien), a delinquent journalist, blackmails Heinz Webber (George Colouris), the gang leader, to get the money to pay for a rescue operation for his son. In return, he agrees to go for the murder of his editor, whom the gang has killed to prevent the publication of an incriminating story about them. <br /> <br /> A typical photo depicting the line of misery Terence Fisher, who will do so a few months later, will become one of Britain's leading horror film directors at Hammer Studio. The scenario is far-fetched and Tommy Steele (a guitar in hand), teen idol, was chosen to sing a bad rock and roll number called "The Rebel" in a caf√© serving as a legitimate facade to the activities of the gang.
