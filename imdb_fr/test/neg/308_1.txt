This should be considered one of the worst movies of all time. The film was presented at the Italian Film Festival in Melbourne, Australia. After the screening, not only did I want to get my money back, but also recover the lost 1.5 hours of my life. I have a very wide tolerance for the indulgences of certain European films, but it's one of those films that is selected for festivals based on the reputation of the filmmaker alone. This film is proof that if such selections can satisfy the filmmaker's and the jury's egos, there is absolutely no joy for the audience. There is no character development, the plot is a distorted mess, the style does not make sense, the selection of shots is appalling and the editing is worse. At the end of the first reel, you will wonder if you have entered the wrong cinema, and at the end of the third reel, you will beg to be put out of your suffering. This film is an abomination.
