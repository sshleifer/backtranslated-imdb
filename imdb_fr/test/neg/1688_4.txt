It's a painfully slow story about the last days of 1999, when a strange illness breaks out and ... I stop worrying about it. This is supposed to be about two people who live superimposed in an apartment complex. There is a leak and a plumber has made a hole in the floor of the man so that you can see in the woman's apartment. Moreover, given that a crisis is underway, a large part of the dialogue is in fact a news item ... <br /> <br /> That sounds promising? <br /> <br /> Not really. <br /> <br /> I became distracted and started doing something else that is deadly in a subtitled movie. Basically, I started not looking anymore, which made the events even more surreal when I looked up. <br /> <br /> It can work for you, but not for me.
