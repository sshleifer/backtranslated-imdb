Wow, what racist and profane piece of celluloid garbage, and what an insult to the great western genre. <br /> <br /> Exploitive? Sex scenes abound, profanity abounds, violence and gore abound ..... all that gives such a reputation to modern films, especially among those who prefer the movies of the classical era. This is the kind of speech that gives old ammunition against today's movies. <br /> <br /> In a way, I simply can not imagine bathing scenes of naked men in Randolph Scott's or Gene Autrey's films. I can not imagine either having heard "motherf --- uh!" exclaimed here and there. I sincerely doubt that this word exists even more than 100 years ago. Yet, the keyword is so prevalent here that one might think you're looking at a story centered on today's urban areas, not the old west of the 1800s. <br /> <br /> A prejudice? Well, if all the white characters were good guys and every black person was the mean, brutal bad guy? Do you think someone could complain about a racist movie? Back home, we do not hear an outcry when the opposite - as shown in this film - is presented in hundreds of theaters across the country? <br /> <br /> Mario Van Peeples wrote, directed and played the lead role in this bomb. Remember that name. Apparently he is the "Ed Wood" of today's filmmakers. Even Spike Lee would not be so racist. You can not be worse than this movie.
