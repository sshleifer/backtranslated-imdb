Ring! Ring! Hot-line of horror directors, how can we help you? Uh, yeah, Pronto! I mean hello, my name is Rugge ?? Uh, call me by my initials R.D! OK Mr. R.D, what seems to be the problem? Well, the reviews of my latest movie "Dial: Help" were all negative and harsh and, frankly, I have the impression that my career has seen better days. Okay, Mr. R.D, and why do you think that's the case? Well, I gained a well-earned fame and cult status through my controversial and shocking movie about wild cannibal tribes devouring a film crew and another film about relentless thugs terrorizing the rich in a house on the edge. of the park, for which I borrowed the idea from Wes Craven, but "Dial: Help" turns on ?? be mistaken?? it does not matter! No no, Mr. R.D, go ahead and tell me what the movie is about. It is a spiritually owned phone line that tracks down a sexy model and kills the people around it. Oh I see. This premise seems indeed a little silly and not as petrifying as cannibals or rapists, but I suppose there are deeper themes in your film, is not it? Oh yes, of course ?? What did you mean by that? Well, is not the symbolism of the telephone line another type of terror? Or maybe everything is happening in your heroine's mind? Uh no ?? This is a phone that goes crazy and kills people with a cord, vibrations, electricity or even ordinary coins. Interesting, Mr. R.D, but how do you explain all this supernatural stuff to the viewer at the end of the movie? You see, I thought that the mysterious phone plot that was coming out slowly would not be so important or relevant, so I focused on handling all the phone gimmicks I could think of. Telephone gadgets? What do you mean? You know, like the wind blowing in the horn, the tones that penetrate the mind, and the turntables catapulting through the air! Very original, Mr. R.D., but not really horrible and as an experienced director, you must know that in the end, people expect a reasonable clarification of all these events. Oh, but there is! All this has to do with a negative energy and not liberated, if I remember correctly! It's a little vague, I admit. Hmm ?? I see. Oh, as we always say, a good movie is based on more than just the story. Have you at least incorporated some of your usual trademarks into the movie, so that your fans will at least recognize your style? I tried! Lord knows I tried, but the murders and the bloodshed do not just shock anyone! It's a shame, Mr. R.D, but what about sex? Everyone loves a lot of slure and nudity in their horror movies and you yourself said that the movie was centered on a sexy model in jeopardy! Yes, but ?? But what, Mr. R.D? Well, to tell you the truth, we kind of promoted "Dial: Help" as an erotic thriller with revealing clich√©s of Charlotte Lewis on the cover, but in reality there is no sex in the movie and Charlotte even refused to go topless. Mr. R.D! Now, I'm really disappointed, it's just ripping off people and luring them with false promises! I know, I know, and I'm ashamed, but I just wanted everyone to praise "Dial: Help" and love it! Well, finally, I can comfort you by saying that every major director is entitled to a few wrong decisions without affecting his career immediately, but be more careful next time and do some research first, okay, sir R & D? I go; Thank you! You are welcome. Tell me, do you already have ideas for future films? Yes, in fact, yes! I was thinking of doing a Giallo with a murderous washing machine! Does not it seem fascinating? Hello? Hello?
