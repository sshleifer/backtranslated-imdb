Thank God, I did not use heavy machinery, it could have been a disaster even worse. The shots were slow and very repetitive. Different scenes, same shots, middle shot, middle shot, middle shot, sum. The scenario was rather empty. William Hurt was the worst. Where did he get that stupid accent? Random shots of landscapes, just to include them, do not add much. There were more Arbor plans traveling in his car than anything else. The management did not really take us to any of the scenes and it did not make me feel any of the characters either. I would have evaluated it to zero if IMDb had the option. Excellent sedative if you can not sleep. There are 2 hours of my life that I will never come back.
