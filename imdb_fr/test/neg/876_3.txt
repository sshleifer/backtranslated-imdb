An isolated, disconnected middle-class housewife in the middle class seeking a divorce seeks solace to reflect on her immediate future. In a kind of bed and breakfast by the sea (well, literally in the sea), it underlies a kind of strange reason for the owner. Enter alone, arrogant Richard Gere. He is a plastic surgeon. He is the only guest from the inn to the sea. Diane Lane is the lonely housewife. You will never guess that these two fall immediately in love. A tropical storm makes them true lovers. <br /> <br /> The secondary intrigues of this melodrama make little sense. The places, the photography are going well. Gere remains one of the most overestimated actors of cinema and does not disappoint. Mrs. Lane must have needed the money, but she's calling gracefully.
