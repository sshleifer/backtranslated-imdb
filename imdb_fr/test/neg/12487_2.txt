A remake can be successful. An adaptation can be successful. It does not matter if it's a remake or an adaptation. <br /> <br /> A good movie is a good movie and a bad movie is a bad movie, whatever. <br /> <br /> Sarkar, I'm afraid this is a very bad movie. First of all, it's not enough to give the characters a dangerous or macho look so they do not create an aura about them. <br /> <br /> What was so brilliant about Nagre (the character of Amitabh Bacchan) that we should have been in aura of his "power" and what shows the "benevolence" of character? Nothing. <br /> <br /> This comment was made by a commentator and Amitabh kept giving facial expressions. Now, Amitabh can give brilliant facial expressions, but why would it have meaning if there was no story or story that would accompany it? <br /> <br /> There was no adequate characterization of the characters who also worked under "sarkar". . Just because a man had glasses, why should we assume he is wise? ] The flow of the film was generally dull because scenes of the godfather were created (like the policeman slapping Abhishek Bacchan), the elder brother being killed by Abhishek (as Fredo was killed by order of Pacino), we sought too much to be packed. the film with too little history and depth to go with it. That was the problem. <br /> <br /> If you try to pack 3 hours of complex details like a godfather in 2 hours and with as few dialogues, you'll get a cricket show of a game, never. have the full impact of watching a full match will do.
