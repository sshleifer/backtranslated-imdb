This film begins with a pedestrian installation before moving on to standard suspense action, where a clerk continues to hit well-trained secret service men, etc. <br /> <br /> I can not say that the acting is bad - there were good faces "surprised" by Hamilton and Sheen - but then I really would not have to. <br /> <br /> A laughable final has at least made me laugh at my pains. Nevertheless, if my life was shining in front of my eyes, I think I would fast forward those 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> I have to write two extra lines of text for this thing to be published. Yes, very strong suit that the chandelier wears. I promised myself never to watch such a bad movie.
