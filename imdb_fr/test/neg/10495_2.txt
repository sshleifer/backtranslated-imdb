I give this movie Vampire Assassins a "2" mainly because he had neither sex nor nudity. Other than that, I do not know why it was done. It was more like a training exercise to make a film with a very limited budget. The characters Derek and Slovak were the best actors. They were followed closely by the "biker-guy" with the Pleather pants and the silver belt. He was fine too. Most of the film was shot in a distribution warehouse. If you're tired of watching the Kung-Fu stunts, you can check out Scott's facial tissue, Windex and other cleaning products. You will have plenty of time to do it, believe me. I almost started making a list. The dialogues and cascades of kung-fu were extremely slow. They spoke slowly, fought slowly, and so on. I do not know why. At least with the extra-slow delivery of the lines of actors, you could hear everything very clearly. I try to find good things to say about this movie. We looked all the way to the end to see if we had improved, but that was not the case. We could never decide if the actors really knew the martial arts or simply acted as if they knew the martial arts. You can look at yourself and decide. My favorite line was something like (a vampire who talks :) "What are you looking at?" other man responding: "your bad dental work."
