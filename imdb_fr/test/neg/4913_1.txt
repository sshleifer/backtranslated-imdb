Aksar is a horrible movie. The scenario, the story, the acting are simply laughable. Dino Morea plays a man who pays Emraan Hashmi to seduce his wife. Yes, it's as ridiculous as it sounds. Morea and Hashmi offer incredibly and unsurprising acting. Udita Goswami plays the aggressive, capricious and angry wife. She is beautiful but has no talent as an actress. The film has a song called "Jhalak Diklaja" which is composed and sung by Himesh Reshammiya. I have never understood the hype around this song because I have never found it particularly good, even if it is catchy. The film is supposed to be a thriller but instead it looks like a comic book thanks to the terrible direction and writing. Avoid this cheapo at all costs.
