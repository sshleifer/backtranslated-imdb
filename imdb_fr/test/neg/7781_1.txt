If you want a total loss of time, because removing your teddy from your belly button, cleaning your wax from your ears or sealing your tiling is your idea of ​​the carnival thrill ride, you will not want to miss it. <To begin, forget the VHS coverage. NO body in this film looks as attractive (ie the Indian girl). Someone commented that whoever asked for the blanket was not the same girl and I agree. The cover is the most exciting thing about this movie. <br /> <br /> To put this in perspective, I bought this VHS for 99 cents at K-Mart and three minutes, no, 40 seconds after the movie started, I knew I had been scammed. <br /> <br /> I ended up looking because 1) I still paid 99 cents and 2) there might be a hair of chance, a scene in this turkey was better than a pinched bread. <br /> <br /> There was none. <br /> <br /> Good grief, Fonda. I know you had trouble finding roles when you did that, but it's below you.
