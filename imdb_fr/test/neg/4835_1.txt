What shocks me the most in the critics who follow this film is the mention of "originality". This film does not contain AN innovative element. If, by "originality", you refer to pathetic action scenes, overactivity, gluttony in violence, direct humor and a scenario that goes beyond intellectual convictions. Then, the Swedish film can do without "originality". <br /> <br /> It's mysterious for me to know how Röse and Karlsson can get along to "play" this bad excuse. And how can you see Eva Röse after shooting this movie at the TV breakfast, the promotion disappoints me. <br /> <br /> This film contains no story, the scenario is illogical, stiff and last but not least, just bad. These two young directors made a pretty disgusting boy fantasy containing violence, cartoons and trivial psychological portraits. I would not be surprised if the scene where DD masturbated in the kitchen around a microwave dinner really described the daily life of these two pervading cinematic nerds posing as directors. <br /> <br /> I would not show this movie to my worst enemy.
