I am an Indian resident in the United States. Why India continues, as a dumb animal, to imitate all that America is beyond me !! The main problems of the film are not so much the absurd plot as the silly comedy. This film has a lot of sex, it is moving, that women dress like trumpets in the street and that many curses have no place on television. <br /> <br /> To the producers and directors of this film I have the following message: you continue to weaken the strong family values ​​of our country by making this kind of nonsense. You continue to let young women think that it is normal to have a feminist attitude and not to have morals. You continue to make dance songs that belong to the lowest clubs and bars for adults. I am ashamed to be an Indian after watching movies like this one. <br /> <br /> In 2003, the US government suggested that the best way to destroy Iran was to send miniskirts there. It is not necessary to do this for India. We are going to destroy ourselves with rubbish like this.
