Well, I'll tell the truth and admit that I was forced, as part of my studies in history, to watch this film, then write a film review as part of my note. <br /> <br /> Even though I had watched film alone, at my discretion, I found it extremely boring and absurd. The style is dated beyond his years and the acting is a joke. Rather than using dialogue, they exchange dazzling glances, or sometimes in the air. For me, such acting does not convey more emotion and, after seeing Ivan's extremely close face for the hundredth time, I prayed for the film to end. <br /> <br /> What is most disappointing is how bad Ivan's character is. This man was mean, the murderous thugs of his bodyguard and his cowardly character. For me, the film was just a piece of Stalinist propaganda, imprecise and boring.
