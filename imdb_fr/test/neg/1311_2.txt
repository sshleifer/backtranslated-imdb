Topical? Certainly. Entertainment? Probably - but only after removing a piece of common sense from the viewer. Reality? Only to the extent that it was done on this planet. <br /> <br /> How thousands of people would have been killed following a 5 meter wall of water in a city littered with buildings 25 meters tall is beyond me. Carlyle's phrase to the effect "How could anyone survive this?" when the picture shows forests of buildings with several floors above the water is completely laughable. In addition, if a person enters an area (under water) where a bottle of air is not enough (that is to say, it will die), why not use the simple way of to take more than one bottle? Obviously, the author thinks that people under stress can not count beyond one (a cylinder, a floor). <br /> <br /> Rather than watching this movie, you would be more informed and entertained by throwing away the DVD and reading the pricing information on the cellophane outer packaging. <br /> <br /> Pitoyable, really pitiful, and a terrible waste of talent on the screen. <br /> <br /> Regarding the sexist propaganda suggesting that only women can see through the problems to illuminate the solutions to be implemented by the men consumable: even more PC 'tosh'. It is no wonder that First Blood, Delta Force members, Navy Seals and other such films with little or no merit are still worthy of attention as long as this obviously political hold is peddled.
