I tried to give this show a chance, but it really does not suit me. Although the performances are good, the writing is not. The two older half-siblings, Derek and Casey, are also boring; I feel like we're supposed to be with Casey, since she's the protagonist, but I do not find her friendly at all. Parents are continually described as totally helpless. The three youngest children are the most watchable things in the series; Lizzie and Edwin are adorable, and Marti is adorable. The intrigues are a bit far-fetched and the premise is hard to swallow - stepfamilies are common, yes, but this family does not really want to melt. Overall, I think it's going gradually.
