Did the first parody actually bring in money? This is another sequel (in the lines of another issue) that no one has asked. But we still received it. The sequel is like his predecessor, completely brain dead. It's also pretty disgusting (do you remember the dinner scene?) To think that I almost felt sorry for Ritter, Yasbeck and Warden. Did they need this money?
