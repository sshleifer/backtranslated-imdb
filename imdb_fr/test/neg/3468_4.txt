'Leatherheads' try so hard. Try to be light. Try to be a comedy. Try to be a love story. Let's see, he's trying to be a "His daughter Friday" through "The Sting" through "It Happened One Night" through a dozen sports movies. Alas, trying is not done and the film is as soggy as the last field of the game. <br /> <br /> A movie fan would watch the big battle scene that was going on between the Duluth Bulldogs and some soldiers and was aware that John Ford's style-wise, witty and humorous fights in films like "The Quiet Man" or "Donovan's Reef", or "The Searchers" may seem easy to do but do not are obviously not. I bet George Clooney thought channeling John Ford would be easy too. It's hard: insane masculinity, punches, broken bottles over your head, imperturbable pianist ... just put it on the screen with music going on. Sorry. It takes a master to cast battle scenes. <br /> <br /> We do not want movies. Humor is difficult. Romance is difficult. Slapstick a lost art. <br /> <br /> I read one day that you never wanted to sit too close to a ballet performance. Something about not wanting to poke the fantastic bubble of performance by hearing the dull footsteps of the dancers or the grumbling of the lifts. This film is like that ... full of tension and good intentions, beautiful actors, beautiful scenery, but it sounds rather than galloping like the galloping ghost Red Grange, on which the film is based.
