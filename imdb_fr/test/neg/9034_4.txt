Marked for Death (1990) devotes more time to action sequences than focusing on his characters. After his first two impressive efforts, Above the Law (1988) and Hard to Kill (1989), this third image of Steven Seagal gives a clear idea: anyone who opposes him is supposed to look silly; the wicked are there only to look good. <br /> <br /> Seagal had regularly trained an audience that seemed a little wider than those who followed the antics of Chuck Norris or Jean Claude Van Damme. <br /> <br /> In Marked for Death, Seagal eliminates any pretense of style and goes deep into the farm. This film contains tons of graphic violence, gore and nudity that seem to be there for no other reason than to please the creepy moviegoers, unable to distinguish between action movies telling a story and those that only vibrate without sensations or rhymes. . And he deserves a real fault for this lack of taste as a producer of "Marked for Death". Seagal plays John Hatcher, a retired DEA officer returning to Chicago, where his family is attacked. by a Jamaican street gang, who attacks his sister's house, and the film proves that it is not disgusting to have his niece (Danielle Harris) shot. Hatcher gets angry and decides to team up with his old friend Max (Keith David), a school gymnastics teacher, and Charles (Tom Wright), a Jamaican policeman. <br /> <br /> Of course, Hatcher declares war on the wicked leader, a Jamaican voodoo priest to the scare called Screwface (Basil Wallace), a nickname that apparently means "exaggerated". <br /> <br /> And it's almost incredible to see how Seagal eliminates various gang members: he misleads a guy's eye, he breaks a guy's back and he breaks many arms and limbs. <br /> All the logic of this film is projected through the window, through the glass. Why are Hatcher and his friends not being charged for all the material damage they have caused or the number of deaths that are piling up? And how were they able to recover their cache of automatic weapons from Illinois to Jamaica by air without being detected? <br /> <br /> Seagal has a stoicism of Clint Eastwood that fans seemed to enjoy, and despite the three different characters he played in as many movies, everyone wears an oriental black robe and wears a ponytail . One of the problems I have with some of Seagal's films is that the main characters never seem to be seriously threatened, and because he's the star, of course, no one can match him, to the exception of the villain. <Seagal's heroes are all interchangeable, as are most intrigues and action sequences. Whether disguised as a boat cook, fireman or general policeman wearing love beads, Seagal is still Seagal, which is exactly what his fans want. In fact, the similarity of these films is such that, if I wanted to, I could take an old criticism, change my name and have a pretty precise vision of the new film. Not that I really do that ...
