It should have rocked. VH1 moved away from the traditional divas (Whitney Houston, Celine Dion, etc.) that made the 2003 show so obsolete. Unfortunately, the movement turned against us. The show had no MC keep the show together. Queen Latifah did a fantastic show at the Divas in 2003. The show started with a dreadful rendition of Lady Marmalade with Patti Labelle, Cyndi Lauper and Jessica Simpson. Okay, in the studio with a little control, they can all be excellent. <br /> <br /> However, when they compete (why?), it sounds just crooked! Jessica Simpson has the most bizarre facial expressions when she sings which I have never witnessed! Cyndi Lauper also played Girl Just Wanna Have Fun. It was not so bad but it was hardly impressive. The worst was yet to come! Cyndi and Patti Labelle have teamed up to perform Cyndi's hit "Time After Time". It was acoustic, and did not fit the rest of the series. It would have been possible if they had not insisted on squealing like mamed animals. It was just disastrous. <br /> <br /> Debbie Harry (Blondie) is always cool. She has a style all her own and even though she may not be able to compete vocally with many divas, even though she knows how to sing very well. Debbie came to play the first hit of Blondie's "Rapture". With beautiful voices. She really hit the notes to perfection. She looked beautiful. Rapper Eve provided a new sad rap, but inferior. It was good. Debbie's next performance was a team with newcomer Joss Stone. They performed Blondie's hit "One Way Or Another". I think Joss misunderstood the style of the song and just shouted at Debbie. A little sad was when Debbie tried and failed to match her screaming style that spoiled her a bit. She should have let Joss continue playing with her. Blondie's set has executed this track. The last track Debbie played was "Call Me", her hit hit. It was pretty poor. It's not Debbie's fault because you could not hear it. The sound was atrocious throughout the show. <br /> <br /> Joss Stone also played some songs herself. They were pretty well done. Ashanti has also come forward to produce two inexplicable cover versions. First, she played Diana Ross, "I just went out," then Chaka Khan, "Is not Nobody." She is not a diva! She can sing to a certain extent but she has no presence. Why not just bring the real singers. Chaka was even interviewed during the series .... <br /> <br /> Gladys Knight came and did a medley. It was really good. She was probably the best part of the series. I do not know much about her except that she is an experienced interpreter in Las Vegas and that her experience and class were brilliant. Patti Labelle concocted another performance this time with his New Attitude success of the 80's. It was the final and it was good but it was too late. It was a big failure. Best chance for next time VH1. <br /> <br /> The version I saw was a heavily modified version of 55 minutes that was shown on VH1 in the UK. If these are the best pieces .....
