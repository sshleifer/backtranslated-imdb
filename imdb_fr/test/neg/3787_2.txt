Quite terrible, but not quite impractical. Another review mentioned "predictable" - and that's almost a euphemism. You can create a game by guessing what will be the next line. Each character is stereotyped or archetypal. The good guy in a bad situation, the fight between older and younger priest on acceptance and discipline, the woman repressed and sexually / emotionally disinherited who returns to the small town after having failed in the big city, engaged to the young man with weak minds, non-exchangeable villains, two "lost boys" looking for a sense of family - they are all there, and none of them has the slightest glimmer of novelty. From the first minutes, you can know exactly what will happen at the end of the film. The story is not quite lame, but the direction, the action (even of a distribution with a certain talent) everything is thrown together without any skill. As for the script, we've all seen it in a movie called "Sister Act". It is also one of those films where inattention to small details appears in an even more glaring light. (For example: the nurse and our hero arrive in town but park several blocks away (post office and hardware store), but they both go through empty car parks for no apparent reason, or from morning to evening at night. a scene apparently, it should not take more than half an hour.The film is filled with these kinds of things, then adds an improbable denouement.
