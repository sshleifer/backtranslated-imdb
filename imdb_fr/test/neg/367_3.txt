I am so disappointed. After waiting for 3 years the rehearsals / DVD of the series of masterpieces "Darkplace", I could not wait for this series. The first episode has just ended and I am dismayed. All that was great about Darkplace was virtually erased here. Worst introduction: canned laughter. this removes the point of origin and makes it almost unassailable. (A joke about Garth's eyes fertilizing the audience was good ... the rest of which I just remember ...) it feels like bad quality "Knowing me, I know you". I hope this will improve as the series progresses, otherwise I will be seriously disappointed. Back to "Darkplace ..." <br /> <br /> "You are the most compassionate man I have ever known, and I know God ..."
