Save early at Norris, "Breaker, Breaker" has nothing to offer that can not be found ten times better on any broadcast channel. A pathetic attempt to film is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. In spite of that, I looked at it, flicking through the fast-forward button, because the acting was so awful that it was comical. Of course, the film is supposed to be an action / drama but has become a treat on how not to make a movie. All that could be wrong with the film is on the screen in this "dog". If you meet him, take a look. It's so bad, it's funny.
