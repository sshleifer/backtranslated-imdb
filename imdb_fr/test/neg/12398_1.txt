Imagine the most clich√© horror plot you can have. Add more intrigue holes than the plot. Do it written by a 10 year old. Play A-level theater actors that mimic American accents (on the Isle of Man!). Add monster special effects that B & W Dr Who's who will appreciate. Result: duff film. Add Samantha Janus undressing (put it on the front cover) and you'll probably sell enough to make a profit!
