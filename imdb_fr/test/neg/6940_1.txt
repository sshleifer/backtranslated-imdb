I never thought a movie could make me regret the fact that I subscribe to HBO. Now I know better! Jack is usually one of my favorite actors, but he could not even save that part. Not that he tried. Jack plays his usual character of Wiitches of Eastwick. Unfortunately, this is not done in the Southwest. He is about as credible a desperado cowboy as Pee Wee Herman. The performance has no advantage and for this reason the comedy fails. He is almost too clumsy. The rest of the cast was worse. The timing of the delivery of the lines was apparently something that the main woman had not perfected in 1978 and the others just seemed happy to be there. My recommendation to those of you who are interested in this movie is to gain valuable time to watch the paint dry.
