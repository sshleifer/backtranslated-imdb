Unless you want to get bored half dead. I have never been a fan of Gus Van Sant and as part of what the previous posters described as the new generation of young people, I was very disappointed and slightly angry at the stereotypical portrayal of the characters in the film, especially because that they were used to following The ridiculous plot of the film, which makes tell viewers that the riders are offshoots of society and that they should be held responsible for crimes. As a skater myself, I watch a lot of skateboarding and filming during skate scenes, which is obviously a major element of the plot, since the main protagonist is a skateboarder, was awful and that the Camera technique was used in slow motion to give a horrible effect. This film is full of ridiculous stereotypes as shown by the soundtrack of "emo", which only reinforces the myth of the media that all skaters are white rockers. Simply a very bad movie.
