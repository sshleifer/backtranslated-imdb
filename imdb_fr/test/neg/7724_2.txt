When Uwe Boll, an extraordinary movie scammer, released House of The Dead's first adaptation to well-deserved taunts, fans of the original video game generally agreed that it would be incredibly stupid to consider Following. Hollywood's head-to-head ratio must indeed be high, because not only do we have a sequel, but it has been distributed to the antipodes by Sony, a company that is not normally known for its cost in expensive deductions. Published directly on American television, the sequel improves on the original version, but becomes faded rather than interesting. The scale of the scenario is broadened, the action taking place in a deserted city surrounding a university where experiments on a virus capable of resuscitating the dead took place. In particular, the action is spreading in the university, where the first infected inhabitants are. In simple terms, the film differs from the original in that it actually takes place in a house where you can find dead people. <br /> <br /> Distribution, on the other hand, is a real setback. Emmanuelle Vaugier was specifically designed to look like a low-rent Angelina Jolie, while the rest of the cast never reaches the level of Jummen Prochnow. In fact, the only name that will emerge from this cast is Sticky Fingaz, which probably did not want to be recognized so easily by the people it faces at home. In simple terms, these people could not convincingly order pizzas on the big screen, even in the best direction. Say what you want about Boll, but at least he inspired actors like Ona Grauer to fight against his incapacity. That said, the people involved here seem to know at least that their film is nil and that they could just as well have fun. A big part of the problem with the original was that the director thought he was creating a misunderstood masterpiece, and he took himself seriously. Unfortunately, actors failing to take seriously their characters or the difficult situation, the little dramatic tension he could have lived is undermined. <br /> <br /> A big part of the plot is the search for a generation zero victim regardless of the plague that makes the dead resurrect. Or to translate more concretely, they try to find an infected person just after the mutation of the virus into a threatening form for the man. We can see how this can be useful when a non-mutated strain is usually needed to create a vaccine, but the way this quest is punctuated suffers from its own problems. The "We must return" plotter is used to indicate the elapsed time, but the exact timing of the extra quest is also a problem. We are told at one point that the city will be destroyed by cruise missiles in ten minutes, but the heroes return to university, locate the sample they are looking for and fight enough zombies to devastate the Chinese army . this time space. Filmmakers take note: it pays to be precise over time, when it can serve rather than hinder a dramatic tension. <br /> <br /> The special effects used in House Of The Dead 2 leave those of the original original. Where Uwe Boll simulated the death of characters using idiotic camera tricks, Michael Hurst instead uses all the graphic details that his budget can afford. The necks are bitten, the arms are cut, the heads are shot. All this gives a much more convincing flow, but it also excludes the obvious forgery parody. Photography is also much improved. As the DVD Crypt says, the fact that it is in the foreground is an improvement over the original, but it also deprives us of something to laugh at the expense of. Writing is also both an improvement and a setback. Throughout the script, references to other horror and survival games, the most obvious being Run Like Hell, are offered. The first two times, they work because they offer clever ways of transforming titles into ordinary everyday dialogues. However, after the eighth time, they are just pissed off as they remind players of things they would rather do with their time. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, House Of The Dead 2 cost only six million to bring. to television screens across America. Given that Tom Savini alone would cost more than that to work on a film, I must say that I am a little impressed by the visual results. Unlike the highly revered original, zombies look like real zombies rather than badly made up extras. Unlike the original, the actors seem to have an idea of ​​what they do. To seal the agreement is the fact that, apart from some real zingers scattered, the characters speak like real people. However, history is nothing that we have never seen a thousand times. When Aliens, the real Dawn Of The Dead, or The Evil Dead were made public, the success comes from the fact that these films did something that we had not seen before, or that we really did not care . House Of The Dead 2 is competent enough not to make fun of him, but he brings nothing new or particularly brilliant at the table, so we end up not worrying about it. <br /> <br /> For this reason, and many others, I gave House Of The Dead 2 a two out of ten. It's too good to be bad, but too bad to be good. Unless you like dummies as much as I do, you'd better stay away from them.
