The Kindred opens up shots of a Porsche running on a highway, overtaking an old van and being restrained. As he passes quickly in front of the van, the driver (Benjamin J. Perry in the role of Ben Perry) screams obscenities and sounds a horn. Distracted, he does not notice obstruction in front of him and plants his Porsche. He is quickly released from the wreckage and leads to the hospital. En route, the paramedic (Randy Harrington) trying to save him suggests he probably will not succeed. Then the ambulance is attacked and forced off the road by a van. The driver of the van, Jackson (Jim Boeke as James F. Boeke) beats the medical device and steals the patient. The ambulance driver Harry (Charles Grueber) is not trying to stop him. Once the injured person is in the van, Jackson turns his attention to Harry, who seems to know each other. Harry asks Jackson not to hit him because he broke his jaw "last time". Jackson hits Harry on the floor and throws him a bundle of money. The film then clearly shows that we are in San Fransisco showing a picture of the Golden Gate Bridge. Sharon Raymond is awakened by a phone call from her boyfriend, Dr. John Hollins (David Allen Brooks), informing her that her mother, Amanda (Kim Hunter), recently suffered a heart attack, has regained consciousness. Hollins works for a company called "Geneticell Corporation" and looks forward to this news and goes home. Once there, she asks him to return to his former childhood home in a small town called Shelter Cove and destroy all his notes and experiences, especially the "Anthony newspapers" Hollins has never heard of. She also claims that he has a brother. named Anthony. Back to Geneticell, Hollins talks with his mother's Phillip Lloyd (Rod Steiger) because they had worked together before arguing, and asked him about his research and the name of someone calling him Anthony. He claims he knows nothing. When Amanda dies after visiting the sinister Dr. Lloyd, Hollins decides to follow up on her request for Mothers and to try to find out who Anthony is. While paying her respects at the funeral, a woman named Melissa Leftridge (Amanda Country) introduces herself to Hollins and says she was a big fan of her work and her research on mothers after helping her. . Because Melissa seems to know a lot about her mother's work, he invites her home, because she may be able to find help to find answers to her various questions. Hollins, Sharon, Melissa and three laboratory assistants, Brad Baxter (Peter Frechette), Hart Phillips (Timothy Gibbs) and Cindy Russell (Julia Montgomery), and a girl with a watermelon (!) Named Nell Valentine (Bunki Z, big name his parents thinking!?). They go to work immediately but find little interest. For some reason, no one at this point is thinking of looking in the basement, which is as good as there is something down there, something big, sticky and that has a lot of tentacles. First, he kills Duke, the dog. Then it goes to a larger prey. When Hart is attacked by something in a barn, Hollins decides that he must destroy all traces of his work as a mother and what Anthony will be. Co-written and co-authored by Stepehn Carpenter and Jeffery Obrow, Carpenter also acted as director of photography and Obrow as a producer. It's a very bad movie in my opinion. The script is credited to five (!) Writers, Carpenter, Obrow, Earl Ghaffari, John Penny and Joseph Stefano. With five people working on it, I would like to think that they could come up with something a little better and more coherent than that. Nothing explains that as well, why did Amanda create these monstrous hybrids of marine / human creatures? What is Dr. Lloyd's interest and his motivations? Why is he stealing bodies from the back of the ambulance? Why does he have a basement full of mutants? Why do not any of these so-called genetic scientists think about checking the basement? Could Melissa act more suspiciously even if she tried? Why does none of the characters have a background? Why do people continue to mention a substance found in marine creatures called Hemocynine while 99.9% of viewers will have no idea what's about them? There is also a serious lack of blood and coolness, only one person dies on the screen, only one! And all scientists survive in a "happy ending" causing vomiting. It's a horror movie, all we want to see is that gooey monsters kill and eat people in different ways. The one about death on the screen is actually pretty cool, someone has sticky tentacles inserted under his skin, into his ear and nose in the decent horror sequence of the movie. To try to raise the gore quote, there is a scene in which Dr. Lloyd experiments a skinned animal but only lasts a few seconds and, in the rest of the film, it means nothing. Melissa is also turning into fish, do not ask. There is no nudity either, which is not a surprise. The film has a fairly professional appearance with decent production values, but it is so dull and no turtles. We can not even see the giant monster in the basement before 15 minutes before the end, which is far too little far too late, when it appears, the effects are OK, which is even more unfortunate than it is. has not been used further. Overall, I was very disappointed and expected much better. A horror movie with only one death on the screen and only three, what is the world going too?
