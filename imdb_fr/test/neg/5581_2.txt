The kind of 50s B-series movies that were both schlocky and so much fun is a tribute to what Predator Island is paying tribute to. Filmed in Connecticut, Predator Island is located on an island called Hell's Beacon lighthouse, inhabited only by the couple that deals with the lighthouse. In the 1950s, after half a dozen young adults hit their boat in the rocky shore, hideous creatures on the rocky shore invade the island after a nearby meteor struck. The creatures begin to inhabit the bodies of their victims and devour them. Many curses and lame returns are the main form of dialogue in this film. It's so hokey that you just have to laugh sometimes. If you're looking for a stupid but fun movie, this one is perfect. <br /> <br /> Interesting note: I appear in the film as a corpse in the distant background of the final scene. During the filming, they needed about 50 extras, but about 300 people came forward to seize this opportunity. They finally used nearly 200 of them.
