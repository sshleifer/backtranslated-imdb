It is easier to watch this film if it is considered a scenario created by Lieutenant Reginald Barclay of Star Fleet during his holodeck addiction. (Barclay is a recurring Star Trek character played by Dwight Schultz.) <br /> <br /> Dwight Schultz is under the pseudonym Oppenheimer. The character of Oppenheimer is poorly written, so we never see the depth and breadth of his knowledge. Instead, we see a shallow, two-dimensional figure of a soap opera. Paul Newman also embodies General Leslie Groves, but the problems in this film are not limited to bad actors in bad roles. <br /> <br /> Factual errors and great freedoms (along with the chronology of events) for the political agenda of screenwriter Bruce Robinson makes this film embarrassing to watch. That's probably why this movie found its place on the so-called History Channel. <br /> <br /> "Fat Man and Little Boy" combine bad science, bad story, bad scripting and poor performance to produce a film that should not be viewed by impressionable college or college students who know nothing of the Manhattan Project.
