It's really abominable. I just got a copy of "Disco Beaver From Outer Space" after hearing good things about it, and I have to say it was so incredibly stupid and bad that it will leave you numb and mystified by the way it was been done. <Br /> <br /> I mean, what was it? Is this the typical humor of the late 70s? I do not think so. It's so bad, and believe me, I do not mean "so bad it's good" either. This is a collection of extremely funny sketches as if you are watching cable TV. Yes, it was an HBO program, and to think that it could have been considered revolutionary is frightening. <br /> <br /> It contains a cute girl and some old hockey NHL Islanders team footage, which is fun to watch even though I'm a long time fan of the New York Rangers. But they even messed up all of that by trying to give a bit of humor to two hockey players bickering on the ice as if they were "dancing" and, worse yet, reversing the videotape of two hockey players who are fighting to make them look like. have sex. Oh, it's funny! In a bit of intelligence, there is an interview with a hockey player named "Chico" who looks like the New York Islanders goaltender Chico Resch, but they even ruined it by making him wear a jersey. Rangers! Well, maybe it was intentional, who knows. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that "Disco Beaver" is so horribly horrible, so incredibly bad, you will definitely feel cheated after seeing this and wasted almost an hour of your life. You'll wonder what may have caused the manufacturers of this waste to think they had something funny here, and you also wonder why these skits can not even get close to the worst slump of Saturday Night Night. Unbelievable. Just amazing.
