Until about 1970, Lucille Ball was a great actress. It was such a perfect clown that I only wish more people could have seen it with Bob Hope in "The Facts of Life" because it could also be a dead end. as well as slapstick .. <br /> <br /> Yes, Lucille Ball was wonderful. . . until "Mame" <br /> <br /> Trying to see Lucille Ball in "Mame" is physically impossible, because there is so much Vaseline on the already filtered goals that you would need Windex to see Lucille Ball in some scenes. So, even if you see Lucille Ball in "Mame", you can not really see Lucille Ball in "Mame". Which is a blessing. <br /> <br /> That's about all I can say best about "Mame", the film of the play's musical (it could go on, but it started with a book entitled "Auntie Mame"). To give a bad shot is like beating a sponge. So, it does not matter whether the music is crooned or crooked. Most of the songs were not a lot, anyway. There is no difference in the first three. "Today's", "Open a new window" and "We need a little Christmas" are all the same song. Celene Dion should make an album with them, they are so big and so boring. The murderous ballad "If he walked in my life today" needs a beautiful, confident voice (Edyie Gorme won a Grammy for making it in 1967) that poor Lucille Ball did not possess when she realized this film. (Certainly, Elaine Stritch can not carry a melody in a bucket either, but at least Stritch can replace a song.) <br /> <br /> If you still feel that your life will not be complete to see comedy Mame, notice how IL is dancing, but each time Lucy / Mame starts doing something beyond a paralyzed mix, the camera cuts, then returns to the end of the number and the star poses with the dancers. Once again, it's just as good. Jane Connell took on the role of the pathetic Agnes Gooch after Lucille Ball's dismissal of Madeline Kahn to ensure that no comic originality comes to the fore. Connell is a stage artist who, like Carol Channing and Ethyl Merman, can not reduce her film performances. She joins Lucille Ball to be embarrassing, although for different reasons. <br /> <br /> The sumptuous dresses are by Theadora Van Runkle (Van Wrinkle?) and they provide the missing color in all but one actor. <br /> <br /> Bea Arthur as an actress Vera Charles, Mame's best friend, ignores everyone and does her own funny thing. If only she was in more scenes. She is too old for her role too, but at least she did not mutilate her.
