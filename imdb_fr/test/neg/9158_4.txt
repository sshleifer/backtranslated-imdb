This is a less than average "whodunit" with everyone's clich√© in the salon routine. Charlie Chan is a secret service agent who works for the government. He must find out who killed a bomb scientist to defeat German submarines during the Second World War. There is little to recommend in this film, since neither the bomb, nor the scientist, nor the war have much to do with the plot. Charlie Chan fans will probably find this film disappointing. Who dunit? We do not care?
