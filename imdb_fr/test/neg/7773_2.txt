If you like silly movies and are looking for something you do not need to watch closely, it may be worth watching. the story itself is very unrealistic. the dialogue is not very credible. it is doubtful that you find yourself in relation with any of these characters because none of them are very friendly. the game could have been much worse. Victoria Pratt is visibly uncomfortable with the rest of the cast because she seems to have a lot of potential and talent as an actress. Although it does not say much, it's one of the best gaming performances I've seen from tori spelling. she seems to improve with age. All in all, this extremely melodramatic film is mediocre at best.
