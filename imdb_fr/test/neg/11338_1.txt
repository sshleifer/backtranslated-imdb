When I went to see this film, it was already an imposed choice, because my original intention had been sold. what resulted then was pure terror, this film is so bad that I could hardly bear it. the story does not deserve to be mentioned, a gay goaltender forms a gay football team to play against his former right-wing team who, after discovering his sexual orientation, has made him suffer hard times. Loaded with clichés of gays unbearably old and overused, the plot perfectly complicates stupid dialogues ... it is absolutely amazing that actors like dietmar bär or charly hübner waste their talent and their time on such absurdity. 1/10
