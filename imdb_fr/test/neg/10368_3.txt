So I decided to watch the entire series Puppet Master. I had just watched parts 1 to 3, which I found ALL excellent. They had a unique charm, and some intelligence that I really appreciated. About a year ago, I even saw the Demon Toys puppet master, which was of course bad, but still a guilty pleasure and fun to watch. <br /> <br /> From the beginning of this movie, I knew the problem was serious. The evil Egyptian skull of the style Power Rangers who looks at the style "Rita Repulsa" puppets through its pyramidal glass came out of the left field! All the additions to this franchise in this story were completely absurd! We suddenly have a big assortment of new and random characters and plots that are far from the first three movies. I seriously doubt that when the first puppetmaster was written, the scriptwriters would one day see an Egyptian villain of the Power Rangers, monsters totems, twenty annoying years that can not seriously act (Something smart ), and a lame puppet "Decapitron" whose head can turn into a ghost of Toulon. <br /> <br /> Another thing that greatly disappointed me in this film is that it completely ignores what happened in the last entry (Part II, since III was a prequel). Suddenly, the puppets are back to Bodega Bay Inn, in their holster (less Blade), and Toulon for some reason is willing to help him again (he betrays them in Part II for his love of Elsa). This is not explained at all ... and with that, and with all these other nonsense thrown in, I was no longer amused. <br /> <br /> I am a big fan of ridiculous B movies, a connoisseur if you want. I even collect laser discs of rare rare films that you can not find on DVD, so I need a lot to say that it was one of the most absurd movies I have ever seen in my life. I still love these puppets, the original ones, Blade, Tunneler, Pinhead, Jester and the rest, and if they had stuck with what they had rather than trying to fix something that was not broken, well , the series could still be alive and healthy. That being said, even though the reviews are not so good, I'm really interested in visiting Puppet Master Retro, which looks interesting and pays homage to the original themes.
