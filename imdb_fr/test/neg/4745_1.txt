This movie and the first AvP movie cover the entire Aliens and Predator franchise. <br /> <br /> These are horrible films, misinterpreted, poorly scripted and terribly made. It sounds like a desperate attempt to make money from the reputation of the original alien and predatory films, but instead of producing a thoughtful and quality production, they have imagined the predator. <br /> <br /> original Alien / Aliens / Predator / Predator 2 movies have been great. They redefined the genre of thriller / horror by inventing those crazy (and yet credible) creatures who took on the role of the "serial killer" as opposed to a human. <br /> <br /> These films deal with the franchise and only darken its name. <br /> <br /> The Aliens vs Predator comics were brilliant and have a great story. They were faithful to the Alien / Predator mythology, they did not hide all the original stories, etc. Why did not he make comics a great movie? Because Hollywood are idiots, that's why.
