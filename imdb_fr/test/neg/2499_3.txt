D'Amato's hardcore / horror hybrid does not really match its extraordinary title and intriguing premise, according to which various tasteless contemporary types are attacked by a monster located on an atoll previously used for nuclear experiments, but the film is generally so slow, so sad action and distribution so clearly repulsed to be forced to have sex with each other as the film becomes a chore to watch. <br /> <br /> It's a shame, because the film gives a promising idea. A group of scientists is taken to the atoll by a naval officer in a small ship. The scientists ?? three women and two men ?? are an intriguing sample of sexual types, suffering varying degrees of nymphomania, co-dependency and frigidity; there is even a fascinating foray into the world of female sex tourism, where one of the women stops in a brothel to be served by two chic Caribbean studs. The creature itself ?? a native island native with a horribly marked face and an unbearably long tingling ?? bears certain affinities with the ancient creature of the Black Lagoon and constitutes the kind of nuclear nightmare that reigns around the postmodern man since the beginning of the cold war, even if we, in the West, we are folded into the hedonism and the relativistic science. <br /> <Porn The Holocaust is certainly a film that shows the post-sexual revolution that Westerners encounter in their mirror image in a nuclear monster. Yet the torpor with which it unfolds really lets the ferocity of the idea fall. There is a promising interaction of action scenes with POV views, which suggests that the monster (which looks like what horror monsters do from their POV position) looks like the one of the voyeur in the audience being fired between the two "beautiful people." The sight of the monster forcing a beautiful young woman to suck his oversized member certainly throw in the face the ugly fantasies of the target audience. But D'Amato has developed similar ideas in other films, and Porno Holocaust is a potentially ferocious idea left by the execution (even D'Amato's usual cinematic talents have let him down with a very boring photographic work ).
