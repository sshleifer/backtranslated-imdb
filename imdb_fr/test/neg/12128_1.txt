I may have been too young when I saw him. I may not have grown up with the Grease and Elvis movies. <br /> <br /> I could not get it. I get a comedy "black" (Black Adder etc.). I have irony and parodies. However, I do not understand this one. <br /> <br /> I set myself the goal of finding the name of this movie (soliciting the help of people on Usenet and the most excellent IMDb bulletin boards) for my first 1 pointer. Terrible!
