Not as if I was expecting a lot, but I was hoping for at least one big budget fun movie. It's not even that. This article ranks in the bottom half of all the vampire movies I've ever seen (and believe me, I've seen a lot). Bad action game, zero characterization, almost nonexistent thinking, almost nonexistent parcel (and this is where you can drive semi-trailers through the holes). Of course, he has action and is noisy, and has more action, more noise, blood and action ... These things alone do not make a good movie (or even half decent). It's beyond me that some people can say it's the best vampire movie ever - all I can assume is that they have not seen much. I suggest seeing Near Dark instead.
