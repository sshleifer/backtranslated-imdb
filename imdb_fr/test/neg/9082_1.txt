It's hard to believe that there are people in the world who think it's a worthy vehicle for Charles Bronson. <br /> <br /> Bronson is a good actor who can do more than carry a gun and eliminate the bad guys. He was moving quietly in the TV movie "Yes Virginia, there is a Santa Claus" and showed a lot of class and style in the movie "The Indian Runner" directed by Sean Penn. <br /> <br /> In "The Evil" That Men Do ", however, Bronson again plays a character who sees injustice and corrects it with fists, knives and, of course, rifles. There's nothing here that you have not seen in the last five "Death Wish" movies. <br /> <br /> Wait, I'm taking it off, it's probably the most sadistic and violent movie Bronson never had a hard time, not only repelling scenes of torture or descriptions of torture, but the fact that these scenes were placed in a movie selling tickets, and Jose Ferrer! here in blue? I mean, he won an Oscar, for shouting loudly !!! <br /> <br /> OK, sorry for this blast.Let me say, "The harm they do men "must be one of the worst films I've ever seen and is based on a book Yes it's true.I wonder if this was written thinking about Bronson? <br /> <br /> > No stars Watch "Death Wi sh "instead, at least it was topical.
