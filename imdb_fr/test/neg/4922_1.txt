The movies do not get worse than that. A horrible plot, effects and pathetic effects at the chosen moment, terribly synchronized and yes, we use the "B" norms. <br /> <br /> And for the guys: nothing, this movie is a terrible mistake, some scenes that could have been great but you get nothing but to build you without delivery. <br /> <br /> This film does not please anyone, horrible film, he had a problem; intrigue, game, flavor "B", special effects and everything in between. In addition, no nudity or eroticism for boys or girls.
