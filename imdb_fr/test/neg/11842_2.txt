We all know that the world is full of crazy and stolen horror movies. Some of them can be fun to watch, because of their stupidity, their terrible effects and their wacky dialogues. But Raptor, who could have been in the same league as Carnosaur's equally useless series, does not even try to take pleasure in it. It's so bad that it's really unbearable, even if you look at it with the intention of spending a brainless day at home. Where are we going to start? Well ... the sets are rather dull. My former theater group has created more realistic scenes. The genetics labs seem to belong to a university and they are just as unbelievable outside (even to hide, why would you place near civilization where people can easily hear the roar of dinosaurs), while the hall doctors do not do it? not look credible at all. The next step in the list of complaints is the creature effects; Well, what can I say? Absolutely pitiful. In addition, I think it's worth mentioning, the woman's breasts should be mentioned as an effect. The two main female characters have so obviously had boob jobs, and that depreciates them: one is a respected member of the police, while the other is the "innocent" sweet girl of the sheriff of the city. Actor play, however, is by far the worst tragedy. Eric Roberts can be excused for at least trying to give something to his role. That's where it ends. Corbin Benson should have killed his costume designer for making his dull performance even more pathetic, while the female lead seemed so bored (though with this movie you could let her go). The other character I'm going to point out is the girl, who lets her tits play in the sex scene "hot" (Ten minutes of endless rehearsals of his scene that bounces on a guy). <br /> <br /> Overall, and summarized in one. do not bother, but do not do it.
