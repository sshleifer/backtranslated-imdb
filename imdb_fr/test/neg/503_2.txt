The basic rule in the making of this movie seems to have been "never make a scene of a minute if you can make a scene of 10 minutes". It was a principle established from the beginning with an endlessly long portrait of the graduation of the Harvard class of 1870. The purpose of this scene was, I suppose, to present some of the main figures of the story and to give a little of their context - which is quite effective when comparing the idealism of the Harvard graduation ceremony to the realism of life in Johnson County, Wyoming, but it continues to be perpetuated, and this opens the way for a film that presents repeated passages of numbing nothingness, compounded by the fact that I found that an important part of the dialogue was almost incoherent. In the end, I could not even look at it in one sitting. I covered about half of it and had to put it aside for a few days before I could pull myself together to see how it would unfold. <br /> <br /> My reaction to this movie is in many ways shameful. because there are positives here. The performances are generally of high caliber, notably of Kris Kristofersson (Averill), Christopher Walken (champion) and Isabelle Huppert (Ella). The basic story - intertwined around this nerve-wracking nothingness - is potentially interesting, it focuses on the efforts of immigrants to settle in Johnson County and on the efforts of a breeding society to stop them by killing a number of them. collaboration with the government and the army. There are also pictures of breathtaking landscapes. That said, the whole could have been done in half the time - and should have been. In the end, all these potential positive aspects are swept away - again - by the stultifying nothingness that the film seems to revolve around. Seriously - 2/10.
