Screenwriter / director Brian Burns has obviously seen some romantic comedies, and he seems to believe that he has discovered the formula for success: many shots in New York (preferably in winter), allusions to old Hollywood movies (including musicals), a pleasant musical soundtrack. Alas, all this only compensates for Burns' lack of talent as a writer. (The great mystery of many directors-directors making independent films is not the reason why they can not get along with the big studios, but to what extent they get the slightest support for their films.) <br /> <br /> Normally, our interest in romantic comedy is motivated by the main characters, but the couple in this film has no appeal. This is not the fault of David Krumholtz or Milla Jovavich; their characters are just badly written. What we respond to in classics such as When Harry meets Sally or Annie Hall or older movies like His Girl Friday are quirks and flaws in the characters of the main characters. Not having the ability to create individuals, Burns offers us a special program after school inspired by Men Are From Mars, Women Are From Venus. <br /> <br /> It's totally impossible to see how Burns is Woody Allen's successor. I did not laugh once during this film, and the screenprint is full of echo chamber dialogues ("I want to paint the city red." "Do you want to paint the city in red?"), Which is the most telling sign of someone who has no writing business to make a living. In one of the first scenes, we see the girlfriend of actress Krumholz filming a stupid TV sitcom. This is the only moment in the whole film where dialogue feels good; perhaps that indicates Burns' talents.
