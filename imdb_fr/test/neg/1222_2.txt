It would be a shame for Tommy Lee Jones and Robert Duval to see this film someday, as they will probably be associated with it in the years to come.

I think it was a comedy, but not very funny. I really do not understand why they agreed to play. "It would be such an injustice that the original" Lonesome Dove "was a true Western classic and this turkey is a real bombshell and Jones and Duval will remember it.
