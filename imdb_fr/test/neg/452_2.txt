Pink ?? Is something really happening in this episode? He presents our two main roles: a Doctor idiot with a slow, smiling smile and a completely uninteresting companion. There is no real conspiracy, childish humor, mixed with extremely bad and stimulating music. What else to say, really? <br /> <br /> The end of the world ?? A marginal improvement, as we see our first space scenario. Subsequently destroyed by poor contemporary humor, thin logic like paper, very poor rhythm and tired SF shots. <br /> <br /> The Unquiet Dead ?? The best episode to date showing what can happen when someone knows how to structure an episode, write an interesting character dialogue AND incorporate an intriguing plot. Abandoned only by Doctor and Rose. <br /> <br /> Aliens from London / Third World War - Doctor who degenerates into a joke. What more can you say. Penelope Wilton brings some seriousness to the proceedings, doing her best in extreme circumstances. Some poorly written and irrelevant soap opera items are highlighted in these two episodes, then a return to a mediocre rhythm, a bad plot and a grimace worthy of humor or satire. <br /> Dalek ?? Not great, but still well above the RTD rate to date. The pace and the scenario are all good (even if the doctor and Rose are still pissed off). The effects and threat of Dalek are well introduced. The finale, however, was based on an interesting premise that reduced the Doctor's most notorious enemy into a bloody brothel, and transformed a never-before-seen threat into a blue rubber squid resembling a child's toy. <br /> <br /> The Long Game - The first RTD script to show any plot, even in a clich√© style of the 80s. Nevertheless, it was somewhat marred by its usual excessive reliance on juvenile jokes, the placing too much in the future to give a logical sense, and still a bad pace. Not as bad as his previous efforts, but instantly forgettable. <br /> <br /> Father's Day ?? The initial premise could have been vaguely interesting, but common sense and logic leave this episode early. In addition, we are treated to an entire episode of Soap Opera. Before you start thinking that everything is a matter of characterization, remember, there is a big difference between Soap Opera and characterization. On the positive side, it proves that RTD is not the worst screenwriter yet. <br /> <br /> The Empty Child / The Doctor Dances - It started off mediocre, with some worthy moments, and some illogical mistakes that even a primary school student would not make (Well lit windows in a blackout) electricity, do you like it?). After that, the first part takes a more interesting and sinister turn. Florence Hoath really steals these episodes, showing us just how much an interesting companion could have been. It could also act. Instead, captain Jack, annoying and politically correct, becomes his new companion. The conclusion was a bit hasty, but sufficient. The pace and the scenario improved with a reasonably good scenario, making both episodes rather atmospheric and intriguing. <br /> <br /> Boom Town - I must be honest. Except for a few examples, the current series disappointed me so much that, when I saw the trailer for another episode of "Slitheen", I did not submit to torture. <br /> <br /> Bad Wolf - Reality TV, arguably the worst aspect of modern media, is essentially used as a premise. There is no subtlety whatsoever. Do we have interesting social comments like in The Running Man or Truman Show? No of course not. This in an episode of RTD, so they are here basically trying to cynically attract the audience of these shows. Once again, logic moves on to something else, since we are in the 200,000 years in the future. RTD unnecessarily tries to worry in a "super-arc" story here, with no relevance other than his own existence and when the bad guys are revealed at the end ... They make empty threats, and the Doctor grins once again . silly for the climax! Most of the time, faster than other RTD efforts, it has one or two interesting moments. Otherwise, another payment dull. <br /> <br /> The separation of paths - The grand finale. More than a wet squid, literally. All the threat Dalek put in place in "Dalek" is reduced to nothing, because it becomes rather pathetic. So many intrigues complicate this episode, with generally mediocre devices. The Daleks want to harvest humans like Daleks, but then spray whole continents? Dalek can vaporize these continents, but not destroy the Tardis in space? The Tardis is now indestructible and can land anywhere, even above people, so they can be saved? This ability can not be used to easily destroy the "god" Dalek? The Daleks can spray whole continents, but do not just neutralize the doctor 5 to destroy it, but rather let it play? The doctor is a pathetic coward without the conviction of his actions, after eradicating all his species to try to eliminate the Daleks? Apart from these holes and many others, we are faced with the most complex solution ever conceived, with an almost useless narrative arc. <br /> <br /> So what can we say about the new series? all? <br /> <br /> Would you have won a second series if it was something other than Doctor Who, with RTD behind? Would most episodes have been seen as anything other than unoriginal and forgettable, if they had been anything other than Doctor Who and if the RTD name had been added? I think not. <br /> <br /> Some people would have us believe that we can not say anything against RTD, because we owe him for bringing Doctor Who back to our screens. However, this at the expense of good characters and good stories. Personally, I would rather not have a poorly planned, poorly designed, manufactured product at this price. I would rather wait for someone to come and make a sincere effort. For the most part, it's the kind of childish garbage that gives SF a bad name, tainting what is otherwise the most creative genre.
