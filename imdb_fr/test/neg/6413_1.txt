It's the most stupid movie ever made. The story is laughable. His wife and child think he is crazy. Then they do not do it. Then it turns out he does it and I think they've known it forever. There is a dog named Ned that causes problems and I think it's all his fault ... Jim Carey too. Only God knows why Virginia Madsen played this role ... it's a career nightmare. I think the target audience for this is the 11 and 12 years old. And that adds up to 23. Or maybe it's for the 8 and 10 year olds who also adds up to 23. Or maybe it's for the really stupid 23 year old. Or maybe really stupid 32 years because it's 23 in the opposite direction. Or maybe 46 would appreciate that because half of that is 23 years old. I think looking at the number 23 on the Internet would be more fun than this movie, unless you want to see a comedy.
