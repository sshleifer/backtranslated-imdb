This was once called a "woman's image" and later a "girl's movie" when times and movies became more youthful. The plot is just a soap opera for women and will only appeal to these guys. The only attraction for most guys is if they want to see Mary Tyler Moore too thin like a leotard. (If you're older, like me, it might still be enough to give it a look.) Otherwise, MTM gives another of its typical performances in numbers, which it gives since the beginning of the years 70, when she took it. at heart she was darling of America. Christine Lathi gives another of these abrasive and unpleasant performances that seem to be part of her person and probably only appeal to those of this type. (Sorry, but that sounds true.) Ted Danson is too young as a husband of MTM and usually broadcasts a scary call, unless he has an active partner who can soften him. And it does not happen here. Allan Burns wrote and directed and probably managed to do everything because he had already worked with Mary before, had written it as a project for her and she already had time to do it. There seems to be no other purpose.
