When a friend once harassed me for my first film (a very bad deal recorded on video), I argued that I could grow up; Orson Welles' first film was even worse. He challenged me that it could not be, so I pulled out the Criterion laserdisc from (I think) CITIZEN KANE and played at Hearts of Age. My friend lasted a few minutes before conceding the point. <br /> <br /> There's a bit of humor in this short film, but it's basically as pretentious as (and maybe a collegiate answer to) BLOOD OF A POET and others before guard movies of the time. That's what it is: a succession of images on a vague theme and, unless you really like the images of Welles (thick makeup, and more), it's not even worth to be found.
