At the very beginning, the control panel displaying "8 miles from the cost of California", and no, I did not misspell the fact that they did not realize the total cost rather than the coast. These people must have been morons. <br /> <br /> It's good if you like terrible movies, but the simple fact of not being able to catch a simple spelling problem makes me think that they really made no effort to create the film whatever. Navy uniforms are by no means correct. <br /> <br /> Wow, completely ridiculous, but good if you're looking for something incredibly stupid to watch. How these people made money with that, it's beyond me.
