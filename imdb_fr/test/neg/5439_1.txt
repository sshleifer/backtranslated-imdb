I would give a zero to this movie if I could. How anyone who could evaluate it goes beyond me. Until I saw Rollerball, it was my choice for the worst movie of a big studio with a real budget (claim that Mangler 2 or Leprechaun in the Hood was considered the worst ever, these are supposed to be bad) <br /> <br /> Tim Curry's mother had to undergo surgery or something to accept this nonsensical junk. I'm really not sure what happened here. The novel was great, the director Frank Marshall had a strong background with Alive and Arachnophobia (maybe they should have changed the title to 'Africa'), the distribution was good and the budget present. You might think that someone would have taken the trouble to read the script. <br /> <br /> You'd better watch Battlefield: Earth again than wasting your time with it. Congo wants return of MST3K
