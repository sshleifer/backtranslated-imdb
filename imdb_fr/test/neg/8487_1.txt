I was lucky to see this movie the other day. I did not know what to expect because I had never seen the trailer, etc., but what I discovered just watching the first 10 minutes is that this movie is the worst I've ever seen have never had the misfortune to see. <Br /> <br /> I wish I could assign the score 0 to this movie. The first 10 minutes were bad, but as soon as the party scene arrived, I just wanted to go into a coma and it was really bad. The actors made no sense, there was no real story, I read reviews that say it's good if you have a small child to entertain for 90 minutes, etc., but why should you we expose children to this type of movie? ? He has at most a good mood, a crude and crude comedy and focuses on mediocre special effects to occupy 80% of his time. I'm sure a few people in Hollywood will be in the streets after this bombshell. <br /> <br /> Also, how can 39 people give the score of 10 to this film? I mean anyone who gives this movie a rating of 10 has a mental problem and / or works for the movie company. This film should be on average 1.5 / 10 instead of the current 2.3 / 10 because of the people who rated it 10. Really sad.
