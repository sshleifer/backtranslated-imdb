If you can stand the campiness, this movie should make you laugh a few times. It did it for me, at least. I will mention only one of my favorite elements: "underwater shooting" of "fish" "swimming". The sound that accompanies these shots is also excellent. <br /> <br /> One last remark: William Katt is actually a pretty decent actor. I hope he spends another day in the sun; Watching him as "The Greatest American Hero" was a fun part of my childhood a few decades ago, and he has not been very visible since. He seemed a little depressed in this movie. Someone gives him a fun job on a good show or something.
