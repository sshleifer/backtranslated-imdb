This film, despite its list of stars B, C and D, is a total loss of 90 minutes. The plot, with its few peaks, was very predictable. It was so stupid that I can not believe I'm taking the time to write a review. Flex, to his credit, has developed his ability to act since the role of Michael Jackson in a TV movie designed a few years ago. Tangi, on the other hand, regressed, because she had more talent in her role of Felicity's flunkie a few years ago. As I watched this sinking film, with its pitiful production and horrible quality, I remembered other four-letter words to describe what I thought of this film. However, in order to keep my writings rated G, I will simply say that this film is another four-letter word starting with L. BLADE !!!
