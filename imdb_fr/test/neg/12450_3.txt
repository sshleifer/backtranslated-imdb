A heavy, slow film with terrible scenes all in all - but beautiful places and clothes to admire, and of course, Timothy Dalton, doing an irresistible job, as always. I wanted to laugh loudly - so silly !! But Dalton is still worth watching, even in bad movies, a wonderful actor, older now, but still very handsome and masculine. This film is worth watching only to see it .... and it seems that it has gone astray in a bad mood novel, this poor boy. Your time would be better spent watching Mr. Dalton in "1970's Wuthering Heights" or the "Jane Eyre" version of the BBC in the early 1980s. Poor Sela Ward, so adorable, but so wooden ... she has surely been better in other films.
