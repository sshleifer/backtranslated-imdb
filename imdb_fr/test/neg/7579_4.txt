I should explain that, to the extent that this trend goes to the archer of Asian horror movies, this flap is a head above The Grudge and Dark Water, while not producing the same amount of goosebumps than The Ring. <br /> <Although movies, like life, do not exist in a vacuum, they can be compared to other suspense / thriller / horror movies. Honestly, I do not write a long synopsis here and I will say that this film tries to rely on the "fright" induced by the music rather than on an atmosphere and that the "ghost" is not really remarkable. The plot is pretty basic and predictable and it's not something to write at home either on. Although there are some scenes of suspense that border on creativity, most of the film is rather vanilla. If you enjoyed The Grudge and its kind, you might like it. <br /> <br /> Grade: C-
