Hi everyone, I just wanted to give you some crazy facts about this movie. In fact, I was one of the makeup FX artists who helped create the "beast" of this movie and I must tell you that the original creature was absolutely amazing. I remember when we had the first pictures of the shoot, we all talked about the shame that this creature was in a film that would probably be quite poor. <br /> <br /> What really happened? That's because Jason Palmer originally made up the Sasquatch, but for some reason they had to go back and photograph a large part of the creature. The sad part is that Jason died a few weeks ago and the creature redone was not as impressive as the original. <br /> <br /> For me, it was pretty sad because it was the final of Jasons. film, and he was somehow cheated on his final celebrity because of the bad times. Anyway, I thought you might find that a little interesting, and if you want, you can go to the site mmmyeah.com and discover some pictures "behind the scenes". <br /> <br /> Later, Jeff
