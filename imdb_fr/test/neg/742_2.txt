I'm afraid I did not like this adaptation. When I started to watch it, I had a strange feeling of watching television shows from the 70s, because of the filter and the score. I did not like the end scene. Mr. Tilney appears dressed only in his waistcoat. Jane Austen would never have brought a man out without his frock coat. It looks like the producers have misinterpreted the dream of a romantic girl. I appreciate JA's more modern adaptations, which show an eye for these details, that make the BBC series so interesting. Sorry, waiting for the adaptation of 2007. I hope it will be better and show the benefits of Jane Austen's 20 years of adaptation.
