Do not get me wrong, I really like the TV series from League Of Gentlemen. It was funny, twisted and completely inspired. I was looking forward to the movie, the premise was interesting and I was eager to see what they had done with the characters and where the bizarre plot would lead them. <br /> <br /> It was a total disappointment, for starters. the three weakest characters in the series were the main roles and it only contained bit parts for the other characters (why not choose Mickey & Pauline, Papa Lazaro or Tubs and Edward for the main parts !?). It was really funny, half-cooked gags and mediocre humor. <br /> <br /> The real deciding factor was the ridiculous period drama / comedy (and I will use the word comedy loosely). This distracted from the main plot and felt awkward, not to say painfully not funny. The direction of the film is appalling and often gives the impression that the lines were delivered by the characters in one take. In a hurry. <br /> <br /> Then - the monster with three heads made of modeling clay. What was all this? Simply ridiculous, it seemed that the League of Gentlemen had tagged it at the end. <br /> <br /> In the end, I found myself watching my watch and sighing with disappointment throughout my filming experience. What was once an incredible television series was corrupted by a terribly funny movie. <br /> <br /> If I could give it 0 out of 10, I would do it. Do not waste your money seeing this.
