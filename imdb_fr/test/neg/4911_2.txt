weak direction, weak plot, unimpressive music, I wonder why Udita Goswami is present in the world of cinema? she tried to reveal a lot of her talent (mostly skin) but failed to impress. <br /> <br /> the music was not so impressive, only one song "Jhalak Dikhlajaa" was worth listening to .... <br /> <br /> Aksar, the title? Well, they tried to justify the title of the film at the end, but that made no sense. <br /> <br /> The story had many unwanted twists, which made it more boring. However, if someone is a fan of Dino Morea, go ahead, watch it.
