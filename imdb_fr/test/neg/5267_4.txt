I was really looking forward to watching this movie. It contained all the ingredients of a good language, but it was not at all. Kevin Spacey's accent was tolerable, except that he sometimes forgot to use it and I would NOT have preferred to listen to Linda Fiorentino's attempt. Helen Baxendale and she were totally lacking in charm and personality. Fortunately their children on the screen were full, so you can find at least a few members of his 2 endearing families. You could have used the plot with spaghetti and I'm sure the script was written by a teenage schoolchild in a high school English competition. That said, when I was not afraid, I smiled so well that it was not a total loss of 90 minutes. I found the overlay of Kevin's face on the board very clever and rather funny. Maybe I'm a bit tough but I was expecting quality viewing and it just does not come.
