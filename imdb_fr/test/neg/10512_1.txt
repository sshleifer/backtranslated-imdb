I rented this film hoping it was nil, and he did not let me down. I rented it with friends as a joke. But what we got was worse than anyone could imagine. <br /> <br /> It starts to suck even before taking it out of the box. It looks like a blade scam and the guy on the cover is not found in the movie. His name is Assassin of the vampire, but is not an assassin someone who kills for the price? Well, this guy is killing himself, so that does not make him a murderer. <br /> <br /> Then, when you insert the disc, it becomes worse. First, the animation of the menu is zero. But when you start the film, everything is terrible, whether the scenography or the lighting. You know that a movie is bad when the credits are zero. The game is laughable. The action is childish. Writing is elementary. And the staging is the worst>
