Wow! I do not even know where to start with what made this movie so awful. Perhaps I should start by simply saying that during a "stormy confrontation" between the antagonist and the protagonist, I had to leave the theater because I laugh so much. Yeah. The game was really so bad. The acting was not the worst. The plot was almost entirely shown in the previews. The characters are all grossly underdeveloped. The dialogue and the "dramatic moments" are ridiculous. The villain is an uncontrollable caricature, drunk with power, sadistic. <br /> <br /> But, the actors are pretty, so guess it was supposed to improve everything.
