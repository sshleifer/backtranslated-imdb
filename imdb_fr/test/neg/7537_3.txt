Two teenagers from the north-east of England are desperate to raise money and buy season tickets for their favorite football team. They go through a series of "comic misadventures" but finally come back smiling. <br /> <br /> The film trailer sells it like a comedy and includes most of its light moments. However, the tone is getting darker and the end result is a depressing story peopled with familiar stereotypes. The two "heroes" have no problem lying, cheating and stealing. Their opponents are an insensitive teacher, a mean father pantomime, a psychotic skinhead and a well-intentioned but incompetent social worker. The other female characters are an addicted teenager, a pregnant schoolgirl and a battered woman who seems to be smoking to death. There are no friendly characters and the audience can only feel pity or contempt. Local actors Tim Healy and Kevin Whateley both play against the guy as villains, but the writing and direction of their characters are so unidimensional that they have nothing more than a novelty value. <br /> <br /> Chris Beattie and Greg McLane perform well in both young leads. However, they are wrong because they have the wrong accent. For all those in the Northeast, it is obvious that they both come from the Sunderland / Durham area, and yet we are supposed to believe they are from Newcastle. As a Geordie, I can assure you that the accents are not the same. Take the phrase "Let the poor boy speak". We say "Let the pooa lad speak" as they say "piwer lad spiyk", with two distinctly different vowels. This discrepancy creates a ridiculous double irony in a scene on the Sunderland football field, where the two guys are trying to hide the Newcastle accents they do not have and "pretend" that they come from Sunderland - which they do it clearly. In a sweet comedy, this kind of criticism can be considered an irritation. However, the dark tone of the film clearly indicates that the writer / director Mark Herman is aiming for realism: it means "close enough", it is really far away. <br /> <br /> I was hoping this film inspires humor and optimism. and found instead old tired clich√©s. Tyneside is not a gray wasteland populated only by losers, and in telling us, Herman should have known he would be offended. It is interesting to compare the film with "Little Voice" by the same director - he is also largely morose and populated by one-dimensional characters. "Little Voice" has at least one talented heroine and does not sink into the same misery. I heard "Belter" ranked alongside "Billy Elliot" this year, but this film is a much more enjoyable and invigorating experience. <br /> <br /> Incidentally, I may be too old, but I have lived on Tyneside for 42 years, I have never heard anyone outside of this movie use the phrase "Purely Belter".
