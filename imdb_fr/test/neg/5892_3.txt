This film was very disappointing in that several elements of the book were poorly made. The main story is the same but there are several flaws that hurt the film. <br /> <br /> 1) Boobie Miles gets injured early in a Texas Tech pre-game. That means he will not do anything during the season and Chris Comer will make his appearance earlier on the team. <br /> <br /> 2) The match against Marshall was lost against Marshall. The team described as Marshall was actually the Midland High one of Permian's main rivals and here's the proof: Marshall High is the Scarlet and Silver Mavericks, Midland High is the Bulldog in purple and gold color. Look at the jerseys and you'll see who it is. In addition, the real football player Marshall High is black, the team shown was mixed as Midland High. <br /> <br /> 3) The Permian loses only against Midland Lee from a point in the district game. Midland Lee loses to Midland High and Midland High loses to Permian. These are the teams that prepare the draw as such. <br /> <br /> 4) Boobie returns to the team as a reserve of Chris Comer and, having not had time to play Midland Lee, he leaves the game. the team completely in mid -time and never stay away, nor any match. <br /> <br /> 5) Brian Chavez was a tight end and a defensive end that was number 85, not a tight end nor a reinforced security. In addition, Boobie wore number 35 and Ivory Christian number 62. <br /> <br /> 6) Coaches end up loving Chris Comer as a player more than Boobie because he has a better lifting ethic and that he runs more straightly plays as the staff prefers, this is partly why Boobie leaves the team. <br /> <br /> 7) Dallas Carter is played in Austin at the Darrell K. Royal Memorial Stadium, where the UT plays in the semi-finals and not in the final. Carter wins the state title but is forced to lose because of an ineligible player. <br /> <br /> The acting game is pretty well played, but if you read the book, you'll see that these flaws are pretty true. I'm also tired of hearing all the hypocrites from the PC complaining about the description of the Dallas Carter football team. According to the book, the team is as large, monstrous, talented and black as the film shows. People say it's racist representation, but by reading the book, you see a real description of the team. The story is very modified, giving a score of 3.5 / 10 to this film.
