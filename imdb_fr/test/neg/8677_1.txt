I doubt that the one who wrote this script ever read Mansfield Park ... or if they read it, it was not very good. None of the characters correspond to what they should be: Fanny is keen and aware of her mistreatment, while Sir Thomas, who treated her very well, seems to have accidentally fallen into Aunt Norris's personality. Moreover, a first-person account of Fanny is very inappropriate both for the story and for her character. Fanny is not a funny heroine and I would say she is not supposed to be. Moreover, in the movie version, Fanny flirts shamelessly with Edmund from the beginning, when they were raised as brother and sister! Austen's Fanny would have feared flirtation, and the novel describes the Fanny / Edmund couple as very uncomfortable ... as it should be. Unlike some of Jane Austen's other novels (P & P, Emma), Mansfield Park does not rely on the strength of her female character. It's a kind of novel very different from the others; it's not supposed to be a love story. I watched this film because I just finished reading Mansfield Park and I am absolutely horrified by what I see. Miss Austen rolls in her grave.
