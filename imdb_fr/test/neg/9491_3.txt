I would like to know the real name of the Lodge where scenes of the film were shot. It is really beautiful and recalls the architecture of the 20s and 30s, like the Hotel Del Coronado. I know it was on Big Bear Lake or Arrowhead Lake and I would like to know if it still exists. As for the film itself, it's really amazing that Jane Wyman was even nominated for an Academy Award. It must have been a time when she was well appreciated by her peers at the Academy. It would have been really interesting to get from Wyman and the other actors of this film a real impression of the scenario. The script of this film, like the recent Kevin Costner movie with a message in a bottle, is so incredible that it limits the credibility that actors can bring to their roles. Rock Hudson can be forgiven. He has never been a great actor, has managed mainly by his look and got credible role only later in his career (Pretty Maids is the exception). But Wyman must have been forced to submit this film to contractual requirements or the studio system.
