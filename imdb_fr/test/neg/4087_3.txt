If, like me, you liked the first movie "Bruce Almighty", I advise you not to hope too much. In fact, ignore any hope you have for this movie if you are above 12 and have no sense of the film. <br /> <br /> Without revealing too much, the story sees Evan (Bruce's partner presenter of the first film) move with his family in the Virginian suburbs to "Change the World" with a new political path. What follows is a rather far-fetched and rather "idiotic" tale, which clearly aims to target young children as the primary target audience. Unlike his predecessor, Evan Almighty is a family-oriented film with the ambiguous genre of "comedy" marked on his misleading "sequel" stance to which some would consider a classic of modern comedy that can be enjoyed by a little more mature , high-end public. <br /> <br /> In general, Evan Almighty himself includes terrible cinematographic values. The game; Steve Carell and Morgan Freeman were rigid and many characters were apparently thrown out to use the unnecessarily high budget allocated to production. In addition, the cast includes acting legend John Goodman, who appears as a stub and is seen only a few times in the entire movie. However, I did not quite buy the character and I thought that the scenario in which he was involved lacked depth even for a family comedy. All the other characters in the film (especially the woman and the children!) Deserve a mention for their game so corny that they could occupy a Kiev like a king. Be warned though; it's the typically Americanized cheddarfest associated with many family-oriented mainstream movies, so I'd advise you to defend yourself with the nearest rasp in sight. <br /> <br /> It may seem that the film is worth nothing so far, however, it has some promising aspects. The CGI was exceptional and it was clear that a lot of time was spent on modeling the arch and producing water effects and animating computer-generated animals towards the end. The particles, renderings and textures used were aesthetically stellar. Although a part of me can not help but think that these films did not deserve a movie with such ideals so poor and were, in my opinion, "too good" for this film and wore the movie all the way through. <br /> <br /> Overall, I consider this film a disaster in terms of continuation of a franchise with huge potential, but unfortunately the Almighty series did not lead to a bad conclusion and at the end of movie, I had set my expectations for an epic. and final in some significant way to compensate for the mediocre content I had seen so far. This was not the case and I was deeply disappointed and confused with the closing credits. As a discontent, I could not do anything, but I think the film was not as powerful as I had hoped. In many ways, the film made me think of a diluted night "The Night at the Museum" because it had a similar style and features, but unfortunately it was even inferior to it. <br /> <br /> I give this film 3 out of 10, as it is observable, but it is absolutely necessary to avoid it! If you MUST watch this film, get ready for the disappointment, because "being slightly entertained" is the best you can hope to get by watching the production.
