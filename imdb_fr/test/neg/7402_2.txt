Dresden had great expectations because of its spectacular theme and high budget. I was really looking forward to it and I really wanted it to be good ... but that's not the case. The only good thing to know is the special effects very well done, but, as in a very bad blockbuster Hollywood, everything else is missing. <br /> <br /> It is badly written, the scenario tries to respect the rules of the kind. with classic elements of suspense / love story, but there is no depth or originality. It is well below average. The next thing: it is also misdirected. He has this uninteresting television management style with a lot of close-ups and wants to be great in quick-fix action where actually no action or suspense is. The actors are not bad, but no performance has touched. <br /> <br /> I do not know ... they obviously try to make a typical TV movie and not a film for the cinema. , where it is always good to have edges and a clear visual style. But why do they try to follow the typical Hollywood trading rules? it really feels like the scriptwriter did a weekend class with a guru from the American script and then delivered that mess. Is there no producer responsible for the project who is interested in dramaturgy / visual style or simple things, at these magical cinematic moments that make some great movies?!? Do they think a television audience is stupid and does not need a high quality cinematic experience? The Downfall was a great example for a good TV movie, but there was probably a leader or producer who knew what he was doing. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time with this one, rent "down" instead ...
