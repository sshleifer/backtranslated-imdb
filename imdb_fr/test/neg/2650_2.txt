To quote a review of the film, "the film started slowly and stopped". The plot was quite credible (although some actions of the characters seemed very, very random), the script was pretty well written (in that the dialogue did not seem forced), but everything was happening too slowly. There were too many breaks between the lines and the way the lines were delivered was not great. This film had potential, but ruined it like a teenager who is taking drugs. My advice? Wait until he comes to the television before seeing him.
