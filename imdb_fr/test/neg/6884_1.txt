I watched this movie (film?) casually and I never stopped watching because it's so ridiculous that any dog ​​can play this act and will be better than the actors (actors?) of this bad remake of the fatal attraction there is no achievement, no game, only an unlucky copy of Adrian Lyne's film if you have a doubt about suicide, look at this and you can choose ... for "yes" <br /> <br /> I can not imagine the people who went to the movies to see this garbage; maybe someone who had an empty afternoon and chose the first cinema near the house to stay two hours with others to forget the problems, but it is difficult to go home relaxed
