That this movie has such a low IMDb rating is not surprising. In our post-Enron period, do we really need more reminders of America's obsession with the creed of greed? The subject has become so politically charged that many viewers will not only not be entertained by such films, but will react with barely hidden fury. It was all I could do to stay silent in this film memo about corporate corruption without extracting the DVD and breaking it into a thousand pieces. <br /> <br /> What's really boring in this kind of movies, including "Purpose", is their claim that behind the glitters, there's a meaningful message that makes the movie interesting. In "Purpose", I found no such significant message. What I found was a story that idolized the material signs of capitalist power and wealth. The two main characters, nauseating by their carelessness, perform very little real work. Instead, they party, they play golf, they strut in the cool, they sound "hip" with dialogues straight out of the MTV culture: "Rock my world" and "Now, go back to the party is an order ". John is good enough, superficial and shallow and smiles a lot. Robert, who wears great little glasses, is even worse. <br /> <br /> The film includes two young garage geeks, who seem to be coming out of the movie "Antitrust" (2001). The stereotypes are played to perfection, and in this film, we also find computer equipment with a chic look, as well as Barbie doll chicks at hand for the occasions when our future fantastic billionaires need relaxation after such a party . And with the punctuated images and dialogues that such a story requires, can you imagine how much this film will be dated in fifteen years? <br /> <br /> The best I can do for this celluloid film waste is to say that it has some beautiful aerial views of San Francisco. The film would have been a lot nicer, a lot more fun, if they had given up those odious characters and that disgusting story, and had just robbed the audience in this little plane for the duration of the movie.
