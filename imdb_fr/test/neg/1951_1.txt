Talk about garbage! I can not think of a good thing in this movie. The scenario was mediocre, the acting was terrible and the effects, well, there was none. I can not believe that the author of this movie made Identity, everything in this movie made me sick from start to finish. <br /> <br /> The cover of the video box presents a showman with a shark resembling teeth and scary eyes. I look like a scary villain, but as in the old adage "never judge a book by its cover", all the villain looked like a cut cardboard. Part of the film where a girl gets killed by a salad tong is terrible. The decor was pretty bad, as they could have put everything in Lapland but no, a tropical island instead. <br /> <br /> I took this movie as a parody, what I think they wanted, but the only thing that made me laugh in a bad way is the sticky effect you can argue that I did not watch the first movie, but I would be safe if I did not try it. <br /> <br /> The biggest joke of this movie is the effects, the snowballs looked like they were homemade and this carrot was a total embarrassment. If I guess to guess that the budget of this movie would probably be between 8 to 9 pounds fifty. The producer, panicked at the last minute, grabbed the actors for the street to give them the script that told them they had 6 minutes to practice these lines and turn on an island. <br /> <br /> painful, it was as if the actors had forgotten their usual aftershocks and had traced them. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I'm giving this film: 0 out of 5 stars
