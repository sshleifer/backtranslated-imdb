To say that this film is a complete waste of celluloid would be a euphemism. <br /> <br /> The acting was unconvincing, especially the actor Craig Fong, who could not have acted more rigidly. As for the story ... well ... what story ?! The "film" is nominally dedicated to Harry Lee, a Malaysian of Chinese origin who returns to his home country after straying from all the courses he has followed and trying to create a band. <br /> <br /> The film has always been clich√©. you can think of sex, tension between group members and some racial tension. <br /> <br /> The problem is that even with a subject adequately treated by the most amateur directors, the film is omnipresent and everything happens as if nothing had been done with elements that would train the hair even the most hardened critics. <br /> <br />
