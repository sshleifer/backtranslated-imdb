For a country that has produced some of the greatest playwrights in the world and has such a rich musical heritage, it has always troubled me to marvel at why so much of Irish cinema has been so appalling. Perhaps because, by its nature, the talents of Irish cinema have quickly abandoned their home country for British or American careers (Colin Farrell is a recent example), and that Irish filmmakers who have continued to working in Ireland and with Irish subjects, they made their films with international money and an eye on the international market. I am thinking in particular of Jim Sheridan and Neil Jordan, who alternate Irish films and projects shot abroad. <br /> <br /> "Middletown" is an Irish film though two of its main actors are English. It is certainly well done and could have resisted the tendency that Irish films are not really very good; ("I Went Down" by Paddy Breathnach, written by brilliant young playwright Conor McPherson, is a crucial exception). Unfortunately, this fundamentalism story takes place in a fictitious Irish town, presumably located in the north of Ireland, judging by the accents (middle belt of Ulster middle, if you ask me), and probably in the recent past (fifties?), is so exaggerated that it's really ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Nothing in the film sounds right and you can not help but think that its author, Daragh Carville, was strongly influenced by Flannery. O'Connor and the fact that all this could have made more sense if it had been placed in the American biblical belt and not in Ireland where even the most extreme Protestant fundamentalist had never been so insane. All of this is supposed to be a kind of grand puddle and it certainly is, although I'm more inclined to laugh than shiver to the right of Reverend Matthew Macfayden's antics. He has the accent of Ulster and there is nothing abnormal in his acting, nor even in that of Daniel Mays, his brother, Gerard McSorley in the role of his father or Eva Birthistle in the Mays wife, but the scenario is so drifting that acting can not do anything. to save the movie. So, rather than climb the ladder of Irish cinema, "Middletown" is, I'm afraid, one more nail in his coffin.
