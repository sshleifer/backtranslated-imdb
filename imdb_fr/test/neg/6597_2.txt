Even though I sat down and looked at it, I must say it was not good. It was everywhere, with a lot of missing pieces of information about how things grew and even inaccurate at times also.If you know nothing about Michael, you will understand nothing. You have to rely on your current knowledge of man to make certain things meaningful. The action was a bit dramatic, Flex Alexander looked nothing like Michael, which was disappointing for me and towards the end. He literally looked gray. He said that he described Michael as a somewhat naive but very positive, kind and loving individual, which was good, even if he was still ridiculed from time to time. If you want to watch the story of MJ's life, check out "An American Dream". It's much better, but the only thing to do is that it will cover up to the "bad" time. I do not doubt that they will eventually make a big budget movie of the story of the life of MJ, because Michael You rock ;-) !!!!
