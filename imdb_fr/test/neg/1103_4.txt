The death of children and horror films will always remain a delicate and controversial combination and, therefore, my personal opinion is that every film showing the courage to turn around this subject should be given special attention by the share horror fans. Of course, as in the case of "Wicked Little Things", controversial themes do not always guarantee a good movie. Despite the potentially interesting plot, the atmospheric scene and the involvement of the video-villainous director JS Cardone ("The Slayer"), it is a film devoid of any inspiration and cliché that would not offer a single fear or a single shock. After losing their husband and father, the remaining Tunny women (their mother Karen and daughters Sarah and Emma) settle in a remote mountain town in the Pennsylvanian, where they inherited an old dilapidated mansion. Their new home is dangerously close to the old ruins of the mine where dozens of innocent children tragically lost their lives in 1913. Strange things begin to happen, like the young Emma befriending a girl (imaginary? ) Who lived in their house. the inhabitants seem to keep secrets from Karen and her daughters. It soon turns out that the undead children are still leaving their mining pits at night to avenge the descendants of the owner of the mine, Mr. Carlton, who was responsible for their deaths. "Wicked Little Things" is rather tame and extremely predictable. The scenario shamelessly serves ugly clichés, like car wheels stuck in the mud at crucial moments, faulty flashlights and horribly broken dolls. There is very little suspense, let alone gore and makeup effects are unfortunately low. Zombified children do not seem threatening. In fact, they all look like miniature versions of Marilyn Manson, with their black outfits, their pale faces and their dark eyes. The finale without excitement is stupid and just as derivative as the rest of this useless production. Lori Heuring is absolutely not impressive in her lead role as a mother, but Scout Taylor-Compton (currently a big star thanks to the remake of "Halloween") and young Chloe Moretz are enough as girls.
