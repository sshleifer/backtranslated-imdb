Beware of the buyer. The Alpha Video version uses an impression that defies description. The film was shot in color, but you would not know it for the first 25 minutes or so. The impression used is so faded and decrepit that it looks almost tinged with sepia. After 30 minutes, color gets into the print but from there to the conclusion, the color comes and goes. Remember that even at best, the color is pale and faded. It seems that the print was recorded on a TV that did not receive the best reception possible. Adding to this parody is the most painful delivery of lines that I can remember. Even the narration is a stupor. Each line is delivered in this irritating and painful behavior. I found myself hoping they would hurry and get the words out. Because of this, I could not wait for this movie to end. It's one of those bad films, but I hope someone will find a half-decent impression.
