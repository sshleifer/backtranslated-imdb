There are films that are not released in theaters but in video. This one should be allowed to age and disintegrate as does the old stock of nitrate film. No history, incompetent violence, exaggerated, badly written and what is a pity, it is that the star was not the only negative element of the film. And I liked and appreciated some of Siegel's other films.
