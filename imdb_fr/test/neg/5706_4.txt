Before I begin, let me blame you: I'm a big fan of John Eyres's first film, PROJECT: SHADOWCHASER. The film, a B-level cross of THE TERMINATOR & DIE HARD, may not be the work of a cinematic genius, but an extremely entertaining action movie that has become a cult hit (and one that has generated two suites and a spin-off). <The judge and the jury begin with Joseph Meeker, a convicted murderer who was sent to death row after his capture after the so-called "Bloody Shootout" (which seems to be a bad name for a slaughter?) Kills three people. trying to break into a convenience store), by being driven to the electric chair. There is a fun scene where Meeker talks to the priest about the possibility of living for sex but meeting his only true love (killed in the shooting), expressing his revenge for the person who killed him? Michael Silvano, a dilapidated football star who spends his days watching his son Alex practice football with his high school team (and ends up harassing his son's coach). But once executed, Meeker comes back (or as Kelly Perine calls "a hamburger without fries"), whose only goal is to take revenge, which basically means that Silvano's life will become a misery. <br /> <br /> Let me emphasize that Judge and Jury is not a real horror movie. It's a supernatural action movie, with Meeker chasing Silvano, using his ability to change his form (which comes down to David Keith disguised as everything from an Elvis impersonator, a French chef (with an accent as bad as his mustache), a drag queen, a clown and a comedian), a shotgun firing explosive shells and an invulnerability to death (although this does not prevent Martin Kove from shooting at Keith with a Desert Eagle), to restore to Silvano the murder of Meeker's wife. <br /> Director John Eyres does not seem to be interested in characterizations but focuses only on action scenes, which the film contains in abundance. But this is the main flaw of the film because there is nothing that connects the action scenes. The acting is surprisingly good, Keith performing best, brilliantly supported by Kove, and Paul Koslo, who plays the faded policeman pretty well. Kelly Perine is annoying as a taxi driver trying to help but aggravates the situation.
