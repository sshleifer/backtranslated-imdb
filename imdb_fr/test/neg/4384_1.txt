If anyone from National Lampoon reads this, PLEASE STOP YOUR FIGHTING, REALLY DRAW YOUR BUM, REALLY NOW! Why on earth are you doing movies like that? They are not funny and watching it for sexual content is a total waste of time, really. It's such a horrible film that you might want to film yourself while watching it. I'm serious here, guys, that makes Harol and Kumar go to blah blah blah blah to a really good movie (and we all know that H & K is one of the worst movies ever made). How bad is it? Well, even the losers who really love National Lampoon will hate this movie ... they will want to murder the director, I swear to God. I hate you, National Lampoon, die already. Die.
