My friend Zac rented this film for free because his mother works in a rental shop. I always feel scammed because I will never be able to recover those 100 minutes of my life. After watching the first "Dark Harvest" the night before that, I was expecting at least a rotten remake of the first movie. False. <br /> <br /> There is not a single scarecrow in the film (unless you count the cover of the box), nor real death scenes. The film got the grade R of an 8 year old girl shouting "his god to his father". <br /> <br /> There is no amount of tequila that could make this movie bearable. Believe me, we tried.
