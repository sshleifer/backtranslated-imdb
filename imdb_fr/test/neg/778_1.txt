I do not understand why so many comments seem to indicate that this is acceptable entertainment. The overwhelming horror of this cinematic monstrosity can not be overstated. My girlfriend and I just watched this together, and I'm not sure we can ever have sex again. I do not know what was worse, the lean, unattractive cast, their extremely photogenic genitals, attempts at rancorous humor, squealing noises that claimed to be songs ... <br /> <br /> No I know what was the worst of all. The girls in the green jerseys, with the green face painting, licking Alice to dry it, then proposed, with a broken infantile speech, to suck the milk from her breasts. It was the worst. <br /> <br /> In addition, what about nurses and why do they seem to have so much trouble finding themselves in the vagina? Why are all male actors gay? Why does Humpty Dumpty wiggle a dildo in the air and claim that it's his penis? Why did my eyes have to see that? There are no words.
