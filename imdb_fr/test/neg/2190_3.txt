Los Angeles doctor Tom Reed (Vincent Ventresca) survives a tragic car accident but ends up in prison in California's high desert. When his time is up, he lands in a small, windswept town called Purgatory Flats. His first stop is a bar, where he quickly taps a beer and gets hired as a bartender. This is for ex-inmates who have trouble finding work. This is the first in a long series of absurdities that make up the plot of the ridiculous screenwriter of screenwriter / director Harris Done, a modern and desert black film. <br /> <br /> His first night at work Tom meets a sexy femme fatale Sunny Sunny, with a family of mean boys: the Mecklins, who include Uncle Dean (Gregg Henry) and his two nephews, the addict Owen (Kevin Alejandro), Sunny's husband, and soldier AWOL Randy (Brian Austin Greer of "90210"). Once his shift is over, there is a shootout and Dr. Tom is right there. He agrees to treat one of the wounded and, above all, to say nothing to the cops. I'm not sure it's a good choice for a guy who just came out of the pen, but this script (co-written by Diane Fine) has very little to do with logic. <br /> <br /> Tom makes a series of bad decisions that make him even more entangled with crime-prone Mecklin Boys, including stealing medical supplies and jumping into the bag with Sunny. Everyone in the theater yells, "Do not do it, get away," but Tom does it anyway. <br /> <br /> In a classic black film like "Body Heat" or "Double Indemnity", we seek and sympathize with William Hurt and Fred McMurray as they are trained in the canvas of brilliant, sexy and sneaky such as Kathleen Turner and Barbara Stanwyck. It's not their fault. We would probably be tempted by all that money or that particular woman. But Dr. Tom's weakness seems to come from stupidity rather than circumstances. Sunny is sexy but her character is not very convincing and there is no money to try it. You wonder if he attended the same medical school as Dr. Nick Riveria of "The Simpsons". <br /> <br /> The silly scenario would make you think that the rural house of a redneck has almost everything you need to treat a stomach shot, and whoever is injured could easily attract attention and participate effectively in a fight with fists. This gives us an unlikely car chase with one of those "The Club" stuff hanging on the wheel. Oh, this tanker that just exploded - no one noticed it. <br /> <br /> I wonder how such a ridiculous scenario has already received the green light? Brian Austin Greer may have more juice than I gave him. It is obvious that he took the relatively modest role of Randy - a twilit murder - to show the producers that he had greater autonomy than he showed on "90210". <br /> <br /> Nicholas Turturro plays a Hispanic stereotypical drug dealer. He deserves better than that. <br /> <br /> If you have an IQ greater than 50, "Purgatory Flats" will make you shake your head in disbelief. I'll give it 3 stars for unintentional laughs and scenes with the sexy Miss Holden running in her red panties.
