Depressing black comedy on a woman (Mia Farrow) who flees her house on Christmas Eve when she discovers that her husband (Tony Goldwyn) has hired a hitman to kill her. She ends up with a husband and wife (Scott Glenn and Mary-Louise Parker), then things go wrong. Basically, Farrow continues to run and continually encounters VERY strange people and finds himself in morally ridiculous situations. <br /> <br /> This was announced as a good movie when I saw it approaching Christmas at its VERY short time in an art cinema. I found him sick, not funny and just depressing. I like black humor, but it was too dark for me. What happened to the character of Parker in particular was horrible. To make matters worse, Eileen Brennan is later incorporated as a nun (!!!) and chews the landscape with enthusiasm. <br /> <br /> The only thing that saves is the role of Farrow: it is much better the image deserves. It was also a relief to see the very talented Stephen Dorff appear at the end. The end itself was pretty cool but it could not erase what had happened before. <br /> <br /> A "comedy" sick, morbid and absolutely dark. A 1
