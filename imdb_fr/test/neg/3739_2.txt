I love John's work as a singer, but the movie was dull and not worth watching. <br /> <br /> I thought he had done a job "ok" playing his role. When he says "you have an affair with the old man", I laugh a little to his companions, his movements of the face ... or his absence. <br /> <br /> I would suggest the movie if you like John's music but not like a Saturday night video. <br /> <br /> If you like his music, the video contains some music from him, but not much. <br /> <br /> So so ... at best
