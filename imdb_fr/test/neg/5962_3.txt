This is an excellent example of what could have been a good movie and a good idea, but it turned out to be very bad at the same time. I was especially tempted to get it because of the DVD jacket, stupid me, but I did it anyway and I was blown away, in a bad way. This film mainly deals with the disaster caused by El Chupacabra around Los Angeles. It is up to an animal policeman and a writer to save the situation, before two corrupt policemen and two evil scientists shoot them down. The main reason I did not like this movie was because of big continuity errors that are hard to miss. With a few bad actors, correct lighting and nothing scary, this film did not hit me as much as it should have been. However, compared to other films of Chupacabra, this one certainly figures at the top of the classification. <br /> <br /> First of all, the continuity of this film is very false, and I hear the shoulders and the bottom of the ditch. There were so many points where the characters said or did something and then in the next move, they did not do it or the change never happened. Example: the main character has a rifle, attacks Chupacabra, he comes out of nowhere and distracted and the gun is missing. The girl runs as he defends himself here with a mysterious talent and that she had no weapon, so the main character runs with the girl and has the weapon. Where does the flair come from and what happened to the weapon? The time of day is fucked. One minute, he is lying on the sun and you can still see the sun. The next minute, it looks like midnight. Why was there Chupacabra there, what did the scientists do, what happened to that guy, and why did he shoot that animal and he always lived? These things bothered me and none of the questions were answered. <br /> <br /> The next on the list is the acting game. Boy was it wooden and bad. The main character, Navarro, played by Eric Algeria, seems a little too quiet in places and too determined to discover what killed a few dogs and when a tragedy occurs, his emotion was simply not there. Elina Madison, who played Starlina, did a pretty mediocre job. She was the author of a bestselling book about Chupacabra and she simply did not seem to be in her role or performance. His game was laughable and poor. Even for an author, she knows too much about this issue and knows how to disable a high security defense system in a hidden lab. Tony Criss was fine, but he seemed a little calm for some of the things that were happening. The film reminds me of a bad reenactment for a crime-solving show where actors and actresses are not really attached to their work. <br /> <br /> It's rare that I do not get this anal when it comes to lighting or editing, but for this movie, I could not help but be hard with it lighting. It took me out of the movie many times because the light was poorly directed. Sometimes they tried to be creative by adding color filters to the scene to make it more "comical", but it turned against them. The worst is the night when it is dark outside, but the scene is so saturated with light that it seems to be his day. They continue to move from high intensity light to soft light for random scenes, and the lights look so bright that the actors narrowed their eyes. It should not be so bright that there are dark shadows at night. At sunset, when the lighting was perfect, it was the only time the light was good, other than that, it was terrible. <br /> <br /> There was no fright in this film. There was only one time I jumped, but other than that, it was not scary. There were points where it might have been scary but there was so much light, we could see the Chupacabra approaching the man, but if it was dark, it would have been better. Even the creature's drawing for chupacabra was mediocre, it looked good but it was a small man or child dressed in a protective suit. They did not hide his face. they showed him without any sense of mystery or any enigmatic appearance. There was a good amount of blood, but it seemed unreal. This movie was just not scary. <br /> <br /> Overall, they have Americanized a great South American legend into a bloodthirsty human eater, unlike Chupacabra. In fact, he was afraid of people and he was just killing goats, sheep, dogs and deer, because he hated to say he hated the smell of humans. But then, what would be the story? I did not like this movie for any reason, but I will give them the credit of trying to make a good movie with good intentions. I would not recommend this movie to a horror movie fan, but if you like independent movies or B-movies, you should take a look at that. Moreover, if you are easily tempted by cult classics, you will appreciate this film. I have not seen it again, I will never see it again, but in a way, I like that kind of movie just to see what the other side of Hollywood is doing.
