it's annoying that I had about 3 minutes while going to work to stop at the video store and it was 2 hours for one night and I was really intrigued by the mid-term photo of the star". <br /> <br /> I guess this movie shows what the New York Film School and Mr. Papa's fortune - judging by the biography of this clown in mind - can do for you and you and you, because that's about what we have here and in addition, a photo of the main "actor" with someone else's body in a still image that does not happen anywhere in the movie. it's strange because, in many ways, money was injected, of course, but from the beginning, when all the extras made fun of their terror scene, that does not bode well. to be had a certain charm if it had been done for 2 cents! In a short time, I jumped scenes and I made a quick advance to see the picture on the box, it was all that really mattered to me. strange, why not rent a porn or something like that? but wow there's a bad acting game that's funny I guess and a bad acting game that's just bad. Robert Englund is pathetic enough with everyone. this makes you appreciate the most horrible video horrors that exist. . . blah most of which I would not care. should look at hellhest 3 if I wanted to see a pack of 8! I imagine that old gay guys with 2 minutes in the video store are going to be the main tenants and they should start a class action!
