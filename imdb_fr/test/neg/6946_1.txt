This movie is not even enough for the dollar trash at the grocery store. <br /> <br /> I only bought it because Terrence Howard was there. I guess he could not be too demanding about his roles during this time. <br /> <br /> The film itself was difficult to obtain. It seems like they were hounding around a story. The "guys night" must have been the most boring I've ever seen. One minute, they talk and the next narrator of poetry? Even the arguments were hard to follow. Most of the actors lacked depth. <br /> <br /> I have no idea what they were looking for with this one, but they certainly missed the goal.
