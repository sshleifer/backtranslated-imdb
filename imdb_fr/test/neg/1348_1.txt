I was very disappointed with this movie. Mrs. English, who claims to be a fan of the original film, seems to have taken a great artistic job and turned it into a "ho-hum" dish, you've come a long way in producing a baby. I tried to love Mary Haines from Meg Ryan, but she was just boring. She did not seem to feel anything about her husband's case. There was no emotional struggle, no deep wound. In the original 1939 film, Norma Shearer's Mary Haines felt betrayed, shocked, vulnerable, confused, and angry. The 2008 production was more about a fictional theme (in my wife's words) and did not make you cry or even laugh. The only performances worthy of attention are Debra Messing and Bette Midler. (I wanted more from Bette.) There really was no protagonist in this movie. Sylvia Fowler's character had too many sub-themes. And Crystal Allen did not have a fire. The remake of the meeting with department stores with Annette Benning and Miss Mendez was Luke Warm. Also the pace was slow too. Obviously, the 1939 version had to be updated, but it was not. The reason the original version worked so well was that the characters were dealing with "man" problems. A subject besides which is not old-fashioned. The magic of the original movie was that the film spoke of both sexes, whereas you have never seen men.
