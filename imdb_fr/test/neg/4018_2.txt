When you're used to Lana Turner in The Postman Always Twice Rings twice, and you compare it to this low-budget movie, low talent, mediocre quality, well, I was just embarrassed by Ida's "singing" Lupino (rather like talking) and not piano playing scenes. When the first unsung scene started and everybody stared at it, I was sure they would all roll their eyes and start to leave or at least talk to each other (she stinks, go ahead, get out of right here ). The actors are flat - the emotions are deflated. And Ida is a real bi-otch spoiled all the way - just a total disconnect. It was as if Betty Boop, under conscious sedation, was meeting a pump attendant in the American city of nowhere. The story was flat, the music was flat, the acting was flat, his chest was ... no, nothing to do. I felt sad for the rest of the actors. Maybe if the good role was to be attributed to the good actress and the male actors had more emotion, the film could have had a chance. Sorry to offend those of you who thought it was down to earth. It would not have bothered me if he had stayed out of this world.
