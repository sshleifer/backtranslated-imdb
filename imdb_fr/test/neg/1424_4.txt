As Ben Elton has already observed, nothing is faster than comedy. Steve Martin's latest offer - "The Pink Panther 2" - recently opened to bad reviews and disappointing box-office results, while Mike Myers' "The Love Guru" seems to have won few admirers . <br /> <br /> In 1970, it was Jerry Lewis's turn to feel the pain of rejection (ironically, his character in this movie has a funny twist every time someone uses this word in his presence) when 'Which Way To The Front?' <br /> <br /> In this comedy about the Second World War, he plays "Brendan Byers 111", the richest man in the world, who wants to be part of the army his patriotic duty (and also because he is bored to succeed) but is rejected because he is medically unfit. He then decides to create his own privately funded army, recruiting other 4-Fs. <br /> <br /> They wear ridiculous uniforms similar to those worn by "International Rescue" in "Thunderbirds" and enter formation. Some good visual gags here. When they launch rocket launchers, they look happy until they learn that they have just destroyed a Texaco gas station! Wanting to learn German, Brendan recorded a long record entitled "Songs To Mein Kampf By". When this army sits down to eat, instead of being in a dubious dining room, it is in an opulent room adorned with a chandelier. <br /> <br /> John Wood is very funny like "Finkel", never. -so English butler. His best scene is when he makes a mafia-type gangster sing to teach him to kill the Byers Brigade. <br /> <br /> The script was not written by Jerry, but by Gerald Gardiner and Dee Caruso, author of many episodes. from 'The Monkees'. "Front" often looks like a sitcom for television. In fact, you almost expect to hear a trailer of laughter. <br /> <br /> Things are going badly in the last thirty minutes, when Byers replaces a high Nazi commander and after ordering the Germans to withdraw from the front, he takes part in the plot to kill Hitler (and Tom Cruise is nowhere in sight!). As commander, Jerry performs a performance so stupefyingly inept that it defies description. He gives Brian Blessed a chance to earn his money in the "The Strongest Man alive" stake. This comes as a relief when the end credits appear. <br /> <br /> Maybe the timing was wrong - doing a comedy of war while the Vietnam conflict was raging was not a good idea. Or the audience just had enough of Jerry (this beard probably did not help!). He needed a good producer here, a person who took it in hand and said, "That gag stinks, throw it!" "Do not climb the bridge, lower the river" is a masterpiece compared to this image. <br /> <br /> In the early 70's, the new comedy icons would be Woody Allen, Mel Brooks and Monty. Python - cooler, more biting and in Allen's case, more humane comedy styles have replaced Jerry's slapstick brand. It would not be until 1982 that he could make a successful comeback - as a pretentious talk show host "Jerry Langford" in Martin Scorcese's brilliant film "The King Of Comedy".
