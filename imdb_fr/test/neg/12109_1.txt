To say that this film is the work of Sebastian at its best, just tell you everything you need to know about this man. Sebastian is a pathetic animator, stupid, not fun at best, yet very popular on French television. If watching one of his shows is simply a torture for a normally constituted human being, his first film (only leaves hope) turned out to be the worst. Sebastien's excuses for the rape (the victim fell in love with his attacker) are not only inappropriate but clearly unacceptable. I strongly suggest you do not bother to look at this picture (or any of the future features of Sebastian), you would simply lose your time ... There is something on French television that does not feel good .. and it's Patrick SÃ©bastien !!!
