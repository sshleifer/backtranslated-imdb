another is in the making. self-promotion, bad scenario excuse for a horror director. victor is as far from the new horror icon as mary poppins (referring to Disney's score). What is happening here? you have marilyn manson opening and closing this piece of shit and chitty chitty bang bang all through this one. can it even be called horror? horrible, yes, but the horror is a stretch. David Lynch should sue them for stealing Elephant Man's prosthetics. Please, stop those fans who want to be administrators now. Filmmakers already have enough competition in the film industry. getting online and talking about the quality of your movie does not make it true. stop the madness. I work in the industry and yes, these movies are fun, but rarely fun to watch.
