By the time the Hellraiser franchise reached its fourth movie, the premise was a little thin. Dr. Paul Merchant (Bruce Ramsey) is a scientist of the future who, while a prisoner, regales his captor and tells how his ancestors (all played by Ramsey) built for the first time the Lament Configuration breakbox that installs evil on the world. and how his line then dealt with this box. The film is full of lack of continuity with other films and lack of coherence in it. Yes, it could be due to a combination of rewrites, massive cuts in the original version of the film or whatever. But I review the film as it is, not what it was or could have been. And as it is now, it's a mess. Of course, the franchise will continue indefinitely with DVD sequels, but it was a major obstacle to his chances of getting a new theatrical release theatrically. <br /> <br /> My note: D-
