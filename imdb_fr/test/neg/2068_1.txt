As a film reviewer for a local gay magazine, I'm automatically referred to any fiasco if it contains a homo. The chicken Tikka Masala is in the background as I write this. I gave him my full attention for 53 minutes before I found myself screaming - like a sick Tourrette - "This is the test film I've ever seen". We arrive just at the emotional climax where the son gives an outgoing speech to his father at his wedding. Father seems to be taking it. An attempted murder of honor at this stage would have at least allowed to animate a little film. And made it more funny. <br /> <br /> I did not particularly like Beautiful Thing, for example, but I could at least understand why other people loved her. It was done with a certain professionalism and I think I remember that it had at least some good lines. The lack of wit in this movie is quite amazing - even the most mediocre sitcoms will tend to have recognizable jokes. The film closest to this film started to be funny (at least in its first 53 minutes) was the subtitled comment addressed to the fat, unattractive female chef "Look at her with her legs wide open - she's like the Mersey tunnel. " Completely without intelligence and I did not smile, but I could imagine someone with a low IQ (who may be working in a french fries store) enjoying it. <br /> <br /> I guess it's an atrocity funded by the lottery. If not, I can at least console myself with the fact that the sponsors will lose a lot of money because even a low-budget British film will still cost a few million dollars to someone. Seriously, if I met the most beautiful guy in the world and, returning home to make love, I found a copy in his DVD collection ("Man, I love this movie"), I would probably give a kick. him in the nuts and leave immediately. And this from someone who has been away for about six months without the aforementioned sweet love. <br /> <br /> Oh Lord I hate this movie.
