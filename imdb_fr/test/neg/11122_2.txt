Well, the Sci-Fi chain keeps pushing these turkeys ... and they seem to get worse every time. When good actors such as John Rhys-Davies and Giancarlo Espositto present themselves as rank-lovers, you can imagine how disastrous the REPOS of actors in disarray is. The only decent halfway thing is the creature's rubber outfit (which is caught in such fast flashes that you do not really have time to see how wrong it is). The dialogue ... the plot ... if this "movie" (and I use the term loosely) was food, Jack-In-The-Box would be a gourmet meal compared to that. Attend the replay of "The Munsters" for the 372nd edition - your time would be better spent (and a lot more scary too)!
