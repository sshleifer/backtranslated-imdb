COMMITTED is still a love affair with the trimmings specially designed for a young and targeted audience. The direction seems very basic, with an obvious dramatic irony and a classic case of the loser lost against the unintelligent clerk. COMMITTED is visible at times and there is a small sense of originality from Lisa Krueger. <br /> <br /> ENGAGED is completely aimless for the first twenty minutes. We meet Joline but the film starts again when her husband disappears. Joline goes out looking for him. <br /> <br /> Some pieces are strange. Other times, the film hangs. The second part is more humorous, because we see the spiritual antics of Joline intensify. The annoying guitar music is terrible, but maybe a necessary evil as COMMITTED offers very little anyway. An average film hindered by totally useless moments, the only asset of COMMITTED is Heather Graham and Patricia Velazquez.
