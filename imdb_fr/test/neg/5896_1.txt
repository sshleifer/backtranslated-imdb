This documentary was very amateurish. It could have been done by students. Assuming this is the case, my notation is as follows. Contents: C, Sound Quality: F, Cinematography: F, Active: D, Soundtrack: F, Casting: C, Boobshot: A ...... General Note: D <br /> <br /> I am I found myself getting Seasickness as we walked the streets with the characters, moving with each movement of the cameraman. My mother-in-law even changed the batteries in her miraculous ear and she could not hear the muffled dialogue. A thorough post-production and CGI editing would not help this bomb. These students would pass "hardly" my course. My advice ... do not waste your time and money on "A".
