Now, do not get me wrong, I like bad movies ... no, I love bad movies, Troll 2 .... painful ouch, Manos The hands of destiny ... Just look at Torgo, Guru the crazy monk ... traffic noise in the medieval context? OK, so it's clear, but it's one of those movies that obviously wanted to be better, but that did not succeed. Why not? Well, it would be easy to blame the plot, but hey, we saw worse, there were not too many holes and hey, I know there is not a lot of originality, but it does not take much not kill a movie. The effects are not bad (if you completely ignore the last scene), the monster is fine, the truck is quite threatening so where did it go wrong? Well, I'd love to blame the "Chris Moyles" lookalike like Harley ... so I'll do it! Comedy and horror are hard to mix, bad comedy and horror are even worse and the problem is there. I hated this guy from the moment he lifted his head (literally), continuing to stammer Adam, too sweet, becomes annoying, so annoying that you lose the belief that the sweetest of us would not react in pushing him out of the moving car. door ... and I thought it was the monster the director was supposed to have trouble convincing us. Why are bad movies fun? Well, you have a lot of fun making holes, laughing at the screenplay, screaming, and so on. This film is not part of the coveted category of "Worst Movies" because it is simply bad because of its annoying nature. Do not bother, go look something else and you'll be a better person for that ... promised! (Fade to the songs of Torgo Torgo Torgo)
