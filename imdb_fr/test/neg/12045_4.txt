I saw this movie when it came out and I hated it. I have just seen him 27 years later. In fact, I liked some of these things ... even though Robin Williams was totally wrong for the role ... What I remember most about hating the movie is that it was almost the opposite of what I I understood from reading the book. As I have not re-read it, I can only give you my impressions of the past - but I'm sure of one thing - the film is a paean for family life, while in the book, almost ALL institutions traditions - including, and perhaps most importantly, marriage - are dummies that we would be rid of. The only good thing about this book is the wonderful nature of the kids ... something that only the beginning and the end of the movie really captures (with this unbelievably beautiful baby floating in the air.) Too bad that Williams does not have a tenth its charm!) My weak note comes from the fact that the film badly represents the book. As a film, it sells better, but only for a few key performances. Mary Beth Hurt is wonderful - I think anyone who looks at her would fall in love with her. And John Lithgow as a former football player who had a sex change operation is fantastic ... he never camped it or made the character commendable - and as such, his performance was of a incredible integrity. I watched him closely during all his scenes, and he was never anything but a woman. Nothing in his performance ever approached the performance of a drag queen ... and that made all the difference. In fact, among all the characters of the film, it is the only one that is irreproachable. It is worth seeing this movie only for its performance.
