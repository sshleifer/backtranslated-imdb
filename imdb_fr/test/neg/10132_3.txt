Natalie Wood plays Courtney Patterson, a polio disabled songwriter who tries to avoid victimization because of her first romantic relationship with her partner, lawyer Marcus Simon, played by Wood's husband, Robert Wagner. The film is heavily cut, but the majority of the remaining scenes show a very weak hand of the director, which allows Wagner to sleep in a constant way, thereby devastating a solid and nuanced performance of Wood, who also offers a beautiful soprano. The scenario is somewhat banal but the persistent nature of Wagner's dramatic gap has unfortunately remained in place, as he is left free to impose his casual gaze on Wood, which must discourage an actress. The progression of their relationship is presented in an erratic way and this, associated with an agitated edition, leads the spectator to be less assured of what is happening, the motivation being almost totally ignored in the writing. Although little differentiated, cinematography shines during a brief scene where Wood is placed in a patio and, following the sound of a door that closes, remains in the center while the camera eye moves away gradually to show his helplessness and fragility. More controlled leadership would have allowed the performers, even the Wagner Boxes, to adapt their game to engaging relationships; at the time of publication, there is for the most part a huge lack of commitment.
