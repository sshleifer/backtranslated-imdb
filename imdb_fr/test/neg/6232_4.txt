as in so many movies from the past, you'd think Hollywood would learn it now, which makes it a very disappointing movie, not to mention to make sure that the kidnapped victim is alive and well before paying the ransom. <br /> <br /> Maybe this movie wants to remember these basic facts in case this happens to one of us. Why this long walk in the woods and a guy from the city can he really cross the woods without getting lost? Just an opportunity for a sentimental dialogue that ultimately made no sense. <br /> <br /> I had to listen to some of the director's commentary in the special features section, from the great Redford initiatives in the past, (Sneakers for one) surprised that he agrees to play in such a movie. The comments and the reasons of the director were weak. <br /> <br /> The best part of this movie was the landscape, look forward to spring.
