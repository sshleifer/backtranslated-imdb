This film was poorly designed, poorly written and played badly. All the characters were in two dimensions. It was a real amateurish attempt. The film was a fundamentalist Christian propaganda. Christian characters are holier than you and they have no compassion for skeptical or undecided characters. The film was a real "gotcha" for the skeptical character and myself as a spectator, putting us in a very uncomfortable situation. I complained to the theater management and was given a free pass for another movie. I remember another film on a similar subject, "The Rapture", starring Mimi Rogers, who was much better and done professionally. I think I'll watch "The Rapture" again. If you attend "Unidentified" and do not like it, do not say that I did not warn you.
