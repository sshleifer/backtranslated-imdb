This woman is a terrible comedian. She can not make a joke. She does not have a real character. This is another example of typical American garbage, which people laugh at because they do not know how to react, so they say, "Well, it's a comedy," so I laugh, I guess. <Br /> <br /> I can not stand this miserable woman and her excuse pi $$ for comedy. She deserves nothing more than to boo it. <br /> <br /> Why can not America overturn this kind of Turkish delight and opt for something that really has some humor. <br /> <br /> She's not funny. Not at all. Why oh why does one person like this idiot?
