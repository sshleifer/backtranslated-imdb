The ruins are in Turistas like Deep Impact in Armageddon, a worse version of a slightly entertaining film, but much worse. One of the characters is supposed to go to medical school, so why are they all late? "you can not continue cutting." -Best line trains this movie. It's a horrible film. I like horror movies, but I really appreciate the fact that most of them are terrible, but I was really looking forward to this movie after reading the reviews on IMDb. The situation they are in is stupid and the way they handle it makes them stupid. It is awful, but it is the Australian context, despite the fact that they spend the vast majority of the film in the same place, which makes it a little acceptable.
