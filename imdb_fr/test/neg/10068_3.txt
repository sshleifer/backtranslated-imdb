Although it comes after three wars of the world, Krull and countless other films, this film would look obsolete in the 1950s ... 1 SFX is mainly made up of video game effects of the 1970s such as bolts, etc. boring after a short time. You also get an SFX creature that looks like a poor man's version of some tier IV Harryhausen monster. <br /> <br /> 2 sets are mostly ruins of the countryside, with paper mache temples and miniature cities that Japanese 1950s monster movies look like flawless perfection. <br /> <br /> 3 The scenario is an extra-fine paper ... Hercules must find the seven golden thunders of Zeus stolen by conspiratorial gods and zombie tyrants. <br /> <br /> 4 actions consist mainly of late Hercules and muscular (check the variety of facial expressions) fighting the effects of video games of the 1970s cheap. <br /> <br /> 5 actor award to Milly Carlucci (third sister of Carlucci show-biz with Anna & Gabriella), who says it all. <br /> <br /> 6 SFX makes other Italian Level 2 salad bowl films such as UMANOIDE & STAR CRASH look like masterpieces. <br /> <br /> The main achievement of Ferrigno was to imitate a delayed green monster, dressed in a whig and green espadrille, you have to be indulgent. <br /> <br /> Look at him and forget him.
