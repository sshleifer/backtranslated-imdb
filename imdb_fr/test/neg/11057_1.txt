I found this film for a dollar (1 dollar) and the movie was a total waste of time. Reb Brown (Mark Hardin) played the role of military advisor in South America and managed to capture the leader of rebel soldiers operating in dense jungles. However, Mark joins the opposing camp after horrific torture has been inflicted on women and men. In a scene where Mark drinks a glass in a hotel bar, his eyes take a look at the sexy long legs Sandra Spencer (Shannon Tweed), "Dead Sexy", 01. Mark and Sandra are extremely fond of one of the other and even make passionate love on very hard rocks, without having time to take the comfort of a bed. It's a horrible movie and it's not worth wasting time watching it.
