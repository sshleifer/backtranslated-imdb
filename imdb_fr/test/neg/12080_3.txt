<br /> <br /> This film was produced and released to succeed a slanderous Calomnian beach comedy - Hardbodies - although quite popular - but it has little or no connection to the movie previous and is better evaluated in its entirety. own right. It is certainly better than Hardbodies I and is more closely related to such films as Venus and Summer Lovers, which have also been filmed during the summer in the Greek Islands. The combination of wonderful blue berry beaches and gorgeous denuded breasts makes viewing alluring, but (except for travel stories designed to help you plan your next vacation), even these movies require a proper plot if they hold the eye. the viewer's attention more than ever. a few minutes. Venus was underpinned by the legend of the reincarnation of the goddess and Summer Lovers was about the viability of a "threesome". In my opinion, these two films were much more successful than Hardbodies II, whose scenario is very tenuous and relies too much on a simplistic semi-crazy comedy. The use of slapstick quickly becomes tedious and usually leads to a series of very short sequences of self-contained cameos that are difficult to integrate into an ongoing story. Mel Brooks did it brilliantly with Silent Movie, but few other movies did the same, unlike Hardbodies II. There is also the problem that slapstick sequences do not happily cohabit with the idyllic and peaceful scenario in which the film unfolds. The last sequences of airports were probably intended to give a hilarious end to this film, but I think they are an example of the worst kind of pseudo comedy super deceptive wacky. They also have an excessive length, so I left the cinema with a bad taste in the mouth. It is a film that could have been much more successful with a stronger story and with most of its slapstick sequences very heavily pruned. As it was published, it certainly does not guarantee a number of spectators higher than 3. <br /> <br /> There is little memorable in the acting game, but the distribution does its best within the imposed limits by a lean story and poor leadership - it is in these latter areas that failure occurs. <br /> <br />
