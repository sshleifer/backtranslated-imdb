Wow, pretty amazing that something so bad can actually be done. I give a 2 to this film because it is so bad that it has a certain appeal of the "car wreck" type. It's so bad its comic and that has some entertainment value. Plus, there is a bit of free nudity and it's always appreciated. <br /> <br /> So where to start? The acting is more than terrible, it's like watching a play being filmed. Theresa Russell had to do something really serious for being forced to make this movie and her acting game reflects how happy she is to be in the middle of this mess. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast is just ridiculous. the casting of Dan Cortese as an agent of the FBI, the cherry at the top of this shit. His game made me laugh out loud. <br /> <br /> As for the script and staging, C. Courtney Joyner and Mark L. Lester should simply be removed and filmed.
