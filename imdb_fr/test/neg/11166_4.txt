Korea's response to "I know what you did last summer" follows a similar path to its American counterpart: a year after a group of high school friends accidentally killed a classmate, a murderer masked began to take one by one. Who could have seen them that night - or was their "victim" still alive after throwing him into the sea? <br /> <br /> We can no longer expect an original teen slasher, but efforts can still be made to ensure that films like this are entertaining and scary. RECORD is neither, producing scenes of "I know ...", "The House On Sorority Row" and "The Faculty" (among many others) badly reorganized, and not producing not a shock worthy of 95 minutes. > <br /> Playing is decent on the part of the cast, which, as it seems to be the norm in Korean cinema, approaches an uninteresting scenario with enthusiasm and enthusiasm. Management is mediocre at best, however; a strange choice of shooting angles and the worst assassin's costume * NEVER * contributing to the fall of RECORD. The most disappointing is the end of the film, where the two "surprise twists" are so obvious that you have already found them too obvious! <br /> <br /> The only good thing about RECORD is its brilliant debut - the first act is actually excellent and shows American counterparts how character development and ambiance creation are supposed to happen - but, aside from that, it's a very bad movie. Not recommended. <br /> <br /> ** / *****
