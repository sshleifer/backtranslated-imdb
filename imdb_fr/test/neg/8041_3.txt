I would think it's one of those movies that the director did not read the book he's based on, if they're not a bit similar. It is certainly possible for a great movie to "base" itself very vaguely on a book and it is certainly the last but not the last. <br /> <br /> There were a number of flaws. The first was that she was trying to look too much like the children of the railroad, probably because adults expected it from the same author. Another is that she was also looking to look like Harry Potter, listening to music and emphasizing the frame too much. I have nothing against JK Rowling or the movies, but the book is nothing like Harry Potter's. I thought that the Psammead, although very well expressed by Eddie Izzard and of character too, was almost free in a totally inappropriate environment. I may have missed something here because the comments on one of the characters' books may have referred to the inaccuracy of the adaptation. Extra characters were not needed either, and today's special effects could easily have been used to tell the story as it was written, but it was not. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie with my two children. , one of which knows the book and the other does not. The one who knew it thought that everything was fine but was not as enthusiastic as the one who did not know it. I'm not sure what that means.
