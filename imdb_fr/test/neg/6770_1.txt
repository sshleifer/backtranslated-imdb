Here is an allusion, real people can not act, but actors can usually act in a real way. <br /> <br /> That would not have been so offensive if we did not see how much he was in a hurry to push this action The radical conspiracy theory on us throughout the film, its particularly hysterical when we let's get a scene where the director camouflages and starts shouting about ridiculously stupid theories and secret agendas. The film also does a good job of laughable stereotyping on all roles. He tries so much to romance these street activists and to print a "good" or an "evil" on each character. <br /> <br /> Ignore, maybe you find a beautiful documentary /
