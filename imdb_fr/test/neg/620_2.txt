I could not I was bored, not just because the acting was terrible and the tragic story was just a fiction film whose plot was about cannibalism, but the fact that I was watching a foreign film subtitled, which did not bother me at all, but was still nicknamed. <br /> <br /> The "special effects" were awful. As the rear of the plane separates, you can see that the model is hollow while it "breaks" in the artificial snow. Most of the film takes place on a sound stage that is clearly not real and almost looks like a play, because the "sounds" of the snow blowing everywhere are heard, but not really the scene. <br /> <br /> "But how do they eat? They have no food," says a soldier (what this guy does or why he is in charge is never clear), which I I'm sure no one has ever actually said or even thought about the food because they were worried if people were alive, not how they would eat. It was simply a stupid line written to indicate that, yes, they will have to eat corpses to survive. <br /> <br /> When they finally decide to eat the bodies, a man finds a shirtless body, which although he is in the snow as long as he is, is not frozen. In fact, its flesh is very supple and fresh. He cuts the fresh meat from his back, that again, it is not frozen or even cold, and this scene lasts five minutes. That's where I had to stop. The "Alive" remake was a much bigger movie about trying to survive in a horrible situation that the real survivors rented, while I can not imagine any of them having anything nice to say about this version. It was just eating corpses and everything else was secondary. To avoid.
