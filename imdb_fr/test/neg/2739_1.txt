Useless horror film ... I will not bother you about the synopsis, just bring together The Core, Armageddon, a diabolical military officer and one or two Nukes of Solve-All and you'll get the movie, if I can call it's like it. <br /> <br /> Seriously, nuclear weapons in this type of film are more useful than Swiss knives: <br /> <br /> Does Big One approach? Nuke some places and it's over ... A tornado wants to destroy "Insert the important name of the city here"? Nuke "Inserts another important city here" ... A volcano is erupting? Nuke it! A nuclear bomb is about to leave? Nuke it! The coffee is cold? Nuke it! You did not like Transformers? Do it yourself, but I can not assure you that it will solve the problem ... <br /> <br /> In the end, how many films of this type can be created before copying? one another? I doubt there is still much to be exploded with a nuclear weapon ...
