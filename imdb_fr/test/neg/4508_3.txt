Victor Buono like the devil? It is certain that someone must have been drunk when this decision was made. This is not the worst part of this stupid hodgepodge of various devices in the haunted house, but it gives me the right to vote for being the funniest part. Although the film is not terrible, it does not even approach other "haunted house" movies of the 1970s like Amityville Horror, The Changeling and The Legend of Hell House. Evil can be entertaining in places, but do not expect to be afraid. It's better that it's like what it is: a ridiculous horror movie made even more ridiculous by its too serious approach.
