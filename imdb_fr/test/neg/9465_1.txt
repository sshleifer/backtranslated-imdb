After the death of the wife of a plastic surgeon, her hunchbacked assistant helps her to bring her back to life with various parts of other nubile girls. This film wants to be a Hersel Gordon Lewis type adventure, but fails miserably. The acting is beyond evil, the gore atrocious (no, not in a good way), the plot almost non-existent and fun. Jump.
