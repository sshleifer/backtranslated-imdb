Alright, how can anyone really think that this movie is awesome, is so much beyond me ... I can not even understand how anyone can find this funny remote movie, the only character he Aimed at, is the devilish super-nerd game designer and who gets older after a while. This movie is so predictable, the punches are not funny, they are forced, you see better play in the red light, and the story is nil, it's so predictable, you know EXACTLY what will happen. Even the characters do not react as they should, try to go to the hot girl who is your boss at work and telling him that you hit two crazy girls with whom you live at the same time, his answer would not be (smile ) "ok let's go back to work". I did not laugh once during this movie, and I wish I had never seen it or spent $ 3 to rent it because it's not worth it. Adam Sandler produced this film, I lost all respect for him. All his films are the same, his comedy style has aged since the release of The Waterboy, if I had known that Adam Sandler had produced it before praising it ... I would never have lost my time here. above. This movie is as bad as it can be in every way ... As Ventura was not an intelligent comedy movie, it did not have a deadly plot ... but it was original and it was hilarious. I do not hit the film because it has a "low level" humor, I hit it because it sucks, it's a shit of Hollywood. If this film was presented to a production company and did not include "ADAM SANDLER", it would be thrown in the trash faster than a used condom. If you want a good movie about pot culture, watch Cheech and Chong or Whitecastle. If you rent this movie, all you will get is a generic comedy for 14-17 year olds, with rock music at all levels, a game that will make you squint and your stomach and a comedy that will be equivalent to watching your movie. smashed friend eating McDonalds for an hour and a half. Do not do it ... for the sake of God ... this film is bad, treat it for what it is and look beyond all the Hollywood glory behind it ... Hercules in New York was once the worst movie I have ever seen, but it's a shame. It was rather a very expensive film, which aspired just as much, if not more.
