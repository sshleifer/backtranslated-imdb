Joanne Whalley (Valerie Alston), owner of antiques in New York, faces a jury in a US court, in the trial of a well-known Mafia, Armand Asante (Rusty Pirone), and most of his films are idling Pirone's attempts to get Whalley to acquit him of the murder, threatening to kill her son and herself. Many activities ensue, involving appalling mass movements, interspersed with Willam Hurt as an intermediary. Much of this silly and incoherent clutter surrounds Hurt and Asante's obsession with Whalley, audience scenes we've all seen time and time again, and an incredible ending. 3/10, it's probably a waste of time.
