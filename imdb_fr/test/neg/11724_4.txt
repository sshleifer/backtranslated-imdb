Do not mistake yourself. I have a weakness for the works of Charles Band, both as a producer and a director. But you must raise your eyebrows when the man who was ready to give his name to "Dollman Vs The Demonic Toys" sticks a pseudonym on anything. "Head Of The Family" is rather lacking, although it is better played than expected. Jacqueline Lovell is a well-defined talent who deserves better than this kind of films. J.W. Perra is also quite funny as a titular monster, although for such a super-intelligent being, he is easily deceived. You know, I'm nervous because the rest of the movie is so bright and witty of course .... <br /> <br /> And have a main character called Lance Bogan? Nice guy. We did not know you, the Americans, knew this slang!
