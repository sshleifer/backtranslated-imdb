It's the quintessence of poor filmmaking from the 80s, unless you're a pre-pubescent girl. On a big name like madonna, a story that physically assails her intelligence and humor and is best suited to a kindergarten. When in doubt, I think this movie nightmare clearly shows Madonna's absolute lack of acting talent and makes me very uncomfortable. The only thing I can not believe is that they let the director go to another movie again. Madonna spends most of the movie prancing like a baby rag doll and talking like a baby. It is painfully obvious that the only reason this film was shot is that Madonna was a big name for pop music at that time. DO NOT BE DUPTED TO SEE THIS TOLERANT CASH ATTEMPT ON STARDOM POP. Avoid it at all costs!
