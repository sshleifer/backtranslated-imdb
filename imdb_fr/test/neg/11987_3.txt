Uwe Boll resumes his filmmaking skills to tell a sci-fi horror story about mercenaries and journalists battling with super soldiers on an isolated island. A very good cast led by the excellent Udo Keir is drifting Boll who realizes the worst scenario that should have worked. The mad scientist being investigated by a journalist was killed to death, but this scenario is quite amusing for the plot to work. In addition, the effects and design of the super soldier with their lifeless eyes have a certain degree of goose bumps, although Boll manages to film everything casually. It's as if he could not bother to find what would work, but rather put the camera down and go away. In addition, the montage of scenes has no spark or life, I suppose that Boll shot only one or two shots and used only what he had. It really stinks. Clearly, Boll is in one of his retrograde periodicals where everything he's learned about the movie is blushed. The last film he shot so bad was Seed, a deadly movie that is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It's not that bad, but it's just because it should have been better. But again, Udo Keir is good enough to watch his scenes and make such a good movie. I'll take a pass unless it's late at night and you catch it by cable.
