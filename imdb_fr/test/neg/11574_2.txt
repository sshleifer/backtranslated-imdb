Scientists participating in a remote laboratory experiment (insert a scaly creature here) and create uncontrollable monsters Meanwhile, an experienced military team / the daughter of the scientist / bank robbers make their way to this remote place and are threatened by the giant creatures, one by one, they are eaten, all along a race "exciting" not to let themselves be exploded by the forces that initially created the monsters ... "What is sad, it is that it looks like a dozen movies that appeared on the Sci. -Fi Channel. I have to wonder what's going on? Of course ... I love the bimbos and the Hollywood-Hunk wannabes being eaten by CGI creatures as much as the next person ... but where is the plot or originality? Certainly, there are times when Sci-Fi Channel Shines. Battlestar Galactica, if it's a bit dark, can be very good. Writers have continued to breathe life into Stargate's various offerings, and the latest BBC import of Doctor Who is surprisingly good. <br /> <br /> Even in the various Sci-Fi "giant animal" movies, the animation seems to be improving all the time. Compare the kommodo of this film to the rather awkward version of the first giant kommodo movie on Sci-Fi. <br /> <br /> But all the better ... what about the plot? Maybe another giant creature? On a whim, I started looking on the Internet. In the list, I found some interesting stories that could interest both SF fans and Russian CGI animators. I offer http://www.macrophile.com/~arilin/archive/metamorphosis-day to the network with the suggestion of contacting the author to get the rights of the story. (The story contains violent images that generally go along with those of different Sci-Fi channel offerings.) <br /> <br /> The story contains a secondary plot, an ethical and moral commentary on the nature of humanity and does not lead to one of these. horrible "did they REALLY kill all the monsters ???" moments, but rather lets you guess completely and in a totally different state of mind. <br /> <br /> This is usually what science fiction is supposed to do, right?
