I gave this film a chance only because it had very good reviews. After seeing the trailer, I said to myself: what a funny film full of clichés. But I decided to give it a shot because the trailers often do not describe the film very well. What a waste of time ... The film is worse than the trailer and after spending 2 hours looking at it, I did not remember a single line that made me laugh. The funniest parts of the movie were the parodies of CSI, but it's also pretty passé. I could not identify with any of the characters, nor hope they would be together, because I found them completely stupid. The plot is extremely predictable and inconclusive. Unintelligent comedy for people who are still in high school or who feel mentally this way.
