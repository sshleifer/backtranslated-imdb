Not only did the effects and actors of this film bite, but the story was terrible. <br /> <br /> A scientist discovers that a fragment of a comet will hit the moon ... World leaders ignore him ... he builds a shelter ... so everyone is angry that he "play God". <br /> <br /> How lame! He built the thing, why does everyone have the "right" to access? Totally lame history, do not waste your time!
