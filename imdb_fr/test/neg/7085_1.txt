It may be one of the worst films ever made. Everything is there - actor, director, screenplay, cinematography - is appalling. The stranger (a human in a shining suit) claims to come from a near universe; It is assumed that the scriptwriter meant "galaxy" but did not bother to have his terms checked by a dictionary. A better title for the film would be "It came from the planet of plot plots". The plot is excessively stupid and almost non-existent. Humans all receive magical MacGuffins that conform to a tortuous series of improbable restrictions just to move the naked plot. Any reflection on the passage of time is ignored. Now, a few days after meeting the alien, then BAM! all at once, there are only a few hours until zero o'clock. Do yourself a favor and miss this movie. You will be stupid to have looked at it. The end is particularly silly, and should have been accompanied by someone going "Ta-Da !!!!" as the screenwriter just pulls something randomly from his buttocks. I think the real plot for the extraterrestrials is that this movie is so bad that you will have cancer watching it. If you can watch the last 10 minutes without being pissed off ("enemies of freedom" - honestly) laughing, you are lingering.
