"Crimes of Passion" is a film that is disappointing in many ways. Where should I start? The parcel? He is hopelessly simplistic and full of shortcomings. The direction? Recall a cheap movie B. The game? John Laughlin is absolutely horrible in his role as "well-intentioned husband" Bobby, Annie Pots is not convincing as "frozen woman" Amy, and it's only Kathleen Turner (above average), and Antony Perkins ( excellent) who gets passable actor marks. Specifically, Antony Perkins gives an excellent performance as evil reverend Peter Shayne, while Turner satisfactorily describes the roles of the sexy China Blue and the fragile Joanna Crane. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the performances of Turner and Perkins alone are insufficient to allow the film to score above 4/10. Look at it if you want to see Turner in some sensational scenes (even if, even on this number, the film can be easily matched by its competitor - "Basic Instinct" for example), otherwise avoid.
