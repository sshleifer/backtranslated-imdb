Do I need to say more? The good Australian version of Kath and Kim was, as mentioned, good, because of its hilarious originality. The reason this new American version is so terrible is that it is largely borrowed from the original. Not to mention the infidelity towards the characters. Kath is supposed to be a dag. Kim is supposed to be fat. Kel (or Phil as they nicknamed him) is pathetic. Brett (or Craig) is supposed to be a loser, not a person who acts as if he was taking heroin and ends each sentence with "dude". Thank God, Szubanski did not sell his rights to Sharon. She would probably be a tall, slender blonde whom Kim likes. <br /> <br /> Kath and Kim are MOTHER AND GIRL. They are not meant to look 2 years apart. And they are not made to laugh like schoolgirls. This series is a shame to share the same title as the Australian version. America: get your own TV shows.
