I have already seen Cédric Klapisch's films and I was therefore expecting a quality film with a psychological depth. Being an Erasmus student myself and having visited several friends studying abroad, I know very well what it means to spend time abroad and to mix with different cultures at the same time. Yes, it's very funny! Because of that, I thought I should not miss this movie. Unfortunately, I was disappointed to find that the Spanish Inn is unsatisfactory in many respects: the characters are stereotyped, the banal events and the shallow story. Although there are many familiar situations, they are an irritating cliché and do not go beyond trivial events. This made the film uninteresting to watch and gave me a strong "summer-it-does-you-have-nothing-to-add?" feeling. Apart from that, the film lacks a firm story. It sometimes looks more like a documentary or a "real life" than a serious movie. However, I can imagine that if you have not studied or traveled abroad, this could be fun to watch.
