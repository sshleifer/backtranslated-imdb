Think 'Charmed' with testosterone instead of estrogen and you get the general idea of ​​this image. A very lame story with mediocre effects and an anti-climax end to leave the door open for a second part. Hope someone will have the sense of spending their money with more wisdom. I would suggest a "Charmed - the movie" because compared to this "Charmed", I only watched this show to please my girlfriend !!!! Wait and watch it on DVD on a rainy Sunday when you have nothing better to do. Or better yet, download it so you do not waste your money. The first 15 minutes were correct. But the funniest thing about the movie and the only highlight of this movie is when Reid says, "Kiss Harry Potter's ass," driving a cliff. Although they are not worthy of kissing Potter's ass, because Potter is a lot cooler and at least his movies have a story. The cup of fire was even more frightening than that one !!!
