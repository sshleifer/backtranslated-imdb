One of the few reasons to make these movies from point of view is to give some actors a chance to hope to play in better movies if they play really well. The only good thing about this movie is the acting, the three main female roles are better than most horror movies like this one. Two scenes can cause an unexpected jump. <br /> <br /> Young children are used to crawl through holes and deposit dynamite to explode mines. When we collapse, a cave dies in all children and turns into zombies. The adults in the mine remain dead, no reason is given for why the children eat flesh. When they were still alive, they seemed terrified by the cavern, innocent, and they had to become furious with any adult who exploited them in the mines (the only reason they had in mind). <br /> <br /> A mother and her two daughters move into a house near the mine, accompanied by a devoloper who wants to build a hotel complex and another terrifying people who seem to know exactly what is going on passes, but no one believes it. <br /> <br /> Nothing new here. , you are usual clich√©s, predictable, many negative points for this film, very few positive points.
