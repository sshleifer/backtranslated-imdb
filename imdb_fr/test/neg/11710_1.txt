This film distorts the facts of Anne and Mary's life into something unrecognizable. To make Mary Boleyn, who was in fact a rather devious and stupid creature, and make her the "good" sister is ridiculous. Anne was actually the most interesting character, and that's why it's her life, not Mary's, that's been told so often. <br /> <br /> In response to a previous criticism, I fail. to see how much Anne's life was so "criminal" ... for me, it was Henry who was the real criminal. Whatever Anne's motives for winning the king and retaining her affections in order to get a crown and a husband, one must take into account the time in which these real events unfolded. Anne, compared to most courtiers of her time, was a relatively innocent person. Most modern historians refute or have refuted most of the myths and slanders that this film perpetuates about it, and I have never heard of anyone who really believes the rumor that she slept with her brother. This film is so sensational and false that it is exasperating to think that someone, without knowing anything about this period of history, might believe that everything this film has presented is a "fact". <br /> <br /> I won. "I did not even get into the bizarre shooting of the movie ... but I'm pretty sure that cameras were not invented in the 16th century So I do not understand why Anne and Mary are talking to one of them all the way through the movie ... it's a really deplorable ploy, it's a matter of pleasure and boring, to put it nicely. <br /> <br /> Anne of the thousand days is not exact either, but she is infinitely more entertaining and at least approaches the narration of one of the most intriguing women in history. not even to praise this, it will take you two hours to never come back!
