This film is actually an interesting beginning, but to my taste, it has degenerated too quickly into a dull and predictable melodrama. None of the performances are particularly interesting and the camera work is only about TV movies, so there's no reason for anyone to see this movie unless it's as big as I suppose for Jeff Bridges. <br /> Bridges plays Mike Olson, a young man who announces at a family picnic that he is leaving the university to leave the road. His parents believe he is "acting out" and explain how "he has no plan". He assures them that he has a plan and that he needs to discover his true identity and his place in the world. So much so that he invites them to leave with him on the road and buys an old bus for the trip, which his father and he repair in real TV movie between father and son. Until then, in the film, I was interested in the plot and the characters and wanted to see how his rebellious mother (Vera Miles) was going to react to life on the road. There is an early fun scene where the father and the son have to convince her to travel with them. They show her the inside of the bus and she gets more and more interested, eventually dulling herself with a sort of talk about the curtains rather than the window blinds. The bridges are marvelous to her father (Carl Betz, equipped with a radio announcer voice) that she has changed her mind. Dad assures him that "the electric oven ... works every time!" <br /> <br /> But the film deteriorates almost as soon as they hit the road. It turns out that Mike's only "plan" is to introduce them to some of his "friends" who turn out to be randomly chosen people they meet at a hippie rock festival. As soon as I saw the rock festival, I was a little disappointed ... especially since it became clear that the rest of the film would be at the festival site and not on the road. But at least I thought there might be a decent band like that, well, if they could not afford Hendrix or the Stones, they might have at least Canned Heat or Little Feat or something from kind. No dice - apparently, the only music from this festival is a horrible choral group with an orchestra that sounded like a poor imitation of the Fifth Dimension, associated with an annoying announcer who is supposed to be humorous. <br /> <br /> We are also presented to a group of hippie festival-goers and their various medical melodramas. Kathy (Reindeer Jarrett) is a pretty blonde girl with existentialism and nature in mind, who falls in love with Mike before revealing that she needs kidney dialysis to live and that she ran away to festival to die. And 2 other campers are determined to have a baby in their raw tent, introducing the struggle between modern medicine and hippie ignorance (or something like that). In short, the more the film loses pain, the more painful the film becomes for anyone hoping for any element of surprise or real drama. <br /> <br /> Basically, this film is a waste of time, although it would probably entertain anyone who is really in the late 60's, early 70's and the movies of that era. I would be just as happy if I never see him again.
