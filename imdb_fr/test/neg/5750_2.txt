Well, now that all the friends and relations of the production company / director have posted their reviews after seeing this in different festivals, I guess it's time to show the critics written by people who paid $ 10 to see her. <br /> <Like the director's movie "Dear Jesse" (the only other movie I've seen), "Loggerheads" suffers from a lack of concentration and too many ideas piled up in a budget independent. I swear this guy would have a better chance of doing a miniseries. I was still waiting for the different threads of the plot to come together, but they only intercepted them at obvious points, in an obvious way, in a way obvious to all, except the most dense viewer. It was like watching a season of movies for Lifetime TV crammed into a long sketch (did I say LOOONG) of the old show "Carol Burnett". Perhaps an enterprising male suitor could bring his girlfriend to see this, then exclaim: "Hey ... remember all the girls' movies we saw last year ... the one about the adoptive mother ... the one about the gay guy ... the one about the Christian housewife We went to THREE Chick Flicks last year so go see Terminator 4! "I guess we have to do n ' anything to appeal to a familiar actor for funding, but what does Bonnie Hunt do in this movie? She is not known as a dramatic actress and this "performance" attempt will not send Mr. Oscar to his door. I mean (talking about Lifetime Original Movies), Valerie Bertinelli or Farah Fawcett were not available? Mrs. Hunt has always been cold with me, maybe she should have played the other mother? I would have liked to choose "Capote" to fill my independent weekly allowance to the gay theme ... oh well, maybe next week. I think there is a good reason for Capote to play in tons of theaters all over the New York area and play it in one; let the distributors believe in this movie make sure to run in the opposite direction if you do not trust this opinion!
