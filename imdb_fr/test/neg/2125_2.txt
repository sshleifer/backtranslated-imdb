The ugliest of all the cute Jaws scams has been made with regret by one of my favorite directors of all time; Lamberto Bava (here under his pseudonym John Old Jr.). You know how it goes in these cheap European imitations, right? They only want their monstrous animal to be bigger, sicker and more threatening, but more often than not it has the opposite effect. The creature of Bava is a gigantic devil of the sea and it's more than just a shark! We are apparently dealing with a prehistoric monster, the jaw and the appetite of a Great White, but it also has tentacles like an octopus! It's up to a couple of dolphin-loving oceanologists to find out how this monster survived for thousands of years and why he started killing only now. The script of "Monster Shark" has little or no meaning and most actions take place on the continent. The shark itself is an unintentionally laughable creation and it is a wise decision of Lamberto Bava to show it only vaguely and quickly. The acting performances are above average and the underwater photography is surprisingly clear and well handled. The twists in the plot are predictable and you will probably have the most fun to discover detailed facts about the characters. For example, count all the cans of beer that Dr. Hogan drinks throughout the movie!
