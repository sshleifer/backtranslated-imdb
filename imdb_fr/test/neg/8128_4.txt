Sebastian Cabot is a rich fool who wants to buy all the land because there is oil - although no one is aware of this oil. With the help of a wicked black gun, they kill and terrorize everyone. When the son of a murdered man arrives, he refuses to back down and face these forces of darkness. <br /> <br /> Wow. As I watched TERROR IN AT Texas TOWN, I felt like I had seen this movie a few times before and would probably see something like that again. Indeed, apart from some novelties (for example, Sterling Hayden using a harpoon on the villain), he has an all too familiar plot. Again, we have a rich man trying to drive out all the farmers to take control of all the land. And to do this, he hired rented guns to force people to sell or kill them. I went there, I did it in too many movies. <br /> <br /> I love Sterling Hayden in the movies, but I just can not recommend it, otherwise to a bad time saver.
