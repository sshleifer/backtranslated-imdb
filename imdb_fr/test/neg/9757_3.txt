Teenage Exorcist is one of those terrible films about God that makes the viewer give up all the wait for decent entertainment for low-brow sex antics, teenage humor and empty writing. This film provides exactly what it was trying to deliver. It is about a young girl who settles in a house where a Baron de Sade (hmmm) lived and who was attracted by his own inner demon. His sister and brother-in-law, as well as an Irish priest, his boyfriend and a pizza delivery man, try to save her and exorcise her demon. Well, not much horror or suspense. In fact, a movie line sums up pretty well what to expect. Mike (the girl's brother-in-law) tied her up (the name is Diane by the way and she's played by Brinke Stevens) after trying to cut her sister off. He removes a gag from his mouth and says something like, "It will not be the last gag we'll see tonight." Indeed, it was not. The special effects are tacky and ill-conceived, and the film uses them playing on its comic appeal. Some lines and situations are fun. Robert Quarry, the old Count Yorga himself, really steals his Irish priest scenes. He gets involved by throwing Bible verses and singing Irish songs. You know, however, that you have problems when Eddie Deezen is at the top of the list. Deezen does his job and spends some good times too, but the material is just too worn out to be more than just a time-keeper. Michael Berryman of The Hills Have Eyes also has a brief but interesting introduction to the film. As for the other Thespians, well, they are all good enough to be mediocre enough. Stevens is adorable in fishnet stockings and panties French size, but beyond, do not wait too much of it. Her sister is played by Elena Sahagun and she shows a little more than Brinke (a very pretty young woman, by the way) and plays Brinke by miles. Her husband, played by Jay Richardson, shows his ability to act and be funny in the midst of mediocrity. Again, it's not a bad movie to lose some time without thinking. If you are a Robert Quarry fan, do not miss his performance.
