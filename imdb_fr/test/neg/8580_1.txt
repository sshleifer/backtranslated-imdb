James Bond is admirable but weak, mainly because the hero (Bond) and the villain (Blofeld) have been seriously misread. Lazenby is too fat and innocent to play Bond. He looks and acts rather like the companion man but tasteless of a police action movie. The director and writer tries to establish his credibility, but his words like those of "Royal Baluga, north of the ..." are simply not effective in establishing him as a worldly and suave thief. Savalas does not do a bad job, but its characterization and behavior are more appropriate to a mafia gangster. The best-represented characters in the film are those of Tracy and her father. But the performances of these actors when sharing the screen with Lazenby only underscore his weaknesses as an actor. This film is too long (140 minutes) for a James Bond movie and does not excite until the exit of the James Bond mountain, where it begins to take shape. This film tries very hard, but does not succeed. Many Bondian elements are present and the climatic battle is of superior quality, but I always feel that something is missing when I look at it.
