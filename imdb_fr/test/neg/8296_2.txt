Uggh! Hanna-Barbera from the 60s and 70s! What ugly and unassailable caricatures that were thrown at us by these hacks! It's a shame, because in the 1940s and 1950s, "Hanna-Barbera" was synonymous with quality - because they produced so many great cartoons from Tom and Jerry. However, with the significant cost-cutting efforts of the late 1950s, cartoons began to appear rather poor and budgets were reduced. In fact, William Hanna and Joseph Barbera were fired by MGM and replaced by a team of Czech animators who had never even seen the original comics! So, in the late '50s, the team is out of work and decides "if you can not beat them, join them" - and started producing horrible little cartoons - with an animation, backgrounds and horrible writings. <BR/> <br /> It's unfortunate, but the team's production of crappy caricatures worked too well - making them rich and actually the most successful cartoons producers of the '60s and' 70s. Meanwhile, again and again, poor production values ​​were their norm and a long list of VERY forgettable cartoons was created. In this case, the incredible bad INCH HIGH PRIVATE EYE - a completely ridiculous and stupid idea. If you want to know what the series is, the title says it all. <br /> <br /> Rotten, it is obvious that the production team had a total disregard for us children!
