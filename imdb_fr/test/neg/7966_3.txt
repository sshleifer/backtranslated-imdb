There is no doubt that Alfred Hitchcock was a serious director. Many of his films are undeniable classics that have stood the test of time and are very watchable to this day. This list could include the 39 steps, the back window, North by Northwest, Dial M for murder, Vertigo, The Birds, Shadow of a Doubt and some other movies. <br /> <br /> However, "Suspicion" is not aging well at all and is really so unassailable that it seems to me that it was probably a bad movie, even by the standards of 1941. The list of scenes that work well can be listed on a book of matches with a pencil. The scenario is cowardly and ridiculous most of the time, but the acting game seems so forced, so woody and amateurish to the limit, that it's almost unbelievable. Joan Fontaine tries to keep things in place, but she is on a slippery slope and Cary Grant does not provide much help. His playing is so bad at times that I've seen better performances in high school plays or theatrical experience classes in college where a chemical engineer plays for the first time without any formal training. While watching this movie, you may be looking for the DVD cover in the dark to see if you have accidentally taken some kind of special edition version that has been paved without any editing. <br /> <br /> The subject is serious, yet the film has a ridiculous and banal meaning that seems so misplaced that you become numb by perplexity. <br /> <br /> "Suspicion" is fundamentally unassailable and another very bad movie overestimated.
