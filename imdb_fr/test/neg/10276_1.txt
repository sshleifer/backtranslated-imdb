Even Emeril Lagasse's kitchen fails to save this silly, sensational nonsense, starring Emeril Lagasse as a TV chef in the food chain who, with the help of the team, is trying to to make the show better, a poor plot and a stupid scenario throwing that show drain, Robert Urich lost in the mediocre support role and unfortunately it was the last of it (RIP), <br /> </ br> > This is the worst show of 2001 and it will be on the list of the worst decade. <br /> <br /> I'm very sorry for Emeril Lagasse for doing this sitcom, he even said stink. <br /> <br /> It's hard to believe that they are the same producers of female stylists who made this mess. <br /> <br /> TV Review: 1 star
