The introduction to the local sports team is to take beginners to the corn fields and guess what? A scarecrow kills people there. Only one of the beginners survives but falls into a coma because of diabetes. Meanwhile, the scarecrow begins to kill everyone involved, one by one. What is the secret of scarecrows? Will they know it before the scarecrow has them all? It's a low budget film and it shows. The sound is correct but the picture is really old. The plot / script is really nil and is quite pathetic and not logical. The acting is really bad and sometimes just laughable. I really can not say much about special effects because they are few, but few are values ​​ranging from bad to good (for a small budget). There is a bit of nudity and this is probably the only thing to watch in the movie (ie if you are a teenager in heat, otherwise skip the movie together). Another waste of time and money then do not see it. Also go for hack'n'slash fans.
