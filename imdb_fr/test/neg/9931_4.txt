I read the last 28 comments of different people about this movie and I was surprised to find that no one mentioned the fact that the first victim, shown on the bed with "missing eyelids", as the camera lifted and moved away from his face flashes! Yes, eyes closed! I recorded it as it happened on HBO last weekend and when I saw that, I literally had to replay it several times, focusing on one eye at a time to make sure I did not did not see things! Of course, after that, it was difficult to take the film seriously although there were some interesting and intense scenes with Julian Sands. Very disappointed and give it a 4 mainly because of the fact that the 1st victim flashes in one of the last images when the camera moves away from the body / face. Pity.
