Little Quentin seems to have mastered the art of taking cake and eating it. <br /> <br /> As usual, purely sadistic display can be explained as a clever way to provoke thought to return violence to the public's face. <br /> <br /> Of course, Mr. Tarantino. The violence is Baaad. Sadism is Baaad. It is worthwhile to dwell on it. It's really awesome. <br /> <br /> The juvenile part of the audience might not be smart enough to follow all the intelligent references to higher levels of consciousness, but I'm confident they'll see the light someday. <br /> <br /> Thank you for making this little world a little better. You deserve a medal.
