Christophe Lambert once said that he always made movies to earn money easily. When I see his last outings, I can believe him. <br /> <br /> Beowulf is, in the main, part of the "good" part of shitty movies: there are indeed good scenes of thrills. The actors themselves are not too bad. But the plot is stupid, the "Mortal Kombat" -as the music has nothing to do here, the end is really s **** y ... <br /> <br /> In reality, the only good thing about this is that my friends and I could laugh at how uninteresting it was. I would even have wasted my money for something else. <br /> <br />
