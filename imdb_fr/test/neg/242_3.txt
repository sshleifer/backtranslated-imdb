With dialogue in the dubbed version of this film, I do not think Shakespeare is in great danger. This is the story of an ancient Aztec mummy who was deprived of her rights. His business was taken and it really kills him. He seems to know who does this even though he is a whirling and delirious entity. I loved the two stupid men who tell the story of the discovery of the mummy and the doctor who is determined to destroy the creature. There are all these scenes in this ridiculous cemetery, full of inexpensive crosses and other odds and ends. There is a mausoleum where the mummy is kept. I can not start reproducing the idiocy of this, including a snake pit where the good doctor is thrown (there is a door next door so he can crawl) to the robot, a mass of metal cans with a guy inside. The dialogue is awful. There are long pauses between speeches, as if someone outside the stage fed them. I like the scene where the two little kids accuse their mother of going out at night (she gets into that zombie state or something like that). Nevertheless, if you are looking for a movie you can laugh about and never take seriously, look at this. Have a few beers first. As a direct line from the mummy's grave, "Look at this and your eyes will bleed and your breath will become bad." What more can i say?
