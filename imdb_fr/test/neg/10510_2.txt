I do not really know where to start here. Imagine a film that is so bad in every way, from acting to props to the story that makes you angry. It's one of the worst films I've ever seen, and it says a lot because I've seen bad ones. When I saw this movie, I knew it was a blade, but I thought it was his kung fu and his vampires, a combination that I thought could not fail. That's until I add it to my DVD player. How Ron Hall managed to ruin something as cool as vampires and martial arts is beyond me. first the acting game. At first, I did not expect much because it's an action movie and a B, but the acting is so bad that I could not help but be disturbed by it. Expressions and vocal tones were out of place, there was absolutely no emotion in almost the whole movie and when it was so ridiculous that I thought I was watching Mad TV. kao master who should never have been born. overall, I have seen better play in elementary school plays. Not even compared to what has been done recently in action cinema. but the action was not totally disappointed because Ron Hall seems to have martial arts skills. but even his talent is surpassed by his nonsense, for example the part of the film where he begins to shoot, then the camera changes. I almost ripped a pillow in half. And the fight scene where his prison mate fights the vampires by waving his arms. WOW.OR What about the part of the prison where Derek, suddenly, knows the magic and can sing songs that make tap water water blessed. and as far as the accessories go. Weapons look like Walmart toys, teeth have been stolen in Halloween costumes, and words can not describe how bad CG graphics are. I could talk for hours about everything that's wrong with this film and believe me, it's just the tip of the iceberg. it's only getting a 2 because it made me laugh. Even if I laughed at how much the movie had been done, laughing is a laugh. I would say avoid the vampire killer unless you want to laugh at a horrible movie or you're planning to be tortured for long periods of time and want to practice
