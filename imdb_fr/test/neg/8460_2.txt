If the WGA, a professional association of screenwriters, has nominated for a scriptwriting award, it's time to hang up the word processor. Incredibly inept writing, directing, producing, at all levels, even for a TV movie. No clich√© is going to be untapped in this breathtaking film. What were they thinking? Does anyone really believe that children are stupid enough to watch this?
