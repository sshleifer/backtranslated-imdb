In my opinion, the film was laughable - a bad dialogue. Whoever wrote the script - please, keep your daily work. This is definitely not a godfather or goodfellas. It's good to be on the other end of the table - bad choice of words. Some of the characters were clowns. But what do you expect from a low-budget film without a nameless actor?
