From the brilliant spirit that brought us "The Exorcist" ... and "Cruising". "Rampage" is unfortunately more like the latter. It's a messy movie that has a great atmosphere made for television. The whole film claims to be based on the following question: "What if the 'Boy Next Door' was a serial killer?" but instead, it ends up being an uninspired courtroom drama and a meditation on mental insanity and the death penalty that makes little sense. The film is very vaguely based on the Richard Trenton Chase affair, picking a few facts here and there to create a fake character and a different outcome. One of the main points of the film seems to be that ending the life of a brainless terminally ill child and a murderer is somehow unnatural. "Sometimes you just have to choose," says the main character. Yes, sometimes you have to choose to unplug the plug ... on your TV!
