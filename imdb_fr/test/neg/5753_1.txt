This game is a beautiful first person shooter. ----------- Hang on ...... <br /> <br /> But of course you have to tell a story about this genre. That's why a rather innovative conspiracy on soldiers now driven by drugs To save the world and kill the terrorist, Nectar is the drug of choice to create a super soldier. <br /> <br /> Great, give us some fun and challenging missions now, add some great new weapons and off-road vehicles that can be driven as we please and I'll be very happy. <br /> <br /> NO !!!! <br /> <br /> The creator of this game has decided to create a propaganda game, military in nature, that tries to give meaning to our fears of terrorism and democracy. The game has twisted ideals that only reinforce the moral values ​​we learned when we were in elementary school, nothing new is said to us, but "Drugs are bad ... mmmkay". Then depressed in a type of .... Yvan eht Nnnioooojjjjj! (join the navy) the way we defend the common good, given discourses about normality and abnormalities, good and evil ... GOOOOOOOOOOD, WE GET IT! LET'S KILL SOMETHING !!!! <br /> <br /> NO !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br /> <br /> You can not, you are obliged to undergo very long gaps in the achievement of the objectives of BULLSH! T such as "Run to the helicopter" ....... "Go to troop group" .. ... Then once this is over ......... CINEMATIC takes over. ........ You sit for at least half of the game watching small scripts played by the characters, you CAN NOT jump, but sit back and wait, sometimes when people do not even talk , we sit down and wait for a helicopter to land! <br /> <br /> Bad game, a laughable group of programmers! Do not bother to create another one because I would rather see the movie!
