I was shocked to read all those wonderful comments about this movie because I hated it. I held it to the end, but it was painful - especially listening to that child's voice. As Socact-1 pointed out, even though the girl claimed to be from Chicago, she did not have a Chicago accent - it looked more like she was trying to emulate a New York accent - but she also failed. I was so confused that I was waiting for the typing line. Of all the wonderful actors who could have played this child, why did they choose this one? And why force her to speak like that? It was not even just the accent, it was the script, the monologue created for her. The reason I even chose this film is that the idea of ​​the plot interested me - this time of history, the type of poor and uneducated characters, the frame - and the love triangle. As far as I'm concerned, it could have and should have been much better. I was so relieved to read that at least one other person felt the same way as I felt about this movie.
