In addition to the fact that Skylar is a complete shower bag and that its disadvantages are not imaginative, its stratagems require a lot of preparation to prepare for all its scams. Without giving spoilers (as if that mattered with this piece of shit), its drawbacks are such a sham, because it takes the effort of days and days of planning, and the use of multiple accomplices and a team of filming etc. Someone in a service that would cost less than a hundred dollars ...... In addition, if you read in the credits, they reorganize some of the phone calls, etc. because they do not unfold ... The concept whole of this show is superimposed because all its disadvantages have the cost both crewed and the effort of ten times the actual cost of the service it tries to get for free ... what's the problem?
