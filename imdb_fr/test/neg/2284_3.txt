It took only one observation of this dog for me to say, "Never again! It is so deeply immutable that I had to read the reactions of others before I could remember anything beyond (1) it was horrible, (2) Connery should have stopped while he was in front, and (3) the film included a gross total. This involves simulating an analysis of the retina through the most macabre means (not to say horribly ineffective). <br /> <br /> In fact, I never understood why anyone would prefer even the best of Connery's Bond movies worst outings of Moore or Dalton. Or Lazenby, Brosnan, or even David Niven, by the way. Personally, I've found Octopussy and Moonraker, among Bond's other "canonical" movies, a lot more entertaining than that, and probably for the same reasons that others belittle Moore Bond movies, including their ironic humor and their willingness to submit to the absurdity of all the basic middle of the links.
