"Tokyo Eyes" tells the story of a 17-year-old Japanese girl who falls like a man hunted by her big brother, a cop. This lame film contains about 50% fill and 50% conversation. You will have the chance to see the less than brilliant distribution of three people as they talk on the bus, chat and play video games, chat and get their hair cut, talk and walk and walk and talk, talk to each other. mobile phone, hang out and chat, etc. while you read the subtitles while waiting for something to happen. The end of a story is not enough to support a movie with minimal production value, a skinny cast and no action, no romance, no sex or nudity, no heavy drama ... just an incessant yadayadayada. (C-)
