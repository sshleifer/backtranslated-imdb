There is no reason to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Why? Many reasons. First, the acting is awful. There is hardly any phrase that is misinterpreted - but this is hardly surprising given the banality, stupidity and repetitiveness of the dialogue that actors are invited to make. It's terribly written. One of the most boring things in the screenplay is that the authors seem to know only one way to get their characters to speak after a certain point is that they repeat the most important words from the previous character's line. <br /> "Repeat?" <br /> <br /> "Yes, they repeat it, for the whole film." <br /> <br /> "The whole movie?" <br /> <br /> "Yes, the whole movie." <br /> <br /> Etc. <br /> <br /> In such movies, you usually know who the bad guys are and what they are looking for. (All they have to do is stop the bad guys.) Set up a good "Mwahahaha! With X within my reach, I'll lead the Universe!" The villain is the first stop of any cheapo plot SF) but in this turkey? - You tell me. <br /> <br /> If I understand correctly, our "heroes" are a band of mass murderers sent in the past as part of a Dirty Dozen mission. They are sent by a fascist totalitarian state to prevent other murderers from changing the course of history. The new story would not include the rise of totalitarianism and a war that kills 30 billion people and leaves the planet dead (we all know it, because this film contains one of those long, useful reports on the screen just before that the action starts, who tells you who is who and what, it is an indication of what the producers think of their target audience, that the film is narrated and that it appears on the screen - just for avoid that the public is too taxed their head by doing a lot of reading.) So just who are we supposed to be rooting for here? I guess we are being asked to believe that our hero is embarking on a kind of journey from totalitarianism to love, peace and understanding by shooting at many people - but it does not work like a bow because we are shows that he is a decent man (ish) to be at the very beginning when he tries to rescue all civilians aboard the rebel station. <br /> <br /> I guess the directors were aiming for a kind of deeper-than-normal complexity in this movie, but they ended up godless mess with more plot holes and logical inconsistencies than a dozen of your SF shit movies means. <br /> <br /> The opening credits were nice.
