A group of friends discovers gold at the bottom of an old mine. But by taking the gold and thinking that they hit hard, they wake up a long-dead miner who has the torch to protect his treasure. "Miner's Massacre" is a horror movie that is b-horrifying to the extreme. You have all your familiar snapshots, your group of teenagers with a developmental disability, characters who leave alone to investigate strange noises, some pop-freaks, the mysterious sheriff, the old lady that everyone thinks to be crazy -bill Karen Black no less), and so on. Nevertheless, it is done in a fun and not pretentious way, which makes the film entertaining without wanting it, in a way "so bad, it is good". The characters and the dialogue are what you expect from this type of film: familiar, ordinary and without originality. The actors are all doing decent work though, since I've actually seen big budget movies of this type with a worse acting game (I know what you did last summer, anyone? And add a little credibility to the movie itself. The villain in this film (The 49'er) is obviously derived from the climbing plant of Jeepers Creepers, up to the brown coat, hat and long white hair. Like the climbing plant, he never talks and he is really ugly. The gore is a little disappointing in my opinion. There are some pretty macabre moments, but too many things are off screen and the scenes of death are often laughable (Spoiler ahead!). There's a really hilarious moment when a girl is beheaded by the bad guy, and to get that effect, the filmmakers hide the actress' body under the bad guy's coat, head forward, and apply some blood to him dummy on the neck. Seriously, you could see the outline of his shoulders! I think they could have done a little better there, even if the budget was low (and I'm sure it was, but still?). The special effects are inexpensive, but sufficiently effective and moderately well done for a low-budget movie. The effects or the director seem to have a weakness for explosions and shots. Almost every scene near the end of the movie has at least two characters burned to death (still filmed in slow motion) or SOMETHING explodes, whether it's a car or an old mining cave. Seriously, no one has ever heard the term; "Stop, drop and roll"!?!?!? <br /> <br /> "The massacre of the miners" (or "The curse of the forty-nine", as you want to call it) is cheesy and dumb, though entertaining, and as long as you do not have expectations through the roof, you will be entertained enough. <br /> <br /> I feel generous, so I will give him a 4/10.
