At what point? Well, compared to this movie, Cannibal Holocaust is citizen Kane. There is acting on stilts, the atrocious dialogue, the half-cooked plot and, like its associated play, too many animal slaughter on screen that have been made. Unlike the Holocaust, Ferox is a simple film. It does not pretend to be a pseudo documentary. In a way, it helps the production to the extent that the film is very sharp and clean compared to the grain of the holocaust. Unfortunately, we have a group of morally reprehensible people again. They torture the natives and essentially bring everything they have on themselves. There is really nothing in this film that is worth it. I was quite lenient in my Holocaust review because of a real attempt at declaration and style, but in the case of Ferox, there is no reason to look at this unless you put yourself in in blood and blood.
