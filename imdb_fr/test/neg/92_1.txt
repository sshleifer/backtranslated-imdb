this film has no plot, no good acting, to be honest, it has nothing, the same songs are still playing and still so awful and if you can sit and watch it all and enjoy it there is something wrong with you. I wish I could give this 0 out of 10, but I can not, so it must be a 1 which is generous! Ice-t is not even a good rapper and worse as a comedian, every part of the movie is a rubbish, I got this movie on DVD without knowing what it was for the price of Â£ 1.99 and I thought I had a good deal. I then took a look at the IMDb rating and did not take it into account, but after seeing it, I realized that the DVD I had bought was a waste of time, money and electricity. if you have this movie, you can sell it to someone who does not know it or burn it!
