The year 1993 was a time of change for the WWE, but for this Wrestlemania, they decided to go back in time when Hulk Hogan was back, accompanied by his good friend Brutus Beefcake, who was out of fight since an accident paragliding in 1990. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It was not a big event. Only two matches had a real build and the whole thing turned out to be rushed. The action on the ring was not great and the twist at the end, which I will talk about earlier, was not really the time of the Earth's burst that WWE was hoping for. <br /> <br /> This forgotten night began with Shawn Micheals to defend his title of intercontinental champion against unbeaten Tatanka. Tatanka had beaten Michaels a few times before the fight. Michaels had a new director, Luna Vachon, while Tatanka was accompanied by his former director and future future member of the WWE Hall of Fame, Sherri Martel. Tatanka won by DQ. Michaels kept his title and immediately returned to his quarrel with Marty Janetty, who had been put on hold just for Wrestlemania. Why, I have no idea. <br /> <br /> Then the Steiner brothers (Scott and Rick) defeated the Headshrinkers (Samu and Fatu), Scott scoring the goal after hitting Samu with the Frankensteiner. Good game. <br /> <br /> Doink the clown needed the help of another clown to win his match against Crush. A second Doink distracted Crush when he had complete control and allowed him to win. Doink was a funny gimmick character, who grew older rather quickly. <br /> <br /> Razor Ramon easily beat Bob Backlund in the next match. <br /> <br /> This brings us to the first of our two main events. As Mega Maniacs Team of Hulk Hogan and Brutus Beefcake, with the new brave guy turned Jimmy Hart in their corner, have faced the old friends of Hart, Money Inc. (Ted DiBiase and Irwin R Shyster). It was a pretty basic finish. Beefcake, as mentioned, had a paragliding accident requiring facial surgery and had played the match with a mask. Shyster tore off his mask and beat Beefcake. The referee dropped, Hogan grabbed the mask and knocked out DiBIase and Shyster, then Hart, who wore a referee's shirt, counted all three. Another arbitrator reversed his decision and overturned the decision by declaring the winners of Money Inc by DQ. <br /> <br /> Then Lex Luger or the narcissist, as he was also known at the time, defeated Mr. Perfect. This match came about because Luger was led by former Perfect manager Bobby Heenan. Perfect had his feet on the ropes when he was immobilized, but the referee missed him. <br /> <br /> The Undertaker won a poor DQ victory in a rather mediocre match against giant Gonzales. The Undertaker angered Gonzales director Harvey Wippleman in 1992 and Taker defeated his big monster Kamala at Survivor Series. Wippleman swore vengeance and took it to the Royal Rumble while Gonzales attacked Taker, which cost him the match. Gonzales dominated Undertaker in this match, but was DQ'd for choking Taker with chloroform. It's weird to end a bad game. <br /> <br /> That led us to our main event as WWE Champion, Bret Hart, seriously challenged for the first time, to put his title on the table against Fuji's unstoppable monster. , Yokozuna. Yokozuna controlled the start but Hart resisted and then took control. He had Yokozuna in the sniper, he would surely give in and Hart would become a heroic hero after defeating the big monster. But Fuji had other ideas: throwing salt on Hart's face, making the Canadian defenseless while Yokozuna got the pin. <br /> <br /> What a dark end. But wait, here is Hulk Hogan. He checks that Hart is fine. Suddenly, Fuji challenges Hogan to win a title at WWE. Hogan agrees. Fuji throws salt at Hogan, but hits Yokozuna instead. Hogan strikes the leg and wins the match and the title. What have I just watched? And so, what most fans thought would be the night we would have seen Hart establish himself as a giant killer, or that Yokozuna would establish himself as an unstoppable monster, we instead saw Hulk Hogan win a title without meaning . A title he would not defend for three months. In fact, this is the only game Hogan played for WWE in front of the King of the Ring PPV in June 1993.
