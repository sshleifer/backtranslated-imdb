Don Wilson plays the role of Jack Cutter (real name hard!), A vampire slayer who faces an army of vampires. You see that the story is a little different, because vampires can not be killed with money, crosses or sun, but rather necks (as it's convenient because it reduces the budget) and that's Here Cutter Meets Reporter (Melanie Smith of Trancers III Glory) Night Hunter's action sequences are shaking for no reason during the fight sequences and while this is supposed to emphasize the mood, it makes the movie even more shocking. What is worse is that these fight sequences are shaken beyond belief, Wilson's martial arts talent being concealed by a disjointed edition. Of course, the greatest interest comes from the fact that it is indeed prior to Blade, but the problem is that it was done on a small budget and that Don Wilson was there. He is Roger Corman and this turkey is a movie that most people would NOT pay to see. Unfortunately, I am at the bottom of things and I address the section of the store in search of precious stones. In this sector, you always encounter difficulties. With Night Hunter, I'm in danger of having the craziest poop in the world. <br /> <br /> 1/2 * on 4- (Awful)
