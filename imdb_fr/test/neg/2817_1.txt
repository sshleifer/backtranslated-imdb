Killing the Scream Queen may seem like a good slasher movie, but it is terribly boring and very stupid. <br /> <br /> Killing the Scream Queen is a crazy filmmaker who auditions girls in her movie. He rapes them and tortures them. They are garbage that is not amusing, suspensive or entertaining. The killer has no motive, okay, maybe he's just sick ... and very boring. Maybe they could give a victim a story of their own. Everything could be an improvement. It needed a lot more. <br /> <br /> They could put a little more. I love horror / slasher movies, but it's ridiculously bad.
