I like Das Boot. I was hoping for something similar - a realistic war movie, depicting soldiers and civilians on both sides as real people, with the joy and pain of combat. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Stalingrad seems to have been written third grade and led by a fifth grade student. The major pieces of the film just disappeared, leaving it completely disjointed. The dialogue in translation is ridiculous, but does not appear better in the mother tongue; Just look at the actors' faces during the difficult moments of the dialogue to realize how bad this movie is.
