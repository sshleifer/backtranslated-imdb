If a movie does not interest you in the first 25 minutes, it's over for me. This concept of simply dealing with the slow first third of a film and being rewarded later is nonsense. A good movie must begin and end loud. It all sounds interesting, with some decent photos and lots of promises, but ultimately confusing and irrelevant. There are so many other Asian movies to watch, most of which have surely not been seen, that I'm sure I do not watch this one and look elsewhere. Why exactly does IMDb require a minimum of 10 rows for evaluations? I said my play and I hope it will help some of you to move on to the next movie.
