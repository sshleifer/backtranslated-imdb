This movie was so stupid and slow was it still slow. The only good part of the movie was that of the girl in tight golden trousers. There was no Whatsover gore and what is a horror movie of the 80s without a bit of gore. Moreover, the murderer was not at all scary, any more than the murders. But if you like to watch the worst horror film in the world, it's for you. Do not waste your time as I watched this.
