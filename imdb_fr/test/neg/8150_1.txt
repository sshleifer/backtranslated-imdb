This movie has one or two slightly interesting gags, but they are not worth the wait. After an unexplained argument between two guys collecting garbage in a movie theater driving, we cut a family that was leaving! Hollywood and his driving by driving their camper through the screen again and again while a senseless dialogue is heard. At least, I think it's absurd, the terrible song that accompanies this montage is mixed so much that it sometimes makes dialogue almost inaudible. <br /> <br /> Finally, the camper arrives, at night, at a service station where the family is out for a new insane conversation, before leaving. The camera then panes to reveal the actor we have just seen leaving. He speaks directly to the camera and we realize that he is the director of the film we are watching, who is concerned, and how he came to make the film. <br /> <br /> A beautiful idea that has almost (but not quite) the previous sequences are worth it. <br /> <br /> As the film unfolds, he meets the two characters we met collecting garbage at the beginning of the film. They all form a film society. <br /> <br /> All sorts of funny and clumsy comedies follow when they form a team and try to raise the funds necessary to start filming. <br /> <br /> This film is obviously mounted on a shoe chain and a promise and there is a nice little idea here that has trouble going out, but the execution is so inept that the idea is lost . Comedy is more than just falling and everyone is talking (or screaming) at the same time. Much of the dialogue here is shouted by several actors simultaneously: Robert Altman knows how to do this kind of thing because he has a scenario, rehearsals, decent sound technicians and editing facilities. Everyone who screams on the microphone that, as it is said, was hidden in a trash can of the next room, displays nothing.
