"Fate" brings Walter Sparrow to seize a mysterious novel with similarities and strange relationships to his life, all based around number 23. While the story unfolds in real life and fiction, Sparrow must understand his connection with the book. and how the story will end. <br /> <br /> Number 23 offers an intriguing premise that is defeated by a weak performance. The film failed on many levels, which is quite disappointing because it had a lot of potential. The scenario was probably the worst. It was filled with stupid sequences and laughable dialogues that had just killed the film's atmosphere. It seemed that the screenwriter had a good idea, he just did not know how to develop it to stretch over a period of 90 minutes. The second half of the movie was short of ideas, the turn was obvious and the end was horrible. <br /> <br /> Joel Schumacher is responsible for one of the worst movies of all time and bought a little with Phone Booth and some other movies but The Number 23 reminds me that he is still capable to do the fucking. He has the film soaked in style but he just can not focus properly. He moves the movie at an awkward and slow pace. He goes from reality to what is really happening in the book, which quickly became annoying. The book in the movie titled "The Number 23" is a terrible detective story and the audience is stuck listening to Carrey tell it, which bored me to tears. When Carrey finally finishes with the book, we are stuck watching him run to try to solve the mystery. At this point, the public has lost interest and there is no real tension. We look forward to the film reaching its horrible end and an unconvincing explanation before celebrating that the film is finally over. <br /> <br /> The acting game was rather average and rather unforgettable. Jim Carrey was clearly dozing through his performance and he did not even seem to be trying. It was either completely exaggerated in some scenes or just very wooden. His narration was a total boredom to listen to and he did not put life inside his character. Virginia Madsen has done her best with a limited role, but she must choose better scripts. Logan Lerman was pretty bland just like Danny Huston. Overall, The Number 23 was a terrible thriller that offered more laughter than suspense or chills. Rating 3/10
