The VHS jacket of The Evil Below gives the impression of an underwater horror film. Unfortunately, this sounds more like a boring adventure movie and contains no real horror elements. It starts with some divers being attacked and we see some blood, but it's the only blood in the whole movie. <br /> <br /> The Evil Below is not the worst, but for a horror movie it's boringly boring. The acting is decent and to be honest, the only thing that keeps you from watching is the developing romance between the two main characters. There are some nightmarish sequences where it seems that the director does not know what to do. I missed attending everything (pretty much), but I would not recommend this movie to anyone. Horror fans may want a copy for VHS coverage, but it's better to stay there.
