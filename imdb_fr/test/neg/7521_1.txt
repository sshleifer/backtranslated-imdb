I was one of the many fools who were forced to pay for it at the theater, even though I paid $ 4 for the morning rate (before 6pm). <br /> <br /> The story of this remake was cruel, the CGI Morlocks was bad, the Eloi were Rastafarian to imitate the fashion of the day (no, I did not think the girl was hot at all), the Re-killing the hero's modern girlfriend was a little cruel, all in all, it was a sad and bad remake. <br /> <br /> I'm going to bring Rod Taylor, Weena and the big, bright-eyed surfer, Morlocks, on this junk anytime. My guess is that many critics who love this horrible remake are young children, which is neither the good taste nor a real value of the old classics that are largely unknown to today's confused youngsters and increasingly more eager. <br /> <br /> When the 60 version came out (I saw it for the first time in the 70's for the pleasure of summer), it was really impressive and still holds. You do not have to have too much CGI in a movie to make it better. Too much of this seems wrong. I can not say enough about the disappointment of the Morlocks. They ran and jumped like in a children's video game. 3 out of 10 stars.
