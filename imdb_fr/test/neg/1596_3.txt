Someone told me that Pink Flamingos was, in a word, "crazy". Now, I wonder if this guy has ever seen it, because that's not how I would summarize it in a nutshell. Disgusting, absurd, hum, more disgusting ... would do it. Whenever you think that it can not get dirtier, that's the case. One of my "favorites" was when Divine had her birthday party and when the cops came to undo her, they were slaughtered and eaten by the guests. I admit it's one of those movies where it's so grotesque that you can not just look away, but it's not a creative work of art. It's pure shock value. <br /> <br /> The good thing is that the Jackass guys look like a bunch of pussies.
