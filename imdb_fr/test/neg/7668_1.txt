This film is an absolute shame! I really enjoyed the airport of origin and I can not believe that the same people can produce this film as nine years later. First of all, the acting is bad. The original had actors who had already made quality films (without disaster), but this one uses actors who have already made the disaster movie circuit (Blakely, Kennedy, Wagner). In addition, the character of George Kennedy, Patroni, seems to have been promoted very quickly. He is now the main role in the film, but his character is not strong enough to win: he lost the charm and humor of Airport (1970), and the character is now just boring. Did I mention the plot? Is it credible at all that someone sends a missile after the Concorde? NO!!! There are also too many tips; scenes that have no relevance to the plot. The scene where the balloon landing on the track, the pursuit of the thief at Charles de Gaulle airport are two examples. Both would be interesting - if only they had something to do with the real story. There are also many unanswered questions: Why is Patroni opening the window and shooting a flare on the other plane? Why does Robert Wagner's character kill himself? (There must be another stupid and expensive way.) Why is there no investigation after the missile almost blew up the Concorde? Why are the rear projections so bad? When the plane lands at Paris) Why does Patroni think he is in a flight simulator? (when he returns the Concorde) Why is he greeted by a hero in the cabin of the plane after terrifying the passengers? And why Because of their one-dimensional dimension, nobody seems to realize it. The blessing given to the young couple on the plane by the girl's trainer is shmaltzy, the man who plays the saxophone is boring, and the woman with the bladder problem is just silly. this film should have been the apogee of the pre There are three films on the airport: it is a waste of time, money, energy, celluloid and "talent" diabolical, sub-weak, complete and total !!!!!!! Remember when Patroni asks the French driver if he has "already landed on his stomach?" This film certainly makes the flop flop, and lands flat on his sharp nose ...
