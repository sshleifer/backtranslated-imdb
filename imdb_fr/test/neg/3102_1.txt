I saw this film some time ago, because some of my friends wanted to rent it, and I was rejected. I did my best to get the story, because some movies had told Rob Lowe, what Pulp Fiction had been for John Travolta ... Well ... we can all see that he's not only failed, but he fell alone. It's actually the worst movie I've ever seen, and I've seen a lot of bad movies ... it's not even worth watching for free on TV.
