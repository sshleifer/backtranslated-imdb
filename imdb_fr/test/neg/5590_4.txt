EVALUATIONS IN STARS: ***** Saturday night **** Friday night *** Friday morning ** Sunday night * Monday morning <br /> <br /> David (Johnathon Schaech) and Tish (Lori Heuring) form a couple in Budapest, for professional commitments and a stay in a luxury hotel. One evening, they meet an attractive woman in a disco and invite him to their home, where they find themselves in a threesome. All is well, until David receives negatives in the mail and he and Tish end up being blackmailed. But when some people involved in deception are found murdered, things get complicated and they are forced to enter the subterranean and shabby world of pornography and bondage to find the woman who could hold the key to everything. <br /> <br /> While the original film dealt with the concept of snuff films, this sequel directly on DVD deals with the healthier theme (!!!) of the trios and the sleazy sex. It's like a porn movie, a piece of cheap titillation with a lot of T / A hot acts. If that sounds like your idea of ​​a good movie, you'll probably like it, but you'd probably be better off. comfortable in a porno shop than in a video store. <br /> <br /> You are trying to copy the original. The film is both dark and voyeuristic, but even if it does a very good job, it still does not resist that of the original. He has an apathetic story, with a shady narrative flow. And compared to Cage, Schaech appears to be interminably made of wood. <br /> <br /> Better than I thought, and far better than your average of those direct DVD suites that seem to go out a lot these days, but really, have not we seen enough? **
