If you see this film in TV programs, ignore it. If you're looking for something scary, you'd better watch X-Files reruns. <br /> <br /> The previous comments referring to the incredibly poor role of the leading female role are without appeal. She is almost unassailable. The total sum of his range includes "whiny and frightened" and "whiny and not afraid". <br /> <br /> I am the kind of movie buff who loves a good "bad" movie. But that's ridiculous. There is no direction. The plot is as simplistic as the set of numbers that they continue to launch and, just like this set of numbers, it ultimately has no meaning. <br /> <br /> Your time will be better used if you turn off turn off the television and give a bath to your dog.
