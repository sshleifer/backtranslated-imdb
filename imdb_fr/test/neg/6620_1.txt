There is a reason why the chairman of the board got a 2 (which is too high). This film is one of the worst of all time and I saw my share of rotten films. Chairman of the Board Carrot Top and Courtney Thorne Smith is one of the most annoying stars of the moment. Carrot Top is just not funny and was not in this trash. Courtney Thorne Smith is no better, just look at "From Jim" and you'll see a great example of what I'm talking about. The chairman of the board has received a 1 from me, because it is as serious as possible. I'm a little shocked that this junk does not appear somewhere in the bottom of the IMdb 100. I would put it in the top 5 of this list, but it moves slowly.
