First of all, I have nothing against Christianity. I believe that everyone has the right to believe what they choose. But I can not imagine how stupid a person must be to believe it! What a waste of money for believers. They would do better to use it to feed hungry families in third world countries. I do not want to talk about acting or intrigue this "movie", because I could not find any in this one. The story is simple: two journalists, one (A) atheist, the other (B) for the sake of some abandoned the religion. B regains his confidence in religion and gives a lesson to A - believe in Christ or go to hell. This message appears after about ten minutes and is repeated until the end of the film. People do not believe the rating assigned to this "movie", read the comments first. I have not lost an hour of my life :( PS: Why is it considered science fiction? Because of these strange sounds and a little bright light from the sky? PPS: UFO = Les perverse deeds of Satan? new :)
