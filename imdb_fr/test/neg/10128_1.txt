If you were wondering whether Disney could broadcast a show with a character more spoiled than Paris, more superficial than Britney, more tasteless than Jessica and more narcissistic than THE GIRLS NEXT DOOR, do not ask the question. What is amazing is that Selena Gomez is apparently supposed to be the heroine. She is also supposed to be rejected by the spoiled, superficial, tasteless and narcissistic "school girls", which is no more credible here than for Hilary Duff in LIZZIE McGUIRE. Plots range from recycled BEWITCHED & I DREAM OF JEANNIE to the parodies of HARRY POTTER. The older boy alternates between being a magical genius and being unable to master the complexities of his own laces. The boy is just another of the clever kids on the palate who have bred on television like roaches in New York (and with the same call). Dad is the stereotypical daddy of the silly tv, and the mom ... well, she's not totally awful. But everything pales beside the hideous, disgusting, and yet horribly fascinating spectacle (like a bad car accident) of Mrs. Lopez's inadequate, satisfied and arrogant spectacle. And again, it's the heroine.
