This joins the endless line of the science fiction shlock of the 50s, nerdy and predictable. As usual, it's pretty bad. There is not much intrigue I can detect and the excessive exaggeration of the tracks only adds to the involuntary shouts of laughter. The title is deceptive too. Catching this on MST3K is probably the only way to see it, and it's better to leave it that way.
