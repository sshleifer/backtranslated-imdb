The most horrible cast I have ever seen. Clark Kent as a crack, a very feminine woman like a trans, etc. ............. <br /> <br /> Silly violence in the ass just to be violent. No content, no meaning. This person has never been on the street. It's a joke! <br /> <br /> The only thing stupid that this movie is the fact that I finished watching it. I kept thinking that it could not be worse, but that was the case until the end. <br /> <br /> Try to make a difficult film. Try to be weird. So stupid! I really have nothing to say, but I can not leave a comment, unless I write more. <br /> <br /> Please, take this advice and do not hesitate to watch this movie !!!!! TERRIBLE!!!
