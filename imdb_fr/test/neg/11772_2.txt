It's not often that I give two stars to a horror movie because horror is my favorite genre. A movie can be bad in that it is not a masterpiece, but can be nice on the basis of unintentional humor, weird characters, and so on. A lot of horror / science fiction movies from the 1940s to the 1980s. They are nice for genre lovers and fun lovers because their "nastiness" is entertaining. However, this film has nothing of the humor or the bloody scenes of the original "Piranha" (1978). <br /> <br /> I guess in 1995 it was the pinnacle of political correctness, the gore on TV was at a minimum. Now in the mid-2000s with C.S.I. watch, television is a festival of absolute blood! (Good for us, horror fans!) <br /> <br /> William Katt and Alexandra Paul are not Bradford Dillman and Heather Menzies (the stars of 1978). These are not the faults of Katt and Paul, but the writers and the director who created this lukewarm turkey. The way the main characters interact is the main flaw of this movie. I will not say how because it's part of the plot. <br /> <br /> This TV movie probably had a larger budget than the original movie but was a good horror, as evidenced by user votes. Stay true to the 1978 original if you fancy a killer fish movie!
