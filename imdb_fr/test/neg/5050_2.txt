It's a shame that high-quality actors and actresses get involved in pure shit, probably because they have been offered a lot of money. Helen Mirren does not look better in her career. The game of "teenagers" is simply appalling, not helped by a scenario that is in part simply inept. <br /> <br /> Most of Kevin Williamson's work is above average, above average, but it's really below average. <br /> <br /> This is the kind of movie you watch on TV when there is nothing better, you drank half a bottle of wine and you wait until the pizza is delivered for to be able to drink it The other half.
