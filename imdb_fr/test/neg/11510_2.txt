The first time I saw an advertisement for this show was when my sisters were watching Kim Possible's movie. Sadie and her friend were discussing the meaning of the word "nothing" in advertising. This is one of the most stupid ads I have ever seen. Basically, they come and go with lines of the type "Nothing is a thing, so technically nothing is something". When I saw that, I thought it would be another fool of Lizzie Maguire by Disney. But I did not know how bad it was. <br /> <br /> Fast forward, about 3 weeks when my sister turns on the T.V. Naturally, Sadie happened to be on. What I saw was one of the funniest shows I've ever seen. How did it go? Something like this: <br /> <br /> Sadie, a vegetarian tree lover, has an incredibly unhealthy and obsessive crush on Owen, a very monotonous and badly played man. For some reason, her friend Margret decides that Owen must be "tested" to see if he's as good as he seems. What exactly are these tests? Well, one thing they do is put a cockroach on his notebook. Why? So that she can be sassy and ask her monotonous knight in sparkling armor to remove it. How is this a test? Because if he crushes it, he is mean and indifferent and does not believe that insects, as Sadie says, "are also innocent animals". THEY SHARE THE DISEASE AND THE PESTILANCE! They deserve to be crushed! But of course, Owen sweeps him out the window and Sadie is still in love. But that's not all! Margret says he must be challenged once more, on something that "no one can pass". It consists of putting on scarves in their pants (yes, you read correctly) and buying it to see if they notice their big butts. As you might expect, he does not notice it and we see Sadie in her bizarre and weird world of notebooks. Sadie decides that she wants to be with Owen forever, raise a family with him and, as she says so well, "lives like wooden ducks with their offspring". It's just wrong. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: This is the weirdest and craziest show I've watched. For those who like to make fun of nonsense, you will love. For anyone, ignore this show.
