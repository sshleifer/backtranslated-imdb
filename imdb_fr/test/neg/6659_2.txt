Exceptionally bad! I do not expect much from Garcia since he is one of the most overrated actors today, but Keaton should have known that this film would be bad and come out as much as he could ( it's not that I love him particularly, but he did it (Batman). <br /> <br /> In one scene, Keaton is transported to a chained hospital wearing a Hannibal Lecter-type mask when two attacking dogs bark at him (dogs can smell the hurt you know (vomit)) and Keaton growls behind them, pulling them back and moaning with their tails between their legs. Did the film turn the comedy right there? Garcia makes fun of himself in an interrogation scene with dialogues that only a total delay could find plausible and the kid is too annoying to feel sorry for. <br /> <br /> If you are going to make a film with such a poor plot like this requires charm, humor, solid action. Take Die Hard for example, which is great despite its rather crappy plot. <br /> <br /> Even though Keatons was a joke, I simply routed him. I wanted to see Garcia crying over his dead son and Keaton sipping martinis on a paradise island, though! This film makes you laugh .. Look at it with a spiritual friend and you can have fun while this film claims sarcasm in almost every scene. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's an insult to intelligence and a huge waste of money. Greed made this movie and thank god, he bit his ass.
