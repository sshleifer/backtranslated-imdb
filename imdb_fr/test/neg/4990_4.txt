They did it again: they tore the title of an old show, then destroyed the nostalgia with boring stuff "reinvented". The 60s cartoon was one of the funniest of his time, a benevolent satire of superhero comics. The character was drawn halfway between the animal and the man, in the manner of Mickey Mouse. Here they use a real Beagle; it's about the same as making a Mickey Mouse watch with a real rat. <br /> <br /> Missing most of the intelligent schtick that made the original show funny in this movie. Instead, we have an old clumsy police dog who is even dumber than Cad. And some pet owners who add nothing to the story. Cheesy effects (talking dog animation is embarrassing). Wrong script. A stereotypical dwarf playing Simon Bar Sinister. The guy from the gritty sound box they hired to talk to Underdog is painful. One would think they would at least have had an impressionistic voice to get closer to Wally Cox's distinctive humorous voice for Underdog. But no. There are at least some affectionate references to the source material (such as rhyming lines), which bring it to a 4. <br /> <br /> Only small children who love dogs can enjoy it. Everyone should get a DVD of the original cartoon series. Look at this only in desperation.
