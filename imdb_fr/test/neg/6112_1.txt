A good friend of mine said, "A monkey is funny, anytime, anywhere." There is one exception to this: GOING BANANAS. It's simply the worst film I've ever seen. It's worse than plan 9, worse than the beast of YUCCA apartments. It's terrible. The talking monkey gets old after about three minutes and believe me, that's all. Make sure you have a group of people around you to relive after you go to TOXIC SHOCK of GOING BANANAS, the worst movie of all time.
