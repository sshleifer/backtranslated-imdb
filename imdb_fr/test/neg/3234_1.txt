Dean Koontz's book "Watchers" is one of the best books I've read. Unfortunately, the film is a sad caricature of the book. The middle-aged disillusioned hero and the bachelor with whom he finds meaning in his life are converted in the film into a couple of stupid teenagers. The stoic security officer and the conscientious sheriff are combined into a wacky villain - you get the picture? The filmmakers took a moving story of love, horror and adventure and turned it into a Z-Grade horror movie intended - very badly - for the teen market. <br /> <br /> Buy the book and enjoy many hours of reading - it will be far more rewarding than watching the movie. <br /> <br />
