I rented this movie because the DVD cover looked like it was going to be a silly comedy at the college like van wilder or pet shop. I took him to my friend's house to watch a movie night. We ended up stopping the movie 15 minutes after the movie started and instead saw Copper Mountain. I do not know if any of you have seen Copper Mountain, but it's not great either. However, I must say that the Alan Thick Jim Carrey Duo made it a nicer watch. <br /> <br /> Later, I finished Puddle Cruiser. This film was slow and the humor forced. This film reminded me of some stinky I had seen in some of my previous production classes at the university. I wondered "was this the film that allowed Broken Lizard to make Supertroopers?" Also, how could this movie suck so badly? Supertroopers was good and the Dread Club was ok. Do not see this movie!
