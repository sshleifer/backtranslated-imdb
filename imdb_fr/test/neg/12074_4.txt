This film follows the life of a great guitarist, who wants to do things big but who behaves irresponsibly to the point of self-destruction. <br /> <br /> I was expecting the usual witty dialogues, sarcasm and humor of Woody Allen but "Sweet and Lowdown" failed to provide it. The main character, Emmet Ray, is an egocentric, rude, irresponsible and hurtful man. He is so unfriendly that I do not want to talk about him or worry about him. I wonder why a movie about him has to be done. The pace of the story is slow, making the movie a terrible trouble. Even Sean Penn's great acting game fails to bring the film back to life. <br /> <br /> I really like Woody Allen's films, but "Sweet and Lowdown" is a major disappointment.
