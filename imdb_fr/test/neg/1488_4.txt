Like many history buffs in western Pennsylvania, I was really looking forward to participating in this much-advertised PBS program that was produced by the Pittsburgh WQED. However, I must say now that I was a little disappointed. On the positive side, I think that overall, this film has well explained the main problems and describes the events of the so-called French and Indian War. In particular, his presentation from the Indian point of view was somewhat new and quite interesting, although it was certainly overestimated at the time. Still on the positive side, the mix of narrative and action scenes was well done and was a bit better than many of these typical documentaries composed of "expert" and still-image interviews (at the Ken Burns). On the negative side, many battles have had a somewhat "organized" aspect and many important aspects of the war have been neglected. Above all, I was very disappointed and frustrated by the lack of importance given to the successful Forbes campaign in 1758 against Fort Duquesne, compared to the previous failures of 1754 by Washington and 1755 by Braddock. In particular, I was somewhat incredulous at NOT having mentioned Colonel Henry Bouquet, the Swiss mercenary of the British service who was the main culprit of the success of Forbes. Finally, I could not believe in the complete omission of the 1763 Battle of Bushy Run, which began with a resumption of Braddock's defeat but ended with the victory that decided the outcome of the Pontiac War through artifice. Colonel Bouquet, who ranked among the most successful British commanders of this war.
