When I first became a father about 5.5 years ago, I was prepared for many sacrifices I had to make. I knew I would have to change diapers, go to swimming classes and attend many Santa Claus parades, but I was not ready for the kind of sacrifice I made last night. This, in my humble opinion, is a cruel and unusual punishment. <br /> <br /> An outsider is bad. It's not bad for karate, but it gives The Shaggy Dog the feeling of being Pulp Fiction. If Underdog was a TV show, I would advise you to stop. Even the presence of Puddy and the voice of Banky Edwards can not save him. Bow. Wow. <br /> <br /> It was also about the best of the 80 minutes I've ever enjoyed. James sat to the right of me and Michelle left, and I spent more time watching their reaction to this conversation by flying than watching the screen. At the age of 5 and 3, they were the target audience, and this film made the target clear. There's a scene where Underdog is snapping hard under the face of another dog and Michelle thought it was the funniest scene ever filmed. When Underdog flew into space, James was literally on the edge of his seat, hypnotized. The kids absolutely loved Underdog, and that's why I was there. That's what last night was. <br /> <br /> Unless you're traveling with someone under 10, you do not miss a second of your life watching this brutal movie. But if you're looking to kill 80 minutes with your four-year-old, I will not judge. I enjoyed it.
