Sad to say, this is one of the most ridiculous in John Wayne's series of poverty westerns for Lone Star Productions. Here he is a United States Marshal on the trail of a known bandit only, I beg you, Shadow. <br /> <br /> No, it's not Lamont Cranston, it's a guy who gives his orders through an open wall. safe so that his men do not see who he is. But the voice is undeniable, you'll know in the 10 minutes after the film. <br /> <br /> And another criticism here is absolutely wrong. There would have been no screams or groans from the audience, because Gabby Hayes still played various roles and he was razor-shaven here. He had not yet found his place as a friendly sidekick of the veteran of various movie cowboy heroes like the Duke. <br /> <br /> Later, he leads his men openly in the climax, so I'm not sure about the interest of the original gimmick with the wall safe was. I do not think that those who wrote this one know it either. <br /> <br /> Wayne gets Yakima Canutt here as an Indian partner and the relationship is pretty much the same as that of an unmasked Lone Ranger and Tonto. <br /> <br /> That's pretty silly if you ask me.
