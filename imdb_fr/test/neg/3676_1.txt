This film is totally nil. I love Val Kilmer and I was very surprised earlier this year by "Felon" (a good movie!). The entire DVD box is misleading. Val Kilmer, while being considered one of the main characters of this film, is in the film for about 2 minutes. Even the summary on the back of the DVD is not quite true. It could have been a good movie but the direction was awful and the plot was about as thin as a sheet of paper. Usually, when a movie is so dreadful, you can sit back and laugh at it. However, this movie is so bad and boring that I fell asleep (which I never do during a movie). AVOID AT ALL PRICES!
