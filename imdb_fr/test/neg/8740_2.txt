After watching this movie, I can only wonder what are the reasons for its creation. It was without a doubt one of the worst films I have ever seen and which did not include any redemptive film. <br /> <br /> If it was supposed to be funny, it might have managed to be a very weak comedy, but The action thriller was terrible. <br /> <br /> Slow, no plot, no real action, nothing approaches a good dialogue and I have no idea of ​​the characters. What else can I say? To avoid.
