It has been several minutes since I try to write a summary of the plot and I can not do it. But with a film as bad as Night of the Blood Beast, the plot does not matter. An astronaut lands and is dead. His body is resuscitated later, but we discover that he carries the embryos of a strange form of extraterrestrial life. But how did they get there? And where is the alien who implanted the strange creatures into Major John Corcoran's body? <br /> <br /> IMDb lists the Night Execution Time of the Bloody Beast at 62 minutes. Is it correct? 62 minutes? It must have been longer than that. It seemed endless. Even with the comment of MST3K (which was very funny by the way), the movie itself was a lot longer. And it's pretty much a snoozer from start to finish. I like a lot of these extraterrestrial-type movies of the 50s, but not this one. It did not attract my interest at any level. The extraterrestrial babies were too stupid to want to be taken seriously, the beast of blood was pathetic, and none of the characters helped me. Add to that Roger Corman's usual low-budget traps and you have a real loser of a movie.
