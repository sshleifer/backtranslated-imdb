CAMP BLOOD <br /> <br /> Format report: 1.33: 1 (Nu-View 3-D) <br /> Audio format: Mono <br /> <br /> During a hike in the woods to close to abandoned Blackwood Camp - site of unresolved murder ten years ago - four young city-dwellers are targeted by a masked psychopath who kills their guide (Courtney Harris) and stalking them in the woods with murderous intent ... <br /> <br /> Time lost, filmed on a camcorder using the Nu-View 3D sequential format. There is at least one plot, but the script adheres closely to an established plan (with obvious signs of sensations like "Friday the 13th", "The Burning" and "The Texas Chain Saw Massacre") without adding anything, even to distance, or interesting for the formula. Director Brad Sykes, who is also responsible for similar 3D efforts such as THE ZOMBIE CHRONICLES (2001) and BLOODY TEASE (2002), cites the early work of George A. Romero and Sam Raimi as decisive influences on his career. Sykes uses video technology to emulate his film heroes, giving a home movie with illusions of grandeur. Aside from the 3D format, there is nothing here that deserves anyone's attention. Follow-up of CAMP BLOOD 2 (2000).
