I was really hoping for the best with this one, but it just did not happen. Funded in a very Dutch way and still as beautiful, with a style and a look very close to that of Hollywood. What I do not understand is how, with all these benefits, the director, screenwriter, producer has still managed to make this film a very horrible picture to watch. Filled with bad jokes, cheap nudity and actors who just can not speak English. Kudo for doing it, but what was this guy thinking about!
