Before starting, a "small" correction: IMDb indicates that Richard Gere measures 180 cm. False! I passed him 10 years ago and he can not be an ant greater than 165. I am 183 years old and he looked like a child next to me. <br /> <br /> Should have been called "Wheatlands"; an appropriate title to complete the previous (and much better) Malick movie, "Badlands". This film shows that not all directors have the primary goal of entertaining. In fact, some of them have the main purpose of showing wheat in all its splendor. <br /> <br /> The film is depressing and relatively uninviting, with the tragic end obligatory. Nothing more than a medium and predictable love triangle drama, with the male two-thirds of the triangle not surviving the film. Praised for its visual quality; Although the 1970s are realistic, there are limits to the fascination of wheat fields. You can shoot them with 1500mm cameras, but they are still wheat fields. <br /> <br /> Gere, who at first seems a bad idea, looks like some kind of factory worker from the lower class to Wheatfield. -Worker, is quite solid, while Brooke Adams seems distant and cold during most of the film, which leaves one wondering how much she liked one or the other of the two men. But for those looking for a film that displays all the glorious colors of a wheat field, look no further: you've found your dream! <br /> <br /> If you want to read my "biographies" of Richard Gere and other Hollywood heavyweights, contact me by e-mail.
