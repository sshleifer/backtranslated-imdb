** May contain spoilers ** <br /> <br /> Ok, let's conclude this film in one word: bad. Two words? Really bad. Now, why do I think that? Let me explain. <br /> <br /> Guttenberg leads a special operations team of four people responsible for taking back a deadly virus after a weapons dealer stole it from a laboratory. To do this, they attack the gunsmiths in full flight and recover the virus after a fight. However, suspicions arise about Guttenberg because a terrorist knew his name. After the debriefing, team members are attacked by strangers and everyone begins to suspect that everyone is involved. After deciding not to trust their leaders, they decide once again to steal the virus and to attract potential attackers. <br /> <br /> This is theoretically a plot that could have worked with a reduced budget. film that only aims to be broadcast on television. However, the plot is compromised and the film ruined in several accounts. First of all, the plot is totally predictable and it is not fun to know how the movie will end after three minutes. Second. The acting is really bad, or actors are invited to play the role of models. There are not many emotions, no changes in facial expressions, etc. I was particularly disappointed by Guttenberg who, in my opinion, can do much more, but fails completely in his attempt to be an action hero. In addition, although I am by no means an expert on the subject, I am quite convinced that I can build a better team of secret operators by selecting five foreigners and training them for a week. This seems to be a theme in the movie to make things as stupid and unprofessional as possible. This is also good for the good, the bad and the passersby. Then, I sincerely doubt the scientific and technical consultants, if any, of the film. For example, I poured liquid nitrogen on my hand and did not break instantly. <br /> <br /> I do not know how to conclude this really, but let's say that this movie has a predictable plot, a bad behavior and they seem to be amateurs in every way. Sorry, I can not be nicer than that. Do not watch this movie, it's not even so bad that it's funny. 2/10
