Movies on the mundane are often the most interesting of all movies for me, in the hands of an insightful artist who examines all the twisted little details of the mundane. French cinema often seems very good at this kind of thing and I really like French cinema. <br /> <br /> This film was about the mundane. There was not much intrigue. They were just characters who lived in a city, very normal people, and events had just happened. But it was not very interesting, and it was not examined in a very insightful way. The film captured a certain mood, but it was not a particularly captivating mood. And although I do not see much about the fact that the film was specifically wrong, it failed at almost every level to do anything. <br /> <br /> There were a lot of characters in this movie. Many of them looked a little different, so it was hard to know who was who and what their relationship was. I do not mind making an effort to understand a movie, or even watching a particularly complex movie more than once to fix the details, but this one was a puzzle that was not worth it to be resolved for me. <br /> <br /> The only good thing I can really say about this movie is that cinematography was nice - functional, not brilliant, but enjoyable. The camera often captured beautiful postcard type shots. But he rarely found the little details really interesting. <br /> <br /> I've already seen a handful of not-so-good films at the Seattle International Film Festival, but it's the only one that has failed. applause when the credits rolled. I felt a big collective sigh of relief when the movie was finally over. But I guess there are probably people who would like that. <br /> <br /> 4/10
