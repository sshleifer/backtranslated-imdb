The opening of "The Jungle" promises us a safari adventure with a sci-fi element, but we mostly get a travelogue with lots of archive footage and stuffing (as well as a weird leopard attack) . The film is quiet when you want it to be captivating and tries to get interest in the debates with badly organized games between various wild animals (I did not know that lions and wild boars were natural enemies in nature , is not it, the big cats remained attached to the hunt for the herbivores, but apparently the producers knew it better) <br /> <br /> As for the actors: Cesar does his usual good work of sweep the mustache, and Marie Windsor is reasonably credible as a girl to Rajah's progressive thinking (beautiful eyebrows, by the way!). However, Rod Cameron is barely observable since the hunter is the only survivor of his expedition. I'm sure he was in demand for his time, but here he presents himself as a Bogart Rent-A-Center: tough, but without the scope and timing of Bogey. He goes from film to stereotypical anger to angry stoicism, and every time the scenario tries to spark romantic sparks between him and Windsor, you have to laugh. This gnarled, gnarled face is not a good vector of tenderness. <br /> <br /> The scenario is not entirely devoid of merit, although it makes strange choices. Early in the first act, the scenario is to spend several moments during which the heroes decide to take the intelligent young boy and the mascot monkey, then ignore them until *** SPOILER *** the monkey s picks it up. a live hand grenade at the mammoth scene and accidentally throws near Windsor. This is so Cameron can prove his courage by diving on it and saving his life, at his expense. *** END OF SPOILER. It is possible that the Indian version of this film (which, to my knowledge, worked better than two and a half hours) could have given more to the child and the monkey. <br /> <br /> Another thing that makes the movie show its age ** SPOILER ** is the question of wooly mammoths (the plot that sets the safari in motion in the first place). When they finally appear, the way the scene is filmed clearly shows that the "mammoths" (obviously elephants draped in a long-haired carpet) never "attack" anyone, or even move so fast, and yet Cameron immediately tries to eliminate them with hand grenades. Nowadays, the idea of ​​destroying the last known specimens of a species considered to be extinct would be unthinkable, especially when all they seem to do is ride through the jungle at a pleasant pace. *** END OF SPOILER *** So, IMO, four stars, which is pretty good for a production of Robert Lippert (normally, Lippert's hacking works give at best two or three stars). It's not the sinking of a movie, or anything; moreover, it seems to mean that the rajah's daughter advocated for the improvement of the most repressive aspect of the "traditions" and elements of "métis" romance which were rather progressive in 1952. And there are beautiful landscapes and exotic shows. Look at it if someone offers to show it to you for free, but do not expect much except for an interesting historical chapter from the beginning of fantasy cinema.
