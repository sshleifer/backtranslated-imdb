I just wanted to say that I was very disappointed after watching this movie! I was expecting a biblical story visualized with super special effects, etc., but during the movie, I discovered it was an absolute disaster ... it was not biblical at all. .. only the boat and the animals were similar to those in the story ... if you want a visual translation of the biblical version of Noah, do NOT go watch this movie!
