HAPPY DAYS was one of my favorite shows when it aired in 1974. But critics quickly showed their ignorance, combined with a complete lack of humor by slamming this show, because they thought it was about an inexpensive attempt to make money. the success of American GRAFFITTI. <br /> <br /> There were some similarities between American GRAFFITTI and HAPPY DAYS. <br /> <br /> The two started with Bill Haley & the Comets' Rock Around the Clock. Both took place at a bygone era and both presented Ron Howard as one of the leading roles. But there were also some major differences. While the American GRAFFITTI took place in California in 1962 and brought together a group of newly graduated high school students poised to take this decisive step towards adulthood, HAPPY DAYS took place in Milwaulkee, Wisconson, around of a group of high school teens who have teenage joys and tribulations. <br /> <br /> HAPPY DAYS was originally opened with the juke box playing Bill Haley's original version & the ROCK AROUND THE CLOCK of the Comets. But when the old years became hot, thanks to the success of the American GRAFFITTI, and the original version of ROCK AROUND THE CLOCK dating from 1954, she entered the Billboard Hot 100 and was again a resounding success in 1974 ; So a "remake" of the song (the correct term is now "new stereo recording") was quickly replaced. <br /> <br /> The current theme song of HAPPY DAYS was then introduced for the second season if my memory is good right. <br /> <br /> Fans and opponents agree that this show is an escape. Freedoms were taken and details were forgotten, making this show less than authentic. <br /> <br /> It's perfect. HAPPY DAYS is supposed to be a comedy, not a history lesson. But it sometimes happened that writers defend themselves by addressing controversial topics. One episode centered around Cunningham's construction of a fallout shelter. Another episode concerned a divorced woman who was settling in the neighborhood with the dream of starting a new life. The subject of prejudice was raised when Howard was invited to the wedding of an old friend of the army who was simply black (at a time when prejudices and discrimination were unfortunately an acceptable part of the American way of life). The question of the draft was even discussed in a later episode! <br /> <br /> The show as it was originally in 1955. One of the problems that was treated wisely was distribution. Most of them were teenagers and, as each year went by, it was obvious that they were getting older. The series was getting older with distribution, spreading the series of safe waters from the Eisenhower years to bring it to Camelot's age, up to JFK and then into the turbulent half later of the 1960s. That, as well as the writers at short of ideas, and later, cast members like Ron Howard leaving the show, wisely abandoning themselves while they were in front, let me wish they all did the right thing by unplugging the series and leaving the series. while they were ahead. That, as well as the idol-worshiping studio audience that simply could not control each time the Grand Fonzie came on the scene, was starting to get dressed very quickly. <br /> <br /> This show originally portrayed the Fabulous Fifties LOVES to remember that time. Time heals wounds, you know. Everything has its place and although I prefer to listen to the "original versions" rather than these "new stereo recordings", these "new stereo recordings" worked very well HAPPY DAYS. And that's where I regret my purchase of the DVD! Unlike the full DVD of the first season, the original music of the second full season has been replaced by a different music. Although it is good that the original episodes were numerically restored to perfection, the removal of the original music destroyed what made this show so much fun to watch!
