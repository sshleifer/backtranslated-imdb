This film was fine, but like most television series, it would have been better to do it for television. The most beloved and beloved characters had only five-minute roles, while the three mediocre characters were throughout the film. <br /> <br /> Unlike most British movies based on television series, this film starts there seems to be a winner, but the rhythm suddenly stops when the three mediocre characters are in the real world and wait to capture the three comedians. <br /> <br /> The film then goes nowhere when Hillary enters the scene. a piece with Steve captured, Lipp pretending to be Steve and Geoff Somehow writing in the Middle Ages. What made me think 'hang on? How is it that he does not need a key to enter this world unlike Royston Vasey's characters? The medieval scene was going well, but Monty Python was doing a lot better and of course, funnier, with Peter Kay's and Simon Pegg's cameos, the two did not say anything funny, Kay had a line and Pegg was sitting on the wall, looking bored. What also displeased me is that they seem to forget what happened in previous episodes, such as Hillary escaped to the Caribbean on television in Series 2, but in the film he escaped from prison, and Lipp also a pedophile vampire who was not mentioned at all in the film, which was also very disturbing when he was left alone to look after the children. <br /> <br /> There were many plots and unexplained situations, like how did Geoff and the Dark One escape from the medieval era at Royston Vasey? As for the series 3, the beginnings were good, but as the film progressed, it was slowly going downhill and had a very unpredictable end. <br /> <br /> They would have done better to do what Monty Python did and remake all their best classic sketches from series 1 to 3 and the Christmas promotion, and turned them into a film that would reintroduce the characters to a whole new audience, who can not be asked to watch the show or buy DVDs. <br /> <br /> The best advice is to save your money and wait for it to be on TV ..... what does it belong to?
