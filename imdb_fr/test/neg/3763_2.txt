Small spoilers <br /> <br /> First of all, I must say how rare and charming it is to find a film containing such fundamental messages: nuclear war will inevitably destroy all civilization and women will have a vocation to make babies. It is absolutely incredible to see how well the plot is formulated, as with a golden hammer. Essentially, everything in this movie annoyed me. The occasional sexism, the character whose only trait came from Texas, the mysterious choice of death on Orange Mars, and of course the imperfect science of all this. Then the Martian woman screaming as if she had just realized that she was blind? What was that? However, I will give him credit. The fifties spit out foolish things. But not a lot...
