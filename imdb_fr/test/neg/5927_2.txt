Yes, Lifetime is used to making stupid the male species. And this soap opera does not laugh when they make Perry King, so-called famous doctor, unable to see the evil that surrounds him. Trust doctors, huh? How can we not see what's going on? Is he so stupid? And the wicked horse-faced wife disappears without leaving any trace of her whole family. How does she acquire all the drugs? It's not explained. How does she manage to be a secretary in a hospital without credentials? I guess the director, Don FauntLeRoy is asking us to believe him. I did not keep shouting at the screen in front of King's stupidity with straight ahead of his face. If the woman was so attractive, maybe I would accept it. But she is not even that. Shannon Sturges is the perfect wife and I tell you she has the face of a horse. I would not cross the street for her, but our perfect husband does it quickly. Once all the members of the group were eliminated, I was not satisfied with the money given to our villain. She deserved more than she had. William Moses plays the brother of the doctor who, unfortunately, knows the result of the first day. Pleasure to see at least one pretty face in this clinker. That of Lesley Anne Down. She credits the movie just 2 on the relief of seeing someone go in this mess. Perry King deserved his fate. What a moron.
