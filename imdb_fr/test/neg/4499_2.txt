More like a frisbee like a turtle with fangs that goes up like a wild boar. No more battles with people in bird suits who look like people in bird suits. A spaceship ball ping pong. Two naughty boys who know how to do everything, including boarding the spaceship. More tedious music. More things "Gamera is the friend of the children". I remember when Godzill and Rodan came out. The movies were very funny because the monsters posed a threat to people. Now they are just a parade of stupid costumes with very little behind. The adults are all ridiculous and stupid. As in American sitcoms, children are the bosses (when in reality they could not get out of a paper bag). These monster movies must be the means used by the Japanese to share these little rascals. But most importantly, after watching three of these movies (with the same plot again and again, check the archive footage), the final conclusion is that they are boring. If you have not seen this one, do not worry.
