Does anyone remember BRAVEHEART? He played Mel Gibson who also directed and was scripted by Randall Wallace. The movie contains more than 200 errors. Does anyone remember the GREEN BERET? This is John Wayne's western where the Duke saves a homestead called Vietnam from a band of injunes from the commie tribe. If you watch WE ARE SOLDIERS, remember these two movies. <br /> <br /> First of all, what is this Scottish lament that has been played three times in the film, four if you count the end credits? I mean what is the connection between Scotland and Nam? Maybe Wallace uses it in the vain hope that since BRAVEHEART was bombarded - unintentionally, I might add - with several Oscars, this film could be too? Whatever the reason, it's really included. Gibson plays Hal Moore as a cross between William Wallace and John Wayne and I was expecting him to say something like "They will never take our liberty - but they will do it" and it is impossible not to notice other similarities with THE GREEN BERETS as the plot of a journalist who takes a gun and turns into a warrior and Moore informs the journalist of his guilt in a scene almost identical to that of Wayne's movie <br /> <br /> When he does not recall at the hearing the other WWS Movies also fails on his own legs, he is based on actual events of 1965 but does not seem to have the integrity to do justice to the story he is giving away. never feel like 1965 and lack of sense of time and place probably filmed in America, not in Asia. Hal Moore might have brought the French experience closer to Indochina, but if it did, it was unique because the US military did everything possible not to read about the Franco-Indochinese war. the previous conflict, Westmoreland replied that he had nothing to learn from the French "who has not won the war since Napoleon", and I was confused about the portrait of the NVA in this film, when in 1965 the American high command, overflowing with pride, the North Vietnamese and VC were in contempt. It is as if the story had been rewritten to show that Vietnamese rice farmers were superlative warriors. That's right, but very few Americans believed it in the mid-1960s <br /> <br /> There are some other things that bother me, like how women come home with telegrams telling them that their husband is dead? No bodies are shown being brought to the base by plane and no one on the screen is referring to what was killed in the Drang Valley. Similarly, we do not see reinforcements coming to the screen. How can we see Americans coming out of the NVA number? I consider these mistakes to be errors in direction and editing by Wallace, who does not seem to me to be a director, and his biggest problem seems to be communicating the horror of the battle. Take the stage where the American was burned to shout "Tell my wife that I love her". This should have an emotional impact similar to this death scene in PLATOON, but here there is no impact. In fact, I found the scene clich√©d and condescending, and he is not the only character to utter the words "Tell my wife ..." when mutilated or dying, I counted at least two other characters who used this expression. Did the characters really say that during the battle? I do not know at all, but since Randall Wallace wrote the script, I have reservations. <br /> <br /> I gaped at the sighting of APOCALYPSE NOW, PLATOON and THE KILLING FIELDS let go of my eyes, I burst out laughing, PULLER METAL JACKET, I kept looking at my watch with THE DEER HUNTER, and having seen WE ARE SOLDIERS, I felt totally patronized.
