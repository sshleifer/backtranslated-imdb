I remember this movie with feelings of pure. . . agony. More than half of the film is an advertisement (no, really!). The slight excuse for a story could easily have been told in 25 minutes (and almost!). The end result is a prefabricated love story of predictable schlock, all obviously joined together in a rude commercial attempt to derive a little more money from the contemporary. Debbie Boone hit. Yes, how fast it was produced ... the song that "inspired" it was still so important in the charts when the movie was released! <br /> <br /> Despite decades of seeing bad movies, this one always impresses me for its extravagant, taboo, headless jump into the most tedious, absurd and indelible cinematographic malice. It really deserves to be on the IMDb list of the 100 worst of all time and has never left the top 3 of my list of "worst". <br /> <br /> Enjoy it for the masochistic thrill!
