At the San Francisco Silent Film Festival opening night, I was excited to see historic and rare films. The guest speaker who opened this film created a hype about the darkness and how this film is underestimated. The science fiction part of the movie was very interesting and fantastic for its time, but I'm not sure if this is due to the fact that it was shown directly after the brilliant 1928 "The Wind" or if it seemed that Russian filmmakers after the Russian novels are famous (hundreds of characters, intricate intrigues), but I know for sure that the dramatic scenes, like those of the Earth, had absolutely no sense, were boring and that I I lost in twenty minutes. It may have been the acting game, but I was convinced of the reason why this movie is "unknown and underrated": it's boring, there's no plot or story basic and the acting is horrible. This is certainly not a Potemkin battleship, but I will say that Russian films do not make a very good effort to enlighten life in Russia.
