The Concorde ... Airport '79 begins in Washington, where a man named Carl Parker (Macon (McCalman) communicates with renowned journalist Maggie Whelan (Susan Blakely) to give him secret documents proving that his boss, Kevin Harriosn (Robert Wagner) The owner and president of Harrison Industries, who is developing arms for the military, illegally sold the weapons to foreign countries, but Maggie's murder is saved and she narrowly escapes her life. must take the Concorde to go to Moscow via Paris the next morning, he intends to whistle Harrison, who is also his boyfriend, which would ruin him. "Determined to flee, he will reprogram his high-performance missile "Buzzard" to intercept and destroy the Concorde during a test testing all those aboard. & destroy documented evidence ... <br /> <br /> renamed Airport '80 - The Concor for his cinema and his first video releases for the house because it was released here in 1980 and instead of 1979 The latest film of the Airport franchise was directed by David Lowell Rich. This is a notoriously bad film that has apparently made people laugh at press and test screenings, prompting Universal to promote the film as an action comedy. The first thing to say is that The Concorde ... Airport '79 is a really silly and rather silly movie, but on a purely entertaining basis, I can think of much worse movies to watch for 108 minutes, I really can. I really liked the absurd plot of a wealthy industrialist wanting to kill his friendly TV journalist before he could expose him as a weapons dealer, but this guy does not behave badly and decides that the best The way to do this is to detonate Concorde with his own missile launch and then ask a Fench fighter pilot to try and shoot him down before finally sabotaging him. So there are three catastrophic mini-movies in one, every time the super-pilot Joe Patroni manages to save the situation. You know that Joe Patroni played by George Kennedy appears in the four films of the airport and passes from the role of mechanic of the first to the extrodinary pilot of Concorde in this field. In addition, I think it's a bit odd for nine years that he participated in four major air disasters. I think the real reason the Airport series stopped here is that Patroni retired after the spell was cast. Some of the things that are happening here are just nonsense, Patroni rolls rolls, flies upside down and maneuver is a guided missile in a huge Concorde, not to mention that he crashed and fired guns at fire through his window to destroy the missile while keeping his head calm. This guy is good, very good. Then there is the character, there is a saxophone playing a black guy who smokes grass in the toilet, an old woman with a bladder problem and a team of Russian gymnasts with a bad accent. In addition, although they are almost shot down by a missile and then attacked by a fighter jet, the passengers of the Concorde do not seem so disturbed and do not return on board with joy the next day. I do not know about you, but after that, I would probably find a safer way of transportation and why do not police or authorities question anyone? Why is the captain of the Concorde, Patroni, allowed to go out and sleep with a French prostitute? The Concorde ... Airport '79 is certainly not boring and full of memorable moments & I have been entertained in a way although it is far from being a good film and that the modern public could not- not be patient with that, damn I loved it for what it was silly, but it's not a classic. <br /> <br /> Even though Concorde does not fly anymore, it's still a pretty cool plane & there are many sequences here, the one used in The Concorde ... Airport '79 was the seventh built. This Concorde was also the same plane that crashed after the fall of a fuel tank and the bursting of the fuel tank on July 25, 2000, as it took off in Paris, resulting in the death of 109 passengers and crew members on board, as well as 4 people. on the ground. When this was broadcast on television in the United States in 1982, nearly twenty minutes of new footage was included, most or all of which was shot more than two years after the end of the original production. I know that the effects here have negative effects on most people, but I do not think they are too bad. When you consider that this was done in the late 70s, I think they are very good. The camera moves during the shots, real sequences of real planes are used rather than toy models that, in my opinion, would have been much worse and I could certainly see what the manufacturers were trying to do with limited funds and limited technology. Strangely, they are really impressive without ever being so beautiful if you know what I mean. The most action-packed of all the films on the airport is probably made up of missiles, explosive explosions, daring landings, assassinations and a guy named Robert Palmer (no, not the singer) giving the head to a woman in a jacuzzi. <br /> <br /> IMDb indicates that its budget was about $ 14 million, which is actually more than I thought. Maybe these special effects are not so impressive after all. Shot in Utah, Washington, Los Angeles and France. The acting is not great here, people do not seem worried about dying. Goerge Kennedy gets bad doubles while Robert Wagner plays the bad guy. <br /> <br /> The Concorde ... Airport '79 is fun for bad moviegoers from all over the world & to be brutally honest, I look rather at this entertaining mess of a movie than about two hours, nominated at the Oscars .
