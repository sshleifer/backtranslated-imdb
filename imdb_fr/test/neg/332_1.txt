I knew Brad Linaweaver at Florida State U in the early '70s, while he was an inspiring and inventive writer who, in my opinion, was heading for greater glory. <br /> <br /> That's why I rented this video. Well, well, well, the weather has not been kind to Mr. Linaweaver. I suppose that the pressures to make a living make the highest aspirations useless. Another flower whose bloom came and went unnoticed in the summer breeze. Amen. There is nothing more to say. And nothing more to add. A sad epitaph to a once flourishing career, as stated above. But it's the price to pay for shadows without a solid base or personal goals. Because this film has no purpose, no purpose, and I've repeated myself, what has become of Brad's creativity, his once brilliant genius? Party, gone, years of neglect have deteriorated his once brilliant spirit.
