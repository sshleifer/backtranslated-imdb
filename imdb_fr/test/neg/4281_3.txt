Being a big fan of Disney, I was really disappointed when I looked at this trash. The animation was nice and the backgrounds were incredible, but I think a good animation does not make up for a weak scenario and a weak story. I will have to disagree with those who say it's not good for kids. Yes, there are deaths in the film, but is not death an event to which children should at least be exposed? But I go astray. The script is riddled with bad word games and lame jokes ... the kind that I could expect from most dreamworks movies. The music was soppy, the morality forced (and forced without any charm.) And the characters began to sing at totally inappropriate moments. The characters were also cold, and I really could not bring any form of emotion to them (bar irritation). I am a big fan of jungle book, Aladdin and new groove emperors, but this Disney movie was a complete and total loss of time ..... do not look at it !!!
