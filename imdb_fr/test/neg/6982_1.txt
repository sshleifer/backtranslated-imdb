This movie was bad, but it was so bad that it could become cult in the distant future. A kind of black film meets Plan 9 of outer space. The story was, well, there was not really a story. There is a place reserved for Ed Woods and Russ Meyers of the world and this film proves it. "So bad it can be good" is the best way to describe it. I seriously doubt that this film is taken over by a legitimate distribution company. It is therefore unlikely to be widely distributed. <br /> <br /> I will add that I expect to see more actor Ron Carey. He made the most of what he had. The rest of the game, if I can call it that, was completely forgettable. I have seen worse in big studios with big budgets.
