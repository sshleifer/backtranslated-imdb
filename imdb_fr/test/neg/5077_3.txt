I just watched this DVD movie late this morning and was so disappointed that I thought it was a good joke for the audience. In other words, the creators intended to make comedy, not drama. However, in the end, I realized that Mr. Tony Giglio was serious about this movie. Too bad, because the dialogue is ridiculous, the actors play mediocre and lifeless, the story is a fish tale! Poor Ryan Phillippe - despite his efforts, his character in the film is probably his worst performance! What to say for Jason Statham - the lack of skills to develop this role that is an imaginary fiction ... For this reason, I vote: 3/10
