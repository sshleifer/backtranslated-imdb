**** Will probably contain spoilers **** <br /> <br /> After a successful attempt to attract attention (I would not call it by ensuring that you get help before your death , a "failed suicide attempt"), Joey discovers she is pregnant and starts seeing images of spirits. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie was a little slow, but enough fun to watch it all. For a horror movie, there were only a few thrills and thrills. However, halfway through, there was a very good scary scene (I will not let go) :) I watched this movie because I really liked the previous movie, The Eye. <br /> <br /> I was a little confused, however, to determine that, apart from the fact that it is a film of "supernatural suspense" by the same creators, The Eye 2 does not has NO relationship with The Eye, * whatsoever *; different casting, different story. The Eye2 does not even have anything to do with the eyes: <br /> <br /> The film had some dubious scenes: Joey tries to commit suicide 3 times (4 times, if you count the time where the witnesses say seeing Joey trying to jump in front of the train), she is associated with the brutality of the disfigurement of an attacker, she panics in a restaurant and witnesses say she "attacked" people and yet she is allowed to go to her occupations freely, without even psychological evaluation or hospitalization (for reasons other than pregnancy). <br /> <br /> The film was not the biggest horror film, the story was rather far-fetched (even for a fiction film: P), ghosts were rare and / or nothing that we have never seen before. However, it was an "interesting" story and once you know what is the "truth" behind the ghosts, it's an interesting twist in the "ghost" story. <br /> <br /> I note the film 3 out of ten.
