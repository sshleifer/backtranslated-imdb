It's not really as good as the other Dragonballs. The bad guys are actually scams of other villains Z like Cell, Frieza and even Majin Buu. Baby being the clone of Frieza, Super 17 Cell Clone and Shadow Dragons Buu clone (s). The story is also very bad because it deals with the shrinkage of Goku. CONTRACTION!! He is afraid of loving the size of an eight-year-old just to throw him. Let's not forget how weak the characters become. Gohan can not become mystical and is even weaker than Pan (it's sad I know). Speaking of Pan, she was so cute at the end of Z. She has now lost all her kindness and has become an irritating and mourning little girl whose only purpose in this series is to get in the way. Goten does not even have a goal in the series and Trunks ... well, I do not know what to say about Trunks. GT is just an attempt to milk the popular Dragonball franchise. If you really like Dragonball, then avoid this series. It does not even look like Dragonball. I will be fair, however, because the end was very good and is actually pretty sad (at least for me) and the end and beginning themes are better (Japanese, not American). It could have been better if Toriyama san worked on it.
