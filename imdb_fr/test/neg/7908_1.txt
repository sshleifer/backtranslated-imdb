I hate to comment on something that I have not finished, but if I avoid someone sitting for almost an hour before turning it off with disgust, it will be worth it. <br /> <br /> I decided to look at this with an open mind, knowing it was at the bottom of the list. <br /> <br /> Bad idea. I usually love rude humor or at least I can tolerate it. I love so-called "black" comedies. I am not easily offended either. <br /> <br /> It started well and quickly dropped. I laughed a few times (for example, when the main character got stuck in the toilet on the plane), but that was it and it did not make up for the strong disgust I felt. <br /> <br /> I did not laugh when the dog was sucked into a jet engine. I usually do not see humor dying in animals (except in Animal House). I did not laugh much more about nastiness, either. I turned it off after an incident involving a blind man and a baked potato that I do not care to repeat the details, but that the wave of nausea has not yet transmitted to me. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell, it was filled with hot coals and just not funny with almost no conspiracy. This is one of the occasions where, if you do not have something nice to say, you should let it know. <br /> <br /> Do not say I did not warn you.
