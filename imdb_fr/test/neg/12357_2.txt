I saw it on a boring Sunday morning, just this morning. Well, I was attracted by the fact that it was an outdoor movie .. I was hoping to find beautiful landscapes, but the view was simply limited .. They come and go in the same place over and over again .. I hate when they use these so-called hi-tech products like the Motorola Blue-tooth headset they use to eliminate the use of a walkie-talkie, it was so funny .. they look like amateurs. And they loved to advertise these poorly designed laptops that could connect to a satellite to find people. I could not say more about this TV movie ... The end was unfortunate: it looks like they cut short by eliminating the use of rescue helicopters, etc. * / **********
