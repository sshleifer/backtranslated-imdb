Unfortunately, this movie is not very good. But is it really important? We all know the basics of history, and that's nothing new. But I like the classics of the horror and sci-fi camp ... so I forgive this one. The only thing we remember about this movie is that little Leonardo DiCaprio made his debut in this movie. <br /> <br /> He did well. The piece did not require great acting skills, and the staging had probably never given him the slightest chance to give him one ... The little Leonardo DiCaprio was very cute ... and the girl too. The movie is fun, if you like the horror and sci-fi classics and you're used to watching them.
