This is not the real story. It's the darkest fiction possible from events. It refers to suicide, to the gloomy obsession with death, to a totally gratuitous loophole in organized religion in general (and the Anglican church in particular), and generally provides a nihilistic and unfounded view of the world from from which the spectators, I suppose, are supposed to go away, richer. in their poverty and more hope in their despair. <br /> <br /> A perfect basket, although played attractively by a capable cast. That anyone suggests that this is a true rendering, however, is actually a misleading advertisement. Do you want the real story? Rent 'Fairy Tale'. This is the real story. See if you can find a match between the facts presented in both cases. I only found one: the girls who made the original photographs were prepubescent.
