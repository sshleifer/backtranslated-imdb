This movie is such an amazing shit. First, let me talk about the benefits: Sandra Bullock wearing a black swimsuit. <br /> <br /> Now the rest of the story is utterly deplorable. We told Angela Bennett, a computer programmer (whose online profile is ANGEL - HOW WITTY !!!, I bet the filmmakers applauded her for an hour) who basically checks the company's software to detect errors, problems, etc. We start by ordering on the Internet, then turn on a chimney on his monitor (EXTREME computer skills demonstrated to date). This is after discovering a virus in a Macintosh program that blocks the entire system after pressing the ESC key. This is apparently a huge problem, but the virus created to do it could be solved in about 1 minute with a simple batch file. <br /> <br /> Any event, we move on to something else. She receives this call from another guy (who works in the same company) and this idiot says to go click on this symbol that apparently opens a secret Internet gateway to a bunch of unprotected "top secret" data woohoo! Angela records this shit on a disk and now, the people who created this flaw seek to recover it. It is of course only after she has met one of the villains BEFORE he tries to kill her BEFORE jumping into the ocean of her boat, BEFORE ending up in a random hospital. <br /> <br /> Problem # 1: You can not create a loophole on the Internet to access a bunch of top secret FBI data. Where did it come from? Since when can a group of hackers control the basic Internet flow (even in 95)? Problem # 2: Angela would need proper identification before a hospital or clinic releases her. She could not just do her business and leave. <br /> <br /> Then these "pirates" or anything that changes Angela's ID so that she can not get help from anyone and that all her identity card is gone . So she goes home and a cat and mouse chase continues. <br /> <br /> Apparently, all the police and the FBI are stupid and do not believe it. So she has to use a lot of tactics to get into the building where she works (where the current replacement is) and go back to her old computer. She starts talking to another guy at random and discovers who is behind everything using a BS IP address. The director knows that the audience is too stupid to believe it. <br /> <br /> She then goes to a center to send all this information to the FBI. She apparently has to use a central computer to send information to the FBI by e-mail. But then, the same idiot who tried to kill her BEFORE throwing her in the water catches her and hacks again easily in the FBI (wtf?). But remember this cool virus? Fortunately, it succeeds and even if the virus only worked on software, it now works on the entire system. This destroys all the mainframe that contains all the false information because he was sitting in the middle of a convention ... THAT IS WHAT THIS END! Anyway, the uber virus now works and Angela (the real one now) runs away and later kills the wicked guy with a fire extinguisher. He has a gun of course, rushes to her, he is two feet away and decides to aim. CLASSIC Hollywood. <br /> <br /> All in all, this movie is so full of BS and shit. Anyone who does not know much about computers will be completely deceived into thinking that this shit is possible, but nothing is right about computers or the network. And I sincerely doubt that I would see a multiplatform virus for Mac and a central computer (* Lough LMAO *).
