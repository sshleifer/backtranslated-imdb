Although I have seldom done myself, I am very interested in aviation ... and this film has contributed to the precious laughter of aeronautical cinema. <br /> <br /> 1. Why does the captain do the ground checks? Why does it even measure oil levels in engines? With turnaround times as short as 15 minutes in commercial aviation, this is not a typical pre-flight check. <br /> <br /> 2. WHY the captain KICK against the tire of the plane? Strange type of pressure control. Or anger management :-) <br /> <br /> 3. The crew has three crew members. All large twin-engine Western jets built since the 1980s have a crew of two. Now try to guess the age of the movie script. <br /> <br /> 4. A helicopter manages to fly alongside the crippled airliner. It must be fast ... and the captain's words to explain the "maneuver" to the passengers are really hilarious! <br /> <br /> 5. With the elevator controls stopped, it is always possible to lower the nose of the plane. This happens, for example, when an airplane moves more slowly than the stall speed. <br /> <br /> 6. Elevator controls have hydraulic actuators. After the collision with the business jet, he would most likely have cut off the hydraulic lines and rendered them unusable for the steering, but that would NOT have repaired them to a certain position. <br /> <br /> 7. The fire in the back kitchen was a stupid idea. It was designed to show that only gentlemen ask for the extinguisher and fight the fire, no matter who was trained to do it. the flight attendant. <br /> <br /> 8. At the time of the collision, the aircraft lifts would have been in a neutral position. The film could have ended here ... <br /> <br /> 9. The flight engineer (the third person in the cockpit) has three bars on his uniform. In fact, flight engineers have two. <br /> <br /> 10. Why does the captain cut the cabin casing with an ax to examine the damage behind? I thought that would have been the responsibility of the flight engineer, because he is already supposed to perform technical checks before and after the flight. <br /> <br /> 11. In any aircraft, there is no unused space. At least commercial airplanes can not afford the luxury of a compartment that can hold tons of water. <br /> <br /> I could go on and on ... but finally, I laughed hysterically about how the writers imagine air disasters. ! Woooohooo! Most airplane disasters happen in such a short time that you simply can not make 90-minute movies. But you can still spend 90 minutes with mind-numbing shit, no matter what genre.
