"The Yellow Tomahawk" (1954), directed by director Lesley Selander, opposes the Cheyenne to the American Cavalry with tough leathery Rory Calhoun in the role of veteran Indian scout and buckskin which must lead survivors to safety. The United Artists western was colorful, but the television print broadcast by Turner Classic Movies was inexplicably black and white. <br /> <br /> The action begins with Adam Reed (Rory Calhoun of "Black Spurs") who escapes several Indians and riding the palaver with his old friend and Cheyenne chief, Fire Knife (Lee Van Cleef of "The Spurs" Good, The Bad, and the Ugly "), who has death in mind. Fire Knife warns Adam that his brave Cheyenne are about to erase a nearby cavalry fort in construction because he is violating an Indian treaty with the government. On the way to inform the insidious camp commander, Major Ives (Warner Anderson of "Objective, Burma!"), Of the impending Indian attack, Adam discovers a beautiful woodland nymph running in a lake with seduction. Katherine 'Kate' Bolden (Peggy Castle's "I, Jury") is another of those idiotic westerns who swim naked in the middle of an Indian country without any worries. Castle seems to be really naked in her bathing scenes too, perhaps the most memorable scene of all this otherwise predictable western. Naturally, Major Ives rejects Fire Knife's warning from Adam until the commander realizes that someone has raided his ammunition dump far from the fort. This is one of the many questions that Richard Alan Simmons' screenplay leaves unanswered in this 82-minute version. Why would the cavalry bury its ammunition in a secret place in the desert rather than keep them at the fort? No sooner have they made this discovery than the Indians are attacking, coming out of the hero and leaving him as the only survivor. Before this attack, a pair of white prospectors goes to the fort. Sawyer (Peter Graves of "Stalag 17") introduces his partner with an arrow in his chest. While Adam receives hot water to help clear the arrow, the greedy Sawyer grinds the shaft deeper and kills his helpless partner. Later, we learn that Sawyer and his partner found gold. The question of the dispersion of gold also remains unanswered after our heroes have survived the ordeal. Adam and Fire Knife have one last pow-wow and Fire Knife asks Adam to hand over Major Ives or everyone will die. Naturally, Adam refuses and the Indians begin to reduce the whites. James Best, in a rider role, receives an arrow in the back for his efforts. Noah Beery, Jr., plays a Mexican scout chased by a pretty Indian maid, Honey Bear (award-winning actress Rita Moreno of "West Side Story") and Robert Bray of "Lassie" are briefly known cavalry officer to the reputation that Kate had planned to marry. <br /> <br /> The biggest surprise of this ordinary western shot in Kanab, Utah, is that the nasty cavalry officer Ives, who slaughtered Indian men, women and children during the infamous Sand Creek massacre, has a secret that he is Native American too! Ironically, the tense arc that Fire Knife offers Adam from the start of hostilities is what our heroic scout uses to kill the strong Cheyenne warrior after he runs out of bullets. "The Yellow Tomahawk" ends on an ambiguous note. The survivors go to another outpost, Fort Ellis, where Adam and Ives provide their respective reports on the matter to an army general, but we never learn from the outcome of this meeting. Is it an artistic ambiguity or another unanswered question? The producer Howard W. Koch has no connection with the scriptwriter "Casablanca" Howard Koch. In the end, "The Yellow Tomahawk" is one of the many pro-Indian westerns that appeared after "Broken Arrow" (1950), where the Native American is considered a wild noble treated unjustly by some whites, but not all. Selander, who made dozens of Westerns in the 1950s and 1960s, makes this Westerner tolerable, despite his lean character and familiarity. Calhoun is a leading player always serving the average above average. A beautiful castle is worth watching for its feminine charms. Peter Graves plays a skunk, as he was used to in most of his leading roles. In fact, Lesley Selander made a more satisfying version of this film the year before, entitled "War Paint" (1953), with Robert Stack. Incidentally, Noah Beery Jr. and Rita Moreno have both become accustomed to "The Rockford Files".
