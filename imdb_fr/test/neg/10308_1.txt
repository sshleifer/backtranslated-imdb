Wow, there are no words to describe how bad this movie really is. I'm usually proud of being able to enjoy any movie, no matter how bad the situation, but it was too much. I would only suggest watching this film as an instrument of torture. If you can get rid of intrigue and dialogue by looking at it dumb, the camera's even more terrible work and poor quality special effects make this movie a real horror. If you plan to watch this because you are a fan of Sandra Bullock, do not worry, she has less than ten minutes of projection and her acting is absolutely atrocious. Not to mention the rest of the cast, which could be replaced by baboons who would do a better job, at least we would not have to listen to the terrible dialogue.
