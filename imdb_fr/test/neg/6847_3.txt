I agree that Mary Woronov (Murdoch's secretary) is one of the only positives of this movie. She is my favorite actress since always, every role she plays is always as well done. His character is devious, sarcastic, intelligent, light, funny and cunning. She really pulls this role and you have a good idea of ​​the nature of her character. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie is pretty bad. Music is the most entertaining thing left. One of the characters has this really strange circular radio that she carries with her as she wears her zebra striped tank top. <br /> <br /> One thing that intrigued a bit of history was the idea that someone hired three college kids to beautify an old abandoned theater. He gives them the keys and says, go ahead. It would be really fun and I would like someone to give me that chance! Imagine going to an old abandoned theater with two other people and deciding how to decorate and fix it. You have total control over the entire building. It would be so much fun! Unfortunately, the characters do not see this as an exciting adventure, but as a big chore. They walk with long faces and argue all the time. It is kind of a shame. But it's fun to think of the possibilities that these people are not even excited about. <br /> <br /> The movie does a very good job of making you feel helpless or a little scared by the theater itself. However, the acting game (apart from Woronov .. and maybe Murdoch, the boss - just because he makes a very good smiling businessman very hungry who never has a chance) is really horrible and you you feel dissatisfied. In addition, the random slapstick is a bit sticky and somehow ruins the reality that the film tries to create. <br /> <br /> Look at it if you like Mary Woronov, the awesome music of the 80's Casio keyboard style and if you think you have a giant spooky abandoned theater to yourself is intriguing at all.
