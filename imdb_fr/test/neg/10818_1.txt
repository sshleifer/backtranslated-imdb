It may be unfair of me to comment on this film because, for the very first time, I turned off a movie because it was so bad. I can watch anything, but this movie was so boring. I got bored before putting on the DVD and I thought it might be a laughable horror movie / horror movie to lighten the mood. It's not even that, it's a device that increases the rate of boredom by the power of 100. It had to be extinguished after 45 minutes because everything that had happened at that time was that some people had dived had been discovered. Seriously, this movie is not worth it, even if you can enjoy a bad movie as I can, avoid this movie like the plague. The worst thing I've seen in years.
