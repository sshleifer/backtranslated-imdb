A group of heirs of an old mysterious mansion discovers that he must live there as part of a will or is disinherited, but they soon discover in the history of all those who lived there before their death strange accidents or killing each other. <br /> <br /> You have seen everything before, and it has a budget too low and a slow pace to scare, and does not present a real surprise in the Climax. No special effects or gore, the only really fun thing in the whole movie is the quality of English dubbing, which is sometimes as bad as a cheap martial arts movie. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10, pretty low in the hierarchy of haunted house movies of the 80s.
