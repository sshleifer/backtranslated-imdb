Far from combining the best pieces of Pontypool and 28 days, it managed to ignore them. While copying them shamelessly. (if that makes sense?) Pontypool was different and became more and more tense, it stinks. The radio DJ, "you have to stay on the air," does not actually spend time on the air. He sits on his behind and watches television for news. This is by far the worst excuse for a zombie movie. Is there one person in the US or in the world who does not know what a zombie is? Or already heard about the word "zombie"? Well, in the 50th minute, this group of outsiders is still calling zombies, "the infected" or those with "rage". The word "Zombie" could make an appearance later, I do not care. Maybe there is a copyright Wherever you have to pay to use certain words? For example, the Bluetooth earphone is called "the ear-tip", I do not bother you! Finally, no plot + no actor = nobody cares. A waste of time, a cheeky feeling, mediocre scam performed.
