Probably one of the worst movies of all time, I always try to know if it was to be fun, but for sure I did not have fun at all. Perhaps the film lost something in the English-Italian translation, dunno, I lack the courage to see it again in its original version. <br /> <br /> My price for this film is 2/10, and I feel that I'm pretty generous (say that 1 point is for Liv because she is a cute girl and the other point is for honest actors who have been trapped in a worthless, useless and pathetic movie) <br /> Take care of yourself Alex
