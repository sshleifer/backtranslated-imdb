I AM NOT LYNNE BATES MY NAMES ARE RITICHIA BUT LYNNE IS MY MAMA I AM JUST USING HER ACCOUNT! Barney and his friends (or Barney, as it's called here in England) is the most secret show of all time. I never really liked that, it was about 3 or 4 years since I was born, so it was nothing new. My friend, however, loved this dildo of a show. I was about 6 years old and I was at home once, and he had a Barney VHS tape being played on television. I turned off the power and he started crying. GROW HIS DINOSAUR SPEAKING FOR CHRIST SAKE! In any case, I happened to see Barney on television later that year and I liked it. I got the VHS a few months later, and I carried the tape, I loved it so much! I gave this tape a few years ago now, but I loved it at the time. But the show! My god the show was bad! Many children have been victims of pedophiles because of this pretext called entertainment! Never again, never again! It's not just me who hates Barney, either! 85% of all comments on this show are of poor quality, and just look at the amount of poop You Tube and videos that put the mess out of Barney are on You Tube! And do not get me started on Blow Job BJ! Why would producers dare to give a character such a sexual name? Another subliminal message in a children's show! And this Baby Bop is the worst thing since Osama bin Laden! All in all, I give Barney and his friends less than 1000 out of 10!
