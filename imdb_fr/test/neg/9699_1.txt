I spent a good time browsing all the reviews for this movie. I totally agree with almost all critics that Noah's ark is shit, shit, shit, shit, shit! Do NBC executives have no class? I feel sore stomach to actually watch both parts of this mini-series. The script is so stupid, so useless, and yes, TOTALLY INACCURATE! I can understand to make some changes for dramatic purposes, but this film has changed just about everything in the story. God himself is going to have a hard time killing the entire population of the Earth, but he's sort of a guy who's sailing trying to sell things to Noah. Leave me alone! And what was happening with Noah's sons acting like Indiana Jones, saving girls in distress? If all this is not enough, there is the part where God apologizes to Noah and says: "I'm sorry Noah, I was wrong". NBC Newsflash, GOD CAN NOT BE FALSE! This film is the most insipid and shameful Bible film ever made.
