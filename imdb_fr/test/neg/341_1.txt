We'll have to take a deep breath for this one ... <br /> <br /> Terrible special effects that have tried to go well beyond budget limits. Flagrant and shameless plagiarism of other sci-fi movies (like Pitch Black). Terrible acting. Endless slow motion scenes of characters walking aimlessly in the sand dunes. Sinuous dialogue that does nothing to advance the story. Characters wearing turtleneck sweaters on a desert planet with two suns. A "cargo ship" made up of a team of soldiers armed with camouflage and camouflage (why would you need a camouflage of the forest in space?). Some of the worst casting choices in the history of non-budget film production - a swollen "captain" of steroids that looks more like a jock-ball sportsman than a trustworthy commander, and a "doomed" who has the air and acts as dangerous as a rabbit. 70 minutes, 35 of which could have been shortened if the director had the idea of ​​"time compression by mounting" ... <br /> <br /> I will not continue. Suffice it to say that although some components of this horrendous movie can (and should) be forgiven because of its low budget; the bad design, the laughable plot holes, and the script inducing snoring are unforgivable on every budget. The end result is a tedious task, boring and lost. Sorry guys, I hate being so hard on an amateur movie, but you have no excuse to produce that kind of work.
