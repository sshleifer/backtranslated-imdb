Forced, disgusting, formula. Do these adjectives make you want to run to rent his? Miriam Hopkins was brilliant in the original "Dr. Jekyl and Mr. Hyde".

Ray Milland is not convincing at all. <br /> <br /> The two child performers are scary and have no connection to the village as it was at the time. <br /> <br /> Speaking as a native of Greenwich Village, I find the setting ersatz, generic and phony. Not that I've been there for a few generations, but my parents were there in 1937. It's not funny. It's not really authentic.

It did not happen in the village. But that sounds very real. It sounds with a thump.
