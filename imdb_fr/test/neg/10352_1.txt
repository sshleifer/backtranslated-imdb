The best thing I can say about the American version is that Jane Turner and Gina Reilly have to make money for this shit. Yes, the American scam has been shown for about two episodes in Australia but has not been evaluated. probably by curious viewers who wondered how bad it would be. Answer: DEPLORABLE, a total loss of time. The actors are relatively unknown and they do not easily take the nuances of script writing in Australia. Bad luck for them because they are doomed to collapse with this turkey. My advice to American viewers is NOT to DO. <br /> <br /> Americans should be in a better position to find ORIGINAL VERSION DVDs on eBay, but be aware that some DVDs are in a different "zone format" than the one that was released. in the USA. Otherwise, some DVD players will use discs in both zones / all zones.
