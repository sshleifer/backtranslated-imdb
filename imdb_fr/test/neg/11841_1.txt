So, I was sick of the flu on a Saturday and the good thing was that SciFi Channel was organizing a marathon of dinosaur movies - the trilogy "Carnosaur", "Pterodactyl", "Raptor Island". Then, I spun ahead on my wired remote to see what movie SciFi had placed in its glamorous location from Saturday to prime time. A film I had never heard of before is called "Raptor". I was pretty excited. The film begins with a few teenagers driving in a jeep, when they are tracked down and killed by a Velociraptor. I was like, "Hmmm, it's strange, it looks almost like a scene from Carnosaur, except it was in the middle of this movie." Then, I witnessed a very bad acting, and then a guy was led into an underground research laboratory where he was eaten by a ferocious T-Rex. Now I thought, "Wait a second, it was also a scene in Carnosaur. "Then, after seeing some blatantly torn scenes from" Carnosaur 2 ", I understood what was happening., Roger Corman & Co. ripped scenes from the" Carnosaur "trilogy to use as scenes of action, woven into a basic "dinosaur-run-amok" script, and tried to portray it as an original movie.Happy.I did not Roger Corman or the Channel SciFi Channel, who tried to get this message across as worthy of the prime time slot, have no idea who I am even more angry with him, who looks like their counterparts in the "Carnosaur" trilogy and guess what scenes will come up next.Although it hurts me, being a lover of dinosaurs, I have no choice but to give it the lowest possible rating because I feel completely ripped off.
