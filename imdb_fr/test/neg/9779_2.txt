I gave this movie 2 instead of 1 just because I am a polite person. This film made me lose 90 minutes of my life in which I could have done something useful for the human race or just for me. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is mediocre, the actors never look scared! Even if it's supposed to be a horror movie. For example, the scene in which Kurt gathers the bones of his former colleague. He should be scared, but he looks perfectly normal. The girl of the film is such a cliche. The only thing I liked about her was the dress she wore in the final scene. And, by the way, the end was extremely predictable with the cocoon blinking pink in the box. In fact, I was thinking of an ant walking in the back seat of the car. But that still did not surprise me.
