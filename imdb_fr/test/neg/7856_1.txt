It was completely shabby: to escape absolutely! <br /> <br /> It was a silly attempt to destroy classic sources, and it was successful! <br /> <br /> Do not watch this film under any circumstances, unless you want to have your ten euros torn and pushed your nostrils by a group of tasteless characters, atrociously not fun. <br /> <br /> This type of film clearly illustrates the chasm that still unfortunately divides filmmakers and the public. If the individual (whom God forbid to a collective could have conceived this slag) behind that had been sufficiently considerate to look at the version being read in French cinemas, he would have endured what I had to endure, and fortunately he has rewritten it or just abandoned it. absolutely. The vein of adult humor that is here mined goes back, in my opinion, to Fritz the cat, but lacks the avant-garde status of this film, even its basic attempt at social commentary. <br /> <br /> With the proliferation of remakes and increasingly relying on pre-existing sources to fund storytelling these days, one would have hoped to choose Snow White and not have to worry about the design of characters or a radically new story would have left more time for, oh I do not know, interesting animation, smarter jokes, maybe a coherent movie that has something to say and does not it telegraph its emptiness from the beginning? <br /> <br /> A production obviously appalling.
