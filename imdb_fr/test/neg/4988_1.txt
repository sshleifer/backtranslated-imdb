When Underdog, the design debuted in 1964, at the age of 7, I became addicted immediately. He was a Top Dog (intentional wordplay) in my book (ie until the first Batman on ABC a year later). Even when it was clear that Disney was going to make a live version of the famous Saturday morning cartoon, it was just as clear to me that it would be a piece of shit. Even reading the reviews in the newspapers seemed to confirm that. However, I wanted to: a) never attempt to write a review unless you have seen the film from start to finish; and b) never spend a dime in a movie that I'm almost sure to hate. <br /> <br /> Thanks to YouTube, I: a) are fully qualified to write this review; and b) it only cost me 84 minutes of my hard-earned time. <br /> <br /> That also proves what I mean, that this film is not just a shit. It's a smoking pile of dog poop. This sounds like the name of the TV show only, although they did it pretty well with Simon and Cad. <br /> <br /> In total, Underdog is a huge waste of time and money, which fortunately I do not need to spend. <br /> <br /> Rating: 1/2 * on *****
