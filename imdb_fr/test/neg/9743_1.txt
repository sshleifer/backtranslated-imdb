I vaguely remember this movie. I remember it for the only solid reason that it's the only movie I'm out of !! and since then, I have never seen it available for rental ANYWHERE !! I can not spoil it for anyone, I hardly remember it !! Thinking, watching the actors, it seemed like a winner, under the direction of John Landis, but god, they had to be paid a lot for this driv !! All I can remember is that the father disappears and the family tries to find him by trying to put a picture in the disc drive of a computer. I went out after about half an hour. I must admit however that I would like to see if I can get a copy, just to see if it was so bad !! <br /> <br /> It would not surprise me if it was on the black of all actors list! I mean Christopher Lee was in that ?? The legend of all the bad guys who had been in Star Wars and Lord of the Rings ?? As I said - movie noir, The Stupids!
