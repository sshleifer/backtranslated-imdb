I could not wait for the end. It's absolutely the worst movie I've ever seen. If you thought that almost everyone could make a viewable movie, these people prove that there is a minimum of skills required. This is a film without any redeeming features. It marks a zero in each department. This is more than just amateurs because the audience has no consideration. There is no serious attempt to act or entertain. The scenario is aimless, useless and foolish. The actors look very uncomfortable and completely lack direction. The technical aspects of the film are mediocre. <br /> <br /> As a DVD, he is a good coaster.
