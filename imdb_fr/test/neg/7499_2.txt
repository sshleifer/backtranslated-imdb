Am I the only one who thinks it's a bad movie? <br /> <br /> I recognize that horror movies often lack things like a great story, a good acting game or even good special effects. But the way these deficiencies are corrected in this film is surprisingly pitiful. <br /> <br /> Miserable Story: The idea of ​​a violated vagina taking revenge by turning into a man-eater seems pretty funny, but what the writer wrote is stupid. <br /> <br /> Bad play of the actors: the actors move like puppets. They play and look like people doing their best, but failing completely. <br /> <br /> Bad FX: The explosion of the van seems particularly cheap. <br /> <br /> It is surprising that a director who has made beautiful films during his career moves on to such a messy thing.
