I read the reviews of other hacks on this movie, and although it's certainly not the best movie ever made in the sci-fi / horror genre, it's not so bad if you accept it for this it is - little - budget, b-movie fare that (shall we say) "borrows heavily" from the likes of "Alien" (nasty alien monster who cocoon his victims) "Species" (gorgeous "and confused" space girl ") and" Incubus "beastie-rearing-with-captive-girls angle) This is a seriously lame movie, and all this was obviously done on a tight budget, although the alien is not so bad (j I have seen much less convincing men in rubber suits.) None of the actors play Oscar and the Isle Of Man does not really double for Boston Massachussetts very convincingly.The plot is also quite predictable and the hypothesis according to which an alien ship would travel thousands of miles and land at the b water middle of a university campus reserved for girls - thus providing a rich source of perfect breeding victims - is completely laughable. However, the film has its moments of suspense, there are some portions of nudity and semi-nudity and the film presents one of the rare appearances in the film of the beautiful and tragic model / actress Kadamba Simmons (as " Space Girl ") who, at the tender age of 24, was murdered in London by her jealous boyfriend shortly after making this film.
