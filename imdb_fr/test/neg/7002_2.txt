I rarely close a movie after the first 10 minutes, but that's what I did with this one. What shocked me was that it was so obvious that the only purpose of this movie was to expose as much skin as possible to actresses B, and nothing else really matters. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong. ; I like pretty actresses and sex scenes, and sexploitation movies have their own merit, but this director does not do anything else. <br /> <br /> For example, let's take the stage where the two cops (of course, a gal guy and of course there's all this so-called spiritual chatter between them) argue while standing over the first corpse. The camera swings between them for each line (there is more than one screen width between them!) And you end up wondering if you are seasick or if you do not have the naive dialogue. <br /> <br /> Well, that COULD have improved after the first 10 minutes, but I would not know it. I refused the bet on the suckers and found something better to do.
