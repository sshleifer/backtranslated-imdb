The Texan Revolution from 1835 to 1836, including the periods immediately preceding and immediately following, is described in this mediocre three-hour film, designed for television, whose only redemptive value is to shed light and pay tribute to Stephen F. Austin. called "Father of Texas" whose life story had long been overshadowed by that of the legendary Sam Houston. The rest of the film is simply the usual scenario "Santa Anna is a tyrant" and tries weakly to show the Mexican perspective with a fictional Hispanic character displaying a stereotypical Latin machismo. Combined with short, low-budget battle scenes like Alamao and San Jacinto, this movie is only recommended for history buffs who do not come from Mexico. To his credit, the Mexican uniforms seem accurate and the romantic sub-plot (another love triangle) does not take too much time on the screen. Overall, this film depicts the violent secession movement of the Texas Anglo-Saxon racial minority as a fair and positive revolution against Mexican tyranny embodied by General Antonio Lopez of Santa Anna, known as "Napoleon of the West" .
