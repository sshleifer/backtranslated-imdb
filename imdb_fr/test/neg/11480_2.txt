This should be renamed "Everybody Loves Sebastian". The rural high school student of 1983 (or senior?) Seemed to have turned above it with weird hair and a "Leo style" look has a big plate full of problems. His father-in-law announces concrete plans for a sex-change operation, about which his mother asks for the marriage to end; Sebastian is called the "f" by everyone and their mother, while "kissing" with various girls, banging at the Ready-Whip in a supermarket and rescuing a "strawberry" prostitute from the clutches of his ruthless pimp . <br /> <br /> Sebastian's "buddies" make Eddie Haskal look like a choir boy; bad association does not get worse. Sebastian seems to be looking for Harold's record of suicide attempts (though he does not admit of a suicidal tendency). For no apparent reason, SAT genius engineering score, Sebastian, MUST graduate earlier, although he has no idea of ​​his future or wants to go to university (what is what gives with this nonsense?). The film is an overview of a few weeks in the life of someone who is JOLI MESSÉ. The final scene suggests that everything will be fine, even if the COMMENT is left to the viewer. <br /> <br /> The directors of this film seem to rely on the indisputable attraction of the very attractive masculine role. "The story" leaves a lot to be desired. Looking for "what will this gorgeous kid do next ...?" does not exactly satisfy. Poor production values ​​simply do not fit with other films, independent or otherwise. A small budget and a weak story need more than a pretty face to carry it out. The "results" of this project are forgettable and an insult to intelligent cinema fans.
