Director and playwright Richard Day has adapted his own stage material for the screen, clearly inspired by the real 1950s Rock Hudson dilemma: what to do with a secretly homosexual screen idol? Marry it to an unsuspecting woman to suppress gossip (and keep it at work). Idea slender as a knell that the good distribution and the design of the retro production give a little energy to the style of a greeting card of Shag. The dialogue is not very intelligent, and there is a blunder in the beginning that does not work (spit food, etc.). Nevertheless, when a serious tone comes on the final act, it is treated with great taste - and is much more welcomed by the viewer than all the klutzy foolishness. Guy Letscher does a good job as a movie / prostitute hero Guy Stone, but his experiences here are enough to reinforce his character, or would he be back at the bar the next night? The movie does not seem to know - or care. Day wants to make some unique speeches and a carefully homosexual speech in favor of homosexuals - a plea for tolerance - but he has no other agenda. For audiences who invest their time and interest in these people, the sentimental bow of this thing can look like a joke. * 1/2 of ****
