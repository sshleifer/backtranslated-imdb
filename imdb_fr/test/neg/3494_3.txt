Okay, it was very good ... but better movie? Please, not even close. Munich was better, Capote was much better, Good Night and Good Luck were much better ... Brokeback Mountain - well, that should have been won! The voters of the Academy seem to behave like the Democrats of the day - just a little bit of everyone, but do not dare take a concrete position. That's why we have a complete fool in the United States. <br /> <br /> It's the worst presentation of AA ... and forgetting 1987 ... well before that. Hollywood is so afraid of its results that it can not be settled "straight". Apparently, many voters have not even seen Brokeback Mountain. Real and concrete. <br /> <br /> The most pathetic year since I looked in the mid-60s and I was only two years old. <br /> <br /> Wake up, whoever you are are. Hollywood is the mainstream, and that's what happened at the box office in 2005. King Kong, the latest Star Wars movie, another Batman movie, a redesign or something else from Charlie and The Chocolate Factory, and much more to come in 2006. At least, there was at least the best original images, that is to say Munich, but heard it before, Capote - super; Katherine Keener should have won, although now we know that Reese knows how to sing like a Cash / Carter, etc. Syriana was much better than Crash. This film is made since the early 1960s and we must make the best film? What a horrible Oscar night and this horrible year to end in 2005 and another boring year in 2006. At least the BAFTA of the best picture went to Brokeback, and what about the horrible song that won? Pathetic. I think we only have about 20 years left in the United States or the United States before someone comes in and changes things a bit. Maybe it will be China, because they own a large part of this country ... or India, because they have all the jobs in the high tech sector and are the largest democratic country in the world. <br /> <br /> America has become the land of fat, pathetic and stupid. Garbage is found in more places than Florida, West Virginia, South Dakota and the Midwest. <br /> <br /> Go through a local McDonald's or Burger King for kindness. Order whatever you want until you get a heart attack. Put yourself out of your misery.
