Following the events of September 11 in New York, this drama about US firefighters was designed as a tribute and tribute to their professionalism. The story is told with a series of flashbacks, after firefighter Jack Morrison (Joaquin Phoenix) crashed through the floor of a burning building and communicated with Captain Mike Kennedy (John Travolta) only by radio. The flashbacks basically show how Jack went from rookie, considering Kennedy as a father figure, to the legend of the fire stations. Of course, nowadays, Jack's firefighters are trying to reach him, but they are too late, and in the end, he lets them leave him, and he goes to his funeral, where he is considered one of the the best. the firefighters they knew. In addition, Jacinda Barrett (Linda Morrison), Robert Patrick (Terminator 2), Lenny Richter, Morris Chestnut, Tommy Drake, Billy Burke, Dennis Gauquin, Balthazar Getty, Ray Gauquin and Tim Guinee, Tony Corrigan. The flames of the film are finally all that I could pay attention and enjoy seeing the characters face them, the rest is a little too talkative for my taste. Adequate!
