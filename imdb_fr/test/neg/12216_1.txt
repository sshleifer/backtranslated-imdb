I ordered this film on the Internet because it is very difficult to watch Turkish films at home. I have heard so much about the TV series from my friends and almost everyone in Turkey that I was expecting a breakthrough in Turkish cinema. What a desappointment. <br /> <br /> Me and my husband (who is an admirer of all the movies with a bit of Turkish landscape and Turkish dialogues in it) only watched it from start to finish because we paid $ 20 For the movie. DVD. Well, it was a boring way to waste it. <br /> <br /> It was confusing, sometimes exaggerated, while others did not. The scenario was not only confusing, but added a gay man walking with his dog on the beach and using a little humor in the scenario to make it "Hollywood" did not work for me either. <br /> <br /> The American characters were almost too stereotypical to be neither funny nor realistic and, as another user mentioned, Turkish customs and lifestyles were unimportant. <br /> <br /> The movements of the camera have no meaning. Adding some dervishes (never seen in Kapadokya) and broken plates - to the Greek - have made the film even more confusing. <br /> <br /> I'm ashamed of this film and all the noise the press has made about it. There are certainly films worthy of Turkish directors that deserve more attention and respect. <br /> <br /> I give this film 1 of 10.
