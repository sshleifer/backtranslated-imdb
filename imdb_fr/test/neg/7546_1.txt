Wow, this movie was terrible. It's that simple. It's actually the first time I go out early, as far as I can remember. It finally went well: I had a very good conversation with two of the most charming girls while we all waited for the others to finally abandon this mess they called a "film". <br /> <br /> Where to start? . Bad acting, bad jokes. Fecal humor, which I simply can not bear. Sorry, but snot, pee and scat are * not * funny. Did you see the title photo? This scene lasts about 5 minutes, while the two "heroes" strike and mutilate, which is supposed to be humorous. This is not the case. <br /> <br /> Apart from bodily fluids, violence and disguise, I do not remember much of that. At least not much. I was really, really disappointed by this trash. Or let's be honest here: since I'm actually a big fan of "British" humor (that's black), I was angry. <br /> <br /> So, do you want my advice? Three words: do not look.
