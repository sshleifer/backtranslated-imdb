I bought this movie because I thought the cast was ok and I like Jennifer Rubin & Patsy Kensit. <br /> <br /> First, let me say that the game of actors is not of a high level. Stephen Baldwin gives his character an almost lingering and sometimes gloomy appearance. Patsy Kensit is pretty average, but not too convincing in some scenes, and the supposed poetry she throws into a particular scene in her hotel room is hogwash. Ms. Kensit is certainly very suggestive and sexy here, but finally I think that Jennifer Rubin is by far the best of this movie. Ms. Rubins Character is initially innocent, then sexy, as she plays the character Stephen Baldwin (Travis) for a fool. The secondary cast includes Adam Baldwin (no link to his more famous homonyms) and Mr. Emmett Walsh who has appeared in many films. I also noticed Art Evans who was one of John Mclane's allies in Die Hard 2. The film is ok and there are some nude scenes with Rubin & Kensit, a bit of action but it's definitely not a fast or smart thriller. There is a particular scene when they are in the car about to commit a crime and the character of Stephen Balwin is wearing sunglasses. When we see him again, the area around his eyes is painted black, then the sunglasses reappear later, when they leave. the crime scene and the police are in pursuit, a very obvious mistake in publishing. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of one of the ladies or Baldwin, you may find something to love here, but the others have to stay away. This is a reasonable but tasteless thriller and is worth no more than two dollars if you want it.
