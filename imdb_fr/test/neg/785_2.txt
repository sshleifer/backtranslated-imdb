"Do not be greedy" summarizes the depth of this film. All the rest of the craziness is big budget dressing. The film turns hiding the ball boringly and revealing too much. None of the potentially interesting tangents of the plot are developed, but the simplest are minced and redefined to excess. <br /> <br /> The charm of DD, as others have pointed out, was in the device of schizophrenia, the humor woven into the fabric of the film, and most importantly, the acting of the actors. There are enough wooden pieces in The Box to attract a giant mound of Martian termites. <br /> <br /> The main problem of suspending disbelief during this mess is the blatant question: "Why is a technologically superior power capable of taking control the government must do tests at all?" Horrible failure of a movie.
