"Catchfire" or "Backtrack" as it is sometimes called, is not very good. It's bad. Jodie Foster had already won an Oscar at this stage. Why did she agree to do that? I do not know. <br /> <br /> The relationship between hostages and kidnappers is not credible, even if it is a common psychological phenomenon in real life. Worse still, this film presents a scene where Hopper and Foster ride a ship under Fremont Bridge (a bridge in Seattle), which means that traffic has to stop for the bridge to open. I had to wait for this bridge to descend several times, almost all on the bus. It's not a nice wait. This film has caused useless expectations and the world is worse for him.
