Yes, the film is not a work of art, but the first time I watched it, I was 10 years old, my parents were away and I stayed at home with my two brothers. It was in May 1970 (I know it because I found a note on the horror movie cycle that a network had). This is one of the most vivid memories I have with guys. We all ended up in bed and covered in the head! Our first horror movie! We had been talking about it for years and laughing at the moment. These are horror movies. Today, horror movies are always the same. Or was it better when we were kids enjoying without analyzing the plot, the casting and the dialogues? Of course, that's it. But for me, it's a good movie!
