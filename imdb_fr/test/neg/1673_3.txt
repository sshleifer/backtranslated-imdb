Like another reviewer, my wife bought this movie as part of a family pack of 20 movies. I guess you could say it was a decent movie for 1980, but it's super predictable, and the cast, with the exception of Robert Conrad, is usually sub-par. The football scenes are nothing special and seem to be mainly used as filler for the film. The film is very dated now, but a decent remake could probably make a good movie. However, is it really necessary? I mean, how many movies from the "underdog team" are working together for the big game with the unbeaten guys "do we really need it?" It's probably a good movie for your younger kids if you find it in the basket of bargains, but a sports film lover will find him absent.
