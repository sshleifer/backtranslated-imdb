It was a mixture of film that had not started going anywhere, went astray on the way, then suddenly found a plot in the last 5 minutes when the main character is FINALLY presented. There were so many ugly, chopped mutton guys in this movie that I lost track of who the owner was and who were the supervisors. I have a theory about casting though; all the bad guys were played by ugly actors (and an ugly actress) and all the good guys / victims were played by beautiful actors. Indeed, the actors who played the ultimate victims, the slaves, were magnificent, as was the daughter of the innocent priest, while the owner of the plantation, his minipulative mistress and his supervisors were hard enough for the eyes. On purpose? You make the call. <br /> <br /> I hung to the end and others could do it too. If you just want to look at the naked breasts, there are many here and if you have a slave / master fetish, then you will love this movie. Otherwise, watch it once, throw up, take a shower and never talk to anyone.
