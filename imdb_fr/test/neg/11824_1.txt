This film is an embarrassment. Nothing works at any level. The staging, the scenario, the acting and the editing work together to push your eyes off the screen. Everything is inappropriate and inconsistent. At first, you can sit with her and moan, grimace and laugh, but very quickly, all the effort of watching becomes just too heavy.
