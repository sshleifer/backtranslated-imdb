Harmony Korrine - hate him or hate him? On this evidence, hatred could be a better word. Not him of course, just everything he does. But it could have been so different because the first ten minutes of this film are promising, including a fantastic idea of ​​an imitator Michael Jackson falling in love with an imitator Marilyn Monroe. Fantastic. And put in Paris! It could be great. But unfortunately, Korrine can give the illusion of a decent idea, but because he is a formidable writer, the story fails at all levels and the overflow of the audience that I attended about an hour is irrefutable proof that he is the most boring and pretentious director ever. . Apparently, the dropout rate at its premiere at the Cannes Film Festival last year was quite shocking. Instead of focusing on the two protagonists, he stupidly rocks history in the confines of a castle to present a group of other imitators making the whole experience tedious and sterile. When will the independent cinema stop funding this upstart?
