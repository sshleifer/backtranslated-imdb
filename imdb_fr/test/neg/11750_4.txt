The most disposable film in the history of cinema? It is a serious competitor! Why waste so much money on such unnecessary and unnecessary work? The only difference between the classic HITCHCOCK and this poor imitation is the color, the big screen and the Walkman of Leila !! A film supposed to generate strong emotions and the fear leaves me completely indifferent. This will encourage younger generations to see the original? Balderdash! This "psycho 1998" is a giant spoiler. <br /> <br /> They could have done something different, for example by founding an actor closer to Bloch 's Bates, an obese man.They are content with an odious repetition! A pox on it! and long live Alfred Hitchcock!
