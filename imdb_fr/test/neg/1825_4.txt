I looked at it mainly for the sole reason that it was supposed to contain references to the Third Reich. It turned out to be a pretty slasher, brainless and predictable movie that seemed to appeal to feminists. <br /> Let me tell you something, if you're waiting for a movie to see the pretty tits of the female, the last thing you want is a sex scene made with taste, with camera angles troublesome who do not show anything. Her busty friend did not pull out either, but we saw a lot of ass and pubic hair and guys in their shirts. And at the end, our heroine magically avoids the scalpel and the movements of the villain (who turns out to be the pretty kid, oddly enough) and she easily fights him (uh huh) while his amorous love is attached and wait to be saved. The funniest part was when she took a chair and "swings" to the guy and he breaks on him. Now that would be just about anything she could lift the chair, let alone smash it against a person with enough force to break it! It looks ridiculous, it rubs against him and it falls apart. If you are thinking of doing this kind of "role reversal" (which has already been done to death), you must at least make things almost plausible. <br /> <br /> There was, however, a good part. The villain got the better of his slutty friend, giving him a lesson for being such a wanderer and sleeping around. This is not exactly something feminists would like. <br /> <br /> Really stupid. Not that American slasher films are generally much better, but you have to wonder why they are boring. It does not bring anything new to the genre. <br /> <br /> 5/10
