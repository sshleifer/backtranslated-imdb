This movie was just about two nights away on ITV1 .. dear oh oh dear. Someone actually bought this with the strength of Robert Carlylse .. OK, I missed the start .. but what I saw is so serious that I thought, no ... I looked with embarrassed the stars that were there. Nothing was based on reality, I doubt that things progress as they did in this film. Everything was poor in this movie. OK, cgi .. but no reality. The writing gave the impression of a piece of cliff suspension ... sorry, I was not impressed. Yes, formula. I could not guess the end. From what I saw, the army had the upper hand on the head, the people who did what was heroic did not have time to do their job, it would not have happened like that? It was worse than leaving your brain at the door. It was annoying ... like someone said ... yeah, ok ... of course it would have happened ... no !! The credits mentioned Quebec and Canada ... so it was a co-production, missed the third part concerned ... I will have to check on this site. I'm not usually that critical, but it annoyed me.
