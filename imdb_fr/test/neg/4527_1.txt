This film is in the same league as Ishtar. A lot of wasted talent. Who let this bomb escape? When Sigfried said that an example had to be made, in reference to a nuclear bomb, I said, "Please, let it be this theater!" Do not waste your time. Not worth a free rental! And where did they find these shills to fill the comment section on IMDb? I can not believe anyone who has ever seen the original series enjoyed this stinker. Steve Carell is not a physical comedian. If they removed the "comedy" and made it an action movie, he could pass. What was the purpose of the dance scene? In addition, the big jokes and references were tasteless. This film never missed an opportunity to search for the lowest common denominator and the scenes had just ended, it seemed, as if nobody thought them. Simply horrible! Save your time, if not money and give a pass to this movie!
