Now I have seen everything. Just when I thought it could not be more pathetic and corny than "Woodchipper Massacre", just when I thought that dialogue and play could not be worse than "Nail Gun Massacre", just when I thought "Do not Go In The Woods" would retain its ugly film title Slasher Ever, followed by "THE LAST FESTIVAL OF SLUMBER!" In a way, this cheap and miserable manure manages to avoid the lust, but it remains terrible ! I could not believe my eyes - for once, I can not complain about excessive nudity (or in this case, none) in a slasher movie, but it still managed to make me scarlet with the embarrassed to praise him. Never before have I seen such an awful acting, dialect, direction, writing ... I could go on forever with this list! Here is a brief overview of the situation: <br /> <br /> A patient with mental disorders escapes from the zany garbage can, dresses like a surgeon, somehow finds out where his doctor lives and between as his daughter has friends. for the night. Then begins the most stupid killing (snatched from other movies such as "Slumber Party Massacre" and Halloween ") on this side of the universe.The characters have a negative IQ, which suggests that they are not not human, because they tend to bleed Kool-Aid when they are cut, as the slasher likes to show his usefulness when he wields his mask to the camera in so many scenes, it's only 80 minutes .. How many times do I have to watch this scapel before it burns the whole movie? ... which, I suppose, would not be such a bad idea in this case! There was a moment when I thought maybe, just maybe, the director make it interesting (a second killer was added), but alas, it should not be! And then to insult even further, there is a stupid sub-ending of super-cop-out and a final conclusion even more stupid ... logical, but I would not like to give the few scenes the p Silly reading of the movie story at these two or Fools (like me) stupid enough to rent these sewage. <br /> <br /> I hope that by writing this, I saved 80 minutes of someone's life. I kneel down to beg anyone who still thinks to praise this: PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE DO NOT! He is a fan of the slasher genre who speaks; I know what's good for you! The only real victims of this idiot are poor morons who have sat in the entire toilet tank! The score of Zanatos ... since there is no negative scale of points, I must give him a 1, but a 1 lower than average. Avoid it at all costs .... please !!!!
