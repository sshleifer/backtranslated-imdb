First, let me clarify that I am a big fan of bad science fiction, especially when it involves gigantic monsters hitting the cities. But this one is so lame that I can not even like it to be bad. They apparently have not saved enough money on the budget by skipping on props (the only accessory we have available to indicate that the size of the extraterrestrial girl is an oversized fantasy pencil, available from Spencer's Gifts for a couple of weeks. dollars), they also decided not to spend on the concept or the plot. The monster looks OK, in my opinion, but it does not have enough interaction with the backgrounds, that is, not enough destruction to satisfy most fans of the genre. The general rule of giant monster movies is this: if you do not have a lot of fake buildings to destroy, you'd better tackle another fake monster. This film has neither one nor the other. I can not complain about the movie without revealing the end, but just tell the origin of the monster and the method found to eliminate it, but do not hold back the water. Not as good as most of these movies. Jump.
