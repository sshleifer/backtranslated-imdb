In one way or another, this documentary about Miles manages to include very little music and no complete melodies. Although Miles appears in the film, 95% of the interviews are people other than Miles. There are huge chronological gaps, many aspects of his life (his prodigy of childhood, his addiction) are ignored or ignored, and you will learn little about what made the man and his contribution to the so innovative music. Jump.
