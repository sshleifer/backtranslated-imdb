Seriously ... I am amazed by all the good returns from this show here. All we have in this show are two stupid kids who keep on laughing and doing funny OCCASIONAL things only in ... two of the shows, while most of the others are void ... so they comment on video clips I can not personally support that they like or like. <br /> <br /> In most episodes, you will only hear what is repeated: "we're going to score sticks", or "I'm going to kick your ass", or the better and usually used quote "who was cool", and most of all, their annoying laughter. <br /> <br /> If you want a good animated show, try The Simpsons, Ren and Stimpy, South Park, this series just is not worth the time and energy to watch this awful MTV series in all honesty.
