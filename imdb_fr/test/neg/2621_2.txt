Retro Puppet Master begins in Kolewige in 1944, while puppeteer André Toulon (Guy Rolfe) and his still alive puppets plan to escape Germany. Resist in an inn. Toulon remembers his childhood and the moment when he learned about dead objects in 1902 in Paris, when his young character (Greg Sestero) directed the Magic Theate. He describes the fateful night where he met a 3,000-year-old Egyptian wizard named Afzel (Jack Donner), and the eventual love of his life, the young and handsome Ilsa (Brigitta Dau). He tells how Afzel passed on the gift of life and gave life to his own wooden puppet that was part of the Magic Theater show. However, the gift of life was also a curse because the ancient god Sutek, to whom the secret had been stolen in the first place by Afzel, wants to recover it and all those who learned it died ... <br /> In the end I was a little fan of Puppet Master, being a big fan of the first three, I decided to watch the rest of the franchise and, as such, I saw Puppet Master 4 (1993) , Puppet Master 5: The Final Chapter (1994), The Curse of the Puppet Master (1998) & now the Master of the Retro Puppets in the space of a few weeks and it was difficult to get through it, especially this one, which is the worst of the series so far. Retro Puppet Master looks like a cross between Puppet Master III: The Vengeance of Toulon (1991) with its period decor & Puppet Master 4 & Puppet Master 5: The Final Chapter with Sutek trying to kill all those he stole. There is not much continuity here either, again, there is no green serum presented in previous films. Despite the suicide of Andre Toulon in 1939 at the beginning of the original film Puppetmaster (1989), he is seen alive and well in 1944. The majority of the story is told in the form of flashback and focuses on André Toulon rather than on puppets, the film focuses on his relationship with Ilsa and teaching him the secret of life and it's rather boring and tedious to be honest. Even at just 80 minutes, Retro Puppet Master feels elongated and padded, with no real rhythm or concept, because the plot is never really adjusted and usually fluctuates a lot. Then of course there is the disconcerting decision to completely redefine the puppets, which I found incredible. Why would manufacturers take the basic thing that made the Puppet Master films so memorable and eliminate them completely? The puppets are briefly seen at the beginning and end, but otherwise we have these wooden caricatures looking for waste that is not nearly as fresh as their modern rework. This has never even explained why these puppets were used rather than those that all Puppet Master fans have come to love, although it is suspected that Full Moon was hoping to create another sequel to this question. <br /> <br /> If a mediocre story and a total absence of our favorite puppets was not serious enough Full Moon decided to rank PG-13 to make Retro Puppet Master the only film of Puppet Master not ranked "R" in the United States (obviously in other countries they do not have a single drop of blood in the whole movie, the puppets do not kill anyone, there is no swearing or nudity either. is more docile than tamed animals all the way.In addition to the puppets themselves that clean the special effects are the wost of the series too, there is no stop motion animation in it, no computer effect CGI (probably in 1999, CGI was pretty cheap?) & All the effects are stiff puppet type effects, I mean that every time you see a marionette "walk", the camera is always positioned above the wait not to show his legs and there is obviously an assistant advanced production, it is as complex and at the cutting edge of technology as the special effects get married. <br /> <br /> The positive aspect of Retro Puppet Master is that it's pretty pretty, the design of the period, the costumes and accessories are actually quite impressive and it's a pretty film beautiful looking sometimes. Apparently shot in Bucharest, Romania, this dubbing is quite successful for the turn of the last century, Paris. Playing here is awful and perhaps the worst of the series. <br /> <br /> Retro Puppet Master is more or less the final film of Puppet Master, and the next film, Puppet Master: The Legacy (2004), publishes together images of the previous seven films and is a rather crappy way to complete the series that started so well with three superb and distinctive puppet films. Do not bother about it, watch one of the first three and remember the good times ... The deadly puppets would return in the dreaded movie, Puppet Master vs. Demonic Toys (2004).
