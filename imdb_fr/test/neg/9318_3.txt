OK, last night I attended the world premiere of The Exorcist: The Beginning of Paul Schrader at the Brussels International Fantastic Film Festival. With all the excitement around the film, he was eagerly awaited. <br /> <br /> The director was present, as were most of the stars (with the exception of Skarsgard). <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the movie was completely lost. . This was a real disappointment for me because I am a big fan of the 1973 original film by Shrader and Friedkin (RIP). <br /> <br /> What was the problem? Most of that actually. The FX (we could think that the Matrix and LOTR digital revolution never took place: it was so bad!), Editing (no real rhythm), the acting (only Skarsgard could sometimes convince). The script was a, IMO, set up to explain the African scenes in the original movie. So, the film had the impression of mounting a scene, but it brought nothing. <br /> <br /> The only thing that I liked was the cinematography of Vittorio Storaro although I saw it better (Apocalyps Now). <Br /> <br /> All the time, I thought it was just a blow, a work in progress. And that, given the circumstances (well known), is probably what it is. But that does not change the obvious problems with the scenario. <br /> <br /> I had the chance to meet Schrader (very briefly) but I did not have the courage to tell him what I thought of the movie and I was so nervous (this is the guy who wrote Taxi Driver for Christ's sake !!) that I forgot to ask him to sign my copy of his Taxi Driver script ...
