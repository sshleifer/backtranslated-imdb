Once I heard this movie described as either you will love it or you hate it. By reading some of the other reviews and reviews, I would venture to say that this is true. I put myself in the crowd that hates. I have seen really bad movies, boring movies and even low budget movies. This film is bad on all three fronts. <br /> <br /> This island of Earth, Exeter (Jeff Morrow), returns to his science fiction / b-movie film roots under the name of Dr. Les (minus a giant head prosthesis). The doctor and his assistant Arnie (George O'Hanlon - also called the voice of George Jetson) - as well as assistant Vera, the assistant of Les, track down a meteor. This is the casting node and it's almost a double date. Vera and Arnie have her "Susie" (Synchro Unifying Sinometric Integrating Equitensor - or computer). Let's just say that the relationship between George and his robotic maid, Rosie, (and her relationship with "Susie") is more believable than the cold and clamorous feelings Vera has for Les (and vice versa). The object of all their interest is not an ordinary meteor, however. It's really an Art Nouveau / Art Deco extraterrestrial energy storage device, which moves like a three-legged dog. There is also the little extraterrestrial "energy" that controls Dr. Hubbel (aka his chief scientist). The stranger is obviously and from the start, mean and evil. Is this the kind of science we distribute? No wonder the aliens of the Explorers were afraid of us. Looking at some of these movies, we shoot first. There is no need for questions after. <br /> <br /> The whole film is synonymous with boring scientific experiments, such as cooking an egg or adding food coloring to celery. It's not the fact that it's a low-budget science fiction movie or it's a bit old-fashioned and old-fashioned. It's really, really, really boring. The whole film is trying to understand what's going on. That's it. Most of the things we learn about what is happening are done through monologues and autodictation. Add shit dialogues, cardboard role plays and cheap sets, and you have the stuff of a clone of Ed Wood (by the way, Ed made really boring movies - avoid the orgy deaths). The dialogue ... oh, the dialogue. Jems such as: <br /> <br /> ".. less than 3 km from the ocean? <br /> <br /> Why not ?! He has traveled a billion kilometers in space." <br /> <br /> or <br /> <br /> "Do you think that you will be able to respect a husband who has probably pulled the scumbags of science all the time?" <br /> <br /> This film obviously tries to shoot a forbidden planet, this island Earth, magnetic monster or in the same light as the outer limit, the twilight zone. Namely, a low-budget science fiction film (or episode of television) that is compelling enough to overcome technical difficulties and strange situations. Basically, these films are enjoyable at a certain level (the story, the underlying meaning or the completely comical character of the dialogue or situations). This film has none of that. It's just 90 minutes of trouble. I could not even enjoy it at the Ed Wood level. I highly recommend passing this one in place of one of the movies I mentioned above. It's so bad that if I called myself Dr. Forrester, I would never think of showing this film to anyone ... except Frank maybe.
