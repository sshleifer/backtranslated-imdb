Southern Cross, written and directed by James Becket, is a waste of good efforts in celluloid and acting. A movie formula is not necessarily bad if it pays off, what this movie does not do. It's a tedious mix of movie clich√©s that can be associated with a thousand different films from the past. It is full of random and empty twists that add nothing but aimless actions, like a journey of the protagonists into a ghost town where the bad guys follow them (without explanation). This was obviously concocted as an excuse for a shootout and an escape scene bordering on ridicule, with people coming in and out of doors and walking past the windows while shooting at each other. This suggests that someone told Becket that there was a ghost town in the Chilean foothills and he said, "Oh, great, let's do a filming scene over there." <br /> <br /> Do not even lose your rental money. So. It's a bunch of random pieces of a hundred different movies put together to call an action drama.
