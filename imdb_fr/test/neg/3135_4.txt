First, I would like to admit that Chokher Bali was not my cup of tea. This film was obviously not intended for the masses. This is the type that critics would like to watch. The hype and advertising were quite misleading. <br /> <br /> I was expecting something very dramatic like Devdas. Realizing that history and the period require it, I found the film extremely slow. <br /> <br /> I am a fan of Aishwarya and I regret to say that I thought it was a manufacturing mistake. The role of Chokher Bali required an actress who could be subversive, innocent and naive. Everyone gave a good performance. Tagore's description of the human condition meets celluloid to give the film an interesting theme.
