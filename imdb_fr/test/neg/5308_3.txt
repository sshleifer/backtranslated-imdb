If Pulp fiction and Get shorty did not exist, it could be an OK movie. When I say that, I mean that nothing of this movie is clean unless it's another piece of terrible dialogue or a scene full of clich√©s. All the lines like 'i will not say more than what I must say if 'from shorty seems to appear in this sequel of garbage, all the cameos like Steven Tyler are terribly acted and are not necessary and as for Christina Milian, dude, do not get me started Some of the coolest actors and actresses like John Travolta and Uma Thurman seem to want to be depressed by kids and hip and have almost ruined their reputation because of this movie and, frankly, I think the best game comes from rock that plays with one of my least favorite actors , Vince Vaughn.The man tries to be funny while taking the mickey of how apparently the rappers speak.Cedric, the artist and Andre 3000 play another terrible double act {I personally think that the background actorswere better than Andre Cedric and the only fun part of Cedric's game, Andre and the rest of their gang, is the way their pants are up to their knees so you can clearly see their boxer and the only reason why I find it funny is because a lot So, in conclusion, this movie tries to be funny and fails miserably, it does not have any new material, comedy or coolness because it copies all the other movies and ultimately the only reason you should see it is like to compare how bad it is to its brilliant predecessor Get shorty.Oh yes I forgot to mention there is a big shot in the end.
