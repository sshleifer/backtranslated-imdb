I was not really interested in seeing Step Up, but my friend kept bothering me watching this movie, especially since she is so in love with Channing Tatum, I constantly tease her about it. saying that this is the only reason she liked the movie. But she kind of convinced me that it was a worthwhile movie, that if I liked movies like Dirty Dancing, Take the Lead, and Save the Last Dance, I'd love Step Up, huh, it's What is this mess? I guess all movies are entitled to a view. <br /> <br /> Well, do you know the movies I just mentioned at the top? Dirty Dancing, Take the Lead and Save the Last Dance? Well, put them in a blender with gangsta love and that's what you have. Not to mention that if you saw these movies, well, frankly, you saw Step Up. Because Channing is a lower class with smart people on the street who naturally feel the music while this posh up class girl has to follow step by step, how will they fall in love if they are so different? After all, it's their chance to "compete" with the passion, the mystery and the lust of dance! <br /> <br /> OK, that was a stupid explanation of the plot, but as I said, as long as you saw the movies I mentioned, or even if you just saw 'plot, you get the movie. I do not understand how it actually has a rating of 5.5, I bet it's these lovers of Channing! LOL! I'm kidding with you, but it's good, I guess I did not understand what others did with the passion, the mystery that is dance! Oh, Antonio Bandares, where are you when we need you ?! <br /> <br /> 4/10
