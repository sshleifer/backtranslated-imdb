I had to miss part of this movie ... I wondered who it was? And when did this happen? He seemed to jump but I kept looking for fear of missing something and everything would be explained to me. I loved Lonesome Dove but this movie did not make sense to me. I loved all the actors but what happened with the rest of the film? It made me go "what"? At the beginning of each part..As for the landscape - I thought it was fine..It made me feel like I was flipping through a book and leaving pages outside .. The end had a little confused as well as I imagine the boy was waiting for his father and was supposed to leave, you wondered if his father would finally come home with his son and become a father since his mother was now gone..I would like to read the book just to see what I missed the movie..I do not expect him to win a prize.
