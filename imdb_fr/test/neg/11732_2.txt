No no no. That's my advice if you want to see this movie. Anthony Perkins is the ONLY and ONLY Norman Bates, as is Janet Leigh in her role as Marion Crane. This looks like a colorized version of Psycho, with a few slightly different touches made for a more modern appeal. Vaughn is as drab as Norman, and Sam Loomis of Viggo Mortenson seems too cowboy compared to the original. Please, do yourself a little justice. Do not bother with that. One can only wonder what would think Mr. Alfred Hitchcock and Mr. Anthony Perkins right now ....... <br /> <br /> * on ****
