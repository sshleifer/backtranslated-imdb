Let me be clear. I hate this kind of movies. I do not like anything where the protagonists are all of the English bourgeoisie. I find this kind of literature and film terribly pretentious. You will never make me read a book by Jane Austen willingly. That said, the only reason I read W. Somerset Maugham's book and watched the film that followed was for a class. <br /> <br /> Mary Panton (Kristin Scott Thomas) is a beautiful English woman living in a villa borrowed from Florence. before the second world war. One night after having dinner with some of her rich royalty friends, she finds an Austrian refugee, has sex with him and ditches, and kills himself. As the film goes further and further, you really do not want to love Mary. <br /> <br /> What a shit this movie was. First of all, many of the subplots and characters invented in the movie did not even appear in the book. I doubt very much that the late Mr. Maugham would have appreciated them. The characters, though rich, were among the most superficial and egocentric characters I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The only reason I did not give less than three stars was because acting was the only redeemable thing. The always talented Kristin Scott Thomas is perfect for Mary's role. In fact, I could not imagine anyone else filling his shoes. Sean Penn and Anne Bancroft also had secondary roles as well as the lead role. <br /> <br /> Save yourself the trouble of watching this movie.
