This film looked funny on the cover and I honestly thought, "How bad can it be? Little did I know. Out of the door the dialogue was IMPERABLE. It was artificial, unrealistic and not even interesting. The dialogue on UPN subscribed television shows is more natural. The story was not plausible and had virtually no playoff play in the end. The end with the snake is almost confusing and seemed staged. The only interesting character is that of Rose McGowen, who is silent, which prevents her from being ruined by a dialogue with cheated garbage (well, at least until the end even if she must speak). The only thing that even gives a 3 on 1 or 2 is the nude scene of Rose McGowen. Really horrible. Save yourself the trouble and rent something more interesting, like a video of Barney.
