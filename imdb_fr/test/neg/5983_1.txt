There is nothing in this that the viewer could point to and call "good". The game was dull and calm. The sets and the cinematography seem to have been developed by someone who grew up in a Starbucks and tried to create the perfect advertising for Gap. The characters have no motivation, no motivation, no reason to worry about it. There is such a lack of interest and tension that it is difficult to follow banal action and dialogue. And the plot ... if anyone finds out, I'm sure it would be as boring as anything else. <br /> <br /> It's not funny, it's not romantic, it does not reflect the human state. If you want a good stoner comedy, watch Half-Baked; if you want a good stoner drama, watch Trainspotting. The only reason I gave these 2 stars instead of one is because it's fun to see familiar faces in the mid-cast of the late 90's. Which is a shallow reason to give the film even a star, but again, it's a shallow film.
