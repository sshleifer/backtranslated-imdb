My position: Even great underwater photographs can save a familiar script and characters as fine as possible. <br /> <br /> For those who do not have enough photos of FREE WILLY, FLIPPER could serve a decent rental. Others are (strongly) suggested to stay away. Although FLIPPER is a harmless affair, it hardly presents anything for the adult audience (unless it is your first visit to a dolphin). <br /> <br /> A remake of a TV show and a film from the 1960s, FLIPPER may sound like a good idea at the time: a dolphin seduces the life of a boy and of a girl. They help the environment get rid of toxic waste thrown into Florida Keys sparkling waters, while fighting a shark and a nasty salty shit that happens to be the one responsible for toxic dumping and also hates dolphins. But even for the 90s, especially if a strangely similar movie like FREE WILLY was a recent hit, FLIPPER is just another innocuous but sometimes empty summer splash movie for kids. Although the animals (this is the case, it's the main dolphin, a clumsy pelican and a realistic-looking hammerhead shark, cast like a villain) and immaculate underwater cinematography steal the show, it does not matter. There is nothing better in FLIPPER to steal anyway. <br /> The story is totally predictable, what today even a child of 6 can find obvious. The cast (Human), led by a pre-Lord of the Rings, Elijah Wood, and a Paul at work, out of work, rarely has anything to do but stay upright and be pretty. Their acting skills, whatever they may be for this film, are rarely revealed on screen, unless you consider the "actor" talents of merry Bottlenose Dolphin. I guess do not try to recommend FLIPPER because a foolish family entertainment will not be fair, but anyone over 10 (no, do 8) is better to rent or buy something else. In addition, the film lasts about 95 minutes. This could give you enough time to go somewhere else, without worrying about your children. This alone could be worth the rental. <br /> <br /> Rating: ** out of 5
