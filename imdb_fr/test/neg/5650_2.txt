Well, I had and saw this movie based on the rather high score here (7.1 now), and some of the good reviews. IMDb is usually a good guide to score points, although in this case I was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> The film is a contemporary crime novel, starring Vinnie Jones as a reporter-investigator, investigating the death of a construction worker. Added to this is a novel invented by Dickens (entitled The Riddle, which takes place in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries), which also deals with a murder story. Both stories are linked by the discovery of an unpublished manuscript. <br /> <br /> Sounds interesting to you? This could have been the case, but this film has failed terribly in a number of areas: 1) Play. Mediocre at best, but it's observable. Not worse than your average British sitcom, but for a movie, we expect a little better. Especially with a score of over 7. 2) Music. The music used is simply horrible, distracting and annoying. Especially the pub music, and the music playing in the journalist's apartment. 3) the scenario. It's a big joke. There are many holes in the plot and even the obligatory love story is so unrealistic that it's almost funny. Moreover, without going into details, I can say with certainty that the end is absurd and that it is one of the worst plays and script of the year. 4) Camera work. Sometimes the positions and views of the camera are distracting and do not serve anything in "history". <br /> <br /> I'm a bit fanatical about cinema and I watch an average of 1 to 2 movies a day, but it's easily the worst film I've seen in months. Do not waste your money or time on this garbage.
