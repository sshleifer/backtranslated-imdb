Some teenagers go to an old abandoned farmhouse left to one of them by their deceased grandfather, unaware that there were several murders decades ago because their grandfather had a pact with them. the devil for a good harvest. have you thought of something better to sell his soul? The grandson of this man and his friends are designed to be the next sacrifice, for reasons that are never explained. The stereotype of his teenage son and his girlfriend, the black with a white girlfriend and the two lesbians must fight against three killer scarecrows. But, do not be fooled like me, it's not as fun as it sounds. . It's mostly about the ball, the drugs and the main actor who complains of never knowing his parents. The work of the camera is atrocious and fragile, perhaps done on a hand-held camcorder in some scenes, which may be a good thing since the scarecrows seem to come from a child's birthday party and that they could apparently only hire two people to play the three scarecrows! Some of the best movies I have seen have been these low budget independent horror movies, but this one is just pathetic. The team and the actors seem to be composed of a group of people who knew each other, who had never acted before and who had no intention of playing again, and who had a few thousand dollars (I can not not believe that this film cost $ 130,000). make) and a weekend of free time in their hands - even the sluggish lesbian scene is lame. <br /> <br /> I think it's fun too, as at the date of this writing, there is a sequel to this movie that has not even bothered to add to IMDb. <br /> <br /> * on ****, and I value this very well only because of the lean soaking scene, no matter how lame it is.
