this movie wasted my time. I only saw part of it and I cried about how much time I could spend doing something productive and useful for this land. for everyone who watched this movie more than once, I blame them for global warming because the amount of black balloons that came into the earth from this piece of shit was not necessary and if they forgave them . robin Williams lowered his criteria to actually participate in this film for more than 10 seconds and Tim Robbins, how he went from this movie to the redemption of shawhsank, I have no idea. please do not watch this movie for the safety of the earth. Stop letting go of black balloons into the earth from a movie they should never have financed or broadcast. please burn all the copies before anyone has to look at this shit.
