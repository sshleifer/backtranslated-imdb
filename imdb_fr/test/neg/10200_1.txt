I watched Gomeda at the cinema in my city. My friend took me away and I was really curious to know what it was like. Well, I must say that this movie was not a horror, maybe we can say it's a "fantasy experiment" ... OK, I'm going anyway ... But there were a lot of problems with filming, acting, drama, theater and storytelling. I can understand because the director is very young and Gomeda is his first feature film. OK The realization of this film was not so bad, I see. Unfortunately, because of the constraints imposed on the film by its extremely reduced budget, the visuals are And there are no powerful Gothic scenes. As a horror movie, he really fails, he is not afraid at all and he is quite confused and boring. Some people say that "Gomeda" is a film of art, but I could not see a laughable, appalling and degenerate art film like that. So, how can we say it's an art movie! Just funny!
