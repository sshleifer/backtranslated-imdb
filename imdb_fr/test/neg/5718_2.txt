After a long night of partying at the Islington Walkabout, I needed a relay. My throat hurt, my wallet was empty and I ended up chatting with an addict at a bus stop trying to sell me gas. Today, I watched "Red Sonja" and I can honestly say that I felt much better last night than now. Brigitte Nielsen directs a band of warriors to conquer different shapes and sizes to recover the green rock of an evil queen whose motives are never fully explained. Yes, it's as good as that. <br /> <br /> "Red Sonja" is not a genre known for big films until Peter Jackson arrives with some Oscar-winning trilogy. In fact, the best movie about swords and witchcraft I could think of before "Lord Of The Rings" was George Lucas' "Willow". Given that, we should perhaps go a little easy on this film. But I can not - it's badly written, badly played (with the exception of Paul Smith, who is just average) and terribly prepared. The film is as convincing as an episode of the Flintstones, with costumes and scenery apparently lifted from the Bedrock. Given the sources of comics, it is easy to forgive the various inconsistencies of the plot. Why Sonja insists on saving the most annoying child, in this world or that one, is disconcerting. His personality seems to go from a spoiled kid to a polite gentleman in a jiffy. Schwarzenegger displays less charisma than a field full of cows and just goes through the motions, a perfect actor for his decisive role in "The Terminator". <br /> <br /> It's easy to start a movie when you're down, but the fact remains that it's not a good movie, far from it. When Nielsen mourns the death of her sister and Schwarzenegger tenderly puts her hand on her shoulder to comfort her, then lights up, with that distinctive Germanic accent, "she's dead," so you know you're in a difficult situation. A few smiles were raised at inappropriate times, such as the priestesses of a temple who, when sent to dive to their death in a hole in the ground, seemed to enjoy the experience - at least, judging by the orgasmic moans that seemed to resonate around them. the place. If you have to watch a fantastic 80s movie that was not pornography, look at "Willow" (but never take that as a resounding endorsement). In fact, present yourself at the local multiplex and show Peter Jackson the remarkable work he has done with "Lord Of The Rings". Believe me, 11 Oscars really mean it's a great movie - unlike "Titanic".
