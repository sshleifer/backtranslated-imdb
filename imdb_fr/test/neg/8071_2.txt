I live in Rome where lives and works the Turkish director of this film. On behalf of my Italian friends, I heard a lot of good things about his films ... so after watching the preview, I really wanted to see "Cuore Sacro". I am deeply disappointed, one of the most pompous, pseudo-religious, highly improbable and naive films. I love cinema but this one is really heavy and bad. The main character is really crazy, and should be locked in a madhouse ... made me understand the negative character of an aunt, who runs a dirty business that only wants to earn money ... and I consider myself an anticapitalist ... so bad !!!
