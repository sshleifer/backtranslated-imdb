A total and total parody of a movie. "Dark Power" is the kind of movie that even Troma would be embarrassed to release. the fact that it was only 75 minutes could have been better spent. The reviewer above must be related to the director, because that's the only reason I appreciate his assessment of this crap. when the lead actor (and the most experienced cast member) can not deliver his lines convincingly, you know you have a very, very bad movie. Avoid at all costs.
