If you really REALLY love movies in which ants build earth mirrors, eat non-ants and conquer the world with voiceover narration, this movie is for you. Essentially, a couple of scientists working in a bio-dome communicate with extremely intelligent ants (the most intelligent actors in this movie) to try to thwart their plans for conquest and extermination. Throughout the film, the two scientists (and a girl rescued ants) use everything they have (computers, green dye and horror game), but to no avail. I guess they just could not afford to buy pesticides because the film would be finished too quickly. <br /> <br /> The title of the film "Phase IV" is a mystery. It's not a spoiler, but the "Phase I" starts right after the opening credits when you do not reach the "Phase IV" before the end of the credits. Apparently, the director knew that the film would be tedious and so placed the phases 1 to 3 throughout the film as a kind of progress report: "Hang on buddy! final generic! " As an MST3K episode, this one was not very good for two reasons: 1) This is from season 0 on KTMA when they started, so the riffing is not as good as in the seasons later; and 2) This movie is so bad that even J & TB can not lighten it. There are one or two Gamera references because they had just filmed 5 Gamera movies. <br /> <br /> The movie has a tip trick / surprise, but I was so happy to get to the end, the effect was lost to me. .
