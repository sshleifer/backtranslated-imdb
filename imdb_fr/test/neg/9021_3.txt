What distinguishes some of the "Lone Star" movies (and many others in Western movies and adventures of the early '30s) is their lack of what we recognize as a stereotypical narrative. To be sure they had good against evil (basic element of all Westerners), a boy meets a girl and some basic characters, such as the old breeder and his beautiful daughter or daughter, and sometimes the bad banker or another businessman, but the action was often different from one film to another. <br /> <br /> "The Lawless Frontier" presents Earl Dwire in his big turn (not) as (for some inexplicable reason) Pandro Zanti, an Apache, half American posing as a fluent Mexican speaking language. His biggest pose as a Mexican seemed to be his outrageous mariachi clothes. The only plot seems to be that he wants to steal Ruby, the granddaughter of "Old Dusty" (Gabby Hayes). When he meets her for the first time, Dwire gives him a long look that places him in the big leagues with sexual predators. One might think that because the opening scene shows Zanti killing John (Wayne) Tobin's father off camera, it would play a bigger role in the movie. It's not. Yakima Canutt calls for a lot of good stunts, including pulling Ruby on his horse when he passes, jumping on the "renegades" and hitting the horses of their horses, a horse jumps from a cliff into a lake, and even the same slip into the sluice sequence that was in "The Lucky Texan" (1934), although this time the Mighty Yak uses a body surfing journal instead of riding a tree limb, and its inclusion is just as illogical this time Also, because they are in a desert. <br /> <br /> The highlight is clearly John Wayne's methodical measured and methodical walk through the desert after the escape and tripping over Zanti with these fantastic basaltic cliffs of Red Rock Canyon (seen in countless soap operas , westerns and sci-fi movies 'moon') framed behind him. No final duel fifty paces with the heroine running the wooden steps of the bar to kiss and kiss the winning hero in this movie! When John Wayne finally catches up with him, Zanti drinks poisonous water from a waterhole and dies. <br /> <br /> After a few extra lawsuits, the Zantai gang is finally captured in Dusty's cabin, emerging one behind the other from behind a swivel vanity that apparently leads to a blocked canyon now by dynamite. No twilight overlap or obligatory kissing: Ruby, now Mrs. John Tobin, on the phone with Sheriff John Tobin: "What would Sheriff Tobin want for dinner?" The film also has a poor lighting and editing at the beginning, the cadence is slow, some parts with the sheriff drag it, and the pursuit on horseback fills the film. So, despite the different and unusual elements, it turns out to be one of the weakest solitary stars.
