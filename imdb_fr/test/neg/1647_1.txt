In his recent denigrated reality show, Mr. Shore acknowledged that his film work was best appreciated. No, he must have said "better watched". Even though a healthy generic can help you reach the end credits, there is little pleasure to find except for a few sporadic giggles in the photo, not with it. The absence of a hyphen is the least grievance. Tiffani-Amber Thiessen (I challenge you to say that the patina of purity "Saved by the bell") is another hyphen and healthy. she is too round for treachery. Mr. Shore himself has sometimes shown a strange talent for mimicry (I thought I recognized a Jimmy Stewart), but it was never used wisely. The banal fish-out-of-water formula has yet to be rendered with less grace. Our hero, Crawl has little precious wit to explain the quick charm of his agrarian antagonists. In the end, I had to announce that this had been verified: THE WORST FILM OF EVER. P.S. As a fish, Adam Sandler is doing better with "Mr. Deeds". It can take a shore to enjoy a Sandler.
