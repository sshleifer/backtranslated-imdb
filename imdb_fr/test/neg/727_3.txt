When I watched this series for the first time, I felt that the characters were charming and amusing, Lorelai and Rory in particular were witty and intelligent talkers, although a little talkative. After watching it for a while, however, my opinion has changed. <br /> <br /> The main characters gradually became selfish and selfish narcissists, who treated their pride as one of the most serious insults in their lives. existence. For example, Rory did not talk to her mother for months when Lorelai did not consult her on her impulsive marriage, while Lorelai dismissed Luke for simply wanting some time to adjust to his new conditions. of life. These people are superficial, see themselves as the center of the universe where all others must behave exactly according to their rigid rules, and if they do not, they will keep grudges against them for an eternity. They do not want to see the problems of others and consider the smallest crime as the most serious offense. Most characters seem to lack the ability to behave in an adult way. They think they should do whatever they want and that everyone else is damned. <br /> <br /> The series is based on characters. So, when the main characters became so unkind, the show also became impossible to watch. I have the rest of the series left, but I doubt I'll ever see them one day. I also want to keep those who have the most suspicion for the series and its terrible characters - they must be as horrible as Lorelai et al.
