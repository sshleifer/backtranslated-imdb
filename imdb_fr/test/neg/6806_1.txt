In order to take advantage of 'Fur - An Imaginary Portrait of Diane Arbus', Stephen Shainberg needs the viewer to suspend all reality and prior knowledge of the American photographer Diane Arbus. Paradoxically, it is the very use of Diane Arbus' name and knowledge in her life and work that makes this film fail on a large scale. <br /> <br /> What appears early enough with the cast of the film The Beautiful WASPish and the glamorous Nicole Kidman in the role of Diane Arbus, a Jewish anti-glamor, is that Shainberg did not have Arbus or her work (her realism devoid of sensations) and that she seems attracted to Arbus only through her photographs of circus freaks. <br /> <br /> The following is a fantastic biopic of Beauty & the Beast with Robert Downey JR as a hairy interest for Kidman's fictional love. However, it is not the banality of the story that is the main drawback of this film, but the misogynistic position of the director that Diane Arbus, one of the most unique and original photographers of the art world, was unable to get a clear idea of ​​his work. While her previous film "Secretary" was a study of female masochism, her continued portrayal of the woman as submissive completely spoils her - and goes against the courage, tenacity and fearlessness of Diane Arbus to the only exploration of the world. <br /> <br /> Imagine an imaginary biopic about the life of pop star Madonna, with Guy Richie as Svengali, the man of her career, and you'll get an idea of ​​gravity and fantasy of this film. movie is: This can only work if you have absolutely no knowledge of the subject, or if you simply choose to ignore all the facts. <br /> <br /> It's a shame because once you remove any reference to Diane Arbus, this film could have constituted alone an interesting study on fetishism and a good companion article for Secretary. 4/10
