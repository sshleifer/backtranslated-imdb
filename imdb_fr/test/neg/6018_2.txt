The mockumentaries proliferate so much that the approach therefore needs an injection of fresh and creative material each time it is used to maintain its vitality. This film delivers nothing but worn stories of similar stories, a lensless scenario, weak ad-libs, uninspired acting and unscrupulous humor. <br /> <br /> The premise seems quite promising; The legend of the Loch Ness monster is tailor-made for one of those mocking misadventures, with a vast array of history and legends waiting to be exploited for a scandalous satire. The filmmakers, however, totally ruin this enormous potential. We get a fool who inserts a false Nessie into the water. Gee, it's original. Another scene has a heinous idiot threatening another obnoxious fool with a gun. Sidesplitting. Some free photos of a pretty girl in a bikini. Annette did it 40 years ago (and much better, by the way). Throughout the movie, someone always seems to be shouting: I guess this is designed to wake up the audience who has fallen asleep. <br /> <br /> The worst of all, however, is the relentless salvo of this reality display the type of "interview comments" made by the characters. Not only do they assail you with this tired joke every five seconds, but apparently, the actors have also improvised; this is the only explanation for the degree of humor of the jokes. If phrases such as "I have never seen anyone write a book about untrue evidence" were actually scripted, the writer should be filmed on demand and sent to Nessie. <br /> <br /> No wonder Nessie has become violent; he obviously saw this movie.
