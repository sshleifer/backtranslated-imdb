Me too, I'm a House Party fan ... House Party I is my favorite movie of all time. House Party 4 is a shame for all HP and Kid n Play ... it was supposed to be part of a series really..there was nothing about kid n play in this movie nor any of the other veterans .. yes kid n play was probably too old to start a House Party movie, his genre being teen-oriented..but kid could not have made an appearance at least ... you can tell how good it was b / c it was not even done in movie theaters. Immature was at House Party 3, so it made sense that they keep the legacy ... but they should have represented well ... they should have left it at House Party 3. I'm 27 and I watched House Party I since I was 11 when he was released in 1990 (16 years ago) and I have been a fan ever since. When I saw House Party 4 for the first time, I wondered what they really thought ... This movie had nothing familiar that could compare to the previous 3 films ... I thought it was a black day at Ferris Bueller.
