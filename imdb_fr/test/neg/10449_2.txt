The plot of this film revolves around this submarine builder who is a true bastard and he wants to launch his new submarine capable of traveling thousands of meters deep. unfortunately, he can not. oh yes, and he is haunted by memories of his mother and father being eaten by a megalodon as a child. the guy meets a pretty hot scientist, and they and that crew of a hundred people head for the main character's submarine to kill the same megalodon that killed his parents. Now the shark in this movie is really a fake CGI shark. Basically, it's a bit like Shark Attack 3, except it's more depressing. if you do not understand what I mean, listen. the opening credits of the film show the main character's "home movies" when he was a child with his parents before they were killed, and a really sad and depressing piano music plays in the background . you would expect to see a shark or something, and you see. a brief shadow of the CGI shark floats every few seconds, but that's it. moreover, I do not remember at all of a cheerful facial expression for the duration of the film, a majority of the film takes place in the dark depths of the abyss, where the story becomes even duller and all the characters (the shark too) die at the end. I thought that Sabato would succeed in killing the shark and saving his skin, but no, they all die, and the film ends with the shark all exploded, and the submarine (with Sabato's crushed and burned body) to sink into the abyss. If you are a happy person and do not like being depressed, then avoid this movie. if you are on the contrary, then congratulations, you have found your film.
