The mod team starts "after" the formation of the "Mod Squad" without even bothering to develop any of the characters or showing us why anyone is doing what they are doing. <br /> <br /> the events in the film seem incidental to the plot. Without even the slightest character development, the plot winds from scenes of Generation X clubs to action and return scenes. <br /> <br />
