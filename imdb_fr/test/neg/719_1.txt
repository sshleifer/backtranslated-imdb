I have read all of Shakespeare's plays, seen productions from the majority of them, and have even performed in some of these works. I do not necessarily think that Shakespeare should be done in a "traditional" way, but I hated this movie. <br /> <br /> There is nudity that is free and useless. There is a grotesque that goes far beyond what Shakespeare intended to do. Some dialogues are incomprehensible, and some elements, such as singing and dancing, add no meaning to the film, but replace Shakespeare with the indulgences of the director. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry to say I wasted money buying the DVD of this movie.
