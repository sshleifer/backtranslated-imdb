Opening with sequences of "Kit for Cat" blatantly and reused, "S.O.S" Tweety fails to live up to this classic drawing. Instead, we get an example of Friz Freleng's Tweety and Sylvester series in its most generic form. Unlike Chuck Jones' Road Runner series, which was striving to introduce new jokes in the same set, the Freleng series seemed happy enough to be recycled as long as the characters were in a different place. "S.O.S" from Tweety, then, roughly equals "this time, let's put them on a boat". This is not an entirely weak drawing. There are some good jokes, mainly involving Granny's glasses, but they are compensated by gags that you can see arriving at one kilometer (the seasickness routine) and everything ends at another of those endings where someone one other than Tweety says Taw a putty tat ", a joke that worked well once, but has diminishing returns. 'Tweety's SOS' will probably appeal to kids who love almost all cartoons, but for big kids like I who seek more than the same tired gags, it is absolutely necessary to avoid it.
