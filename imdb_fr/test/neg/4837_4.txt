And also a wonderful start, a real fast start. You keep the desire and the wait is about to come. Unfortunately, the high adrenaline dry up quickly, but it is clear that after half of the film is over. <br /> <br /> And it's a shame, because this film has very good ideas and explores a lot. But it's also one of his faults. By exploring too many things, you mix them up so that you are too confused to follow a plot or characters. It's very dark and moody, but it does not help much, if it's also like jumping just to try to fit everything and everything in its history!
