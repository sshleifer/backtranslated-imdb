It's the worst war movie I've ever seen, maybe the worst ever. I find it incredible that some people have evaluated it to 10. It is sorely lacking rudimentary traces of realism. Almost all the clich√©s of war movies appear in this film and are poorly made. On the other hand, I would not have watched it to the end if it had not been so remarkably bad that it had amused me.
