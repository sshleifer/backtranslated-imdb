again this kind of trash digital-budget budget cam zero. and again I fell into this trap because the title had "zombie" in it (German title: ZOMBIE ATTACK!) the story: on Halloween some people visit the "museum of the dead", it's a trap, a mad doctor wants to kill people, all that is related to an Aztec worship. so they fight against zombies. <br /> <br /> Ultra cheap landscape: some corridors covered with black ribbon. some dilettantish drawings and some skulls that you can find in all the fun shops. no actors, just low-end models waking up with no idea of ​​what to do. no effect. laughable make-up, your local makeup, zombie and zombie fan will do it better, one day it seemed like they did not have enough money for enough colors, otherwise they just could not do it. so, to achieve the looks of their "zombies". Laughing martial arts fight with zombies, in slow motion. Just when the director wants to scare, he uses a standard effect of digital camcorder where everything is scary. unbelievable! 0 out of 10!
