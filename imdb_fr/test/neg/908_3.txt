The film uses motifs that could be plagiarized from "Wait Until Dark" (1967), a much better Terence Young film starring Audrey Hepburn. "Dead Silent" is a pale paraphrase. There is nothing new here - the object hidden in the doll, the bad guys who want it, the villain posing as a good guy. The disability has changed however: Audrey Hepburn could not see, the child with DS could not speak. But both stories are based on disability. Where "Waiting for the night" has created an unbearable suspense, "Dead Silent" lets you guess the result, history being such a stereotype.
