It is sometimes fun to watch movies implode from your couch, but other times it's horribly painful for your eyes and your mind. The House Party 4: at the last minute is one of those rare instances where your eyes and your mind beg you to turn off the movie. This last installment of the House Party series is by far the worst, not just the sequel, but the movie released by Hollywood. From the beginning of this "feature film", it is very clear that director Chris Stokes loved Ferris Bueller's Day Off. I say this because it is clear that Stokes had no trouble removing Bueller's originality from John Hughes and choosing to create a totally humorous film. One would think that by "stealing" themes and images from a funniest movie, your own movie would at least be able to generate a giggle or two. With House Party 4, Stokes proved he did not have what it took to make a sequel, let alone a Hollywood movie. Since his confusing and unstable story, his inability to make sense of his characters and his moments of recycled old / tired clich√©s, all that Stokes does is tap harder into the coffin that contains the House Party movies. It reminds me of this student who forgets his project in an hour and quickly slides glue, macaroni, cat hair, chewing gum and straws and presents it as "Hannibal crossing the Alps". It looks horrible and you feel embarrassed for the creator. <br /> <br /> So where did this movie begin to plunge into the world of comic stupidity? Honestly, I do not think most places will allow me to talk so long, so I would like to touch on some of the larger issues that struck me the most. For starters, I still can not shake Ferris Beuller's scam. It was as if director Stokes was ashamed of having to lead another House Party sequel and decided to use a completely random formula (from a funniest movie) and see if he could cut and paste elements of the original series into this formula. It was a huge mistake. When a director tries to do it, he ends up creating confusion in the audience. We think we are going in one direction, but rather in another. That's exactly what you can see in the party in House 4. In one case, John-John is trying to have the "biggest part of the decade" while trying to win a record deal (ok, that's me a bit reminiscent of the original home party)), but then we head to that random island where Uncle Charles is afraid of flying, his grandmother gets drunk and some stupid moments with a supposed killer. Once again, we start a little hard and finish chaotic. This is the confusion in which I speak. Director Stokes did not have the ability to keep his hand on the pulse of humor or the ability to tell a sequential story. He prefers to cut corners, keep jokes cheap and think that the public is an idiot rather than trying to revive a dead series. One would think that when a director is given the task of filming another film of the party, he thinks that it is him who will live again or revive him, but Stokes simply wanted to be paid. <I realize that I am slowly getting older as the days go by, but I believe that I always keep my hand in the culture of the younger generation. I listened to rap and R & B as I grew up, but the band "Immature" never went to my cassette deck or my CD player. Why? I do not think they've ever had an audience, but apparently for director Chris Stokes, it would be beneficial to include them in the lead role in his new movie House Party. Did not someone in a studio realize that it was going to be in the red pretty quickly? Or how about the option of Stokes playing the comic car repairer, nothing like a director without any sense of comic timing presenting himself as the only source of humor possible. This is one of the rare cases where I missed Robin Harris, and I never thought I'd end up saying that to a movie. Outside of a go-anywhere band playing the lead role, I also thought that the rest of the cast just continued to suck the life of this movie. Uncle Charles was annoying when he tried humor. Kim Whitely was completely lost for her scenes (literally and figuratively) during ?? well ?? everyone falls into this category. <br /> <br /> Where did Chris Stokes spend most of the budget on this movie? Not for the special stars, because if this film boasted some, there was none at the House Party's "unforgettable party," nor the possible dream of Kid or Play making a final appearance. House Party 4 did not follow a predefined design, which ultimately ruined this feature since its founding. Can anyone explain to me why it was necessary to use the routine of the "escaped murderer who happened to be a taxi driver licensed" for humor? Stokes reached the bottom of the barrel and produced only mud instead of substance. For once, I can admit that this film has no reductive value. House Party 4 has buried the series and, although I hear there may be others, I only hope Hollywood will realize that this series is dead. Hollywood must let this series end, forget about the past and move forward in the future. I think a sequel to who is the man? would start in the right direction. <br /> <br /> Grade: * on *****
