I still remember the first broadcast of Frog Baseball on MTV. Strangely and surreally, the cartoon captured the stupid actions that all the boys growing up in America were doing. I'm now complaining about how I burned a crippled grasshopper with a magnifying glass, but it was interesting at the time for some reason. Growing up in the 1980s, we all knew "stoners". They were children who wore Iron Maiden T-shirts at school, had long hair, an immature mustache and were at least two inches taller than everyone else, because they had missed a year or two. We made fun of them because they were so stupid even when they were not stoned. It was easy to understand Beavis & Co because we already knew them, some of us were. Since GenXers like me rejected the excess of the 1980s and embraced the grunge movement of the 1990s, Beavis & Co was a strange postmodern hymn for us. Strange because, like Beavis & Co, we did not care if we had a hymn. It was just a joke inside that we all immediately had it even though it was awful.
