This production of a four-hour miniseries is about two hours longer than necessary, mainly because the filmmakers did not seem to have a clear idea of ​​how to adapt a novel to the screen. They seemed not to know what to keep and what could be left out. The film begins with Sir Walter reading in the peerage book which is his main consolation in his troubles. It introduces the family - which we all know intimately over the next four hours anyway - but is useless. In the same way, the scenes where the Musgroves lament against "poor Richard" do not serve to abandon the story. Part of Austen's actual dialogue is attributed to different characters and part of his story is recycled into a dialogue that falls awkwardly from the characters' languages. There is also a fill dialog, and it is quite awful. The scene in which Charles Hayter bores Henrietta with his worries about obtaining the title of Dr. Shirley was hardly interesting as a narrative in the book; as a scene in this production, she is staggering. The scene on the Cobb, when Louisa falls and is "taken without life!", Is totally without urgency, and I wondered if Wentworth's phrase "Is there anyone to help me?" could have been directed at screenwriters, as well as other actors. <br /> <br /> This production often looks like a piece that has been filmed, rather than a film, and that is what stands out the most play, which is the opposite of the subtle: diffusion of lines in booming, exaggerated gestures and actors who do not know what to do with their hands, feet or face when they do not say their lines. Charles Musgrove stands in his living room, his feet shoulder-width apart, and seems to stand out on the balcony (if there was one) when he was talking to the other people in the room. The face of Louisa Musgrove, when he does not actively simulate or laugh, seems to be in a confused rest. Louisa is a tired, enervated creature, and I did not think for a moment that Wentworth would be interested in her. <br /> <br /> The costumes are mixed, but mostly horrible, and Anne Elliot's green tartan dress is most likely the ugliest costume of the presumed era ever crafted. We are given the dates at the beginning of the show - it is the late 1790s or perhaps the early 1800s - and yet many costumes appear to be Victorian style, so about 60 years too early! The hair is so fake that I will not even talk about it here. Except to say that I will not mention it. :-) <br /> <br /> This production does some things correctly, however. Mrs. Smith is given all her importance, and her story with Mr. Elliot, his dissipation and his intrigues are fully addressed. I was also happy to see the scenes of "reconciliation" fleshed out with Anne and Frederick at the end, a valuable reward for the reader but which were hidden in the 1995 production. <br /> <br /> If you like the book La persuasion, and even vaguely like the 1995 film, do not waste an instant (or a penny) on this production; you will find it cruelly insufficient.
