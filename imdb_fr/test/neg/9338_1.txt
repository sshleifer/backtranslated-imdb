In short, this film was awful. <br /> <br /> I understand that this is a Disney movie, which are usually shallow movies with mediocre intrigues and bad behavior. HOWEVER, I must say that this is the worst of all Disney movies, with bad action, LOTS OF IRRITANT CHILD GIRLS (my god) and an extremely unrealistic plot. Even at 12, there is no way I would have liked this movie. The only way this movie could have been worse is to try to put it in the theater or sell it in a local video store. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and change channels before watching this show, no matter how boring you are on a Sunday afternoon.
