Flatland is one of my favorite books, so I was looking forward to seeing this movie. Unfortunately, the movie is absolutely horrible. The dialogue is so bad that it sounds like an improvisation half the time. The new story makes me think that they took the book and some newspapers, threw them in a blender and used what was out for the screenplay. It's a shame for the book and the making of independent films. The only reason I even managed to complete the film was my hope that it will improve. Unfortunately, the situation got worse, culminating in a really late end. <br /> <br /> That does not mean that everything on the film is bad. The CG is acceptable, in a "Reboot" of the 1990s, I guess that's what they were looking for. And I guess you can not go wrong by saying that "people" are cut in half and shed blood everywhere.
