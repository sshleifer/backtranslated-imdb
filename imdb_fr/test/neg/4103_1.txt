My friend recommended this movie. I should have known he would not watch it because my friend is a bit of a video game nerd. But the name and cover looked good for some reason. I was so wrong. I mean, first of all, what about their costumes? And the acting game! Looks like they kidnapped Barney's people. Except for Ben Kingsley. And why was he even in this movie? Did he think it was a comedy! But I must say that the special effects were pretty good. But it was like the only good thing to do. I mean seriously, the movie is worse than Pearl Harbor. And that's actually a euphemism. Everyone had to say "oh, I'll get paid, so it does not matter if it's the worst movie in the world". I would understand why someone would do this kind of film if they realized, directed, produced, wrote and made sure that their best friend in desperate life turned and climbed. Probably one of the worst sci-fi movies of all time. A really inflated movie
