It's a horror movie in numbers featuring Richard Crenna and Joanna Pettet as a pair of psychologists who buy an old mansion and invite a small team of friends and patients to help clean up the place. Unbeknownst to them, the mansion houses a cellar door - the door of hell. If you fancy a cliche horror movie, look no further, but if you want something inventive, then this little movie will not attract you. <br /> <br /> VIOLENCE: $$$ (rather submissive, although the scene where a guy cuts his hand with a saw - a rather macabre spirit) Fans of inventive death scenes will not like that, all the characters seem to be electrocuted in a certain way). <br /> <br /> NUDITY: $ (Nothing to say, Mary Louise Weller adds good looks but her character was underdeveloped). <br /> <br /> HISTORY: $$ (Clich√©, but worthy of being seen, but it does not offer anything new to the genre but Victor Buono's cast - which is as threatening as a Santa store - seems to have attracted a few spectators.) <br /> <br /> ACTING: $$ (The best performances are by Crenna and Pettet with the other actors just "calling" their roles.) The screenwriter does not develop any characters apart from the character of Pettet and seems to have forgotten Mary Louise Weller (Animal House) which disappears for about twenty minutes and only resurfaces to be electrocuted like everyone in a boring way).
