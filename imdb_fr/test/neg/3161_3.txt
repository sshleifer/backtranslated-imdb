It is a film with a lot of potential, well made and played, with a rather weekly and incoherent scenario. A young woman with two children moves to her mother's cramped apartment, because the husband, above the workshop where he cuts up stolen cars, aggravates their son's asthma. Husband ends up in jail when the stolen car of an ex-pat is found in his shop. ex pat ends up being kind, generous and naive shmoe (and rather cardboard and we learn almost nothing from him), but ends up with the girl who "swaps" although she is sexually satisfied only by her husband. I expect the film to be a success in Czech, where it will be welcome because of its obvious principle: "They can have money, they can even have our wives, but they are old, sweet and our women want to be satisfied, we may be poor, but ... Now, if only Evzen could keep Marcela satisfied so that she did not have to play with herself, or if he already had a family existing in Italy ... but that would complicate things.
