This is perhaps the worst of the cockney gangster genre that has ruined the UK film industry since Mockney Guy Ritchie released Lock's stock and two barrels of battering. This "True Life" story from Carlton Leach (who?) To all that is wrong in this genre, a really ugly scenario that consists of screams of "Cant", "Fahcking Cant" and "I'm going to kill you, I I'm not going to kill you "" ad nauseum. "The acting is evenly appalling, with the two most recognizable members of the cast being two former soap stars, very visibly out of their depth. we've heard about these people and I can assure you that anyone north of Essex does not have any, and we should be interested in a low-life story Why is it not Goodfellas despite the text Presentation on the cover of the DVD The story is centered on a thug who has turned into gangster bunker and whose friends end up being shot.Boho hoo.The fact that these people are totally unfriendly is the only minor benefit of this movie. In all the action scenes, it seems like the camera is tied to a string and is spinning around while people claim to be fighting and the story of someone that most people have never heard of and nothing really interesting does not happen too, it's a total waste of time. People tell how violent the film is as if it were the sign of a great movie, and although many of the big movies contain violence, it's just an excuse for the man special effects can show what he can do. Overall, this film recalls why the British film industry is gone. The sooner we stop funding these pathetic abortions, the better.
