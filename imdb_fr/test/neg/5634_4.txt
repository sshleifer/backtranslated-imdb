What a pity that good talent has been wasted. It's a tedious and self-conscious film that could tell its story in half the time. Does Derek Jacobi under this beard play two roles? Gosh, who would have guessed it. <br /> <br /> The emotional gain at the end was weak and unsatisfactory. Certainly do not bother to support the padded length of the film for. I felt very disappointed. <br /> <br /> The sound was awful. First, they used stock music. Second, the dialogue was so loud that the words were hard to understand. Only three sound teams and one trainee? There were more people listed in accounting credits or lawyers. <br /> <br /> Part of the camera work was pretty good though, and the actors did a good job with a mediocre scenario. <br /> <br /> Not a good use of listening time, at least for me.
