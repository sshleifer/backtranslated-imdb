I have never seen this film alone, but like many others who have already commented on it, I saw it as an episode of MST3K. Really terrible television schlock from the 70's. But someone saw its potential as it has just been turned into a $ 125 million flop called The Island. <br /> <br /> And to the person who asked if there was ANY good film made in the 70s, I want to remind him that it was a golden age for the American film with directors like Robert Altman and Martin Scorcese who started playing key roles. Not to mention little things like Star Wars (1977). Just a reminder that the 70s were far more creative than the 21st century has been so far.
