I saw this film yesterday on television. I had just finished reading the book in which the film was supposed to be based. In the opening credits, it is written "It is a free adaptation of the novel of Eça de Queirós". I should have turned off my TV at that time. <br /> <br /> Vera Sacramento's idea of ​​"free adaptation" is transforming a story about the Church's influence on people and the hypocrisy of people who claim morality the late nineteenth century in a sex story. In fact, the only thing she adopted in the novel is the sexual part, which was only moderately mentioned in the novel by Eça de Queirós. And of course, the name of some characters. <br /> <br /> Among the characters, in the novel, Amelia and João Eduardo were victims of the influence of the church. Amelia was seduced by Father Amaro and controlled by him all the time. João Eduardo, his fiancé, was excommungated by the priests, because he dared to criticize them. In this film, Amélia seduces everyone she meets and Father Amaro is just another victim. João Eduardo is a reseller of drugs and illegal weapons. <br /> <br /> Vera Sacramento transformed a novel that criticized the moral costumes of an era and turned it into another movie with a lot of (bad) sex. Even worse, his story was completely empty of ideas. Two hours lost! Eça de Queirós certainly did not deserve that.
