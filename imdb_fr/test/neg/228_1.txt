The first few minutes showing the cold and crispness of Willis's character were quite nice, especially with Jean Smart, but he really jumped afterwards. It's just an important man and an irritating little boy, without any innovation. I know the cast probably picked this child to show that Willis was just as irritating, but I found this child particularly irritating and whiny.
