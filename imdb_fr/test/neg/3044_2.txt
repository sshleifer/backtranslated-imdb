That's about all I can say about this flat and uninspired remake of the car Carol Kane of 1979. Camilla Belle is not really an actress and she brings neither energy nor vitality to the role of Jill Johnson, the babysitter harassed by an anonymous caller. <br /> <br /> But if you're looking for good ideas for interior design and interior design, this movie provides more inspiration than anything you'll see on TLC or HGTV. Jill spends nearly 90 minutes wandering around the house of the wealthy doctor and his wife for whom she provides day care, looking for the origins of strange sounds and things that "move" at night. As she walks around the corners and through the corridors, we discover a beautiful master bathroom with washbasins of hers and hers that look like Roman bathtubs, a huge kitchen with incredible glass shelves lit up to the ceiling. back and the resistance room, an independent aviary. and coy pond who has a self-watering system. <br /> <br /> Since the film is not convincing enough to drag us into Jill's fear, we are distracted by the grandeur of the house, which you should not do when you watch a thriller. Even if Jill is pursued by the faceless maniac, we get tangled up because she breaks valuables and ruins the pond of coy, not because she is about to be murdered. <br /> <br /> The film advances as easily as most teen movies, and the end is anything but original. In the end, I just wanted to know where this house was and if it was real. Never mind, Jill and the kids, she was babysitting. <br /> <br /> 2 stars - both for the house.
