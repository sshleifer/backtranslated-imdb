I must admit that among the many thriller movies I've seen, it must be one of the worst. I was shocked to discover that this work had a budget of 1.5 mil. When it started, I thought the opening sequence was pretty good, pretty standard for that kind of movie, but pretty good anyway. But as the film progressed, I began to feel clearly uncomfortable with the lack of rhythm I saw. Each sequence seemed to take hours. The reason may be due to the fact that the film already bored me to tears; only endless accusations with flashbacks and occasional temper tantrums. Well ... after going through what seemed like a whole life of these scenes, we finally reached the grand finale ... a demonstration while singing and dancing showing how much the lack of imagination can completely ruin what could have been a good movie. <Br/> <br /> Overall, I found this movie predictable and tedious and I would not recommend it to those I do not personally like, but if you have a few hours to spare and want watch a thriller that is not even remotely scary, this is the movie for you.
