Orson Welles' documentary "F for Fake" (1974) examines deception and fraud, focusing on two men who have themselves been exposed to fraud. Clifford Irving is a biographer who wrote the allegedly fraudulent autobiography of Howard Hughes. Yet, at least, it seems, he claims his innocence. The other main subject of the film is the artist Elmyr de Hory, a man who has spent his entire life painting fake masterpieces, which he sometimes sold to museums as true works of original artists. Among these stories, Welles does magic tricks to illustrate points, etc., and also points out that his career began as a fraud when he first lied on his resume and then caused a sensation with "War of the Worlds "". <br /> <br /> I really wanted to love this film and find it deep since I was a devout devotee of Welles, but I could not bring myself to do it. the fact that it was not only non-linear, but completely dispersed, and although I enjoy elegant editing and fast jumps and zooms, especially when used in an unusual format such as a documentary, there is just had too much of it in "F for Fake." They created a distraction as opposed to the lending style, so if the story had been clearer and complete, I think the writing would probably not have been so annoying. scattered story was of autan It was more odious that these were really interesting topics, especially Elmyr de Hory. His artistic falsity addresses the subject of fraud in the art world and can truly determine the authenticity of certain works. and if the works are not authentic, what does he say about those who admire works in museums? It's a documentary I would say at least to give a shot, but do not be afraid to turn it off if you do not like it. It's certainly the most disconcerting documentary I've ever seen; it is a cross between a documentary, an art film and an experimental film, none of which is correctly represented or isolated. I do not have a lesser opinion of Welles after seeing her, but this is certainly not, in my opinion, a vivid picture of her work. 4/10 - Honey
