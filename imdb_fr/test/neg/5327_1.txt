I thought I had already seen this movie because the plot summary seemed familiar to me. However, when I watched it one afternoon (needing some stupid but fun entertainment), I did not recognize anything - if I had seen it before, I should have hidden the horror of my memory. <Br /> <br /> This movie is terrible and shows its age. In fact, it looks older than that: it looks more like a silly comedy from the mid 80's. Although I'm a fan of toilet humor and can see the fun side of a lot of things, it's "comedy" at its most childish and homophobic. The plot is as fine as a model, which would not bother me if only the film was funny. <br /> <br /> There's only one funny line in the whole film, said by Louis' character: "It looks like someone has thrown a very good white boy!" In fact, Louis is the only nice character (and it does not say much). James and Carl are the type of immature and immature immature men that a sensible woman could run for miles, their jokes as humorous as the war in Iraq; the character of Susan Wilkins is colorless (looks like Julia Roberts, but she misses her charisma) and there is no chemistry between her and Carl - although it may be unfair to blame the actress because I do not know what she could have done with a party so badly written; and the wicked is neither funny nor frightening nor memorable. <br /> <br /> There is good waste and bad waste. These are wastes that certainly should not be recycled.
