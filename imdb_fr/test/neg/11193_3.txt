Start by separating the story from the movie. The story of a second war going on in the sky is good, very good. Religious-themed movies are not the main choice for many people, but the angels at war are. I really loved the story and some of the pictures provided to save it, like the field of angels on peaks ... awesome pictures. The film itself was simply mediocre, I can not find any reason for the main character - the cop priest being there. The main woman too ... no reason to be there, the dialogue of the main characters was just empty, he had no substance, the story could have been told without them. Now, Walken, Stoltz and Mortensen have had some outstanding performances, although their scenes are mostly lifeless leads. <br /> <br /> Another thing I do not shoot from this movie is why it is featured Native American rituals to purge the dark soul. The child who wears it is clearly Native American but, apart from the final scenario, nothing here links to this heritage. The plot about the black soul itself was barely told, which is strange considering the fact that the black soul is the driving force of the whole movie. The story of its original owner (the colonel) is briefly touched, but not enough to understand why it is his soul that is the special. <br /> <br /> I do not find any justification for scrolling landscapes. in this film, several of the plains surrounding the "chimney rock". I feel they had a helicopter and they wanted to make the most of it, because none of the shots are relevant and they are not in tune with the mood -> Horror. The film falls more in the category of sci-fi than horror. There were no scenes of shock or scaring, a little blood and blood but no element of fear. <br /> <br /> So, aside from 3 roles played, this movie is a big old guy. Unfortunately, the failed factor outweighs the good actor factor, just too many actors of the weekend.
