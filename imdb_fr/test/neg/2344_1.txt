I watched this movie on Telly the other night and I did not know how it would be a grimace ... I knew it would be stupid, but not so bad! This film illustrates all that is awful in Australian comedy. Aside from the most boring and uninspired scenarios and characters I've ever encountered (aside from those dubious comedies produced by US filmmakers in the US!), Most situations were boring, unbelievable, stereotypical and SO funny ... funny! <br /> <br /> One of the scenarios that really bothered me was the nerds of the bus scene. From the point of view of scriptwriting, the writers used the most uninteresting scenario - not to mention the unbelievable - to get these three people without their luggage ... They are on vacation with their lives and they go all risk (including $ 300 deposit, baggage and room) to exercise their rights to dance in a bus? I mean, they are about a half hour from their destination! At least, they could have started the driver on the bus, but no, they leave willingly because they can not stand it anymore! And ruin their vacation ... Anyway, I can not believe the writers did not do it. terrible scenario. I think a 10-year-old could come up with 5 smarter, fun and believable configurations. <br /> <br /> I can go on with a lot of other people - the stereotypical psychopath really unimaginative, the whole relationship with the wrath angry girlfriend and tag virgin, the 'Wow Man! There, the inhalation of things goth girl on the train - EVERYTHING was sad! I can not think of a redemptive feature of the movie except maybe the nerd of the third wheel was pretty cute. Spoiled his career by appearing in this trash!
