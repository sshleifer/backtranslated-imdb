Everyone has their choice for "the worst film they have ever seen". Some like to choose Gigli or Battlefield Earth. Some choose classics like Plan 9 From Outer Space. Since I was 14 years old, I say very clearly that it's Problem 2, and nine years later, I feel exactly the same. It's not "one of the worst", it's not just an expression. This is THE worst movie I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> How much to fart, poop, piss and vomit can you put in a single movie? I do not need to see a dog take a dump that goes up to my size! Why am I so hard on this filth? I have nothing against the bathroom or rude humor. Heck, I like American Pie movies. Having such an excess in less than 90 minutes is a bad idea, but the real problem is to do it with children! Having young children called sex names (IMDb will not let me even write that word here, but here it comes out of the mouth of 8. Think about the irony of the thing!) And urinate and vomit on it another fact that everything feels dirtier. Worst line in the movie: "I guess I should fart in the offices of more people." <br /> <br /> What other movie does he have: urinating in lemonade, sticks of dynamite blowing the toilet, a little boy filming his babysitter throwing it on the side of the house, and a little girl who jokes to scratch the testicles? <br /> <br /> However, my absolute favorite moment must be the moment when the same little girl participates in a carnival: "I'm gonna throw up", opens her mouth and false shoots looking for vomiting her mouth open in a perfect 90 degree angle! The vomiting scene in Scary Movie 2 seemed more real than that. <br /> <br /> I guess the only redeeming element of the film is Gilbert Gottfried. You get the impression that he does not even have a script, but he's just getting started. Too bad he has to act stupid while the pizza is launched. <br /> <br /> You know what? Thinking about the movie, it forces me a lot to go to the bathroom. Goodbye!
