There is nothing new in this film. Nothing you've thought of before, nothing you've heard before. The story of a homosexual brutally murdered in a small town and the reaction of the people can be approached in many ways. This film has chosen the most demagogic and melting. One of the biggest drawbacks of this film is that it is neither a film nor a documentary. The director used the transcripts of the original interviews and made the actors play them as if they were a film. The result is weird. And finally, I read in previous comments that people who do not like this movie are anti-gay. I am pretty sure that these comments come from people who consider themselves tolerant but do not tolerate that other people do not like this movie. It's a funny world.
