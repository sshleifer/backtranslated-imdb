A group of people sinks deep into the jungle for various reasons and finally finds a lost city (where are apparently the Diamonds of King Solomon) and a race of super-gorillas ... Actors like Linney and Curry in a movie which features ... a talking gorilla, and that's just the beginning. Ok, what else ...? <br /> <br /> For an action / adventure movie, the movie is ... well, it just misses that. The first hour (!) Of the movie, they are not even in the jungle, they are just trying to get there, plot by plot after plot (something about a local military regime, whatever), and when they finally do it ... it's simply more fun. <br /> <br /> The effects of the film are so-and-so (and really bad compared to Jurassic Park's previous film). <br /> <br /> Now, the end .. The father does not deal with the death of his son, but is interested in diamonds? Uh-huh ... only in moviegoers, only in movies. <br /> <br /> A total waste of talent, this adaptation of Chricton (Jurassic Park, Twister, ER). 2/10.
