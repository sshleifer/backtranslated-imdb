1980 was certainly a year for bad slasher movies. "Friday the 13th" and "The Burning" were perhaps the best, but there were as always some stinks not far behind, like "Do not Go In Into The Woods Alone" and this one. But in all fairness, "The Prey" is not nearly as bad as "Do not Go In In The Woods" but it's still not great either. One thing is that it's boring and that playing is not very good but much better than "DGITW" and that this movie actually makes women very attractive to watch, the three main roles of women were stunning. The only thing wrong with all these useless movies about wildlife, it seemed completely useless and it seems that the director used it to use this video to fill a space-time. <br /> <br /> this movie? Well, there were a few moments of cheese laughing - I could not contain a fit of laughter when the last girl made a strange type of lunar backtrack to get away from the kille and there was some good killing scenes - my favorites being the girl suffocated to death with the sleeping bag; and the fake looking. <br /> <br /> Overall, The Prey is stupid, boring and the killer I did not find scary at all, this movie could have been much better.
