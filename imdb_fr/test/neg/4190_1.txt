This film was so bad that I do not know where to start, apparently, the filmmakers either. It starts with a guy in his thirties in his late forties watching television. The news is about an open corn maze for Halloween. He has a "vision" of God knows what and rushes to save his children who walk in a labyrinth of cornfields and who are somehow related to this "vision". How do you ask? I do not know, and as I said before, filmmakers either. These are just visions of people's feet. How did he get these "visions"? This has never been explained, we are simply supposed to accept. He enters the labyrinth to find his two daughters who are lost inside. Twice, the girls he is looking for are walking right past him, once they meet him by chance. What is he doing? Does he pursue them? No. He stands there like an idiot who calls for them when they have passed by. Do the girls stop? No, they run away, then ask, "It was this daddy?" Then someone dressed as a demon jumps on "the star" (daddy's character), he beats him in a pathetic fight to discover that he is a haunted labyrinth worker. The police are called and after finding the "star" (which is a really bad term), they handcuff him. They handcuff his hands so he can find a way to lock the lock, which he does. First, anyone who has ever been arrested knows that the cops are handcuffing your hands behind your back, and second, why does this "average guy" seem to know how to get handcuffed? Well, he ends up getting away from the cops who give up and leave after the star's wife unleashes the mermaid in the police car as a distraction. By the way, it is now dark and all the workers who manage the labyrinth seem to be gone once the sun has set. Leaving a man who attacked one of their workers and two missing children in the labyrinth. Considering it was a slow night that they are their only customers, why not. In addition, the cops seem to have better things to do. By the way, the "star" named "Walker", we discover that this is his last name, a name under which his wife even calls him. One way or another, he knows there is something hidden in the maze of maize fields and begins to dig. I say "one way or another" because I did not understand why he had started digging. He finds a medallion, what does it mean? Nothing to those who look at it, but for him, it's a kind of clue to a crime. Someone killed their children in his "vision" and I guess that's what he does, real detective work. And now, he knows there's a killer in the maze labyrinth, which he knew he had been around since the beginning of the movie. That's why he's looking for his daughters. Whenever we see the killer, or rather his feet, we hear a strange robotic sound, like a sci-fi rejection toy that changes a person's voice into his mechanics. Why do we hear this sound? Is it related to ... something? Once again, who knows? Certainly not the filmmakers. The height of all the bad things and bad dialogues was when "Walker" shouted "Hey you, Mr. Bad Man ... I'll get you." Another time, his wife is attacked by the "Bad Man" at the entrance to the corn labyrinth, which, as I already mentioned, is strangely empty of any employee or policeman. The "villain" calls "Walker" on his mobile phone to tell him that he plans to kill his wife, his children, and he too. "Walker" can only respond with "Hey, HEY!" before dropping his phone and running away. Having no one on the other end to talk to, the killer drops his phone too, he drags the woman a few feet and then leaves her alone for the rest of the film, losing the first opportunity to stay true to his treats. If this script had not been written by a child, I would be surprised. Opps it was not. It was written, directed and produced by the same man. And not only that, he has also done so much shit camera work, where we have random images of feet walking in the muddy labyrinth and meaningless images of the cornfield, which are losing 90% of the movie time. In the end, "Walker" uses the cuffs to handcuff the "Bad Man", who also seems to know how to pick locks with the same metal object that "Walker" had chosen. Apparently, there are a lot of small metal objects just lying around this cornfield. But after the killer insists he's still going to kill the kids, "Walker" kills the "Bad Man", and everything's fine in the world. Now, in reality, "Walker" is a murderer, he killed a man who "supposedly" murdered his own daughters and was trying to kill him. He knows it, not because of evidence, but because of his visions. He never found a body, no one else knows that this guy was even in the labyrinth. And the medallion? He returns it to the ghosts of the two dead girls. No proof. So, he kills a man without any tangible reason. I can not imagine what filmmakers were thinking with this one. It had to be a way of concealing embezzlement for the production company. I would rather watch the Blair Witch project five times than watch this movie again. Actors should be ashamed. The director / producer / writer / cameraman should also be ashamed. In fact, the entire production company should be ashamed. If there is anyone associated with this movie, please answer. What were you thinking?
