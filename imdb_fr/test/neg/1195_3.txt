If the league had been unfamiliar with this scenario, the sponsors would simply have turned around and said, "No, you do not have money, it's awful". As a fan of the League of Gentlemen, this is their worst outing so far. Not particularly funny, not particularly fun, there are few moments of loud laughter. They exist, but they are rare. I felt that the format was tired and really trailing. The film refers to writers who miss the characters and it shows. As for being a movie. I felt that the Christmas special had a better production value; the FX are generally quite poor and it is obvious they did not film in the original Royston Vasey (they filmed it cheaply in Ireland). The score is weak and the dialogue is terrible. In addition, the accents of the characters were largely out of their televised equivalents. Tubs and Edward, still very underused, just did not sound like them. It's really disappointing because I was hoping for something much more fun. It was really the equivalent of the League of comedies of the 1970s when actors went to Spain ...
