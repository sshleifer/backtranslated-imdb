I do not want to sound pretentious here, but to call it the next cult classic is another example of the lowering of standards that filmmakers have for themselves. This film is an offense to everything we consider sacred, not the right "artistic" way to offend. This film becomes the archetype of the PAINFUL dialogue, presented by even more pathetic actors.
