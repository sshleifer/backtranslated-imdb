This film is the last drop of a list of films I saw this week that pushed me to the edge and forced me to join IMDb and broadcast warnings to the public. It was absolutely horrible. The film was shot and painfully boring. The sound, the effects and even the picture quality seemed to come from Willow (1988) or perhaps from Conan the barbarian (1982). The battle of Bannockburn was absolutely absurd. This "greatest filmed reconstruction of the medieval battle ever organized in the British Isles" made me sneer. There was not even a consistent training at all, just a few guys with spears and horses running through them. Douglas's scenes, especially during the last battle, were simply horrible, as were most actors in the film.
