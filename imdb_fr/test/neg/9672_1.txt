Just when I thought nothing could be as offensive and / or irritating as a Billy Mays infomercial, I had the overwhelming experience of renting this trash. Peter Barnes and John Irvin should be charged with smuggling this text into a public place. Actors must be accused of complicity and serve at least one life away from the public. <br /> <br /> This production offers the warning, "For dramatic effects, we took a poetic license with certain facts", or such an inadequate statement to prepare you fully for the absolutely disgusting rewrite of a story biblical that does not require any drama. What they added was enough for your I.Q. drop three full points every five minutes of display time. <br /> <br /> The "poetic license", invents characters so weird, you will recognize only the names of some, and of course, the arque. <br /> <br /> For whatever reason, Noah and Lot both live in Sodom, so maybe Abram was on vacation in Switzerland on a ski trip. Lot's wife, played by Carol Kane, is a harpy. When she turned to a salt column, Lot broke her finger and carried it to what appeared to be a jar of empty baby food. If it's "poetic", I'm a kumquat. <br /> <br /> When Noah begins to drink wine in quantities that can help float the ark, he wakes up for the hard work of the construction project, he wakes up One morning, I discovered that God had delivered enough cut wood to lighten the load. At least I think it was God. It looked like a delivery of 84 Lumber, neatly stacked and packaged. Maybe 84 Lumber is really an agent of God ????? Rather than get bored with the cargo being loaded, I'll treat you to the story of the attack on the ark by the pirates. Incongruous, you think? This film is filled with these insulting absurdities. After an incalculable time on the water, Noah spots a pirate ship heading straight for them. And who could be the sea captain? Well, it's Lot, of course! My only surprise was that his uncle Abram was not on board. If you have to cut down a piece of land, cut it down in full. The hacking attempt was unsuccessful and the swashbuckling was pathetic and not poetic. I think it was around this mark that my nausea prevented me from punishing me more. <br /> <br /> An ugly, insane and feeble deformation of everything that resembles a biblical story by far. On a scale of 1 to 10, this film is premeditated mental abuse. Stupid and insulting, you will be more amused reading the Yellow Pages.
