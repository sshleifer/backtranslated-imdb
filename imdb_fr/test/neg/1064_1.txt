There is nothing original, human or insightful in this film. The acting is average, the images are amateur, the writing lacks subtlety and the scenes are very basic ... a bit like a soap opera. <br /> <br /> In 2:37, a suicide is used to turn the film into a suspenseful drama. We look, in part, because we want to know who is dying. The different characters each have a problem and the film shows how serious each problem is for them, but only as a way to get them to a place where you think they could kill each other. Despite the different views the camera offers on key events, there's never another way to see the events themselves. So in 2:37, the holes are holes, the angels are angels. It's simple. <br /> <br /> Without this complexity, the film appears as a voyeuristic tale about sex and violence among young people. You almost do not know the children as much as the breasts, the body and the box that the filmmaker qualifies as characterization. <br /> <br /> In the end, if you know ALL about cinema in the last 5 years, 2: 37 is just an immature elephant scam - not a meditation, not a progression. Yet, while the filmmaker and the distributor use each time the alleged suicide of a friend to give legitimacy to the film, they never speak of Gus Van Sant or Elephant. Positive publications on IMDb oddly avoid any mention of this, or simply do not value originality. If you want something of heart and voice, avoid this piece of youth exploitation. I was surprised by the age of the filmmakers when I discovered after watching this movie - I had assumed that a 13 year old had done it. The Twenty Somethings I've always known are too busy trying to express something real in them to elevate the work of an old man.
