At first glance, this movie seemed to be really good. This is not the case. <br /> <br /> The cast is pretty good, but most of them seemed embarrassed by the whole thing. The real disaster in this film is not the flood, but the script. He tries to include all the clich√©s in the book, all incredibly badly done. The end is very abrupt, but it is a blessing in disguise. Congratulations if you go there. <br /> <br /> The three main male actors (Carlyle, Courtney and Suchet) will surely agree that this is the lowest point of their career. I hope they have been paid a lot of money because none of their reputations come out tactfully. <br /> <br /> The special effects are pretty good, but the same thing was done for a much better effect in The Day After Tomorrow. <br /> <br /> In short, a useless exercise. Do not waste your time.
