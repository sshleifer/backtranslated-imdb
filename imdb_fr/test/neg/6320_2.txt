In the opening sequence of "Where's Poppa?", George Segal gets up one morning, shaves, takes a shower, puts on a gorilla costume and goes to his mother's room, we realize later, to inflict on him a massive heart attack her and take her out of life forever. This is about the level of humor that we can expect from most of this image: madness mingled with what we could take for morbid daring. <br /> <br /> Segal plays the role of a New York lawyer who lives with his so-called senile mother Ruth Gordon), whose life is even more complicated when, while hiring a nurse to care from the old bag, meets the girl of his dreams, the friendly Prim Trish Van Devere, dressed like Florence Nightingale. Her dilemma: how to integrate the charming nurse into her life and that of her pesky mother. <br /> <br /> Segal's performance is pretty much the only thing that keeps the image together. His frustrations, his reactions, his comic timing are almost incomparable (what happened to this guy?); where the film fails is in other areas. The characterization of Ruth Gordon is terrible as a mother. At first, you can not know if his character is senile or just deliberately vague to prevent his son from moving. In the end, it is clear that she is crazy to laugh. When Segal returns Van Devere home to meet him, Gordon's eyebrows are frowning and she looks mean and sinister. She wants the intruder in her son's life to be removed; she calculates. This is not the mode of a senile person. You do not get a consistent performance throughout the photo, which is probably the fault of the director (Carl Reiner) as much as that of Gordon. The old lady of Ruth Gordon in "Rosemary Baby" is much more successful because, with the kind of ungrateful and nauseating person that plays Ruth Gordon, the public answers that it is annoying. But when Mia Farrow is too shy to defend herself, Gordon becomes more disgusting, his fangs go deeper and deeper and we are afraid of Farrow; this kind of taxation is really terrifying. Here, we are asked to laugh at what we normally find boring, and if Gordon played like a completely helpless madman, we could do it. But she is selfish and nasty too, and that alleviates the lack of humor that exists. <br /> <br /> There are, however, some good laughs. An audience scene with Barnard Hughes as a military officer and Rob Reiner as a counterculture punk is quite hilarious, and Vincent Gardenia plays his role as a Lombard football coach. There is also an inspired place where Segal's brother (Ron Liebman), stripped naked by abusers on his way to Segal's home, asks him for a garment to wear at home and gives him the gorilla costume. <br /> <br /> But many scripts are poorly designed and simply do not make sense. Why does a New York lawyer with his own practice even live at home in the first place? Why does Segal, if his mother is senile, try to reason with him logically: "If you spoil that, I'll shake your heart." Why does Liebman keep going through the park if he knows he's going to get mugged? Why does he take a taxi after leaving Segal with a gorilla costume? Why did not he take a taxi from the beginning? A bit more funny would have been Liebman, as a gorilla, terrorizing the aggressors. Why does Van Devere always come back after her first husband has become crazy, why does she want to get involved in this group? I suppose if I submitted this to Carl Reiner, he would say, "They're crazy, they do not have to make sense." Which is a convenient way to excuse an ugly script that is full of holes. The characters' instant behavior does not have to make sense, but their motives are, and that's where "Where's Poppa?" collapses; situations are created just to get the gag, and the gags are mostly one-shots, they do not build anything. <br /> <br /> Carl Reiner is the most guilty of all this fiasco. How he acquired this much vaunted reputation as a pillar of comedy leaves me puzzled; Basically, his career consisted of holding a microphone in front of Sid Caesar and Mel Brooks while they were talking in a funny voice. His son Rob has ten times the skills and intelligence of a director. In terms of show-biz, Reiner presses buttons; a monkey could do his job. And this is more evident in his framing of the action. Why is all New York shot in close-up and close-up, while the scenes of the country are all distant and panoramic? This is the mentality of Carl Reiner's leadership, claustrophobic for the city, spatial for the country. In the last whimsical scene among the old, the camera is so far away that you can not even know what's going on. The abrupt end suggests a resolution to which Segal could easily have arrived ninety minutes ago; it also suggests that Reiner could not understand how to end the photo. So he just cut, like another example of "madness". Reiner seems to think that muteness is equivalent to madness, and madness without logic is always funny. This is not the case, and the creators of "Where's Poppa" are as insane as Ruth Gordon putting Pepsi in her Fruit Loops.
