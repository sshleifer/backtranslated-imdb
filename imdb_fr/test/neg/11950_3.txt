Go to the video store and get the original. I do not understand why Hollywood has this need to take a perfect foreign movie and do it again. "Mostly Martha" or "Bella Martha" has a much better cast. Starting with the heroine Martina Gedeck, who convinced me much more in the role of perfectionist obsessed with work than the most famous Catherine Zeta Jones, the Italian cook and the niece suddenly deprived of her mother and forced to live with an aunt, able to educate children. <br /> <br /> In many ways, the American version of the film is a copy of the original German. They just exchanged the actors. However, they also changed the story because it would have been difficult and not credible to materialize a father for the little girl in an American context. <br /> <br /> I thought about it. Maybe the father could have been Puerto Rican, Cuban or Mexican. Well, there are so many "guest workers" in the United States. Make your choice. But I doubt that any of them showed themselves to assume this responsibility, as the Italian father did in the original. Therefore, the American film leaves aside this part but keeps the Italian cook. And by doing that, the whole story changes. In the original, "Martha" is so far removed from reality that she thinks it's okay to send her niece to a stranger in a foreign country. <br /> <br /> The American "Martha" is softer and, therefore, the film is softer and does not have the advantage of German film. <br /> <br /> In the original, the cook "Italian" is not very pretty but much more charming, the girl is more silly but much more credible and "Martha" is more representative of a woman The world today that the diluted version is presented to us in the American version. And all the opera music in the American version was very annoying. I loved the Italian songs of the original and bought the CD. <br /> <br /> Hollywood has acknowledged that "Mostly Martha" was an excellent movie. Perhaps the distribution companies should have broadcast it in more cinemas or view it in English without subtitles. In any case, the original is so much better. By the way, it reminds me of another remake. "Shall we dance" is one of my favorites in the original Japanese version and totally unforgettable in the American version.
