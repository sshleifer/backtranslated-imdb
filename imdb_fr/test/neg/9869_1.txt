I have always loved bad creations, rhetorical critics and my film teacher validated it for me in college. This is not as serious as the Star Wars Holiday Special, there is nothing substantive in the lunch box that this mistake. Doctor Doom, the movie The Fantastic Four, complete with Dr. Doom, is one of the biggest colossal mistakes in the world. Doom's Dialogue "Kill him! ... Let him go!" is classic because it is amazing in its hilarity. The editing is good and the director of photography is not half bad ... it's the good side. I can not, however, submit all my friends to watch it in its entirety, but if I can have the opportunity, I show them "Can Jonny and Sue come into space with us!" scene I do. I also include the final scene, where Redd Richards in his FF costume for whatever reason, alongside his bride, Sue, in her wedding dress, enter the limousine ... the gain is the extendable arm goodbye when they leave. Most people are totally incredulous by the fact that there is something like that.
