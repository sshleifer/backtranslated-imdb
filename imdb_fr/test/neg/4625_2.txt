This film starts very well and sucks you. Most actors act well until Patrick Swayze (with his Texas Twang - everyone rings the British, like even the Muslim) - proves he can not play. You can live with that until the first fight scene where everyone falls apart. Why Patrick Swayze fights the villains with an ax while he just planted his sword in the ground 5 minutes ago know about. Other critics have mentioned "Troubled Production" and it shows. <br /> <br /> In the end, I did not even care about battle scenes, of course, the Dragon CGI was weak, but the scenario was the biggest disappointment.
