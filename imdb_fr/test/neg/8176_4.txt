It may not be the worst movie ever to have the best picture, but it's up there. Of course, it's probably the worst film ever to have the best picture. Nevertheless, you expect it to be an interesting movie. In fact, even if debatable. The film contains almost no depth and is just "fun" after "fun" if you want to call it that. At first, it's very interesting, but it seems that everything is exaggerated on so many levels. <br /> <br /> The action is not spectacular to watch, but it is quite interesting to see Charlton Heston play his first main role. I found that a lot of characters like the tone of the movie were boring after a while. What I really liked was James Stewart as a philosophical clown. He saved the film in the sense that he gave it a much needed extra layer. Unfortunately, after Stewart, there was not much else. <br /> <br /> The direction of the highly respected Cecil DeMille was nonexistent. I found the film lame at times and its use of Betty Hutton was a mistake. The look of the film was sometimes very good, but it did not generate that magic feeling that the classics must have. The writing was pretty good given the shallowness of the film. <br /> <br /> The name "Hollywood Trash" has appeared in movies like this one. There is no depth, no valid attempt to draw the emotions of the audience and simply no artistic value for the film. Then, of course, the many holes in the plot. This film was constantly boring and frustrating. This movie even made me realize that much of what I was looking at was not just an inaccurate description of circus life, but rather the opposite of what it really is. Why does this best image win me but does not look like the first or last time the Oscars went wrong.
