Well, I must admit that when I saw the trailer of this movie, I was looking forward to it. I'm usually a fan of romantic light-hearted comedies and the trailer is the impression I got from this movie. However, I spent most of the movie waiting for the comedy to begin. Although there were some fun scenes, in general, the film's perspectives were rather depressing. <br /> <br /> I also had a hard time falling in love with one of the characters, as they all seemed a little underdeveloped, the time that the director could have used to explore the characters taken over by one of the characters. Useless overuse of Opera, which would give the film an impression of drag and slowness. <br /> <br /> In the end, even if some scenes are touching, it is quite deceptive and I would only suggest that you look at this if really nothing else tickles your fantasy. <br /> <br /> Not fantastic, and as I said before; Bland.
