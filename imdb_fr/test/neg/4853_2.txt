This game comes from a genre of games that have tried to take advantage of the whole trend inspired by Myst - walk around, talk to people, solve puzzles. The riddles themselves are absolutely horrible, but I'll stick to the acting game itself, which is only slightly better. If you're looking for a convincing performance from a character, you will not find it here, but this game is worth buying, if only to watch Christopher Walken's hilarious performance. His game is so horrible in this game that he seems to imitate someone who pretends to be him. It's a caricature of himself. <br /> <br /> So buy this game if you're a masochist, a fan of Walken or just want to hear a lot of the word-F.
