(The beginning could be a spoiler ...) <br /> <br /> "The Eye 2" is the sequel to "The Eye". This is a pregnant woman who is able to see ghosts and spirits after an incident that happened to her. <br /> <br /> The sound effects frightened me momentarily, but it's the only thing scary. Some scenes from the previous one are relatively similar and repeated, so the scary effects have certainly been scary. <br /> <br /> "The Eye" has a rather frightening and indelible impression while "The Eye 2" is a forgettable film of horror and drama. Fail to watch that. Watching "The Eye" is enough.
