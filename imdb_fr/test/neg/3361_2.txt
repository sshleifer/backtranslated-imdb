Hi, it's me, Derrick Cannon, and welcome to Cannonite's first-ever critical review. My film this week was questionable, which road which movie, what an excellent epic four stars would I choose, guess what I decided to draw another and I chose the other route, I decided to review a movie as atrocious as it is totally killed what could have been a very unique concept. The film I'm going to review today is Jack Frost Two rematch of the mutant killer snowman. The stars of this film include Christopher Allport as Sam Tiller, Eileen Seeley as Anne Tiller, Marsha Clark as Marla David Allen Brooks as Agent Manners, Sean Patrick Murphy as Captain Fun, Ray Cooney in the role of Colonel and Scott MacDonald in the assassin Frost. <br /> <br /> It's hard to believe that this movie was part of the same series that gave us the incredibly funny Jack Frost (loved the carrot scene), but it's even harder to believe that it's exactly the same cast. The film was ruined for me as soon as they arrived on the island and Captain Fun was introduced. What was his character's interest and how did he fit into a horror movie? The only possible reason I could understand was that they wanted to give us a character that would be a real snowman's fodder. Sam Tiler seemed more paranoid than in the original, his chat about antifreeze was one of the most pathetic scenes I had seen in a movie. His wife was however one of the few bright spots. She played her role as the main woman. She was a voice of reason in the film of sheer idiocy. The scene where she discovers how to kill snowmen is one of the most anticipated parts of the film. Ray MacDonald once again did a great job as Jack Frost, despite everything he received. Without these characters so weak, he could have been immortalized as Chucky, Freddy and Jason. Laugh if you must, but deep down, Jack Frost had sperm, he had humor and, more importantly, he undeniably had a vicious twist. <br /> <br /> This film could have been a lot more, it could have been an extension of a beautiful franchise, but any plans to make a three Jack Frost was canceled. <br /> <br /> This film gets a two out of ten for me, and he is lucky to get one.
