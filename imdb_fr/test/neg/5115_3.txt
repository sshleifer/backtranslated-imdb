This movie is exactly the same as Ridley Scott's, "Someone to watch over me", which is a classic. It stars Tom Berenger and Mimi Rogers and the fugitive villain. It's a quality film, with good direction and excellent interpretation. This film is the opposite. It's the same plot of land, minus any good action and adding the direction of a TV movie. I must say that I like the interaction between Lowe and the woman. She is hot and their love is credible on many levels. Unfortunately, that alone can not save the exact copy of Ridley Scott's classic movie. <br /> <br /> Generally, nauseating television movies have a reducing quality that makes them at least watchable. I think for me, the redeeming value of this movie is that Rob Lowe and the main woman have chemistry. This and I was able to watch and compare the plot to another quality movie.
