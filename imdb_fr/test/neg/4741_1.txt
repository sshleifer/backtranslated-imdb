Ed Wood turns in his grave. He could have made a hundred cult classics for the price of this hole. The worst scenario in memory (it makes "X-Men 3" as "Citizen Kane"); the most amateur director; pre-K cinematography; the "special effects" the most cheesemongers (I speak of the territory of the continuation of "Friday the 13th"); and start a useless, revolting, deeply disturbed maternity sequence. The lack of talent or sensitivity that puts this garbage on the screen is stunning. The fact that the "sector" can reward the people involved in this final celluloid pool with future projects should be of great concern.
