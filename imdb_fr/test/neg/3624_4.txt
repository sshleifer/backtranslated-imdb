It was another one of those shows I watched to eliminate the positives and because I've been a fan of Nick for years. Some of these would be stage sets, B-conspiracies, guest stars and some of the main actors who were good. I attended the series throughout high school while I quickly despised Jamie Spears, as well as the other girls in the series who can not play. The only characters I seemed to like were Dustin, Quinn, Stacey, Michael & Logan. Quinn is a perfect pariah who finally began to integrate; Stacey is a complete weird; Dustin goes through a series of strange and random situations; and Michael is a little the right arm of Logan's comic. There is a remarkable difference between the quality of performance and the acting quality of the B tracings that involve them, and the A tracings that featured a group of screaming girls and an iconic "Miss Perfect", which repeats the bad lines and obsesses the boys. This show would have been great if the main plots contained the quality of the side plots, but the main plots did not deliver anything. When he recently came back in reruns, and I was trying to watch him again, I was more insensitive to the abominable actor of girls and I had to change channels. However, I will give credit to the aforementioned characters because they made the show more or less profitable.
