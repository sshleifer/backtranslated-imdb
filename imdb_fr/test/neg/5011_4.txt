Necessary Roughness (1991) was a bad comedy / drama that strove at all levels to become a serious movie about college football. Many famous athletes and former superstar athletes participated in this production during one of the highlights of the film. Otherwise, it's a very mediocre film. They should just stick to a comedy without realism. Instead, the filmmakers try to play both fields and they end up on the end of the neck. When will someone make a decent film about college football, both funny and realistic? <br /> <br /> This is not recommended unless it's free on t.v.
