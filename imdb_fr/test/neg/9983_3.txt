210-minute version (extremely hardcore, or as I understand it) or R-rated release release in theaters? Both are terribly awful, of course. Peter O'Toole and Malcolm McDowell both said they would never have shot this movie (the last of the two men reported it in an interview with IMDb!) And I understand why. Nothing but an absurd jumble of softcore porn and a timid attempt at intrigue. <br /> <br /> Not much of everything here, aside from cheap stuff and stupid scenes. I liked what McDowell himself said about the movie: "It was like I was watching for a moment, admiring my mule or something, and the next scene would be two lesbians." true. <br /> <br /> What a horrible movie. <br /> <br /> 1/5 stars.
