Where do I start? The story was so bad that it must have been written in a high school film club! The game was so wooden that I felt sorry for the actors! An actor even reminded me what a stag should look like when he looks in the headlights of a car! Another actor has this constant look of being constipated! But it's the dialogue that takes the cake! <br /> <br /> Our hero tells his captors - all with machine guns - that if you put your finger on a prisoner, you will be dead. Moments later, the most powerful guard, built like a truck, is used by the only female prisoner. When our intrepid leader, who has this hoarse and very annoying gangster voice, gets wind of this transgression, he calmly heads for the guard, while machine guns are dragged on him and, in a fraction of a second, the neck of this giant breaks as if he breaks. a toothpick! He then gets in the queue while all the bad guys with their machine guns do absolutely nothing, but essentially shout against him! <br /> <br /> I could go on and on! This film is a jewel of camp; and if you have a sense of humor, you are sure to laugh so hard that your eyes will tear!
