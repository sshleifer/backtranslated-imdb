This is another one of those movies that I remember well when I was a kid and that I recently managed to acquire after eBay. Twenty years later, it's not nearly as good as I remember. <br /> <br /> The story is "vaguely" started, by a "cosmic event" (there is another member of the additional film crew in the credits of "low story development") which makes the collective ants become super intelligent. The ant species that went to war stopped their rivalries and now work together. The thing I wanted to know throughout my work was: DO WHAT EXACTLY? You never find what they want. Nigel Davenport and his sidekick go to the desert, where a strange ant activity has been noticed, and begin to study the ants from a laboratory in the shape of an impregnable igloo. The most frightening scene in my opinion was probably the one where the two scientists visited the giant square in the crops (as a square version of a crop circle) following the grinding of the ants. <br /> <br /> This movie was not very scary simply because you do not know whether to fear ants or love them. All you know is that ants want people to leave the area to continue their hijinks - but you can not know if they are really mean. This is not a science fiction because the explanation of "the cosmic event" is too vague to be properly taken into account. It's deffo more than one cooler. TBH flares, silly hairstyles, tight-fitting shirts with big necks and incredibly big Nigel Davenports, this big facial hair made me more afraid than ants! Have you noticed that there are only six actors in the credits? Yes, that right - SIX, and you will not see any other human being in this movie. Not even far away! Obviously, this is a low-budget movie that is a bit under surveillance because you probably will not have seen one. I can not think anyway. The shooting of the ants is pretty good, they must have shot months and months before having the plans they needed to stay in the movie. You can very well say, "How do they make ants do that?" again and again, but it's simple. You will also notice that filmmakers have sacrificed millions of innocent licking ants to make the film too, so STAY AWAY! Good for novelty value, but you can not watch it more than once.
