From what I understood, Fox was embarrassed to have released a PG-13 Alien / Predator movie not so long ago. This was not welcomed by all means. <br /> <br /> Not really sure, because they thought Anderson was the best director in the franchise and they had produced a real sci-fi trove, Fox said. This group of monkeys, small but competent, has answers. <br /> <br /> These monkeys were certainly not veterans of sci-fi writing, but they had seen a remake of Burton's House of the Apes and House of the Dead. <br /> <br /> Their first task: to engage actors. Fox gave them a reasonable budget but the monkeys wanted to save money. They hired about fifteen television actors soon after. <br /> <br /> Now the scenario. The monkeys wanted to save more money so they wrote the film themselves. Abandoning important aspects of both franchises was the easiest part. Think of new great lines for the public to remember years later - it was more difficult. One day, they were hard-nosed and came up with a truly award-winning scenario with clich√© characters, silly decisions and gaping holes in the ground. <br /> <br /> Fox was pleased with the results but wanted to see what would become of them. the centerpieces of the film - strangers and predators. The monkeys wanted to save money again in the budget, so they decided to destroy the great robotics used in AvP's terrible original and to associate the Alien costume man seen in the old movies. The actors who play the aliens have had trouble fitting into costumes because they were not properly sized by the monkeys. So they wiggled their plastic heads throughout the film with honor. As far as predators are concerned, the monkeys decided that one predator was enough this time (again, sparing the budget) to fight the hordes of extraterrestrials that seem to come from nowhere. <br /> <br /> But what about the effects, ask yourself? Go now, people. They may be apes, but they clearly knew that CGI would play a key role in the film. Without diving into the budget, the monkeys used a standard Final Cut program and cut and glued very nice effects of fire and sparks. Putting red and green filters on the lens of the camera gave excellent visions of Predator. <br /> <br /> The monkeys had thought about this setting for a long time. If it had to be on Earth, in Colorado of all places, they had to make it realistic. This is where they admitted to having made a mistake. You see, the monkeys did not have adequate training in this department, so they thought it was wise to turn off the lights in the city and play the movie in the middle of the night and in the rain. They simply forgot that people like to see creatures instead of watching the shadows and raining the entire movie. To add insult to injury, the monkeys accidentally filmed all the incredibly close combat scenes so that no one could see what was fighting or who it was. But again, rookie error. <br /> <br /> The note. Fox asked the monkeys to do the R-rated movie. It was easy. Without showing how many injuries or deaths actually occurred, the monkeys used to show the carnage after the fact. It was simple: the viewers had the gore they wanted and the monkeys did not have to film the majority of action scenes involving this violence. <br /> <br /> Some of the actors originally had questions about the script. Why is a blue liquid that the predator has countless amounts of magical decays of what he wants and nothing more? Why does an ex-convict driving in a police car make the whole film? Why did the monkeys forget to show a complete shot of the extraterrestrials? Why does a clock play a more memorable role than one of the main characters? The list of questions was growing, but the monkeys ignored them and finished their masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Fox was delighted with his work. So delighted that they opened the movie on Christmas Day and even spent a few dollars advertising it the week before it was released. The monkeys had successfully completed another installment of these cherished franchises. <br /> <br /> But some people wonder what happened to the budget that the monkeys forgot to use. They put it in their next movie: Aliens vs. Predator against Hulk Hogan. They knew that the general public would be unhappy with the title, but they have since published this statement: <br /> <br /> "Do not worry about the next movie, it will be rated R and will be violent." <br /> <br /> And everyone has lived happily ever after. The end.
