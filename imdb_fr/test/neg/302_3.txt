"The Secret Life" begins with the worst narrative intro possible: "The crimes committed by Jeffrey Dahmer are too horrible to make a film on ...". Ok, so what do you suggest? That we should not bother to keep watching because the movie will not be accurate or bloody, anyway? And they were right too! The film is not at all shocking and contains almost no blood or blood. Although I think this is mainly due to the low-budget production values ​​and not to Dahmer's crimes being too horrible. Basically, "The Secret Life: Jeffrey Dahmer" is just a repeat sequence over and over again. Jeffrey, young, pitiful and mentally confused, picks up the victims (always men, because he was homosexual), kills them, then explains that his intention was not to hurt them and that he was alone. It quickly becomes boring and even the wonderful performance of unknown actor Carl Crew can not save this movie from a total failure. Nevertheless, this version is much better than the so-called and hopelessly confused "Dahmer" released in 2002.
