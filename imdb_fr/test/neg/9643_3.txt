The story is not very strong. Do not expect a film like "bourgeois identity". It started strong, Tara speaks Russian and it sounds even credible. (Not that I'm the specialist in the Russian language.) Moscow had that dark and depressing look that gave this film a potential, I always believed it. Too bad it only takes half an hour to see that they really missed the place with this one. Playing was mediocre, perhaps because the story itself was not very strong. There is this part of the movie where Gordon Patrick (Nick Moran) has a phone conversation with the CIA, as if you were listening to a Chinese synchronizer. W.T.F!? Too bad, the writer did not even put a lot of effort to give depth to the main characters. In addition, an easy and inexpensive end. <br /> <br /> The plus point of almost every scene that Tara Reid is part of is. She does not act as well, in fact, she does not do it. But she really looks great in this movie. Overall, it was a little disappointing. Rental equipment ?? Perhaps.
