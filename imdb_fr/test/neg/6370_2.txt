I was in grade 6 and this film was broadcast on PBS in a series called "Wonderworks". I distinctly remember sitting on a couch watching the movie with the tears running down my face at the end. In the movie, Jesse, the main character, forms an unusual friendship with a girl named Leslie. Due to a very simple but careless mistake, one of them dies. At the time, I found the story very powerful, because the fatal error is exactly the type of error that a child would make. All children viewing the film will easily find the emotional weight of the tragedy that ensues. . <br /> <br /> Last year, I finally found a VHS copy of the show. I probably should have stayed with my memories. Watching the show as an adult, I was absolutely shocked by the horrible quality of the film. My girlfriend also had a similar memory of the movie, and she too was sad to see how bad the movie was compared to her memories. <br /> <br /> Many adults probably have the memory of watching this movie as children. I urge these people to leave their memories intact and avoid seeing this movie as an adult.
