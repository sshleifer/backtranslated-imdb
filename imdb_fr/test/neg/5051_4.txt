The only reason I watched this movie a second time was to learn the name of the "second banana" that was playing against Katie Holms. Her name is Marisa Coughlan. Never heard of her before. She is adorable. Captivating. With her animated face and cute body, she is very observable ... She has a real "Poisenality" ... More than an ephemeral vibration of Grace Kelly ... with a juvenile exuberance. I think she is Irish in the gene pool (my favorite female DNA), so it makes sense that she looks like the most beautiful Irish American. The film is remarkable, Katie Holms is a classic beauty in the flesh. But Marisa Coughlan is the one you follow with your eyes. In 1999, when this film was shot, she was about 25 years old, at its peak. It makes me think of another stupid and worthless film, with the only girl who is redemption. It was "Career Opportunities" with the first time I saw Jennifer Conoly. Or "Grease II" the first time I saw Michelle Pfeiffer.
