This is only the fourth effort I've seen from this director (whom I met and found quite awesome during the retrospective of the Italian film B at the Venice Film Festival 2004) and also, maybe to be, the worst. As was the case with THE BRONX EXECUTIONER (1989), which precedes it, it is an excellent example from the end of the Euro-sectarian era - primordial because it shows the depths to which the previously invigorating style had fallen! <br /> <br /> Here, in fact, we have a plot that revolves around - I'm not kidding, people - a killer phone! The pretty but faint Charlotte Lewis - in her third film after PIRATES (1986) and THE GOLDEN CHILD (1986) - is a model that apparently has just ended a case; she still expects her architect lover to call her back, but every time the phone rings, everything she receives is static, accompanied by voices from the afterlife (or such shit) . She befriends a new tenant in her building who, in a practical way, knows of the existence of an authority on paranormal activity (William Berger) - which explains with hilarity that the negative energy released during Family disputes can manifest themselves through household appliances. a deadly force (I swear I do not invent it)! <br /> <br /> Among the highlights ... uh ... the weak points of the film are: the grumpy bartender from the dark place where the heroine calls several times (it seems that the chain of 'events will not be broken by again passing Lewis at his own pace, EXTERMINATING ANGEL (1962) -style!), the variety of phones looks absurdly exposed, the camera of the friend photographer of the heroine who is sneaked before the murder, the sarcastic cop greeting Lewis with these strange events ("And what's the use of the toaster, I wonder?"), the potential rapist killed by a barrage of parts from a cabin phone and the bloody death of Berger (with the phone) affecting the pacemaker with which it is equipped and exploding the heart of the doctor)! <br /> <br /> The climax of the film is quite confusing and, apparently, all "lost souls" finally live in a flock of doves and fly through the window of the "possessed" office (a solitary heart service !). For what it's worth, the score - of the old Goblin Claudio Simonetti - is quite effective, despite the inclusion of dated heavy-metal numbers in the soundtrack.
