I ticked the box "contains the spoiler", in case I say something that is a spoiler and that I do not realize that I said it until I read it again after posting it. So just in case. <br /> <br /> Anyway, let's go back to the proofreading of this movie. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie on skymovies earlier this afternoon, and from the description that Sky gives you (these people had to be under acid) it sounded good, but when I I had about 30 minutes, I was dismayed. In my opinion, this movie has the worst scriptwriting and actors / actresses of all time. The girl who falls in love with L.A's boy after about 3 hours is a really stupid and lame character, with an annoying and creepy voice and cute hair. -.-. Then there is his lover, who is an idiot and who is also very sarcastic. In fact, maybe they are good to each other. Then there is the boy's mother, who is with him on vacation, and surprise, surprise - she is a doctor and - oh my god, wait, there are still more unsuspected surprises! A virus suddenly appears on the island and she knows everything about viruses! = O. SHOCK HORROR! Yes indeed. Lol. Then there's this foolish religious boy, who keeps talking about "erbs" or something like that and how the Lord knows everything. Everyone on the island seems to like it, but it's actually a stubborn, arrogant, steroid-pumped (you absolutely must watch this movie just for the scene when it comes out of the sea after a swim, its head is very small, and her body is MASSIVE, it's hilarious) a jester who has drunk too much. <br /> <br /> Anyway, after all these strange characters, including a smashed taxi driver, the religious finally lets go to the doctor, and she takes a blood sample, and they immediately go to work to find a cure, because, for some reason, he was saved dramatically, until "erbs and God". AND OH MY GOD. Yes, there is another surprise !! You will never guess what !! Just in time, there are only 11 minutes left before everyone on the island loses the ball, including his son and daughter, she finds the treatment and injects everyone, and everything is solved! What a pathetic film. I mean, I knew it sounded like an obvious end since I started to look at it, but in fact, I thought it would be nice and that I was experiencing some twists somewhere, but no-no, it was just boring and dry. /> <br /> Do not watch this movie. You will end up like me, stunned for 3 hours, then you will spend an hour and a half watching it.
