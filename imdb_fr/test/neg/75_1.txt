This film is about a couple who decides to go on vacation in the Everglades with another couple and the family dog. When they arrive for the first time, they are not greeted by the nearby gas handler who warms them to stay away from the cabin in which they must spend the night. After harassing the old man, three hillbillys do not like their arrival because they approach their car and threaten to leave. After questioning local models who can not speak or simply do not want to answer, they end up finding the cabin. After settling, strange things happened to them, including the discovery of bullshit on their car. The man at the head of this trip is an idiot who shoots at the family dog, thinking it was a clawing killer at the door and a series of deaths later in the end . The addition of a religious group did not improve the story. Then in the end, the idiot who survived this ordeal goes around the city with a shotgun. Lame. that's what this movie is.
