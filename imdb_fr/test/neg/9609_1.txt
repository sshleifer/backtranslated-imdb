There are so many things you do not like in this show that it's hard to know where to start. Unimaginable characters, horrible intrigues, a terrible writing AND a terrible acting game. Do not even get me started on the topic of obnoxious music. <br /> <br /> In addition, the series is not in contact with the American public, because of the heavy Canadian references that surround it. "Oh, say Derek, will you go to Queens College in the fall, how are you, bean?" We should go. <br /> <br /> Of course, other series are shot in Canada for financial reasons such as Stargate: Atlantis, but although these shows may have suffered some trouble (as Rodney calls a ZPM "Zed-PM" "), the show focuses on life in Canada. <br /> <br /> MTV presents Degrassi (another show based on the experiences of the Canadian teenager) during the day, when no one watches the passing of time (most teens are at school when it has the air). I bet it's for the same reason. Programs that focus on teenage life in Canada do not translate well for an American audience. <br /> <br /> This show should be canceled and the remaining masters burned in an oven.
