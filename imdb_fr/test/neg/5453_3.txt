I never understood what attracted Karen Black. She still had those ashy eyes and that kind of strange look. She seemed to be often eccentric or expressed in "other" woman. In this one, she is the psychic counselor and the specialist of the occult in a shabby producer of bad advertisements while he learns the astral projection. He is mean, even without the new luggage. Apparently, this is the future of immortality, because if you succeed, you will be able to inhabit the bodies of future generations. I think Star Trek had a plot like this with Jack the Ripper hanging on for several centuries. In any case, this guy is really dangerous. He has a beautiful family and makes them unhappy. He begins to murder friends just because they have a derogatory comment about them or he does not like them. You can see the end coming from the last line of the left field. It's a very hard film without humor. Most of it must be considered a truth. Why are some called but few chosen? I found it long and not very satisfying.
