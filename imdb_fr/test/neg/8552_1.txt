Sad ... really sad. This movie has nothing (hmmm, well maybe Sybil Danning) to keep you watching. It also hurt me to see Linda Blair in this movie. She certainly deserves better. <br /> <br /> So what is the story about? Let's see ... Warden John Vernon saves the inmates in rather inspiring positions, while prisoner Sybil runs the prison and little Linda has to fight to survive ... It looks like a B movie, huh? It is.
