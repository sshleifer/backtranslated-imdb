First, no one with law enforcement experience (either ER or EMT, but actual law enforcement) takes this issue seriously. Walker would be excluded from any police force in the United States for his illegal and totally unprofessional tactics. On top of that, he's a cartoon character - no ability to act, incredibly banal lines, no character development. The fact that Alex Cahill loves it proves how stupid blondes are. And Trivett is the ultimate black-faced clown. Come on --- if you think Walker is a sincere series without prejudices, then explain why JT is treated like a fool, is still the subject of Walker's jokes, is never allowed to solve this one and never saves Walker, who should be dead 50 times for the nonsense he does. While it's true that many criminals are even more stupid than the detectives who attack them (and believe me, most cops are stupider than ever), the clever ones Walker meets never seem to understand. the point that once Walker is captured, the shake must be put out of his misery. But again, Norris produced the series and played in it, so how could he get rid of himself or even show how stupid his tactics are. As if six guys would wait to take him one at a time. What a terrible series! It's more humiliating than any classic western like The Lone Ranger, Roy Rogers, The Cisco Kid and Wild Bill Hickock, although I imagine most of you here are way too young to remember these emissions. But like these shows, in the same way as these shows, Walker TR is just as insulting and just silly.
