Where do I start? The plot of the film, which speaks of a love between two high school students in time of war, while one of them is a living weapon, and their struggle to maintain this love is a very good plot. It is based on a manga by Shin Takahashi that was also turned into anime in 2002, which I have not read or read yet. <br /> <br /> This article deals with this adaptation by live action. Unfortunately, this honest kindness was a terrible movie. It's not like we can put some things in, say, for example, that the budget is in question or that the act is to blame. Unfortunately this is a series of disappointing and ineffective elements that make the film fall. <br /> <br /> The acting is mediocre. Not to mention that Aki Maeda and Shunsuke Kubozuka are bad actors, but they did not have many things to work with and seemed to have eaten badly. Neither seemed to have the physical possibility of drawing the viewer into the story, while being too old to be distracted. <br /> <br /> The scenario was weak, the main actors acted unrealistically and behaved irrationally. The film also plays for the heart, but ends up being predictable, while not being convincing and underdeveloping characters. There are also heart rate problems. <br /> <br /> Visually, it does not go unnoticed. The film uses the green screen unnecessarily and unnecessarily in too many scenes. Other special effects also have an inexpensive aspect, especially when minimalist special effects could be used. There is also no visual talent, as if there was no director of photography or artistic designer to give the scenes a coherent and stimulating. <br /> <br /> The music and the sound effects were good, but remarkable. <br /> <br /> Overall, the film is not devoid of pleasure, and fans of the series should not be discouraged to see it at least once, for the sake of completion. People who do not know Saikano, this is probably not the ideal place to intervene, because it is not a very good film or melodrama. It's not the film or the fault of the cast and the teams, it's just not inspired, and that's what kills him.
