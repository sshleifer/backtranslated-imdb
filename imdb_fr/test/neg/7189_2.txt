The creators of this film had to sit one day and say to themselves "make fun of the Russians and show at the same time how advanced we are (Americans)". The film describes the Russians as a lower people unable to understand the brilliant ideas put forward by the Americans. It is true that American campaigns are probably more professional and rely more on costly studies than those in other countries. However, this film goes too far and exaggerates the differences between East and West. For me, it looked like a propaganda film made during the Cold War.
