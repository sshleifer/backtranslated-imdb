How is it that Canada succeeds in producing good films in all genres, other than action? I caught Dragon Hunt on TV the other day and it was like a train wreck. I just could not change channels, it's his stupidity that undermined my will. It's nice to say that the IMDb distribution "credits" this monstrosity apparently never worked again. <br /> <br /> Bad game, bad writing, bad storytelling, bad music, bad hair, bad cinematography. And it starts again so many times. The film really has nothing to recommend. If you are looking for bad action movies that you will laugh while having fun, there are a ton of other movies that will not force you to burn the retinas afterwards. <br /> <br /> I hope this film was not. get money from the government for funding, otherwise I will never pay taxes again.
