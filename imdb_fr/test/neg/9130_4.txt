What I was hoping for (or even hoping for) was the famous "stop motion" imagery and the extremely slow movements, the extreme zooms and all the fish eye shots. In short: The art of a) finding interesting visual events and b) capturing them in a way that the human eye is not able to reproduce for the human eye to see. What made the success of the other Qatsi. <br /> <br /> I was just wondering how the creation of the set would fit the title. <br /> <br /> After watching the movie, I got the impression that the focus in this third part was on the message and not on the packaging. This is good, especially since the message is so valid. But I already knew the message and it appeared that I had nothing left. More than half of the film was solarized, colored, posterized or transformed by another filter. It was very similar to the effects of your video camera but you never use them. A lot of the pictures would have been nicer without filters, like the giraffe and zebra hunt. You could say that "technology or any other male-based source has disfigured our beautiful nature", but why use these 70's effects to symbolize that? By the time there had been more than 10 minutes in a row of this inexpensive aspect effect, I was ready to leave. The hope that the rest could not be so bad made me stay. But there was also slow motion: slow motion is a good thing because it gives you time to analyze the moving picture. But if there are not more than 24 or even 50 or 60 frames per second, there is simply not enough movement to slow down. Please, save the movement to slow down faster, as was done with the beautiful images of bubbling water and splashing water (some of the) people laughing and singing soldiers singing. I recognize that archive footage can not be redone, but I have already seen many of these images, it could have been done without them. It took a lot of work to browse archive images, and the effects were not as easy to apply and arrange. On top of that, a lot of the work was mixed up. This shows that the creator did not seek to lengthen the film or to spare. But I did not like the mixed stuff a bit ... The idea behind this was sometimes nice or even smart, but the implementation was insufficient. The computer generated images did not bother me much, even if they were out of date. The "bits" broadcast along the tracks (in the first part of the movie) seemed newer and more enjoyable. Mandelbrot is always fun, the fractal mountain was less. I was happy to hear a cello play a major role in music. A little less vibrato at times would have been appropriate with Glass's music, but it's a matter of taste. Like all the above, of course. I hope there will soon be another Qatsi story to tell, where computer imagery will have a lesser role and inspire someone to come back to the field. <br /> <br />
