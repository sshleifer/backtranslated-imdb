I was pretty lost for most of the movie, and I'm the one who usually understands the works of enigmatic moviegoers like David Lynch (Twin Peaks: Walk with Me) and Darren Aronofsky (Pi). Not to say that Northfork makes no sense, it does not combine to form a totally coherent movie. As time goes by watching the movie, its themes and intentions become clearer, but during my initial viewing, I was really confused and I think it's the movie's major fault ... its lack of direction. The plot is centered on the city of Northfork, Montana, in 1955. The city was emptied and will soon be flooded to allow the creation of a hydroelectric dam. The major problem is that not all residents want to be evacuated and resettled. A group of men is hired to force the remaining residents to leave town before she drowns. They succeed for the most part in situations and inhabitants rather strange. Simultaneously, the film tells the story of Irwin, a very sick young boy (or is he a fallen angel?) Whose adoptive parents returned him, due to his illness, to the Northfork orphanage where they had adopted it. Father Harlan (Nick Nolte) cares about dying Irwin, but Irwin imagines (or should he ?!) that a group of angels (including Daryl Hannah and Anthony Edwards) have arrived in the desolate, empty city looking for of a fallen angel. Irwin has scars on his back and head, and he tries to convince the angels that his scars are those where humans have amputated his wings and his halo. Oh yes, and all this time, there is a strangely surreal animal on stilts wandering in the background of the landscape. There are many other small events that occur in the movie, but none of them boils down to a momentary plot. We can appreciate the artistic quality of the film (it is obvious that the filmmakers are deeply interested in this film) and its rich cinematography, but the film still tries to be different and then abandons ending without embarrassment. declaration. As I wrote earlier, long after watching, what has probably happened in the film becomes clearer. Irwin is dying, as is Northfork, and to cope with his own loss, he most likely created characters from the ideas he draws from the objects around him at the orphanage, to comfort him. while he is abandoned and his life. approaching its end. But then again, maybe he's really an angel, and he has found his kind and can now go home. I must point out that there are very beautiful moments in the film, heartbreaking, alive and full of loneliness and sadness. Unfortunately, the film as a whole ends up feeling disconnected and somehow incomplete.
