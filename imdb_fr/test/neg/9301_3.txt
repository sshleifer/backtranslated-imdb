This film stars Ben Kingsley as Frank, a hit for some Russian gangsters based in Buffalo. He is also a raging alcoholic, which has reduced his job performance. After falling asleep in his car during an attack, his uncle, chief of the mafia, sends him to San Francisco, where he has to attend AA meetings and find a job as a practitioner assistant. If you think it makes no sense, you are not alone. <br /> <br /> The situation is getting worse. In fact, things are improving, but not before. Frank suddenly becomes a master practitioner despite a total lack of training, but his reactions to funeral parlor people and AA meetings are interesting. The viewer begins to encourage himself as he notices positive changes in his life. Luke Wilson is a welcome addition as a sponsor of Frank, although he is almost given nothing to do (his character tells us he is gay, but it ends up having no meaning). The film plunges into idiocy with the introduction of the character of Tea Leoni. She is completely unrealistic and her role as love arouses Frank's interest because both actors have no chemistry together. As she enters the scene, Frank becomes much less captivating as a character. His characterization is apparently random; there is no consistency in his behavior. The comedy is discreet and funny intermittently, particularly disappointing considering the comic pedigree of casting. <br /> <br /> Problems abound in this one. Kingsley's accent is terrible and incoherent. He alternates between Italian, Russian and Hispanic. Throughout the movie, Frank tells many people that he is a hit (including an entire AA group), but no one seems to care or want to do anything about it. The film is based on scenes of clich√©s to carry out its final act, especially when the unbearable character of Leoni pursues Frank at the airport, as he prepares to take his flight back to Buffalo. <br /> <br /> With a solid base and an interesting first half hour, the film quickly becomes a total disaster and turns into a total nonsense. At the end of the movie, Frank celebrates a year of sobriety. I hope to celebrate many years without having seen "You Kill Me". <br /> <br /> My note: D +
