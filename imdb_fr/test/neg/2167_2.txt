"Tales from the Crapper" is bloody, disgusting, tasteless, offensive, perverse and scatological. But it does not matter, I was prepared for all these experiences from my previous experiences with Troma. What I was NOT prepared for is that it's also witty, insignificant and boring. Very little of the authentic anarchic spirit of films like "Class of Nuke'em High" has remained intact; in its place, we receive endless jokes about the fart (to the point that you wonder if Lloyd Kaufman would become senile, thinking that the adults found fucking so damn hilarious!) and a cynical and unscrupulous exploitation of the spectator, who invests essentially time. and the money to see a "movie" that even Kaufman himself seems to know should never have been released. Oh yes, there's a lot of female nudity on the bill, but let's face it: the average porn movie probably has a better screenplay, higher production values, funnier humor and, above all, more RESPECT for the viewer only this atrocity. <br /> <br /> P.S: AKA Kelly Powers Suzi Lorraine (the lesbian blonde student of the "How to make her own movie" segment) is one of the most beautiful women I have ever seen.
