Well, I've seen a lot of reviews on this one, and a lot of promo still showing the scene of beheading. But this film is difficult. And I mean by all means. It is difficult to find a copy because it was a low budget independent publication and because the MPAA was looking for each copy on VHS, it was not evaluated, but it had to be evaluated for the MPAA. So, the copies disappeared in the underground scene. Everyone involved in this film has never done anything else in the business. It made this film unique. VHS copies almost never appear on ebay or other sites. If so, you will have to pay more than $ 100 to get one. But thanks to the American connections, I was able to catch a DVD release sold all over the world. Limited but it had to be some kind of civil servant. From time to time, there are still projections of this splatterfest party. But is it worth all the hype surrounding it? As we said earlier, it is a difficult problem to grasp, but also to get through. There are bloody murders, there is necrophilia, there is nudity but there is also a lot of talk between the brass. And to be honest, if you want to see the movie in 5 minutes, look at the end, it's a flashback in the mind of the killer. The blood is flowing and indeed it's a splatterfest but not the 80 minutes, splashing galore for 10 minutes. The quality of the film is good, the sound good, no hissing, the colors, the black is black and not blue as in many small budgets. It's good to watch this, but you'll never be scared, but it's watching with your friends having a beer and a pizza, I guess. 555, naaaaaaaaaaaaaaah 333.
