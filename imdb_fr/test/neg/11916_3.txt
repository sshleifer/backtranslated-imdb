I just spent the last half hour reading the other reviews and I do not know if I want to laugh or cry. ADJL in no way resembles Harry Potter, Danny Phantom, Fairly OddParents, another magical and secretive world, which has been almost excessive. In addition, no way is ADJL anime. The anime is really a drawing style (and some will say more, like the plot and Japanese origin), anyway, ADJL is not an anime so stop saying it and if you are looking for something that looks like anime, look elsewhere, like Teen Titans and Avatar. <br /> <br /> ADJL is typical. It's like all the other Disney shows. A child of arrogant main character who thinks he knows everything, does not want to listen to older people and keeps making the same mistakes. Best buddy boyfriend. Repetitive plot with a hint of twist. And fraternal rivalry. Can not they once create a character who has brains and is not full of himself? Can not they have their children respect their elders? Can not they think of something else with the plot? Can not the brothers and sisters get on well and not hate each other? ADJL is simply too generic, because you also have villains who are defeated and who come back, and who are also complete idiots, who have no background for their hatred. Come on, you are going to think that someone who is at least 30 years old will be able to distance a 13 year old child. <br /> <br /> Watching ADJL is like watching almost everything on television these days, it's the same thing over and over. Nothing special, just new character drawings and a little idea that has been used again and again.
