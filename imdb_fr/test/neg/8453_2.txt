This movie was really painful to watch for me. I understand that independent films do not have the same resources as other mainstream movies. But there are basic elements of film making that you generally want to respect. First, skip cuts. The first 15 minutes of the film are numerous. There are shots in which it appears that two separate shots of the same shot have been edited together. What I mean by that is that a character says half a line of a hold, and the rest of the line comes from a different hold. Second, the dialogue. I understand that many writers strive to create a very realistic and realistic dialogue for their films. Since this film is very specific to its location, the dialogue must also be pronounced in a specific tone (example: placing a film in Boston, but people use slang from the west coast with a Chicago accent). Even with this understanding, it is still difficult to review some of the lines presented by these actors. These are just the two most vivid issues I've encountered with this movie. There were a few others. I do not want to sound like a hard critic who knows nothing at all. I have years of experience in the film industry (and more importantly, independent, low-budget film). I also understand that with many directors, there is often a method for their madness. I could not discover this method used in this film. It makes it difficult for me to decide if I consider this film as an example of a unique style in making a film, or simply as another low budget, poorly mounted film. I sincerely hope that this is not the last. If anyone has an idea of ​​why things were done, or has their own thoughts / views about this film, I'd like to hear them. I hope I can better understand this film and that my current opinion can be changed.
