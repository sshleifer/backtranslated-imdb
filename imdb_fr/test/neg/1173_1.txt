I made a critique for the fictional recreation of this director on BTK. I had also seen this movie and it was terrible. Please save your money and your time. This film was terrible and this director is without talent. I do not understand how he finances these films. They are horrible. I decided to check who the author, the director and the producer are, and if that director's name appears, I'm not going to waste my money. There's nothing worse than renting a movie on Friday night, popcorn and realizing you've been fooled by creative art on the front of the movie box. Stay away. So I guess I should invent stuff to fill the lines? I have always checked the IMDb ratings, but I think I will not do it anymore. It's ridiculous. I have been corrected too often in my reviews. Not enough lines? You can cancel my account. Your site is a pain.
