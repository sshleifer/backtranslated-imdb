SPOILERS! <br /> <br /> I gave this film 2 out of 10 for 2 scenes that I will never forget ..... by the way, my husband praised this amazing film that looks almost like a girl. ... but I guessed why when I saw the blanket ... girls in school uniforms ... duh ... lol ... well, men if you can not beat them, join them. .... ;-) <br /> <br /> Jewel Philips, one of my favorites on the independent screen ... too cute ...... not only goes into bestiality (his little dog is the best lesbian in town according to her sparkling and scandalous character) .. it would be the first scene that is worth visiting .. <br /> <br /> Then she enters the bathroom in a pretty dress and enters a stall .... after a little rises, goes to the party where she and the pathetically sad "Cat" character are at, and hands a shiny silver ice bucket to the host of the party ... the host look in his precious silver ice bucket and say, "oh my god, poo." <br /> <br /> I love Bijou Phillips myself for his creativity and his unusual film choices, it would certainly be 'One. Two. .... and uh, I would praise it for the poo scene if I were you ..... I'm not a big fan of poop jokes, but it definitely puts "party-goers" in their place (they do not have it looks like they were having a good time anyway ..... lol) ... you will never forget these two scenes ... hmm, but is this what we want in our banks of data? .... maybe you should not be my advice at all .... lol <br /> <br /> Dominique Swain is a little angry and sad in his absurd and absurd role in "Tart". I do not know, I can not decide if I like her because she loves so much independent movies ?? Independent movies are great and all but could not choose some? I'll take a look at some of his films and reserve my judgment ... but this one was, (sorry, the reference to the beasts) a dog ...
