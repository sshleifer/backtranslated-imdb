If it was not for the fact that it is a 2 dvd game associated with the original American graffiti; Without the fact that I have been here in Iraq for several months and at this point, I will look at just about anything, I would have thrown this film in the trash after the first ten minutes. This film was dreadful on so many levels that I do not know where to start. Badly acted, shot, directed, written, marked, edited. The first incursions of my 9-year-old daughter into making movies are better than that - and she was filming the dog sleeping. (I think, I'm giving 9 stars to this part of cinematography, but I'm biased.) If you have any appreciation for the quality of the film, avoid this dirt at all costs. No character in this film has a quality that redeems, except for the Icelandic girl who does not even have a single line in English. I will not waste time describing what a bad movie is.
