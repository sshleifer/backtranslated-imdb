"Once again, we have a movie that contains about 20 minutes of entertainment - much of which includes the group's sometimes funny lyrics - in a 90-minute package." For those who are old enough to remember, this fits in the lines of the first "Bill and Ted" WITHOUT the story. If that does not tell you how brainless this movie is, think of Jack Black singing for about 20 minutes and that is his selling point. If you really like to listen to Tenacious D because of its musical prowess, then knock yourself out and buy the soundtrack. Do not waste your time with that though. If you are a stoner looking for a bad movie filled with laughter, you always bark the wrong tree. No matter how powerful your buds are, you will still hope that you are back in Grandma's Boy.
