But even caricatures need a plausible plot. I guess in 1934, some of this audience would have benefited from this lukewarm joke. It does not age well. This gives Nat Pendelton and Zasu Pitts experienced and experienced technical support players a chance to try their luck. Pendelton, featured prominently in the Thin Man series, does his best, but is complicated by a plot without intelligence. The backdrop is a play with gangsters, it's not really original material. The grace of the film is the always excellent Edward Everett Horton in a lost performance. But do not waste your time watching Everett in this movie. I encourage anyone to follow him in his Holiday efforts with Cary Grant and Katherine Hepburn. Same time 1936, but much better scenario and scenario. Better gags and needless to say the power of the stars.
