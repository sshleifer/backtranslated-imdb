I'm surprised everyone finds Pauly Shore entertaining: it's actually a joke that's getting bland * real * fast. He has his little vocabulary "California" jerk and a basic stock of lame jokes. Mainly, he is just heinous. <br /> <br /> That said, I watched this movie because I was sick and there were literally only infomercials, otherwise I would have turned it off after 30 minutes. Anyway, the movie might have been acceptable if Pauly could have just turned off his movie and played it as a comic actor instead of, well, Pauly. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I'm sure Pauly's fans will like it anyway - but if you're not a fan of Pauly, stay away from this jar of manure. <br /> <br /> I had to leave This comment after seeing that another user gave a 10/10 to this film! (Maybe it was Pauly !!) Personally, I gave him a 3/10 because they did not have shots in shooting, they did not drop the camera and the secondary actors were pretty good.
