I know this movie is a low-budget horror movie for those who prefer shocks and gore "inexpensive", but even if it's too dull a film, it is filled with an incoherent plot, accompanied horrible music and obvious signs that this film was never finished. <br /> <br /> Without giving any trouble, I will simply say that, in the last part, things end without explanation, whether by film or by narration. The Anitra girl is really attractive, but that's not a good enough reason to enjoy this movie. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of these 60's and 70's gore movies, you should watch it, but know that it does not even reach the usual scene of this type of film.
