Angels and Demons: 3 out of 10: It's clear that something serious has happened to Ron Howard. I do not know what, but something went very wrong. <br /> <br /> Howard has always been a decent worker director. Although he was never confused with an artistic scholar, Cinderella Man and Apollo 13 were excellent films, Parenthood was pretty good and even before / after Angels and Demons The Da Vinci Code was a fun delusion. Moreover, none of his films was really horrible. (Note: I did not see how the Grinch stole Christmas or his latest film, Heidi Montag says no to plastic.) What's more Howard has managed to retain this quality is a well-defined genre, as bait for the star (A Beautiful Mind), costume drama to the star (Far and Away), fantasy of revenge driven by the stars (ransom) and comedies on prostitution and sirens (Night Shift, Splash). <br /> <br /> Angels and Demons is at the center of a film that is badly shot and badly shot. The scenes are too dark, the camera angles are incorrect, the actors are blocking each other and the case is often fuzzy. This makes the story of an already confusing story even more confusing. <br /> <br /> Dan Brown is often criticized, but I found The Da Vinci Code very entertaining (so sue me). The cinematographic version of the Da Vinci code has maintained the same state of alignment and added an appealing cast and an attractive shoot. <br /> <br /> Angels and demons, however, take place in claustrophobic Vatican City and since Howard was not allowed to film in many real places, we often end up with a lot of back problems. The whole movie is as if Rick Steves had made a special show in Vatican City and instead of going to the Holy City and pointing his camera, Rick had to use Lego bricks and an art book. opportunity with all the breasts cleared. <br /> <br /> While Da Vinci's code had what I always think is an intriguing central mystery (again suing me), the story of Demons and Angels is a plot led by the Illuminati (destroy eyes now) to destroy the Vatican. Their idea was to take a stand in deaf schools around the world and rape every student in the ass several times. Oops my bad; Apparently, the Vatican does not need any help in this area. <br /> <br /> Anyway, their plan is to infiltrate the Great European Hadron Collider, kill the Chief Priest and steal three vials of Anti-Matter. This raises more than a few questions. Can the hadron collider create an anti-matter? Can you capture antimatter once created? Why does the EU collect it? (May they fear an attack from Godzilla?). Why does the head of Anti-matter bring together a priest from the Vatican? Now, once they have antimatter, will they use their incredible destructive power to conquer the world ?? no I'm kidding; Unfortunately, the Illuminati have not yet fully understood the level of sophistication of Pinky and the Brain. Instead, the current pope has just died and the time of the conclave has arrived. The top ranked Cardinals for the final four popes' tournament are all kidnapped and the Illuminati kill them one by one in the Seven's way. As they are good sportsmen, they leave clues to every assassination, like some Latin-style Riddlers. Oh, and the last cardinal kidnapped has antimatter. If he is not found in time, Rick Steves will have to go directly to Venice next year to admire frescoes of quality. If only there was some Latin-themed Batman to save the day ??? Okay, the story is really horrible and badly told, but maybe it's one of those movies saved by great performances. A real study of character ?? (Ok you know where it's going). Tom Hanks gives an incredible performance in wood and just looks awful (he's too old to interpret the character for about twenty years). Her love interest, Israeli actress Ayelet Zurer, has no chemistry, neither with Hanks nor with the screen. Ewan Macgregor plays the pope's personal assistant / cabanon as an Irishman who seems on the verge of breaking a musical number at any time, provided no one steals his lucky charm. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, Stellan Skarsg√•rd has a good tour as the head of Vatican Security and, as far as we know, no deaf child was raped during the making of this film, which places it in front of its critics of the Vatican in at least one area.
