Watch this movie ..... only to truly appreciate the quality of the original. I'm not very hard to please, but it was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> It hurts a lot because I love Chevy Chase, Jackie Mason and Dyan Cannon. The writing was just terrible! I thought Chevy would have at least published better things than him. There is practically nothing to laugh about in this movie. I entered the desire to appreciate it. I wanted to laugh but almost cried. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the credits, it reads Special Appearance of Chevy Chase. That worried me from the beginning. Chevy is actually more than I thought. It's more than a "special appearance". Too bad the appearance was not special. The character of Mason would have been a good secondary character but would have aged as a main character. I would have rather seen more (much more) of Dyan Cannon. At least his character was amusing, if it was not well written. I also missed the free teen sex scene. Mr. Gopher went from cute and innocent to a pesky rodent that deserved to be exploded. Jonathan Silverman is the only character who interests me and we have not seen enough. <br /> <br /> I get it back. Try to watch half of this movie, then ... remember Alamo, Maine and CaddyShack I.
