I am terribly sorry! Where the Lubitsch Peak was enchanting, wonderful, full of wit and elegance, this one is only colorful! Lana looks like 51 (in fact, she was 31 at the time, but obviously depressed) and tries to play a shy and boring girl. Think of Jeanette McDonald, who gave the widow's role a double-sided depth by "playing" with Count Danilo. That Lana had to play an operetta although unable to sing - crazy! She sings only one song - the title role of an operetta Lehar, which is really funny! The only good thing to do is the big waltz scene at the end: glamorous! And after watching this scene, take a look at the waltz introduction scene in "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes"! Similarities?
