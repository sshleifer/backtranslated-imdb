I was really disappointed with this movie. I had heard good reviews about it and unfortunately, I missed it in the room. As a result of that, I was really excited to see it when it came to DVDs. I thought it would be a fast-paced horror movie, with a lot of scary surprises, but it was more of a predictable movie with snails. He dragged and dragged without a climax and after all the difficulties that these people went through trying to escape, the end was completely frustrating. I gave this movie two stars for a reason. It's not your typical horror movie with only one villain killing a group of people to death. The story makes this film unique and brings a change to people who watch a lot of horror movies. Even if I do not like this movie, I recommend to all horror fans to see it at least once. You can love surprisingly. As for this horror fan, all I can say is that I hope there will be no follow up to this forgotten movie.
