A big waste of time is all you will have to get out of this bag. I praised this hope for a suspense movie with perhaps some credible scenes, but I was disappointed. I think the title should have been "Camping 101", or something like that. Anyway, stay away from this movie. It numbs you death. Do not be afraid of the big foot, be afraid of this shit !!
