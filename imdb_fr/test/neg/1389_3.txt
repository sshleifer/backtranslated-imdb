I am surprised that the comparison has not yet been made between Mind of Mencia and the television show The Awful Truth, broadcast a few years ago. Directed by the controversial director Michael Moore, the show would begin, in the same mansion as this one, with Moore interacting with the audience and presenting segments, including documentary shorts and skits, that had been put together with the aim of provoking reflections on current issues. The difference? Mencia rarely explores the superficial and the reactionary. What he says and does is often rude and rude, and insults his audience's ability to make decisions for himself. There is a difference between being "pissed off", which is not a problem for me, but Mencia tries too hard to do it and ends up seeming arrogant and without much support. He occasionally makes remarks, but often, to get there, you have to sit in front of a pretty humor thirsty for an attempt at shock.
