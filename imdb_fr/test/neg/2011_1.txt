... and it's a shame! Get the sun up and burn all the copies of Dracula 3000. It must be the worst vampire movie of the new millennium so far (I have not seen REIGN IN DARKNESS yet, but they do not get worse than this). Do not be fooled, the cover of the film by H.R. Gigeresque is cool. It's so bad, it's almost hilarious. I can not describe all the emotions evoked by this film. I burst out laughing, I screamed on the screen, I sat numb, nodding in disbelief, ... This movie contains "cheap and cheese". The best thing about this film is opening credits and opening shots that more or less present the CGI of two spaceships. But when Casper Van Dien's voice-over starts, you start feeling something fishy. And, indeed, everything sinks quickly after. <br /> <br /> The crew of a lifeboat finds an abandoned ship, the Demeter, which seems to be heading for the land. They enter, thus sealing their destiny. This film is above all an ALIEN-scam with low budget without scruple, mixed with vampires. The character of Erika Eleniak, Aurora, reveals that she is a robot. Coolio goes out of his way, like smoking drugs and sucking blood 187 (pffff, name of the hood code?!?!). The character of Casper Van Dien is called Capt. Van Helsing (hahaha!) And he looks like ... uh, Casper Van Dien. Udo Kier as Captain Varna, former commander of the Demeter, only appears on a screen and he really seems to have a hard time reading his replicas from an automatic landmark (poor Udo, what are you doing in this movie? ). And then we have Langley Kirkwood as Earl Orlock, one of the most pathetic and laughable Dracula ever to be pardoned on the big screen. Just look at his outfit. Instead of a futuristic black suit or something cool, he wears a cheap Halloween costume at the old school with fringes. You thought Richard Roxburgh was not convincing as a Dracula in VAN HELSING? Then wait to see Langley's performance! <br /> <br /> The designers of the sets were disproportionate. The interior of the Demeter looks like a cross between a tanker and an old steel mill, which they have decorated with lights and terrible colors like green, pink, blue and yellow. The prop-master must have forgotten that this movie takes place in the year 3000, because the characters use weapons that resemble today's .45 caliber and "Prof" uses a non-motorized and non-floating wheelchair. It must be moved to be able to move. <br /> <br /> Apart from a dead corpse, some impalements and a dismemberment, there is absolutely no problem. And the vampire fangs and contact lenses look fake. Add to that the stupidest, stupidest and most abrupt end of all time: Humvee and Aurora are the only survivors. Instead of having one last (bloody) confrontation with the Orlock account, they lock themselves in the control room. Then, Aurora explains that before modernizing her program and joining the use of narcotics, she was a "Protheus 3.2 PB", in other words: a pleasure robot. So she says, "So what are you waiting for?" Humvee replies, "I do not have to repeat it twice, come on, my daughter," take her in her arms and ... "BOOOOOOM !!!" the ship explodes and the credits roll. No sex scene, no Erika, no bloody climax, ... Another photo of Udo Kier reading a line on the monitor and it's over. <br /> <br /> This film is therefore a must for any bad movie lover, but I must warn them: it can be very painful. And everyone claiming that VAN HELSING, UNDERWORLD or even QUEEN OF THE DAMNED is the worst vampire movie of the new millennium is clearly crazy, or just has not seen Dracula 3000 yet.
