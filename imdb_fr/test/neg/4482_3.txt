Today, at the time of the President, my wife and I had the DVD "The Notebook", recorded at the local library. It's a movie released in 2004 that fell under our radar because we are great spectators. I am a published author hoping to play my first book on the screen. I noticed references to "The Notebook" in reviews of other films, so I mentioned it about watching and this morning was the perfect opportunity. We both really liked it. It made my wife cry; we could understand many things in this with our own love story, and even I struggled to the point of suffocation. <br /> <br /> This afternoon, after many chores, work in the yard and meals, we decided morning. When we arrived at the theater, having seen most of the films being played, we chose to see "Victoria Day" which, for some reason, was not at the theater, even though IMDb and my phone movies were syndicated. So, instead, we looked at the "Dear John" poster and the text written by the same author as "The Notebook", making it the obvious choice because we loved "TN" so much. <br /> <br /> What a disappointment! First, the characters did not have the same credibility or sense of empathy as "TN"; and we continued to comment through all the similarities - about twenty or so - quickly leading us to realize that this film was nothing but, as another reviewer commented, "a poor man's notebook!" There was a real "cash cow" feeling, which meant that the Sparks simply cast a story together, based on the exact pattern of "TN", simply to earn quick money. Not only that, after the trollop 'bug-eyed' unlikely 'Dear John's-John' for the patient with cancer of the fluke, we ridiculed the film, going to the silly and soapy line up to the end. We were only about 6 in the theater on this Monday morning at 4:45 pm and my wife even told me to keep it so that I do not spoil it for others ... it was so serious. <br /> <Seeing this on the heels of 'TN' ensured that the similarities between the scams were perfectly recognizable and that Sparks was a blatant and inexpensive attempt to model writing too obvious. We only wish we could see "Victoria Day" instead ... no matter how bad it might have been after seeing this poor movie starter. And oh ... for the last 30 minutes, I kept saying "... do not give the cow this coin ... do not give the cow this coin?"
