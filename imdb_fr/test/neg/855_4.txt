Spike Milligan was one of the funniest men I have ever seen and had a great influence on my life. <br /> <br /> This film is weak and awful, and its memory does not belong to it. The script is cluttered and keeps too many lines of the book intact (the jokes on the legs are incomprehensible). The performances of the actors are uniformly ineffective, a large distribution lost, and the main role, Sean Hughes, delivers the warring hostilities of Milligan in a plaintive groan, which completely misses the point. <br /> <br /> The gentle stimulation is a good killer. The prank should speed up towards the end. The novel "Puckoon" has often been at Goon's shows, but this film slows down when you want the various elements to fit together in a final climax. <br /> <br /> Milligan told an abbreviated audio recording of "Puckoon" in 1980, with TP McKenna, Kelly Dermot, Norma Ronald and Jack Hobbs. Now, it's funny. Ten minutes of this is funnier than all this movie. I think the disc has been transferred to a CD, but I do not know if it is still printed. <br /> <br /> There is a film of "Adolf Hitler: My role in his downfall" with Jim Dale and Arthur Lowe. It's also a hell of a mess, but it's funnier than that. <br /> <br /> It's possible that Milligan's mind is too exuberant for the screen. The other commentators indulge in politeness and wishful thinking. This film escapes almost every occasion and never misses an opportunity to disappoint.
