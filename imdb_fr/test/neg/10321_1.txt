I checked this out for free at the library and I still feel ripped off. Yes, Sandra Bullock is one of them, but only in five scenes totaling barely five minutes, and even these are pretty painful to watch. The rest of the film is so painful that you will spend most of your time hoping it will end soon, but only if you are one of those who have to finish a movie once they have started it. Everyone will just turn it off. Do not worry, you will not miss anything. Bullock's lines (assuming you were prompted to look at this because his name is stuck on the case) are essentially just character notes, like the following dialogue: <br /> <br /> Lisa (Bullock - "Danny, please tell me what's going on." <br /> <br /> Danny - "I do not know." <br /> <br /> Lisa - "Whaddaya means you do not know? " <br /> <br /> Danny - "I do not know - it has something to do with my dad." <br /> <br /> Lisa - "What do you mean by daddy?" <br /> <br /> Danny - "I do not know - he went out of his way or something." <br /> <br /> Lisa - "Why am I here?" <br /> <br /> Danny - "I'm sorry Lisa, I do not know." <br /> <br /> (Moments later) Danny - "Some friends of my father's army ..." <br /> <br /> Lisa - "Whaddaya, my army buddies? " <br /> <br /> Do you know what I mean? <br /> <br /> Conclusion - Just say no.
