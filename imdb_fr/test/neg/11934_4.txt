I would bet a month's salary "The Magnificent Seven Returns" (MSR) was designed for television. Other critics testify that MSR was a theatrical film, and I believe them on word. The logical answer must assume that the film was originally shot for television and that after a change of studio heart, the film was released in theaters. Each actor is above all a television actor: Mariette Hartley, Michael Callen, Ralfe Waite, Stephanie Powers ... all actors of television. Lee Van Cleef shared his time between television and theater screens. Stephanie Powers has only made three or four appearances in the cinema over the last thirty years of a very prolific television career - irrefutable proof that this film was shot for television. Minor players are veteran actors on the small screen who can be seen on old reruns of "Gunsmoke", "Wild Wild West", "Streets of San Francisco", etc., and so on. <br /> <br /> The ho-hum sets are identical to the Universal Studios Tour sets, often seen in old episodic televisions. And editing betrays the speed of shooting the television, with camera movements, positioning, cutting and lighting limited. The soundtrack, exclusive of Berstein's original themes, comes directly from the television of the seventies. Yes, I would bet that the money was shot for television. <br /> <br /> This is an important point in the evaluation of MSR. At first, I watched MSR on the cable, assuming it was an old theatrical release. In comparison with the original "Magnificent Seven", it's a joke, a cartoon, an amateur attempt at film making. Actors, lighting, writing, sets, action, cinematography, music (Berstein themes excluded), editing, stimulation, ... again and again .... all pale in front of the classic "Magnificent Seven", close to the Perfect 60's Western, and one of the best action movies of all time. <br /> <br /> However, as I suspect, this movie is designed for television in the early 70s, it is actually above average. Those who are unlucky enough to live from the 70s to adulthood know what I am talking about. MSR reportedly competed against "Alias ​​Smith and Jones" and similar network shows. During the seventies, "Gunsmoke" was a quality show, focused on the development of the character rather than the action, mitigating the shotgun shooting twice a week. The first shootout, usually a murder, sets off the plot of the hour - the second shootout culminates the episode by killing the guest star, his sworn enemy, or resolving the conflict with Marshal Matt Dillon. MSR has more action than a whole season of "Gunsmoke". In this context - in this frame of reference - MSR is a fair entertainment, above the tariff of the television of this decade.
