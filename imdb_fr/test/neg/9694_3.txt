Sorry about that. But if you have seen this "epic", you will obviously know total disregard for the very text of the Bible. Now, I am not exactly the next candidate for holiness, but I know the basics. And the basics were this. God wanted to erase everyone from the surface of the Earth because he believed that they had been corrupted to the point of no return. He chose Noah, the rough diamond, and his family was spared because of their uncorrupted methods. Noah builds an ark according to God's instructions to house him, his family, and two other creatures as he floods the rest of the planet. These are the basics. In this film, other people roam around the seas, such as hawkers and pirates. But I thought EVERYONE was annihilated. I guess NBC executives never went to church. I'm told there are other inaccuracies, but being an average Joe, I have no idea what they are. Sorry. Back to the movie, it was inaccurate, as previously mentioned, stink acting, but some of the effects were good, I will give it. But overall, I saw a better and more elegant rendition of the story made as a small scene about The Simpsons. May God help the leaders of the NBC to come on the day of judgment. 3/10
