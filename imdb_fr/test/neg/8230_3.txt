It's a strange film. On the surface, it is no different from many other gores of quality d but stands out at least in some respects. First, the main character of the killer is really weird. How on earth a guy who never laughs like a chicken has been released on parole, totally overwhelms me. What was the thought of this woman member of the parole board: "He is totally reformed and rehabilitated". He's giggling! Another problem with Luther the Geek is the script / direction for women. The girl is so pathetic and apparently stupid that if she were mine, I would slap her. In trying to pull her mother out of bed, she struggles with knots and just does not seem to think, "I'm going to get some scissors or a knife." Later, in a similar attempt to untie her mother, she wanders down the stairs and starts looking for scissors in a box containing scrap metal. She ends up having a knife. By the way, it's after the killer is clearly out of the car and just got back. Bizarre. On the positive side, the girl took out her shower kit, so it was nice, although it was once again unusual. It seems that in many of these category D gay movies, they show with joy that the throat is open, but that the view of a breast is too strong for the public. In general, it worked, but it was annoying and nasty, even if the bare breasts were partly compensating.
