A veteran, just out of his ninjutsu training, finds an old friend in Manila and finds himself fighting a powerful land baron. <br /> <br /> But does that really interest you? If you even read this page, you must know something about what to expect. It's your typical chop-socky, with ridiculous dialect, naughty mega-nerds, apocalyptic sound editing, and a camera that catches your eye. The battle sequences, wonderfully choreographed by Mike Stone and the real master Sho Kosugi, are the only reason to be seen in public with this film. Franco Nero is not left out either, assuming you can see around the mustache. <br /> <br /> Well, I'm too harsh. There are good laughs - take advantage of Christopher George repeatedly shouting "Ninja!" and deliver probably the most wacky death scene ever captured on film.
