Finally, I can connect the dots between the Return of the Jedi and the Phantom Menace. We see here where Lucas lost touch with what was the strength of the original Star Wars movies and started descending into the plot, which is less tripy than the ruined 1-3 episodes. This film is more like one of those low-budget swords and low-budget wizards than anything worthy of the Star Wars saga. As with the Jar-Jar character, this seems to target children (and the toy market). The battle scenes are particularly bad. It was depressing to see Sian Phillips' incredible talent sink into such a mess, after his classic performance in I, Claudius.
