I will never go to another Tarantino movie. The whole movie was worthless. My wife and I regret we did not get up and not be out at the first indication of what the movie was going to be really (which is still difficult to determine because it was such a ridiculous scenario ... from blood, courage and violence seemed to be the only real theme), but we still hoped there would be something that would redeem nearby. Unfortunately, there was none because nothing made sense! We, along with many other people in the audience, came out of the theater mumbling "it was disgusting," "what a waste of time," "I should have gone out," "where was the comedy," "c was pathetic, etc. That made us, the public, tell us our disgust and the feeling that we had just been completely ripped off.The only thing that deserves the movie is the costume and the ability to almost everyone in the movie, I note this as a 1 because there is no 0. I do not quite understand how we can give a higher score to a 0!
