A brief marital infidelity comes back to haunt his beloved wife, Grace Needham (represented by the always sexy Nastassja Kinski). <br /> <br /> She had left the city and her depressed husband to go to the Miami sun. was pursued and finally seduced by Julian Grant, a nicely mischievous and manipulative businessman, who is very well described by William Baldwin (why do all the Baldwin brothers play so badly with bad guys?) <br /> <br Grace's seduction took place as the two men were drinking champagne on a deserted beach that they reached in private by sailboat. Grace confessed to drinking too much for her good and revealed the many problems of her marriage. Julian gained his confidence by saying that he would never let such problems occur if he had a relationship with Grace. Julian's manipulation continued as he described a fantasy "lost at sea" involving Grace, now uninhibited, sitting beside him, listening to each of his words and engaging more and more in his romantic dream. <br /> <br /> Paid Manipulation Some subtle thrusts led to Grace's gentle kisses, momentarily interrupted by her retreat, as if she suddenly thought to herself, 'What am I doing?' I am a woman I am a mother I have a real life. Real responsibilities. Of course, we both talked about being together, lost at sea, but it's just a fantasy. Look what we are doing here. The consequences are real. We are really alone on a secluded beach. Am I going to let this fantasy come true? '<br /> <br /> She succumbs to the dream as her kisses become more passionate. Once guarded, Grace, who responded to the men's proposals by saying "I'm married," watched Julian unbutton his shirt, which led to more kisses, bodily strokes and his climb to Julian's lap! She smiles, kisses, moans, laughs and often looks up to the sun when it was unfortunately a brief love scene in which everyone seemed to be wearing most of her clothes. <br /> <br /> The air of illicit passion on Grace's face while the formerly devoted wife was completely satisfied when sleeping with a man who clearly likes to manipulate others, I would say that, overall, the scene did not deserve the "R" rating of the movie. <br /> <br /> Julian returned home to find her rejuvenated husband after landing a high-paying job. She is delighted to be able to return to a normal life where she can become a loving woman and a benevolent mother. <br /> But the evil Julian Grant reappears and does not want to abandon Grace so easily. Thanks to a plan to get rid of Julian, but will it work? <br /> <br /> Obviously, I do not want to ruin the scenario that remains for you. However, I will say that I still like movies involving a sexual assumption on the part of a woman (especially when she shows a flawless attraction and behavior normally reserved for her husband), but in reality seeks revenge for antagonist. This movie would have been much, much better if the movie had included more of that in the story. My feelings are that if the film mentions it, then the film should finish it. And this film certainly raised it. Unfortunately, some constraints in history have prevented this process from continuing in a meaningful way. Many other available movies succeed exactly on this point and I will include their titles in the "recommendations" section of this section. I am also willing to receive suggestions from other films containing a good story involving a sexual feint from an apparently devoted wife by e-mail. <br /> <br /> Overall, Nastassja Kinski and William Baldwin are both very good. The film is not.
