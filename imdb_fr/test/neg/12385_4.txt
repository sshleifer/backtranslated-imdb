I love old "monster movies" for the sheer value of the camp. This one will not disappoint if you find this kind of thing amusing. <br /> <br /> The acting game is a sheer crap of the 1950s. You get used to it when you've seen enough ... the dialogue is very ridiculous and ultimately unforgettable. You are right there for the giant bird. <br /> <br /> The "science" in this movie is hilarious. A monstrous avian from another world who can manipulate anti-matter ... with the intention of wreaking havoc and devouring people ... an alien who came to Earth to make his nest. Some of the best scenes in the film (which do not contain the bird) include the "scientists" explaining what is happening. <br /> <br /> There has been a lot of talk about the ridiculous bird puppet. It looks like a new baby bird ... bald and ugly with ruffled feathers. He even frolics like a hungry and angry young man. However, the bird scared the shit of my three-year-old son, who had big scary nightmares for the evening. It's a little scary. <br /> <br /> I was very sad about the scene where they shot the egg. (In one way or another, the egg is not protected by an antimatter shield.) But I'm a bird lover, what can I say?
