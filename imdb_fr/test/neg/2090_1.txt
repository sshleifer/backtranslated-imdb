Last Friday, I went to see "Snakes on a plane" with my friends. It was incredible compared to this horrible film (however, many scenes were ridiculously hilarious). Basically, a woman has a Mayan curse in which she erects harmless striped snakes that, instead of attacking, crawl inside their victim. The girl with the bag of coke is hot enough. On the title screen, it says "100 passengers ... 3 000 vipers!" Scary, I know. There were not even 100 passengers on the train. Only two stoners and a few other losers have been eliminated. It's worth five dollars to see the woman turn into a huge CG snake and devour the whole train, then get sucked into a huge vortex. It's just sad that someone is doing everything in their power to make a shitty movie, only to earn a few dollars because of the craze for "snakes on the plane".
