As noted in other reviews here, the work of the camera is ridiculously bad. I am tempted to say that the director of photography is 7 years old, but that it would be naughty - at 7 years old. <br /> <br /> Okay, but what about the subject? I was looking for an overview of the state of the wine industry in the world, you know, Mondovino. The film speaks of a very narrow vision of a plot in this world: the fight between Mondavi and the French and Italian wineries they would like to buy. There is no illuminating narrative that would put the whole affair into context, so we end up with the process of selecting the director and interviews with the different characters of this little psychodrama. There is no lack of despicable characters, or even despicable dogs. However, there is a lack of equity. <br /> <br /> Is the director Marxist? I was wondering then that I was trying to maintain a semblance of focus as the camera dipped, deviated, zoomed into a chaotic plume. Small farmer in France: good. Big producer in the United States: very, very bad. Forget the hundreds of small wineries in North America, Australia and South America. There is a dead horse to beat here for more than two hours. <br /> <br /> To learn more about the plot, you'd better read about it elsewhere. And you will be able to taste your favorite wine without feeling sick while doing it. <br /> <br /> I propose a new prize in Cannes for the best American diatribe.
