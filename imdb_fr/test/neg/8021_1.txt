I can say with confidence that this is the worst film I have ever seen and I love foreign films. The film is nothing more than a badly made violent pornography. If you choose to see it, get ready for endless sexism, free nudity scenes and a stupid and sensational rape scene, which I am sure is the main attraction for movie lovers. <br /> <br /> In addition, the plot meanders aimlessly, and none of the characters are sympathetic. Many scenes are filmed from the woods surrounding the river where girls constantly feel that someone is harassing them, which was a pathetic attempt to compensate for the lack of story to tell. <br /> <br /> Maybe I would not have lost my time seeing the movie, if it had been accurately described in the reviews.
