Why do five United States keep repeating this one? the title says it all: the plot is as clear as a book read in a language you have never heard of and which looks like nothing. <br /> <br /> You will see 90 minutes of change of location, most of them. will be exploded later in the film. From the beginning, you see a pretty little farm typical of Berry, which in the film was moved near Paris but does not survive very well to "transport" to the Ile de France: it explodes a minute later. there are also two gangsters who do not have a language, as if that would make sense in the world of SMS and the Internet, not to mention the pencil and paper. <br /> <br /> It goes on like this, nothing makes sense in this. story. my only credit goes to the cameraman, the camera is excellent.
