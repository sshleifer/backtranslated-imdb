I saw the MST3K version of this movie and it's a bad movie - but it's not as bad as its low IMDB rating (currently 1.8 out of 10). At least the film has some production values ​​and it apparently had a competent editor (unlike movies that are really awful). The main problem of this movie is that it had no appealing character. The main character, Marv, is so pathetically depressed that he asks almost anything that happens to him badly. And he is not very intelligent either, or he would have imagined to stay out of the girl accomplice Betty. And even more pathetic than Marv, it is his father, who is only a drunken loser. The highlight of the film is the sequence at the end, but even if it is so weakly executed, any excitement that could have been added to the film is totally absent. At least, this movie was designed for a very entertaining episode of MST3K because Mike and the "Bots" are doing a great job of mocking him.
