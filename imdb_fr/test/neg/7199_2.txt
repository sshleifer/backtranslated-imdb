This is the first film of the Italian Ed Wood that I watched, Demofilo Fidani, aka Miles Deem. The title above was added superfluously afterwards, since there is another 1961 film with the same title and starring Richard Basehart. This is Michael Carreras' one and only stab at Hammer Films; the authentic Italian title was originally translated by HIS NAME WAS SAM WALBASH, BUT THEY WILL AURA BE APPOINTED AMEN? <br /> <br /> Although it is certainly not bad, the cases of awkwardness and inaptitude abound and I often carried laughter: a horrible figure by a so-called French singer; a brawl of bar-lounges totally irrelevant; the actors make somersaults when they are shot; an elderly villager doing an impromptu dance routine; inefficient (or even abusive) use of idling; and, what is arguably the most absurd, to see Gordon Mitchell and Lincoln Tate play against two shooters (who are named after their actors!) engaged by the villain to kill the main character and never make them appear in the rest of the movie! ! <br /> <br /> The lead actor Robert Woods is just that, even for ineffably whispering Amens on the bodies of his victims. Support the actress Simonella Vitelli (actually, the director's own daughter!) As wide of the villain is pretty spectator, but unfortunately she does not have much to do in the movie ?? despite a change of heart towards the end. The main musical theme is actually quite good but, again, the title song is in itself pretty ugly.
