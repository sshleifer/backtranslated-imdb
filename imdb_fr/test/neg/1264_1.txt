Czech moviegoers may have appreciated and evaluated this film because it was Czech, but I found it banal, tedious, weak, boring and tasteless. Again, I suspect a "ramp up" in order to increase sales of this movie dog. Amazon describes this film as a couple of friends who refuse to grow up, but I'll go a step further - I think it's about two guys who have entered a state of madness and who are performing actions that have no meaning to anyone. I was told that one of the actors of the film had committed suicide after the film and I would believe it. When he saw his performance, he probably figured out how much he had done a terrible job and that the only way to avoid the final embarrassment was to do the "big exit", which was, I am sure, much more spectacular and many had done in "Autumn Spring". Do not waste your time and money on this pathetic performance. It's just a dog in a manger.
