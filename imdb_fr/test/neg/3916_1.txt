Oh dear! ohdear! ohdear! ohdear! <br /> <br /> I love science fiction, but this ... um ... a "movie" is a shame for space movies. All of the sci-fi films I've seen in the last year have been disappointing to a certain extent, and I'm seriously reconsidering the kind of movies I really like in the future !! (Maybe I'll be watching love movies from now!) <br /> <br /> SPOILERS ALERT! (And that does not say much!) <br /> <br /> This movie is so stupid that it rivals Battlefield Earth and Baby Geniuses. The special effects are obviously wrong, the Big Mac Truck looked ruthless with its rollercoaster seat attachments, the killer robots looked like a more silly version of the Power Rangers, a huge fat guy is sucked first by a hole in window and. .. Space Truck School ??? WTF? <br /> <br /> Mr. Hopper can do better than that. What was really stinky, it's the two pretty young things that accompany it and only hang in their underwear (??) during two thirds of the film! The obligatory "sex scene" (sneer!) Between our young heroes was so badly executed that I nearly choked on me looking at the tonsils while laughing at the television screen. <br /> <br /> The only character to mention is the captain / cyborg of the pirate ship / mad scientist. It was oozing the grotesque word and was predictable, but I think it could have been much more threatening. He does and says things pretty funny (all the best scenes concern him!), So for the captain, I give an extra point to this film. <br /> <br /> But this movie is so bad that it will make you want to throw some abuse on TV or maybe throw your TV out the window! It can even kill some brain cells and put you in a catatonic state. <br /> <br /> CONCLUSION? I like the way the captain has trouble moving on his stake leg, when it's obviously a fake stake leg! I would have given 0 out of 10, but as he pisses me off with his disguised antics ... this movie has a 1/10!
