I saw most of John Waters' films. With the exception of several of his very first films that are not available, I have seen almost all of them. It is obvious that I am a big fan and that it is certain that I have a big tolerance for the crude and irreverent in his films. . Although disproportionate and disgusting, I loved FEMALE TROUBLE and POLYESTER - two monumental tributes to bad taste and excess that are seriously funny movies. So, I'm certainly not hungry and I can take most of what Waters has to offer. However, in PINK FLAMINGOS, he created a film so repulsive, so funny and so shocking that I could not even stand it. In his other films that he made before becoming more mainstream, they were funny. However, here, the humor is not at the rendezvous because it seems that the intention is to shock the viewers and not to entertain them in any way whatsoever. I'm glad that after the filming of this film, Waters' sense of humor has been improved, because Divine consuming dog feces (as in this movie) are shocking but not the least entertaining. My advice is to skip this film and act as if nothing had happened, and then watch its infinitely better movies of the 70s and 80s.
