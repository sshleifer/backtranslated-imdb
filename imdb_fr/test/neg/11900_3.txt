I had rented this type of "soft core" before, but honestly, I did not expect it to be the same type as "Rod Steele: We only live to the death" - both sexy and funny. There was a good scenario, a sincere leader and a sense of purpose. He also has Gabriella Hall who is hot. The reason I did not expect this film was because it lacked the sticker "Must be 18 years old for rent". I was looking for more "cheese" and less "cheesecake". <br /> <br /> First, I think that movies should not be allowed to start with "actors" rehearsing for a role in an art agency (or wherever "actors" repeat ). In this film, seeing the "actors" in rehearsal highlights the lack of preparation needed to interpret the real characters in the film. <br /> <br /> OK, after discovering that this film was a hard core, I did not do it. I do not necessarily disable it and demand my money. But, the dizzying way of adding extensive video "erotic" scenes to what was probably a late night cable payout is very boring and easy to advance quickly without the consistent quality, say, of Rod Steele. You know they had to have some money, because I think part of it is filmed abroad. <br /> <br /> I will have to say that the main actor trying to NOT reverse the invisibility potion on himself is one of the most disconcerting acting jobs I have ever seen. And I saw Torgo from Manos! In fact, it may have been worth the rental fee in dollars (that and Gabriella Hall). Still, there are better nerdy movies to rent with your friends.
