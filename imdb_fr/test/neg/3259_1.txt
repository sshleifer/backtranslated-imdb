After watching Caddyshack 1, I heard about a sequel and decided to search for it. The film seemed pretty bad and I told myself to stay away, but I, stupid, I gave in and I bought this damn thing! All the reviews and all you have heard about Caddyshack II are true. The film is simply used to the most unhealthy ideas and plot and jokes I've ever heard, the gopher, the movie's game is really bad (Randy Quaid was funny though). <br /> <br /> Stay away this movie is all I can really say. I deeply regret having watched and bought the DVD, but I'm not sure which decision was the worst. Stay away as much as possible.
