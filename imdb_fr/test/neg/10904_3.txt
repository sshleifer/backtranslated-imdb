If only he had not wanted clich√©, Mr. Shiban could have really made a good movie from this story. It was just different enough to keep you interested. So, with the same time, the same energy and money spent on this stinker, we might have had something good instead of being dazzling. <br /> wise, it's as good as you would expect from a handheld camcorder, so it gets good grades. This is really the scenario that is involved, because the acting was not so bad either, given what the actors had to work with. <br /> <br /> I thought the time was past when we were going to see someone, To find a radio transceiver they desperately want to use, first turn the buttons from end to end, turn down -the 6 or 7 times, then expect it to work. This story is spoiled by a continuous series of stupid moves by all the characters except the villain. It's as if we thought we were too superficial to grab all the tools of the plot, so they're all spoon-fed to make sure we get them. <br /> <br /> I do not know about you, but it does not work on me. My attention ends up being occupied by exaggerated intrigues and dramatizations, not by history. <br /> <br /> So, as I thought it was not so bad from a technical point of view, I think Mr. Shiban should try again, only with an appropriate script next time; so he could give us something to watch.
