At the beginning of the film, Ramgopal Verma says that "Sarkar" is his tribute to the Godfather. This one feels more like an insult. It is terribly derisory compared to the classic Coppola. Although no one expects Ramgopal Verma to fill Coppola's shoes, the film has generated a lot of waiting and buzz. <br /> <br /> Amitabh Bachchan plays "Sarkar", a character automatically establishing instant comparisons with the Supremo Bal Thackeray of the Indian political party Shiv Sena. Abhishek Bachchan plays his son Shankar who returns from abroad and is caught in Sarkar's politics at home. Just like Al Pacino in the original sponsor. <br /> <br /> Like most Bollywood rates, the incidents and characters are overtly simplistic and devoid of any solid foundation. Quick phone calls and sudden announcements make the film switch from one direction to another. Abishek is heading towards the dark underground politics and crime network of Mumbai's underground world as a duck takes over. Amithab Bachchan as Sarkar is supposed to be beautiful and powerful, he ends up just looking old and helpless. Most of his play is focused on the constant observation of different things around the film set: the actor in front of him, the floor or any other random direction. <br /> <br /> However, Kay Kay behaves extremely well as an unwarranted elder son, Vishnu. The same goes for Zakir Hussain as Rashid, the Dubai-based drug smuggler who wants to make himself known in Mumbai. This actor has an impressive presence on the screen and can send you chills in the back with his appearance. By the time he enters the screen, you want to run and hide under the bed. <br /> <br /> Despite all its obvious flaws, the film performed well at the box office. The buzz and the cast of big stars obviously help. Also, Verma manages to maintain your interest, even slightly, towards the second half of the film. It's actually a follow-up to this one, which, I'm sure, will be more of the same price.
