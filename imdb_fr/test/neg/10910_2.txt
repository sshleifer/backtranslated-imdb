Some filmmakers can not be wrong in the eyes of national critics, so you should never pay attention to them. This film is a perfect example. Critics like director Eric Rohmer. <br /> <br /> This film is a boring drama about a woman and a teenager ("Pauline") she deals with during the summer and their relationship with some men. . It's talking, talking, talking and talking again. <br /> <br /> For those who look at the cover and hope to be amazed, some quick naked shots and some curses, but otherwise, it's a harmless French game of morality. A friend of mine lent me this tape. He thought he had a sexy French movie and was disappointed. I was just as disappointed because it was so boring. <br /> <br /> It's almost impossible to understand how this is going.
