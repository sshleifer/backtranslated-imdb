First of all, I am in the United States. <br /> <br /> The first time I saw this, I thought it was an obvious - and disgusting - attack on "The Office" (UK). I would have awarded zero star to this one, but now, it came out well before the series Ricky Gervais. <br /> <br /> However, it is difficult to watch this show or another with a similar dynamic (including "Office" American) without comparison. It's just not close to the same thing. <br /> <br /> I will credit him with being original and ahead of his time. I will also say that this - and the "Office" and "Larry Sanders" in the United States are true satires. The British "office" is something bigger and more transcendent, as if populated by real people in events that seemed to be happening. However, contrary to what is said here or to Christopher Guest's "false documents", it's not really a satire, while "The Newsroom" is certainly not. <br /> <br /> Anyway, "The Newsroom" is still not. I'm very funny. He is distant and self-conscious, but his team and his team are not smart enough or talented enough to steal the goods. It is a heavy comedy worn on weak shoulders. Commendable, but ultimately not recommended. <br /> <br /> --- And what about the lack of anamorphic DVD ?! I know that the film was shot in anamorphic big screen because I saw the pilot episode on one of our HD channels. CBC, follow the program. ; )
