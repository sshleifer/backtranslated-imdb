Frankly, I did not think this movie was humorous. It was really bad and badly done, without any conspiracy. Surprisingly, it made me laugh at first with the Malcolm X terminal and that was about it. Seriously, Soul Plane has made sure that even the worst films like Gigli look like an Emmy winner. This movie is not worth seeing unless of course you are blind like Johnny Witherspoon who played the blind in the movie (another sad character). I stuck in front of the majority of stereotypical jokes and ruined Tom Arnold and D.L Hughley by putting them in this movie. This film could be summarized in one sentence. Nashawn earns $ 100,000,000 and creates his own airline, sex, drugs, homosexuality, more sex, drugs, did I mention sex? If I could, I would note this film in full negative, however, the beginning was fun, which brings this film to a 1/10. Make the "t bag" pfft!
