Although my exposure to world cultures is limited, I try. It was a movie that I tried and hated. Worse, after hearing so many people criticize the shameful nature of the typical Hollywood fare and its stereotypical caricatures, I have seen characters too outrageous for "Eastenders" presented as realistic. <br /> <br /> Clint wants to get out of the drugs. and for that, he aspires to be a waiter. Aim high, I always say. Brad Dorif, or a photo of him by fax, or most likely a curly wig on a stick, it was hard to say, offers to hire Clint if he receives a pair of shoes. <br /> <br /> Clint and a vast entourage, apparently wandering all over England trying to get him some shoes. Finally, they end up in a suburban home. Which is not clear. Mom helps a girl get up. Oh, now there is realism for you! Ms. Brady may have been a ridiculous stereotype of American housewives, but she never helped Marsha to gang up and find a vein. Good God! Dad goes home and sings some tunes of Elvis, then hunt the kids. <br /> <br /> Why did Clint not borrow money and buy shoes at a used-goods store? Why did not he go to a church to ask a nun for help? Why did not he spend time in front of a shoe store? I do not know! None of these things seemed to be below him. Charitable groups, such as Goodwill and the Salvation Army, have stores to help people. I know people who work there! If a person without money came in and needed shoes, the staff would give him some. Maybe not Prada or Gucci, but a form of foot cover. Few of these groups distribute cell phones to the disadvantaged, but shoes are generally not a problem. What a stupid concept. The world, or at least the west, is just not so cruel. In England, it may come from the Royal Queen's Charity rather than goodwill, but people who need shoes get it. <br /> <br /> Apart from the search for shoes, there was nothing to discern the plot. of the action. Not that it makes the movie faster or more bearable, notice. Although I checked the jacket several times, I did not look at the long version of 20 hours, it seemed to be like that. <br /> <br /> Did Clint get his shoes? Did the cut cardboard of Brad Dourif engage him in the restaurant? Have I ever seen anything else foreign? <br /> <br /> [spoiler] Yes, yes and yes. <br /> <br /> Regarding the fate of this particular movie, I decided to end all its activities. I pulled out my S & W .45 and drilled a half-inch hole in the cassette. Blammo! (I made sure to rewind it first.) I put it back in the cassette sleeve, I gave it to the rental store and, amazingly, nobody ever asked us to ask him !!! Which means, of course, that no one else has rented it for at least the last three years I lived in this city. Others knew something that I did not know. Live and learn. <br /> <br /> BTW, if you rent something you have never seen before and someone has put a bullet on it, take it as a sign. And if you work in Kroger's video department, I'm kidding. <br /> <br /> Footnote: This classic has not yet emerged on DVD, for which we should be eternally grateful to the digital gods. .
