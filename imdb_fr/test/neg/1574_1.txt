this attempt at "thriller" would have no substance! Some may say that this movie "has it all?" Autism, arson, robbery, lost love, money bag, slaughter, murder, blood, tipped-nosed revolver, clenched teeth, moans, breasts (different definitions that can be used), big flashlights, tribal people, one duo brother tempting to portray "beast and beast", white wolves, scenes of fights that look like "happy slaps", snow vehicles, a large tracked vehicle and a motel under renovation? All this, with a melody "Enyanesque" towards the end ... <br /> <br /> Maybe my note is a little harsh, but a single viewing will certainly be enough for the cin√©maphile sensible that has nothing else to do. <br /> <br /> Yeowza!
