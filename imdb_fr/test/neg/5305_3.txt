Chili Palmer is tired of making movies and knows he wants to succeed in music. Negotiator half mafia and half expert, he wants to enter the music market. However, be aware that everyone is like him and making sure that the good singer Linda Moon records a hit will be more difficult than expected. The first part is funny and full of irony, it falls into easy jokes and has a lot less good times. Only the two women (Uma and Milian) are decent in their role. Most of the film is made with a histrionic character, excessively exaggerated (a little, OK, too disgusting) and the only one that can be saved is the gay bodyguard, which, at least, is consistent, the rest is too much idiot . The most surprising thing is the fact that the film is not boring, that everything happens so fast and that so much happens that you do not have time to get bored if you want to follow the movie. This can insult your intelligence (a lot!), And the movie is bad (yes!), But hey, it's not boring.
