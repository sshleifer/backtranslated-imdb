I suggest that if you've ever seen the original American Graffiti, do not see this movie. If you have not seen the original, I still do not recommend it, but it will be a lot less painful to watch. The characters in the first movie are great, and in the end you came across a connection. This film shows how difficult their lives have become. It's a chore to watch! <br /> <br /> On the eve of the New Year in 1964, 1965, 1966 and 1967, we have four stories about the characters in the first film. In 1964, we have John Milner (Paul Le Mat), who is now a professional drag racer. He meets a foreign girl, Eva, and although his plot leads nowhere, it's the best of four. In 1965, we have Toad (Charles Martin Smith) who is stuck in Vietnam and, most of all, he wants to go out. He is trying to find ways to hurt himself or do stupid things to get by. In 66, we have Debbie (Candy Clark), the girl that Toad took over in the first movie. Now she's a hippie who smokes drugs and I'm really not sure about her plot. She was going to a concert ... not much happened. Finally, in 1967, Steve Bolander (Ron Howard) and Laurie Bolander (Cindy Williams) have marriage problems that end with an anti-war rally and police action. <br /> <br /> None of these stories are very good. The script in some parts presents a very, very bad dialogue. These poor characters that I enjoyed so much in the first film ended up where they are here ... why? Why was this sequel done? I guess if a sequel had to be done, it had to include the Vietnam War, the hippies and the police action, but the real problem is that this movie should not have been shot. <br /> <br /> The management was elegant, but that amounts to a huge headache. Each story has a different style. Milner is just a regular widescreen (depending on how you look at it), and is filmed like the rest of the movie. The plot of Toad was shot in 16mm and gives a poor quality image, which corresponds to the size of a small box in the middle of the screen. Debbie's plot is shot in multi-screen. At one point, there may have been only one screen, but for the good majority, it can be two to twenty screens simultaneously. Do not try to follow the screens, because anyway, nothing happens. The plot of Steve and Laurie has the strangest shooting style. His style really does not mean anything, he is stupid and useless. Instead of a full-screen panoramic, this is a condensed panoramic screen that looks like a full-screen version of the widescreen. Although I do not like others, at least I understand what they were looking for, it just does not make sense. <br /> <br /> Music is the grace of this film, it may not save it! Bob Dylan, Simon and Grafunkel, Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye and dozens of others have beautiful songs presented here. They do not save functionality, they just make it a little better than it is. It's always bad! <br /> <br /> All in all, it's a useless sequel. Any fan of the original should avoid this dull suite! <br /> <br /> My note: * 1/2 on ****. 110 minutes PG for language, drug use and violence
