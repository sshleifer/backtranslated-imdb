This movie was so stupid that I could not believe what I saw while watching it. It was like a huge train wreck. I could not look away because it was so horribly horrible! I can honestly say that I have never seen anything so serious in my life. It was so cheesy and the acting was so bad that I kept telling myself, "It must be some kind of joke, is not it, Nobody really wants to make such a disgusting movie, right? " I really hope it's just a bad joke and these people do not expect people to look right in their eyes, and I really hope the people who were in this movie were doing terrible things and did not really believe they were good actors ?! Drag-queens are fun enough to watch, just like the nerdy special effects straight out of a bad science-fiction movie of the 80s. <br /> <br /> Look at this only if you've seen all the other movies in existence first and there is nothing to watch! I would give a "0" if it were possible.
