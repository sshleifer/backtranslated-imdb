I had to undergo this film three times while I was an extra zombie in the director's new film After Sundown. The first time I saw this movie, the director was standing next to me and a visibly fake and old-fashioned hand came out of nowhere and grabbed one of the characters. I could not any more. I burst out laughing right in front of the guy. The film has no direction and the only thing that could make this film decent (Female Nudity) was not found. I'm a fan of low-budget horror movies, but it was too much for me. The worst was that I had to watch it so many times. Also, do not expect the new movie to be better.
