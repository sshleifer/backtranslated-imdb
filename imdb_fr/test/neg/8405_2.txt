I think "Rosemary's Baby" is the most overrated horror movie. Not scary, interesting or a lot of nothing. It's pretty well run and Ruth Gordon was wonderful but that's about it. But this sequel gives the impression that "Gone With the Wind"! <br /> <br /> I caught this on TV at the age of 14. Unfortunately, I still remember it. As far as I remember, Andrew, Rosemary's baby, has grown up now and the coven wants him to take power (his world). But there are forces trying to stop him ... and Andrew has doubts himself ... <br /> <br /> I give this a 2 for several reasons: Gordon is in this situation (and stays very good); Stephen McHattie was actually quite good like Andrew and there is a disturbing moment at the beginning with Rosemary (Patty Duke) who was "kidnapped" by a bus ... without a driver. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, it's boring, silly and useless. The original does not need a sequel! The rest of Ira Levin's book in 1999 was hardly better. <br /> <br /> Tune Duke to start with Duke ... then sign out. Not worth it.
