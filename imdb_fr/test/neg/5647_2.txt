A pretty awful movie, I'm surprised that Derek Jacobi & Vanessa Redgrave have agreed to participate, it's like a very long-running episode of a TV series of poor detectives. <br /> <br /> The biggest fault must be Vinnie Jones, he just can not act. Whoever had the brilliant idea of ​​appointing him as a manager wants to examine his head if he did not invest his money in the project? He should stick to playing with thugs, looking menacing and NOT talking! <br /> <br /> The central heating was also at the time of Dickens because there were three big radiators behind his office ?? <br /> <br /> No wonder they gave it away for free with a newspaper, because nobody would pay to see that.
