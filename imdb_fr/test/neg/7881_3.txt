How to make a movie as challenging as possible? This shocking straight-haired heterosexual tries to get two low-life Parisian women (a prostitute, a former porn actress recently raped), going wild and indulging in a national celebration of murder and men in particular. <br /> <br /> A very short duration of operation gives you an idea of ​​the experimental nature of this violently hardcore "Thelma & Louise" - but it is done completely without any irony or contemplation of any feminist message possible ... you are not too close to the protagonists, the violence is actually dumb and numb - and that may be a good thing. <br /> <br /> As a liberal advocate of freedom of expression, I always welcome when the "serious" film industry dares to contain full-fledged sex scenes.
