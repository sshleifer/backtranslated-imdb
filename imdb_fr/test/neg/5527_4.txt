The problem with this film, however, is that the final, the cream of the film, the battle between the two inflated ships, must be well done. Disappointingly, this scene in Ironclads is obviously entirely made with models of miniature ships in a bathtub invaded by vegetation. There is no tension, few explanations about exactly what is happening and the timing of the confrontation. <br /> <br /> The film takes a lot of liberties with the story that surrounds it, as do all true stories once converted. to a film, such as the traitor Union and more particularly that of Betty Stuart (Madsen), a belle of Virginia. <br /> <br /> He uses a decent film with an interesting story about preaching about the evils of slavery. It was misplaced in this historical drama and it was a cheap ploy to attract viewers. This has only succeeded in reducing the positive aspects of the film.
