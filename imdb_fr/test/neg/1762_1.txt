<br /> <br /> This film does not really have anything special. With Reverend Phillip Seymour Hoffman complaining about his constipation and humor in the bathroom in a two-and-a-half-hour movie, you know they did not make any cuts and they left the shit literally . It is a waste of good talent and total embarrassment. Terrible! <br /> <br />
