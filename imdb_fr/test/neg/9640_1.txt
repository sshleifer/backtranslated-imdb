I find it terribly ironic that "the left wing" Hollywood continues to protect itself, making these terrible, lukewarm movies that do not condemn the war on terror or embrace it. <br /> <br /> If you're a Sixties survivor and a committed pacifist, and you're hoping for a total wartime conviction like BORN ON FOURTH JULY or QUIET ON THE WEST FRONT, this movie will really look like a scam. None of these soldiers really questioned this war, nor any war, nor the idea of ​​war. They only fear having to do another tour. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, if you are a patriotic American who wants to see a story of courage and honor, this movie will really look like a scam. . None of these soldiers love America, nor do they like service. The way they move and clog makes them look more like suburban teens than hard men. We are not SOLDIERS, nor SANDS OF IWO JIMA. It's not even a stupid action, and the war scenes are less RAMBO and more BUFFY. <br /> <br /> Ryan Philippe can not completely realize this kind of film. Although he's incredibly sexy, in a brutal business, in a men's room, in the bisexual way, it's hard to imagine him as a slow-talking Texan boy who wants to stand up and be counted. This is not a Sgt. Croft in Mailer THE NUDES AND THE DEAD. He is more like Joel in OTHER VOICES, OTHER ROOMS of Truman Capote. He can not sell you on the idea that he was in combat and did his part, OR that he wants his wife and wants her right away. It sparkles on the battlefield and in the bedroom scenes, seemingly preferring to bend over and take a good, stiff attack from behind.
