My god, do I hate this movie! I saw it in preview 13 years ago and I still have bad flashback. It was, without a doubt, the worst movie I have ever paid to see. It was poorly written, misdirected and (surprisingly given the casting) badly done. I would prefer to be thrown from a roof on sharp spikes, then my skin flayed, rather than sitting on it again. Can you guess I did not appreciate?
