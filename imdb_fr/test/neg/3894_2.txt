I saw this film twice, once a few years ago at the university and last weekend. Although I absolutely despised it the first time, I decided to give it another chance. Terrence Malick is clearly a highly respected director, and it seems that IMDb viewers, at the very least, appreciate the film a lot. But unfortunately, it seems that my tastes have not changed at all. <br /> <br /> Where to start? On the one hand, Linda Manz's narration is horrible. Her voice is so irritating to this awful New York accent (do not try to convince me that the people of Chicago speak this way - they do not do it). She admitted to sitting down and talking about random things, which does not make her a talented actress. She does not even act! I arrived on IMDb hoping to see it torn, because its performance is so laughable, but people seemed to really like it! It is simply unattractive in every way. I was still hoping Malick would kill her. <br /> <br /> The other actors were good, but nothing special. Adams was probably the strongest in the cast, but she also had the only decent role. Aside from the old man, he was pretty good. <br /> <br /> Speaking of acting, how could Shepard's character be ridiculously stupid? He bought the act "brother and sister" because ... why would he buy that? Bill and Abby took every opportunity to feel good, as if they did not realize that their lives depended on a very platonic way. It was completely incredible. And finally, after a considerable amount of time, the farmer suddenly realizes, "Oh my god, they are together!" Then he attacks Bill with a gun, but seems to stumble into Bill's hand and end up with a deadly wound. <br /> <br /> In this regard, the fate of the characters was just as stupid (and, dare I say, lazy). Of course, Bill must die - would it be more boring than being shot in a pond by a group of cops? Abby continues her happy life, takes the train and feels really happy with the way things are going. And the annoying narrator finds her dead friend at random and they wander in the setting sun. But it does not matter, because Malick never gave me the slightest reason to worry about the characters. <br /> <br /> As for the plot, this film is endless, without twists or development. I can not believe it only takes 94 minutes - I could have sworn I was sitting in my seat for 3 hours. The sudden locust disaster was like throwing the Bible to my face; The metaphors and allusions are fine, but it was completely exaggerated. Clearly, the message was: "Do not get married for money, otherwise bad things will happen to you". Very original. <br /> <br /> I understand that "Days of Heaven", like all of Terrence Malick's films, is a work of art. And I will certainly agree that the cinematography is simply beautiful and that the shots at the magic hour give the film a unique aura. But I need more than beautiful pictures to watch a movie, and this one did not do it for me.
