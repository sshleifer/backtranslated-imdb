Meek and sweet Edward G. Robinson (Wilbert Winkle) decide to quit his job as a banker and do what he wants, opening a "repair" repair shop behind his house. Mr. Robinson is married, but childless; he befriended Ted Donaldson, resident of the local orphanage (as Barry). The young Donaldson is a passionate workshop assistant and considers Robinson a father figure. Ruth Warwick (as Amy), Robinson's harassing wife, is unhappy with the choice of his job and conspires to return to his idea of ​​normality. Their lives are even more disturbed when writing Robinson. <br /> <br /> The war also upsets what might have been an interesting story, as Robinson's character struggles against a domineering and unfriendly wife. Filmmakers may be showing how war can save marriages and positively redirect lives. Robinson and Donaldson are a nice team. Robert Mitchum has a role little harmful. The end "trick" of Mrs. Warwick and Donaldson is foreseen in a predictable way.
