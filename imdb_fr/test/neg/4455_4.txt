It's unfortunate that such a lame plot is hanging in such picturesque places, with documentary-style reports inserted for more footage. A shorter film might have kept the tension a little longer, and a more charismatic role might not have upset his lines so much. The main woman was not allowed to do enough, which created a beautiful but boring affair. This is built towards the end, but the redemption of the main actor is too late and should have been revealed earlier in the film. Not terrible, just a pity. Not very exciting but kind enough to honor early morning TV shows.
