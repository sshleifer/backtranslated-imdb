Two things come to my mind by observing this phenomenon several times a year: first, to wonder what kind of girl wants to be a "model" and go to the nearest ice cream shop and have a lighter sundae. <Br /> <br /> I tried to be a fan because I liked the idea of ​​this reality show. No other "famous" model has thought of this, and it is very admirable for Tyra Banks to do it. But over the course of the series, I have come to the conclusion that this is a sad group of people trying to create a mountain with a molehill. Women should not look at this, teenage girls should stay away if they do not book reviews on the subject. <br /> <br /> Many women are trying to win slot machines to compete for "Americas Next Top Model". They live together, fight together, cry together, undergo unnecessary modeling sessions with useless models and fashionatas and are eliminated and almost all declare: "You will see me again". Heck, I'm trying to see what happened to those DID won, actually. <br /> <br /> It's the dream of some girls and it's good for them. Looking at this, I hope other girls who see this and run like Hades in the other direction - like to go to college. <br /> <br /> It turns out that I just watched more of this recent season because of the "stratagem" of the full figurine models joining the band. It even made me think of it more like a lot of people. The "complete models" were nothing more than mid-sized women competing with what I think was the thinnest model group they'd ever picked - so of course it would make them look even more wholesale - a "ploy" used all the time by fashionatas. Bad, bad, Tyra and her crew. <br /> <br /> But to be fair, "Americas Next Top Model" does not deal with "figurative models", it is about projecting an image imagined of a beauty that can be marketed in mass and sold as the the ultimate in beauty - and this show is only looking for the next piece of fresh meat to add to the mix. Hence the name of the show. Hence the sad fate of judges, photographers and associations. As a result, Tyra and its constant "This was me" connect to all possible camera angles. But then again, that's the only thing I like in this show: the old model who gives others who would not have the chance to do so, the opportunity to enter the door. But after that ... everything else is in the status quo for this industry, so there are no surprises or weekly interest in the program.
