It was a Hindi film. Hindi = Horrible. reasons: inexpensive dialogue, cheap special effects, inexpensive realization + stretching of a film of 2 hours maximum in 3 hours. <br /> <br />% ^^^^^^ spoiler ... small bit %%%%%%%% <br /> <br /> Specifically for this movie: 1. the dialogues are not funny . they are tacky and cheap. Although Akshay did his best for the comedy for which I admire him, the comedy was not funny at all! I only laughed 3 times during this movie. 2. the first half of the movie was useless to the story of the 2nd half. the second half was the story / the movie. the first half was time spent / accumulated. 3. The characters are not developed correctly at all. Paresh Rawal is smart in the first half, an idiot in the 2nd half / rest of the movie. we do not really develop feelings or care for akshay and govinda. their characters are no longer stupid. they do not seem to struggle in their difficulties. The jokes are funny, but they are not funny in a very serious scene. the gang characters and drug dealers are nerdy and have been used in the last 20 movies. there is nothing new about these characters. Once again, they are stupid to be funny. However, stupid = funny when stupid is the norm throughout the movie. the only character that made sense was lara dutta with a real story. 4. special effects were shit. in the end, people fall off the ladder of a fire truck. you notice they are not actually on a ladder in the air. secondly, people start flying when the ladder begins to move. ppl can not fly off a ladder when it moves ... they fall directly to the ground because of something called gravity. 5. the whole movie has been dubbed. all dialogues were recorded after the movie. The actors' lips were barely synchronized with the dialogues. <br /> <br /> There are probably many other reasons why this movie was shit, but I do not remember it. Watch this masterpiece of Indian shitty movies by an unintelligent, even silly, director, and you'll agree with my comment. ppl who love Hindi movies, please raise your expectations in terms of decent quality in Hindi movies. <br /> <br /> Let me say that not all Hindi movies are bad. I like some. I did not like this one. <br /> <br /> 1.5 / 10 (1.5 for the effort of Akshay and Lara)
