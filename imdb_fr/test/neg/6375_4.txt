Do not get me wrong, it's a dynamo of success, but it has come to the top by selling expensive plastic toys to impulsive kids. So I'm a little upset when he considers comic fans as an extension of this same market. <br /> <br /> You see, "The Invincible Iron Man" would not be bad if it was placed on Saturday morning. and intended exclusively for unsuspecting children. But this is not exclusively for children. Peripheral characters are killed every five minutes and there is enough blood and semi-naked bodies to shake the censors of the network. So it's not quite done for children's television. <br /> <br /> Which audience is targeted by this video? then? It is the public who enjoys an almost intelligible history to revive a tyrannical Chinese emperor with five arcane rings, that's who. And I think the public is restricted. <br /> <br /> Many great writers have gone through the tough yoni of Marvel over the decades. It is therefore unfortunate that Marvel would risk his expensive investments in animation with so many questionable storytellers and scribes who, like Mr. Arad, are better accustomed to peddling figurines during Saturday morning caricatures. How many warm receptions does Marvel have to endure before proposing a better strategy? <br /> <br /> *** <br /> <br /> Animation: passable shots, some segments are better than others, a reduced budget all the way - it's not a Bakshi (Ralph ) and it's not without Bluth (Don)! The animation in computer graphics is acceptable, but far from impressive. <br /> <br /> History: a litany of clich√©s, everywhere, complicated, artificial and uninspired. <br /> <br /> Characters: why Rhodes even here, if all he does is add to Stark's sexual ambiguity? Hmmm ... his father is in a wheelchair ... Tony misses his mother ... The Asian girls are hot and, apparently, they are little different; the principal female role is completely objectified by the end of the function. <br /> <br /> Performance: impossible to blame talented actors of the voice a bad scenario. <br /> <br /> Art: very Western musculature, very clean lines, the faces are very derived from oriental art, very boring mattes, very bland CG. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: Not great, but deserves a watch for fans and those who love the myths of superheroes. A "must-buy" for collectors. A valuable "what not to do" course for junior leaders.
