Danny De Vito shows us here that he is definitely, and even infinitely, a better performer than on screen. He plays the role of Owen, an unfortunate writer with a grumpy old mother (delightfully interpreted by Anne Ramsey) whom he would like to see dead. Billy Crystal is Larry, a very frustrated writing teacher who has a separate wife and feels the same way. Owen, after watching Hitchcock's "Strangers on a Train", suggests that they exchange their murders. <br /> <br /> However, as director, the control of De Vito is incoherent, because it wastes this intelligent idea, while his film goes to humor. at the very bland. Crystal and he agree in the lead roles, but the series belongs to Anne Ramsey, who is the cantankerous Mrs. Lift. <br /> <br /> Saturday, June 20, 1992 - Video
