It's really awful, the weakest attempt to adapt a comic strip ever engaged in a movie. All that is possible in this film that could be bad, is. Music, games, lights, sets, special effects ... the only positives I can find are that Sue is cute in her blue tights and that the Thing makeup is almost passable (face only). That's all. Zip *: French. Do not look for this pirate copy; it's really not worth your time. Even the aborted film of "Captain America" ​​of the early '90s is a lot less awful than squirming for you while you try to cope with this mess.
