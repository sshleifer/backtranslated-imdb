Last week, I saw this with IFC and I thought it was typical of independent short: heavy in style, little in substance and original. Is it surprising that an outgoing movie is performed by an exceptionally attractive (and blond) boy, with blond hair and 70s clothes and cool clothes for school? In addition, this film slips into the chic of the late 1970s, which is appropriate for some (we think in particular of "The Virgin Suicides" by Sofia Coppola), but not this director. <br /> <br /> Another reviewer compared this to the work of Harmony Korine and me. to agree. However, I do not consider it a positive thing (what have you done recently, anyway?). "Bobbycrush" is really just a waste of time and energy for everyone involved. If you see it late at night on the cable, turn the chain and look at something else instead.
