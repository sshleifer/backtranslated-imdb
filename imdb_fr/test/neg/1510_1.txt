It comes from usenet, so I was not prepared for the heavy religious theme (and I mean EXCEPTIONALLY heavy). It's not that I'm one of Satan's followers or anything, but it was very hard. <br /> <br /> In addition, it stinks. It may be because they had to force good boys to play bad boys, but it did not work. <br /> <br /> There was pretty cool cinema to do, so any fan of director style might want to check but be ready with the fast forward buttons. <br /> <br /> The edition has been somewhat neglected. In particular, a black Mustang (probably a representation of Satan?) Opposes a white 240Z. The wheels are spinning, camera changes and everyone knows that the white 240Z is transformed into a white Civic. <br /> <br /> I gave up very early, so I can not guarantee the moral impact. But I want to emphasize that this type of film preaches totally to the choir. If the director / scriptwriter / producer was trying to introduce religion into the unwashed streets, they did it wrong. I think I'd rather watch an advertisement for an adult diaper than listen to a bible speech to the Steel Vision on Jesus' death for us. Yawning. <br /> <br />
