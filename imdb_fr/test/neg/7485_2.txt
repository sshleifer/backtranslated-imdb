Jon Good's Wife (simply one of the worst titles in a movie), or The Red Right Hand (another absolutely horrible title that says nothing and has no relevance to the film) under which I have seen, takes place in 'Salem, Massachusettes 1978' (passing the year of my birth, probably the best thing to do during these 365 days), where five old university friends meet for a school meeting, the gay-boy fagot Roger Mather (John Kuntz, is the family name of Say it out loud ...), Martha Alden (Kim Brockington), Rebecca Lawson (Jenna Stern) and her boyfriend Jake Stabler (John Doe) Alan Hobbes (Michael Kevin Walker) and his wife Sandy (Megan Rawa) plus John Good (Marc Ardito, why is the spelling of "John" different in the title?) And his wife Sara (Abigail Morgan). From the beginning, there is a disturbing tension in the air and when someone mentions their "disappeared" friend, Calef (Jason Winther), many unpleasant memories come back to us. Then come phone calls, mysterious nosebleeds, hallucinations and guilt as the real horror of the events of recent years finally finally revealed ... <br /> <br /> Product, executive produced and directed by Kurt Gioscia who also wrote the thing and Kurt St. Thomas who also got the credit of art direction and if that was not enough, they also play in the movie! Personally, I thought that Jon Good's wife was awful, I mean she does not know how to cook or anything! Ha ha ha, I'm kidding! Seriously, I did not think much about the film as a whole. At first, it's pretty slow. The first 30 minutes of the meeting are a solid topic of the meeting, which consists of a lot of things to catch up and a dull exposure. The film is never explained, what is it with these strange nose bleeds for the intelligence of God, these mysterious phone calls, the almost inconceivable death of a group member who might or may not be natural and of what the hell was she talking about Sara? She presents herself as a fucking whore who apparently does everything and seems to be sleeping with just about every man she meets! Part of the dialogue she launched would not be misplaced in a porn and this seems totally at odds with the rest of the film, which unfolds more like a drama than the horror / thriller movie it was supposed to be. Then there is the end, if there is a worse way to finish a film, then literally leave everything in suspense in the air without the slightest closure, that I have not seen it yet. The whole thing was very predictable too, I mean that whoever looks at it will not know that when they all mention that their friend Calef was missing, there would be nothing left to do? <br /> <br /> Directors Gioscia & Thomas makes an infuriating film. In addition to the predictability and boring reach, there is a retrospective narrative of Alan that I simply do not understand because it has no more or less meaning than anyone else and when is it told since then? ? The reasons behind this narration are never explained or developed. There is no tension because things are so encrypted. <br /> <br /> Technically, the film is OK but nothing special and some places and clothes did not seem particularly authentic, it never convinced me it was happening at the end of the 70's. acting game was correct and what about the name of the actor John Kuntz? I guess if his wife was standing next to him, we could describe them as a Kuntz couple, right ?! <br /> <br /> I really did not think much about Jon Good's wife (an inflatable doll would have been better! Ha ha ha) & I do not know who it would be. Forget all horror, horror, violence, fear, atmosphere or excitement, in fact, forget everything that could have made this movie visible because it is not there. Not recommended.
