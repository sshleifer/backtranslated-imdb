It's a terrible movie god Norris, with one of the most boring performances of all time in Calvin Levels and a low scenario. The characters were terrible, and there is virtually no action, even Chuck Norris stinks! Christopher Neame is very weak as the main villain, and the story was not very interesting, plus Norris seemed bored by everything and I do not blame him as I was too! Calvin's levels give one of the most boring performances of all time, I could not bear, I was tempted to rip the tape of my VCR and Norris and Levels had no chemistry together !. If you're looking for Norris martial art, do not go too far, but if you want a movie with an uninteresting story, there's practically no action and bad acting! It's a horrible film god Norris, with one of the most boring performances of Calvin levels, avoid it like the plague !. The management is incredibly bad. Aaron Norris does an incredibly bad job here, without suspense or thrills and no frills, and keeping the movie at a boring pace !. There is a little blood and violence. We get 2 bloody emporages, a torn heart, an exploding body and some gunshot wounds. The game is really bad. Chuck Norris is no wonder he's usually here and seemed very bored here, his liners are flat, and his acting was not that great and I'm a huge fan of Norris, it's his worst absolute! (Norris still reigns!) Calvin Levels is INCREDIBLY annoying here, his wimpy wheezy performance cracked me severely, I was so hoping he would succeed !, But unfortunately, he did not do it. Christopher Neame is rather weak as the main villain, his voice was cold, but he played a lot! Sheree J. Wilson is beautiful and has done well with what she had to do. The rest of the cast is terrible. Overall, avoid that, it's not worth the torture, even if you're a big fan of Norris (like me). BOMB on 5
