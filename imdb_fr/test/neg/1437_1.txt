I do not recommend watching this movie if you are easily offended. I'm not even easily offended and this movie made me frustrated. It's disgusting. And that does not make sense. The whole thing on the Internet is so clich√©, and the producer obviously did not understand all the "Internet rules". When you chat with someone, you CAN follow their IP address. Really? (see the sarcasm here). It was stupid. Needless. And I did not even look at the end. I could always say "it does not make sense, that either ..." This movie is pure shit at its best. Nice comment, no?
