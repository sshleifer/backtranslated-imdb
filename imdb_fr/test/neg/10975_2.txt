I bought this video on a table at the video store hoping for a good cast in what has been touted as an award-winning British comedy. I guess I should have read the finest characters. I rarely write a panoramic review, but here. <br /> <br /> These actors who play a gay role really play games with your much more worthy movie memories. This comedy was a very cruel joke at the expense of the actors, the theater audience and all the beautiful films that contributed to their reputation. <br /> <br /> I repeat: it's the joke that involves ransacking the actors' other very respectable characters on the screen with this film sadly misleading? Can the reference to the classics "pride and prejudice" and "sense and sensitivity" of the Austen classics be anything else? At what point was it a political declaration to produce this melodrama using these stars? Are we supposed to just consider this as a mistake of character that all actors are homosexual and so let their role playing on the screen affect our way of life is to accept their private homosexual relationships with our face? I'm sorry, but I do not think so. I say NO to this one.
