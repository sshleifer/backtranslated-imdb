It happened there. In the top rated commentary on this film, someone says "Nishi is an honorable man". Really? It's a guy who kills and maims mostly people in the movie. He takes a break to rob a bank. Honorable? How would you like your children to go to school with the children of someone who calls it honorable? Wait, there is more! The person also says "it can be said that he is constantly thinking." How can we do that? Well, do you know that this joke "How can you tell when a CEO / politician / lawyer lie?" ... "His lips move." Well, Nishi's lips never move, so I guess that means he's thinking. <br /> <br /> Of course, it is existentialism to warm the heart of the cult of victimization. Existionnalism is meant to emphasize the fact that an individual assumes responsibility for the consequences of his actions. No Nishi. Borrow money from yakuza. What, they want to get it back? Kill them. The cops are discovering. Kill yourself and your wife. <br /> <br /> Really honorable.
