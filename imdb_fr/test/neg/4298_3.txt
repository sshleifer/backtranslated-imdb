I do not see the point of going through so many difficulties to make a film like this, then throw the storybook out the window. There was not one specific detail in this movie besides the fact that Richtofen died, which I'm grateful for in the end, so I did not have to watch anymore. Movies like this are an insult to anyone who is aware of the aviation history of the First World War. <br /> <br /> I miss the obvious, that they were flying Fokker DVII in 1916, because the Blue Max did it too. 209 Squadron was flying SE-5s and attacking other areas. On the one hand, they call the Pfalz D-III an "old albatross" at first. For another, they have Voss, Goring and Wolff at Jasta Boelcke. The only one who was in this Jasta was Voss, and he joined after Boelcke's death. Richtofen was not held responsible for the death of Boelcke ... Erwin Boehme, who collided with Boelcke, had deflected to avoid a British plane that Richtofen was pursuing. When Richtofen was injured in the head, it was attacking a FE-2d tandem. He did not crash into the trenches and was not beaten by soldiers. NO..Werner Voss did not die that day. He died on September 28 in one of the most epic battles of the First World War. <br /> <br /> Manfred was short, not like the actor who dominated everyone. His brother Lothar has never been to Jasta Boelcke either, he joined the squadron when Manfred was in charge of Jasta 11. <br /> <br /> There are so many other blatant mistakes in the historical fact that I'll let them go, except perhaps the worst, the scene of death. In the film, Manfred is maneuvered by Brown then shot, thus achieving a perfect landing. Brown hit Richtofen while Richtofen pursued May, and the facts accumulated over the years overwhelmingly demonstrate that Richtofen was killed by a shot on the ground, not by Brown. <br /> <br /> The only value of this film was chance to see the flight scenes themselves, which were as good as "The Blue Max", other than that, I will not look at it anymore and I paid $ 30 for the band!
