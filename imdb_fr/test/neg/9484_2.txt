A stupid movie, with a stupid plot. One has the impression that they threw all imaginable shots in a mixer. I particularly "liked" the party, where two teenage girls ask the French president to clean the water. Because we all know how much America is dedicated to environmental conservation. Kyoto, anyone? And the French chef, who apparently never saw or tasted a hamburger ... That's why people think that Americans do not have a culture. This, and the fact that we met your children when they came to Europe to "see the world" (ie eat at McDonalds in foreign capitals). They are not as stupid as the two pre-ditsy of this film, but they have about the same amount of cultural enlightenment and good manners.
