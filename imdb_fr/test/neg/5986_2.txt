I lived next to the author in 1980, when he first moved to Portland from Downer's Grove, Illinois, with two of his high school classmates. He seemed like a pretty normal guy, even though he had a lot of artistic pretensions. A few years later, he entered Portland's post-punk music scene with his friend Phil and a few others, and a group that was certainly not heading for anything, even though it's gotten a lot of action, including an adventure with Courtney Love in her movie. Groupie days in Portland. He seemed to think that his musical prospects were good enough to move to San Francisco, then to the N.Y.C. <br /> <br /> I was surprised to learn that he had a publishing contract in 1995 after the group crashed and burned. The name of Courtney Love seemed to be the decisive one. I do not know at all how the film was born, especially with this cast, but I doubt that Gus Van Sant was involved. Anyway, the commentators here seem not to know if the lack of narrative is intentional or not, so I would just say it's the job of a pretty smart guy who wants to be a writer, artist or something, but do not do it. I have nothing to say. Like Kerouac without benzedrine.
