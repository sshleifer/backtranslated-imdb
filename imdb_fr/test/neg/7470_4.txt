This movie was nothing more than an exploitive gay cheesecake. It was not an "art" film; just an excuse to show several free, abusive and abusive scenes with extended male genital nudity. There was a cloakroom scene involving more than a dozen naked men. The camera zooms in on men's asses and penises for several minutes with their cocks in full screen. There are several scenes in this movie showing penises after penises. It quickly becomes REEL useless and makes it impossible to take this movie seriously. I was wondering if I was watching a Playgirl video by mistake. If these same scenes were filmed with the help of women (ex: totally naked and showing their vagina several times), it would quickly be considered softcore porn and an excuse to show a lot of pleasure to the eyes ... it's all that this movie is. All the artistic merits were swept away by the gay ghetto mentality. The themes of class distinction, homosexuality, longing, etc. were simple and superficial; no more developed than one would expect from a first-year philosophy student. Just go hunting and rent a gay porn instead.
