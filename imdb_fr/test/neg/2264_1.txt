As a passionate fan of Gone With the Wind, I was disappointed to see the original film and find that it had left many important characters behind. Fortunately, the film itself was a wonderful piece. When the Scarlett book came out, I read it hoping to follow two of my favorite literary characters further in their journey together. Although the book lacks quality, it remains a good story and, as long as I was able to separate it from the original, it was and remains enjoyable. However, I consider that the six hours I spent watching the "Scarlett" miniseries are among the worst of my life. Discrediting one of the original traits so well defined in Margaret Mitchell's book, this series has also turned the story of the sequel into a story of rape, mistrust, murder and erroneous relationships that even the book that Scarlett evaded. The cast of many characters refused to examine the traits so well formed both in the original film and in the film, and even in the second book, and again let at least one extremely crucial character. In the novel, Scarlett O'Hara Butler follows her ex-husband Rhett Butler to Charleston on the pretext of visiting her extended family. After coming to an "arrangement" with Rhett, she agrees to leave and resumes with her relatives O'Hara in Savannah. Finally, in Ireland, she accompanies her cousin Colum, a passionate leader of the Fenian brotherhood, to further explore the "deep roots" of her family. She is finally named "The O'Hara", the head of the family. While her duties as O'Hara keep her engaged in her hometown of Ballyhara, Scarlett ventures into the world of English landowners and instantly becomes a sought-after guest at many parties. After being repeatedly despised by Rhett, she finally agrees to marry Luke, the Earl of Fenton, until Rhett presents herself in a "night rescue" cliché. The mini-series "Scarlett" does not even manage to do this justice. Violated by her fiancé and scorned by her family, the series shows Scarlett thrown in jail after she is accused of the murder committed by her cousin. <br /> <br /> I urge all those who plan to spend this day to rethink this decision.
