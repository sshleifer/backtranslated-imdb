Frank Tashlin's film "Censur√©" is a very private short film, Snafu, which aims to show how much Censor plays an important role in the prevention of military secrets. Snafu tries to make his girlfriend understand that he will be posted in the South Pacific, but Censor foils every attempt he makes to send the letter. These first scenes are the best, with the Invisible Censer tearing the letter from the sky with long mechanical arms, nets and even a specially used eagle! The second part of the drawing, in which Snafu sends the letter with the help of Technical Fairy, First Class (which gives him a lesson), is less funny and reaches a climax with a disappointing final like that of a dream. The main point of interest in this part of the cartoon is the appearance of Snafu's very lightly dressed girlfriend, who is even seen with bare breasts, although she has strategically placed limbs at all times! Designed for the military, Snafu shorts were often characterized by increased leanness, but these scenes, very crowded on all sides, are by far the most erotic I have ever encountered in these shorts. Nevertheless, I prefer Snafu shorts that go a little more jugular, which usually leads to the death of the main character. For great examples, look for "The Goldbrick" by Tashlin or "Spies" by Chuck Jones. "Censured" is quite weak in comparison.
