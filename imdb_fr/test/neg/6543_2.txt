Although the film has a pretty elegant look for an independent film made with a very small budget, that's not why I go to the movies. I did not find any sympathetic characters, they all seemed to be defeated. All they are trying to do wrong is all hopeless for me. Critics consider the Puffy chair a black comedy ... a comedy? Brother Rhett behaves like an escapee from an institution. When Josh talks about his brother to his girlfriend Emily, he almost suggests that Rhett does not play with a full game. Nevertheless, Josh is organizing a "wedding" for Rhett and a woman Rhett had met a few hours earlier. There have been some interesting performances of some of the characters encountered on the road. However, for me, the most telling thing was that people were coming out of the movie ... and I saw it during a free screening.
