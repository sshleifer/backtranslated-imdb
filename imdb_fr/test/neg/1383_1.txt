The slogan of this show is "He says what he thinks We are hiring additional lawyers." If you look back in the past, no classic comedian has ever boasted about being controversial. Richard Pryor's slogan was not: "I am brutal, racist and daring". That's basically how Comedy Central markets this show - to your face, non-PC and "honest," but how can a TV show be proud of it? Where is humility and humility? And what made Carlos Mencia this huge figure for Comedy Central? Let's start at the beginning - Dave Chappelle cancels his show (which has become incredibly popular and controversial) and Comedy Central is looking for someone new to promote. They hire this guy named Ned who claims to be a Mexican, even if he is not. They splash his face on some television commercials and give the impression that they "dare" by letting him on the public. <br /> <br /> I have seen a lot of obnoxious topics on the forums about it. show, and I do not agree with the detractors of "Mencia". It's not a terrible sight. It made me cry a lot of laughter. When it's funny, it's really funny. Yes, it's minor - but so was Chappelle. <br /> <br /> The problem with Carlos is that he always uses the same material. And it is too obvious. The stated marketing put aside, "Carlos" has now said beaner so many times that I lost count. He's trying to make the next famous line (like "I'm Rick James, b ****!") But it's way too obvious. <br /> <br /> As for repeating himself, Carlos uses a lot of the same jokes again and again. For example, during one episode, he said he would love to see all Mexicans disappear from America overnight. He would wake up and an American would say, "Room ser'vuce!" with a southern accent. <br /> <br /> He used exactly that same joke - word for word - when he appeared as a guest in Adam Carolla's talk show. It was a lot less funny the second time because he seemed more desperate. <br /> <br /> "Carlos" is it funny? I think so. There are scandalous moments in his show. But he focuses too much on trying to spark controversy rather than follow the flow and let his comedy progress naturally. Repeating endlessly ridiculous little slogans, zany faces and powerful screams of old voices gets old pretty quickly ... I just hope that Carlos - or his writers - can give a new advantage to this series, because it starts to decrease more moreover in repeated hell.
