I love so-called "blaxploitation" movies and I've seen dozens. Some, such as COTTON ARRES TO HARLEM, SHAFT and HAMMER have excellent production values ​​and are very entertaining, while many others are very cheap and ridiculous, but remain fun, such as FRATERNITY OF DEATH or COFFEY. However, DOLEMITE manages something rare for the genre - it's just cheap and silly and not the least entertaining! It's like a blaxploitation made for very, very stupid people. <br /> <br /> Years ago, Dolemite films took off on "Mad TV" and, unfortunately, the real DOLEMITE is no better. Like parody, the acting is simply awful. Rudy Ray Moore has all the charm and charisma of a piece of balsa wood. He can barely read his lines and his "karate" is a joke - his kicks are obviously missing out on the target again and again. For the rest of the actors, many could be even worse. My favorite was the FBI guy who could not even remember his lines and who was really struggling to get them out. Yet they did not even bother to re-film these scenes! In fact, there were so many things that I found if the movie was a joke. I can not understand if the movie was meant to be a joke. <br /> <br /> this movie, you are wrong. Even for the perverts who hope to see some skin, you will be disappointed. The nude women of the movie really look like evil prostitutes and nothing looks so sexy in their sagging body. I think watching naked seniors - really naked seniors - is no worse than watching these "ladies". And as for Rudy Ray, he has "man boobs". No superhero or black anti-hero should look so naked! For God's sake, put on your clothes and create a scenario that does not look like the one that was written by the winos !!! <br /> <br /> FYI - Apparently, this movie has sequels! ! I can not imagine looking at them, so you will have to find someone else to look at them. I watched OUTDOOR PLAN 9, OUTSIDE ADOLESCENTS and ROBOT MONSTER, but I do not think I can bring myself to see another Dolemite movie - they are so bad!
