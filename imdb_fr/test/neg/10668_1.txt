If you feel Reshammiya as a singer is too painful to watch on TV, try watching it in the movie for 2 hours in a row. His face is gentle throughout the film, and it is very comical to see him play demanding and intense scenes. It's far from a true love story (get the exact spelling, Reshammiya - it's neither luv nor reeal) and it's with him that he makes a dance of Mithun da, scenes of automatic rickshaw fight, imprisoned Himesh, accused of murder by Himesh, he is fleeing the prison etc ... If you want to laugh, nothing like it, especially the scenes where he screams in Mehbooba. If you despise nasal fangs and want to know by curiosity what two hours of Reshammiya can do you, then do not miss this movie. <br /> <br /> I could not help but laugh at the beginning at the very end. The only thing that saves from this movie is the cinematography, the venues and some songs. Even in this case, avoid this movie at all costs until you are a fan of Reshammiya.
