OK, when I was little (and I mean 2 or 3, not 6 and 7), Barney was one of my favorite shows. I then grew up and threw all my old Barney tapes. So one day, as I went through the chains, I noticed that Barney is now in a caboose, and I thought, "Uh, is that the good show?" Once I realized it was, I panicked. Why did they change the scenery of a school series to a CABOOSE? Since then, the show has been absolutely terrible, and the only reason I give it a 2 is a) because I'm nice, b) because of Riff, and c) because in the past, the show was tolerable. Now I hate that. I hate. <br /> <br /> 2/10
