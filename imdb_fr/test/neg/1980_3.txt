I was ecstatic when I discovered this movie shortly after seeing Spirits Within. <br /> <br /> After years of anticipation, they announced the release date for November 2005. Well, November has arrived. And went. Followed by December. Oh, listen, January 31, 2006. We're not out in the States yet. <br /> <br /> Well, I'm delighted to have a friend with a captioned copy bootlegged. ; D <br /> <br /> Well, the cg was great. Not as good as expected, but almost perfect. However, I fell for the artificial movements of the children throughout the film. I thought we had already been adopted. Plus, I did not really like the anime look given to their faces. I felt like they were shooting for a realistic look at the movie, but most of the characters have bigger than normal eyes, especially female characters. They will have personality, however, I will give them that. <br /> <br /> Even though I'm not a big fan of anime, I must say that I was impressed by the scenes of fierce fighting. They were animated wonderfully and kept me hanging on the edge of my seat. <br /> <br /> For about the first two. <br /> <br /> And here lies the biggest defect of Advent Children's. These are mainly scenes of hyper stylized fights. <br /> <br /> A sequel to FF7 with epic proportions has been promised for years. Instead, they gave us a nice piece of CG with barely a plot to excuse the time he has left to run - less than two hours. <br /> <br /> Where Final Fantasy is famous for its complex stories, the film is missing. You do not really know the characters. The only way to understand most of the film's events would have been if you had played the game. We barely had the chance to see them before they fought with the current threat. <br /> <br /> What hurts even more the fans, it is the ugly cameos that the majority of the characters of FF7 were diffused. They were nothing more than Cloud "I'll call if I need you, but I probably will not do it" to save the singers. And, to add to the pain, each character had individually launched Cloud higher and higher. This little corner was so cheesy that I almost turned it off. I would have been much more impressed if he had just jumped on himself, bouncing on the walls to pull himself higher. <br /> <br /> It hurts even more when they reduce the Turks to less than -Just comical relief. It was good for the game, but it's cinema. People do not act like cartoon characters in a hard battle. They have removed their dignity: / <br /> <br /> And spoiler (yes, most of you probably already know it, anyway). Who remembers that Darth Maul was excited in SW: Episode 1? Yes, now, imagine that, but with Sephiroth. It is true. He had maybe 5 minutes of time in front of the screen. Maybe. End Spoiler: P <br /> <br /> If this movie was made for fans, then go for Square. If this indicates the direction you are taking, the FF series, I doubt that you will see much of my money. I played your games for the wonderful story and the excellent characters. <br /> <br /> You had the chance to do something epic. Something really beautiful, a masterpiece that goes against all Disney CG movies. <br /> <br /> Instead, you offered us a nice piece of meat with almost nothing underneath to keep it together. Good to do. <br /> <br /> And I'm sure if the rest of the fans stopped for a moment and tried to pay attention to everything except the GC, they would know what I'm talking about. I was going to give a 5/10 rating, but after thinking about it, I gave it a score of 3/10 because they could have done better. They did better. And it's just sad. <br /> <br /> If they have to do something new in FFVII, they have to do it first.
