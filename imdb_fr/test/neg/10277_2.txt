It is difficult to make a negative statement here after all these criticisms about the recording of facts, the quality of polls, etc. I did not like the movie. it's bad! <br /> <br /> there are orgies, they have taboo sex (gay sex, bisexual sex, oral sex, rape, anal sex, masturbation, brother-sister sex, brother-in-law sex, sex on drugs , sex without drugs, sex, sex, sex seems to rule their world.I guess the director desperately needs to be fucked), the story is just dirty and shameful. I wonder what drove these people to get up with this story. and above all: it does not matter. <br /> <br /> The technical aspect does not satisfy me either. the sound is mediocre, so the editing and the "direction" are absent. the actors are certainly good, but guess what! it's their job! their job is to act! no need to leave your seat if an actor was doing a decent job. Do you applaud when a bus driver takes you home safely? see? <br /> <br /> I gave it 2/10, because after all, there was something I can not put into words. b movie charm? fun camp? nudity? I do not know.
