A man (Goffredo Unger) floats in the sea among the wreckage of his destroyed boat, off the coast of Florida. A helicopter hoists him to reveal that his two legs have disappeared under his knees. Dr. Stella Dickens (Valentine Monnier) and her partner, Dr. Bob Hogan (Lawrence Morgant) are marine biologists conducting research in the sea on dolphins. At sea, Hogan hears a strange, high-pitched noise. Intrigued, he and Stella hire Peter (Micheal Sopkiw) and his assistant Sandra (Iris Peynado) to create a device to locate and track the source, or something, anyway, which is not clearly specified . Meanwhile, a scientist named Florinda (Cinzia De Ponti as Cinthia Stewart) who works for a rival organization called "West Ocean International" is brutally murdered when she threatens to expose someone to the organization. More people are attacked and Sheriff Gordon (Gianni Garko as John Garko) is on the case. Peter, Stella, Hogan and Sandra went to sea. Soon, they find proof that something monstrous and very hostile can hide under the surface. Together with the rival scientist Donald West (William Berger), Sheriff Gordon and the US Army, they set out to destroy the monster, but other sinister forces are at work because someone does not want the creature genetically modified is exposed at any location. Cost! Directed by Lamberto Bava in the role of John Old Jr., he is far from the classic Italian horror and splash movies of the 70's and the early 80's. The screenplay by Gianfranco Clerici, Herv√© Piccini and Dardando Sacchetti is very slow and will make most people sleep well before the 90 minute run. The monster is hardly used, large parts of this film are made up of sequences of boats and helicopters. The big pieces of the first half focus on the mysterious part of the story. There is not really a gore to talk about, a guy with both legs broken and someone with an arm talking about it. The special effects on the monster itself are usually mediocre and this is seen by very fast, disappointing flashes. Virtual actors do not help make this easier. There is really not much to recommend, so I will not do it. Do not bother, you can do a lot better.
