Seriously, science fiction must stop making movies. They are all horrible. And this one had John Rhys-Davies in it, and he could not help the movie. Dr. Pena (Giancarlo Esposito) captures the legendary Mexican goat eater, the chupacabra, and takes him aboard a cruise ship commanded by Captain Rudolf (John Rhys-Davies). The creature then escapes and begins killing the crew and passengers. Captain Rudolf and the crew then attack the creature, the guns. But they can not stop it. They call on the navy. They can not stop it either. Then, the thing kills the 5 (or the number of them). Then the captain and his daughter, along with another guy, find out how to kill him. Stay away from this movie. The chupacabra is incredibly corny, the sailors shoot at the slightest movement, throw grenades on the ship and the acting is horrible. 3/10.
