I was hoping to learn something from this film, but I was disappointed. Everything is about Rommel and praised him as a great general, but at no point in the whole movie, did we ever understand why he was so good. What made it so successful? Was it his motivation, his refusal to accept defeat, his discipline with his men? I was looking for a Patton interpretation that really gets into the character, but it fell flat. Most of the dialogue is artificial and sensational, and feels bland and artificial. There are good deeds here and there, but not much. The end of the story, which deals with his involvement in Hitler's assassination plot, was the most informative and probably the most interesting part. But as a history lesson about Germany's greatest general, it was a failure.
