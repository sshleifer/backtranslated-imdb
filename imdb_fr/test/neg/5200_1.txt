Since I am required to write a minimum of 10 lines and this garbage does not deserve a single one, I will start with the following: 1. I voted AWFUL for this terrible film, called "film". <br /> <br /> 2. Let me explain why these turkeys produced by David Varod are mainly shot in my beautiful country, Bulgaria (in BTW, for the illiterate people around) - this country is IN EUROPE , located in the north of Greece and has absolutely nothing to do with Mexico and Uruguay) A few years ago, NU Image invaded our country and started making rather crappy outings, mainly in video format. Why here? Because they are paying a derisory fee to Bulgarian (mostly distinguished) Bulgarian crew and actors, who are, in many respects, better than most of their American colleagues. Personally, I am ashamed of this fact. The reason is, of course, the greed of the Americans involved and their desire to get the maximum, if not all, of the profits. In fact, it would not be so bad if only the production was not so dirty and pale. There has not been a good picture taken here for years. At present, NU Image is being sued for the highly questionable purchase of our national film production center called Boyana Films. No doubt about it, there was corruption, there was deception, there were lies in this recent purchase. Bulgarian cinema is dead. Long live Bulgarian cinema!
