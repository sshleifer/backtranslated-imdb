What are Forest Whitaker and Clifton Collins Jr. doing in this area? Light It Up is a ridiculously melodramatic piece about the problems faced in low-income schools. Although the subject must be addressed, the film uses all the clich√©s of the genre and is presented as a manual film of popcorn. The characters are cutouts from the downtown version of The Breakfast Club or even The Faculty. Observe this with your children when they are 13 or 14 years old. With them, this could be an outlet for a lesson on current social issues. For older kids, it will only be one thing to watch and spit at 4am, as I did recently on Bravo. In fact, what was it doing on Bravo?
