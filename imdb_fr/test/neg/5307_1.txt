Sometimes, when I hear an A-list cast, I hope I put it together in a movie for 2 hours, and I pray for it to be a good thing, not for my 10 dollars or my 2 hours, but for those of these career actors. In the case of "Be Cool", everything was lost. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the film, John Travolta (aka Chili Palmer) and a musician played by James Woods drive in a car talking about movie sequels, and how most are not good. If you consider past the fact that this scene was shot in the same way that Quentin Tarrantino filmed his car scene in "Pulp Fiction", and listen to the dialogue, you can not help but think about it. acts 1) a warning to the public that this movie will suck, or 2) an attempt to make the audience laugh at the pure humor of 2 people talking about sequels in a sequel. Oh irony! (In case you're wondering, choice 1 is correct.) The cool and clever Chili Palmer of the first and good movie "Get Shorty" is relaunched to play a professional music gangster. He steals a sexy young singer (Christina Milian) in his ghetto, a Jewish manager (Vince Vaughn), and turns it into a singing sensation. Of course, a movie about a former gangster can never be complete without new gangsters causing havoc. This time, the mobsters of choice are Russian, played by American actors who can not play Russian if all my family hits them in the head with the bare hands of Russia. <br /> <br /> As a Russian, I was not so much offended by the way this film portrayed the Russians, but as a writer, the horrible dialogue offended me more. This movie has tried too much to make the audience laugh. This has transformed the good lines into redundancy. The Russian, black and gay jokes were the same as reformulated a few hundred times. After calling the character of The Rock af ***** (he plays a gay bodyguard to Vince Vaughn), and Cedric the Entertainerer a ***** character (he played a black rapper with a threatening entourage those who do not play his tracks with rifles) I wanted to get out of the movie theater, because it was painful to sit still. If it was "Get Shorty", none of it would have even been in the movie to create a drama or a very bad laugh. <br /> <br /> What was missing in this movie that was not in "Get Shorty" was Chile's spicy attitude. He is a completely different person in this sequel. On the one hand, old Chile would have had more dialogue. John Travolta has no more than 20 lines of conversation in "Be Cool" because it is staged by repetitive lines and one hundred and two cameo appearances by the most random celebrities. I'm not going to spoil the shock by revealing all the cameos for those who really plan to see this movie (PLEASE DO NOT !!!), but I would say it's always going to surprise me that these people have agreed to be in a film of such inanity. <br /> <br /> What was even more stupid was the very lame dance sequence with Travolta and Uma Thurman (she plays the James Woods widower who LUCKILY is killed in the first 10 minutes of the film). Tarrantino has never done Pulp Fiction for an idiot like the director of "Be Cool". This dance number was boring, long and thrilling. The Black Eyed Peas playing in the club with a total of 10 people did not make the scene memorable. <br /> <br /> There were so many holes in the ground that I left the room to ask WHY ?! Everything in this movie was a big question mark. I just did not understand the purpose of anything. I could not even explain to you why the Russians were looking for everyone or why this film was shot, because I'm perplexed. All I've learned from this film is that everyone in LA has a sidekick, and the only way this film was probably funded was all the ads from Diet Coke, Yahoo !, Honda Insight Hybrid, T-Mobile, Trimspa spokeswoman herself is in the movie) and the Bad Screenwriters Guild. Holes pierced, stupid dialogues, too many random cameos, horrible action (even from the pros) and unimportant attempt to imitate "Pulp Fiction" make this film the worst film of 2005, and this is only the third months of the year.
