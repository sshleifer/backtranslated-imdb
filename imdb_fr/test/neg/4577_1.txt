I had the misfortune to take this on a flight recently. I had the biggest misfortune of having played it on my return flight as well. Obviously, Demi's attempt to obtain an "artistic" credit, the film is a disaster because of its ability to play lousy. A better actress could have done this job, but a quick glance at Moore's face shows the emptiness it contains. At least, it does not ruin American literature this time around.
