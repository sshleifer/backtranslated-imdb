This film was shot in my hometown and I knew many "actors" in small roles. Most of them were students from the local karate school, and even at the time of filming, we all knew how stinky it was. It was interesting, however, to see it happen. Most filming locations no longer exist, such as the disco, pizzeria, etc. The "World Premiere" was held at the Akron Civic Theater and we all laughed hysterically at how ridiculous it was. Personally, I think it's the worst movie of all time, but it reminds me a lot of good memories. Watch this movie with a tip ... enjoy it for what it is..a very low budget, poorly done, karate movie.
