The private soldier in the army, Gene Kelly, who is also a talented trapeze aerialist, is criticized for his bold stunts without a net and for alienating his cohorts with high thread; during this time, there is an elaborate "camp show" to present to soldiers and army personnel, and the entire M-G-M studio has joined the party. Mickey Rooney plays the mastery (unctuously), featuring artists such as Kay Kyser and his band, Bob Crosby, Benny Carter and the M-G-M Dancing Girls (who seem to be dressed like vegetables). Red Skelton is a little cute with Donna Reed and Margaret O'Brien, but the other comic pieces suffer from a seeming void between the performers and the supposedly live audience (they are terribly silent until the writer talks about them for exaggerated reaction reactions.) Judy Garland sings an inappropriate song about a special night at Carnegie Hall (improbably accompanied by classical pianist Jos√© Iturbi, whom Judy calls 'hep'). The production is brilliant, but the maniacal energy feels false, manufactured. ** from ****
