At the dawn of human civilization, caves sat down and made lame jokes, banged their heads against anything they could grasp, and the women were never seen and apparently at some point had the tail. These cavemen lived in a geographically diverse area with a cockatoos, a camel, a monkey - but no women. This film tells the "hilarious" adventures of seven (or more) cavemen - having burned their land with the new discovery of fire - moving by water into a new land where they find this woman in the extra appendage. Along the way, we are witnessing "great" comedy moments like a big caveman swallowing a frog crunching in his stomach. A monkey throwing stones on his head. A man swallowing a mouse to get the frog in his stomach. The obligatory "gay" caveman. The list could continue again and again. This film is the very definition of the cinematic dreck. From the beginning, I got bored and the situation got worse when the cavemen hit each other, making fun of each other, making little jokes like puns, hitting each other, and hitting poor Seta Berger, who seems to have lost a bet against a producer. appear in this nonsense. It is indeed one of the two highlights of this film. She's not really an actress, so you have to guess why she's a donkey? The other "bright" point is music. As soon as I heard the score, I thought it sounded very familiar. I had never heard the score, but the music was without question that of Ennio Morricone. It's a beautiful score and the best thing in an otherwise rude, boring, lecherous, unimaginative and ridiculous film, basically about a group of Moes finding a woman for the first time and wanting to first eat it as an animal, could do. Awwwwh! Sorry, I'm choking a yawn as I revisit the plot! The end of the film is about one hundred women, most of them naked, with the radiant erotic sensation of removing a crust from the knee. This film was painful and offers no real merit. The fact that it has generated a sequel does not surprise me, because it offers something that will pique the interest of the viewer: the tail.
