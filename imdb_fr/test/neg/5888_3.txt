I am at a loss. This whole movie did not make sense. It was like watching a Soderburg movie for football. The camera cuts, the rhythm, everything is copied. I thought the subject was not too serious for them to treat it as it was. Yes, we all know that Southerners love football and beauty pageants. Should we be inundated as an audience? I watched because of Lee and Jay. I was expecting to see a young talent gathered in the style of the Dead Poet's Society or similar to Remember the Titans. I was completely put off by the movie. You did not have the characters. It was character-driven, but you do not understand most of the motivations or actions of anyone. The only child of his mother is obsessed with his status as a football player. Why is he so quiet? What is his problem? Did we really need the stage with him to "prove" his heterosexuality? Why should we care? The film gave us a glimpse of the lives of these children and offered no return on investment. It made no sense. <br /> <br /> And why show a movie about a team that lost? I know it's real life, but who makes movies about the losers? Give us a profit for these guys who work as hard as they did with all their "imaginable" problems, darnit. We have nothing. We had a shot at the end of the film telling us that Mojo won the following year with the third member (Lee). Why did not you follow this story? What should we get out of this one? The film drove you, but did not get you anywhere. I just felt that I was missing something. It looked like a poor genetic cross between Varsity Blues and Remember the Titans. At least, these two movies have taken you somewhere. Friday Night Lights was about a team of losers who lost their star player at the beginning of the movie. The actor who played it was great. He was completely bored by him, but you at least understand why. They made sure that you understood him, but he could not play, so why make sure you solve his problems? <br /> <br /> And the other team in the play-offs ... should we believe that they are teenagers from high school? These men looked like seniors or professional players in their thirties. Who were they looking for? I know the other team must look intimidating, but it was a bit too far. I loved the hard side of their negotiation with the black team, but again, how does this fit into the overall theme of the film. Nothing restored. The characters knew more about us than us, and it strikes me strangely. Jay's characters had absolutely nothing to add, but he was introduced. It was just a mess. Not worth a movie ticket or rental fee.
