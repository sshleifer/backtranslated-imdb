"Bland" is probably the word I would use to start describing this movie. I only watched it because it had a good rating here and I was so disappointed. <br /> <br /> Basically, the film speaks of racism in a post-9/11 America and the director attacked it with a mallet. ! There was no subtlety in the film and it felt like they were trying to create a kind of Magnolia sensation in the movie - which is never a good idea because this movie was three hours of boredom and confusing just so that it starts raining frogs in the end ... <br /> <br /> All in all, a huge disappointment.
