If the filmmakers / producers / publicists wish to promote a film as "based on real events" and make a film supposed to inspire and make sense, then, to begin with, in order to maintain any kind of credibility and integrity, you will want to keep a film as honest as possible. <br /> <br /> A team who wears "all black" sweaters and who makes the haka in America is just stupid. Any half-intelligent person would know that the "All Blacks" are the team of the New Zealand National Rugby Union and that their jumpers are all black and that the Haka is performed by them as part of a traditional Maori dance. <br /> <br /> Having such stupidity in a film, without explanation, simply reduces the credibility of the film to zero and cancels the message and inspiration that the film tries to achieve. <br /> <br /> The question is "Why"? Why would you do something so stupid and for what gain? <br /> <br /> I can only conclude that the writers, the director or the producers saw it on television before an International Rugby Union match and said to themselves "wow, that It would be great in our film, no one will know that this has never happened, they are too stupid to know what New Zealand and all blacks are, it will be great. "<br /> <br /> How an American audience would he be able to react to a film made in New Zealand on the American iron, with a team dressed in a Native American costume and paintings of war, performing a Native American war dance, running in circles shouting: "Oh, they would make fun of the head! <br /> <br /> The people who made this film and the industry that created it should really have their heads read.For whatever reason the industry thinks can "cheat everyone all the time." <br /> <br /> It's all stupid!
