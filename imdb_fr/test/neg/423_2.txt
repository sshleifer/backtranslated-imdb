I think I would probably not hate this movie if I spoke Polish. I selected the English version at the first menu, but it allowed me to dialogue in Polish with English subtitles, just like the Polish version. The dialogue may have been so disjointed because the person who did the subtitles could not translate it very well into English. To make matters worse, some dialogs had no subtitles. The acting was pretty bad, especially the main female role, melodramatic about everything! One of the scenes that bothered me was when a German woman was caught stealing and when the crowd jostled her, her shirt opened and the director showed close-ups of her bare chest during the 15 to next 20 seconds. I could not see how his chest contributed to the drama of the scene or film. Perhaps the director was trying to increase the number of teenagers in the audience. Much of the film takes place in an extermination camp released by the Americans. First, the "American" uniforms did not look like US Army uniforms. Second, none of the extermination camps in Poland have been released by the Americans. I think that a 19-year-old Polish filmmaker in 1945 would be better than an American born in 1966 when the six extermination camps were liberated by the Russians. All in all, it's not a very good movie if you do not speak Polish.
