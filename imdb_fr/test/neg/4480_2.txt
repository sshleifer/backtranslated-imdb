OK, you can watch if you are sick in bed or have nothing else to do. The suspension of disbelief required to cross this film is however significant. First of all, in modern society, do you believe that college students are committed to CELA to someone in such a short time, even if you are a "virtuous" Habitat volunteer who loves children with autism? And the 2-week romance turns into an exchange of letters that leads to John's "conflict" over whether to re-register right after 9/11/01 ... REALLY? He asks her what to do? All the guys we know will NOT be sidelined after the fall of these rides (my husband was one of them and I love him and I'm proud of him for coming). John's character is so flat. It is almost inexpressive the whole movie. He is handsome, but not Spec Ops ... he seems uncertain, not confident, calm instead of hell, no tattoos, fight with preppy boys who are nothing more than a pushing match ... walks all around the film without cover on the head ... and there are everywhere technical technical faults (shoulder pads in reverse?). The scenes of war are silly ... John and another guy leaving alone ... huh ?, then another guy is shot and John drags him to thirty meters and begins to give help to a friend before securing the area, the emergency arrival or even having the back against cover ... it's a shootout for God's sake, you do not stop fighting until it's over. .. heck, I wanted to shoot John in the back. Back home, when the truth is revealed and she spills the wine ... we hated her for taking off her shirt in her presence ... WTH? break his heart and then tease him in adultery? She is a puzzle. The best part of the movie is when it gets away from it ... at least there was a little respect and honor. Overall, an amazing story and we did not usually care about these characters or their love. Dismal!
