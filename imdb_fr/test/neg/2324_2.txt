Bud Abbott (as Jack) and Lou Costello (as Dinkel), a comic book partner, need to find a job. They keep a job that involves keeping the kids as a "problem child," David Stollery (in Donald's name). Young Stollery ends up reading Mr. Costello's favorite novel (see if you can guess the title), which puts him asleep, dreaming that he and Mr. Abbott will relive the story of "Jack and the Beanstalk" (you have guessed). The sepia tint goes into color for the bulk of the production. Apparently, it was an attempt at something different for the duo, a colorful fantasy for kids. That fails, but that's where we see Abbott & Costello in color, the silent movie superstar William Farnum (the king) plays a little less, the boxer's brother Max Baer, ​​Buddy, and Stollery before the Disney's "Spin and Marty" movie. <br /> <br /> ** Jack and Bean (4/4/52) Jean Yarbrough ~ Lou Costello, Bud Abbott, Buddy Baer, ​​William Farnum
