I met Yvette McClendon in a movie at the Los Angeles Film Festival and I thought she was a doll. After writing my review of her movie there, I wanted to see her more! Found this movie, it was really bad. It's not her fault, she's only in the first few minutes where she's the one who will make you watch this bad movie. Wrong direction. The scenes are curly again and again, with all the actresses. Amber Smith has a very bad chest job but the other actresses looked pretty good. I really like Yvette but, obviously, it was a bad choice. I can not believe I rented this trash to pick it up. I hope to find other films.
