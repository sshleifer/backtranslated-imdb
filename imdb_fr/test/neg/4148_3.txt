Described from Troma (which is my favorite movie company), Unspeaksble is a messy horror movie that can be interesting but very dark and twisted. <br /> <br /> The indescribable starts with a family in a car, they fall leaves a dead girl and a deformed mother. the father ends up going crazy and crushes the prostitutes. He sees his daughter in other people's homes. He kills for her. Meanwhile, his now-deformed wife is violated by his prescription. They are sick people! <br /> <br /> The indescribable tries to be sick and disturbing and manages to do it like a good horror film that is not the case. Most Troma movies have a sense of humor, but this one does not.
