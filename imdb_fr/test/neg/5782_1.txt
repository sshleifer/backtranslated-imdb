This film is absolutely terrible ... Decidedly a bull story and even worse to act. Too bad, Charlie Sheen is involved in something like that since he's a decent actor and he's done two really good movies. <br /> <br /> The special effects are of the style "A-team" with the classic car shooting and turns with a small fireball under the hood. <br /> <br /> Of course, the enemy is portrayed as an idiot and dies as fast as he can say: "Die bad Americans". <br /> <If you do not play at the movies, do not spend 113 minutes of your life on this garbage. Choose instead the "platoon" or "Apocalypse Now".
