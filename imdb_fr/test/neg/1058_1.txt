Well, you know ... Rutger Hauer and Robert Patrick are both very good actors. But WTF with this movie? The story was lame and the scenario was terrible. The poor actors did not have material to work with! <br /> <br /> The jacket of the DVD invites you to an action movie in flight. You would expect something like Top Gun ... A huge disappointment! The flying action in this movie is so cheap that it makes you throw up. The aerial scenes are clearly extracted from documentaries and other footage sources, not made for this film. And they did not even care about brands or models of fighters, taking for granted that the public will not notice it. <br /> <br /> As I said, the story was lame. With a little effort on the part of the author and the director, it could have been very interesting. In short, it looks like a B movie made in the 70s. <br /> <br /> I'm really sorry for those actors who put their names here. They must surely be ashamed.
