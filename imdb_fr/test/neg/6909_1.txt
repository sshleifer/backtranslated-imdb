My boyfriend and I decided to go see this movie after hearing on the radio that it was a good movie to watch, even with "Cars". In the first ten minutes of the movie, I was horrified. For starters, cows, who should be females, had a male voice. Then I realized that they were really supposed to be guys. I put the disguised cows aside for a while and tried to keep watching the movie with an open mind, but it was so cheesy that I could not help but shake my head. I probably checked my phone a dozen times to see if it was almost done. The plot was decent, if not predictable, but it took a long time to get there. I was 19 years old. The children of the theater rose and ran in the alleys. I wanted to join them. But my biggest problem with the film was that it was filled with references to drink, not to mention the fact that the cows / bulls had been heated and stole a car, then drank and drove, broke into a house. boy to push him out of bed deserved it), then escaped from the cops, which the writers of the film made look like terrible people. This is not the kind of thing I want my child to be exposed to. In the real world, there is far too much of that. If I wanted my child to watch the guys drinking and driving and driving the cops on the hunt, I'd have them go in front of the 10-hour paper. Children's movies are supposed to be an escape from reality, not an escape into ridicule. What has become of the good morals and happy outcomes of children's movies? That's why the old Disney movies, like Beauty and the Beast, Lady and Vagrant, The Little Mermaid, etc. are classics. If you want your children to see a beautiful cartoon with essentially the same terrain as "Barnyard", rent "The Lion King". You can get a great story without the terrible car references on drunk driving and theft. The writers of "Barnyard" obviously tried to pursue the great trend of making a children's movie that a parent could appreciate, but they did it in very bad taste. I would never take my kids to see that, and I suggest you save your money and look at something else.
