The first word I can find to describe this movie is Awful. <br /> <br /> This movie is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. First, the plot is a very thin plot (which I will not say later on this part) and a plot followed by many films of this genre. This makes the movie so bad, because you know what's going to happen. Secondly, the film contains many questions that are never revealed. One of the questions (and it's not a spoiler) is: WHAT CHILDREN DO IN THIS MAIZE !!!!!!!!!! Third, the characters are very bad, not only because the film is bad, but also because of the sorry actors. They are bad as they can be. <br /> <br /> The last thing that makes this movie bad is that it's a horror movie. You are supposed to be afraid of murders or sudden shocks, but you are not afraid, you are not horrified because you know what will happen. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: the film is as bad as the film. about killer ants! I was hoping it was a very good movie but because the story is bad, the actors are bad, the movie raises a lot of questions and because it's not scary, the movie is better invisible.
