*** Small plot spoilers *** <br /> <br /> I have to admit that I have a crush on Wayne Crawford. I know little about him, but he seems to have a lot of enthusiasm to make up for his lack of talent. In his films, he usually performs several different tasks - each of the three main men, director, producer and screenwriter - tackling the stories of the basement. Despite this, the end product is usually a fun treat for non-scouts. <br /> <br /> "The Evil Below" introduces Crawford, an unsuspecting captain of a charter boat, a bit like Bogart in 'To Have & Have Not' - the similarities between the movies end here, however. <br /> <br /> The story begins with an underwater scene with two divers digging through a wreck, before being attacked by an invisible creature - much like the beginning of 'Jaws 2'. The wreck turns out to be that of "El Diablo", fallen centuries earlier. The ship was held by heretical priests who were leaving Spain with a cargo of stolen church treasures. This allows to introduce various links to supernatural forces with Lucifer and The Armageddon. The title of the film refers to this ship of the devil engulfed, rather than a malicious sea creature. <br /> <br /> Whatever the flaws the film has (and there are many), it's fun to watch and do with skill. You can not help but enjoy a film that, in the last 5 minutes, reproduces the famous seaside scene of "From Here to Eternity" and the last line of "Casablanca".
