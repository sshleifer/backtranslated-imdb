We will never know the truth about 9/11. And this film of poor quality proves it. <br /> <br /> I recently saw a report on YouTube stating that no aircraft had been involved in the destruction of the Twin Towers; that all the news programs were supposed to have received the same shots from the sources of a mysterious source (probably the gubmint?) and that, to that extent, the CGI planes replaced the real MISSILES that actually hit the towers .... <br /> <br /> It's a convincing video, and although I'm not a theoretician of the Wacko plot in itself, I'm still not sure if real planes hit anything that day (the Towers, the Shanksville Field, the Pentagon) - because there is no plane wreckage available. (And what about these famous "black boxes"? None have been found.) A million other theories abound, all courting a drop of truth plunged into an ocean of speculation. But you're going to drown in Malarkey before you find anything truthful or worthy of speculation in the September 11th COMMISSION REPORT, a budget-free film that tries to close the barn door after all the horses and the jihadists escaped. <br /> <br /> Screenwriter-director Leigh Scott is obviously an American citizen who wants to enlighten the public on what the 560-page report might reveal. That would help if his movie had actors, instead of a guy who looks like David Duchovny, a chick who looks like Gina Gershon, a guy who thinks he's Russell Crowe and another guy who I'm sure , does his best to be Sean Bean. It would help if his cameraman did not have Parkinson's disease; if the lighting director was not trying to save electricity; that would help if his publisher did not have attention deficit disorder, or if the soundtrack was not an esoteric of the world without further notice; and the loop should probably have been inserted while people were really moving their mouths. <br /> <br /> We can not even call this propaganda. It's so funny. And by funny, I mean unassailable. <br /> <br /> You can not get a problem out of this complex in a two-hour movie, but Leigh Scott is still trying, including all those awesome phrases we've long been planning to attack from bin Laden, purchase of weapons in Somalia, non-aggression agreement with Iraq, Mussawi flying school, weapons of mass destruction ... <br /> <br /> The problem is this: we know that everything is retrospectively, every discussion of intelligence agents concerned gives off a false smell of recoil while a neat conversation. As in the case of reverse engineering, all that is relevant is succinctly mentioned to allow us to shake our heads, marveling at the incompetence of all these branches of government. <br /> <br /> There is a ridiculous questioning scene with a lubricating bimbo beating a guy with tomato sauce on his face. Now, it would be considered torture if most men did not consider it an excitement. <br /> <br /> The slogan is: "What if the attack could have been stopped?" According to the story of this film - and we assume, according to the report of the Commission - that the CIA and other secret agencies were about to capture Bin Laden and did not do so. All those involved in "terrorist" reports (you mean you read these reports?) Are so concerned that we simply want to slap them for their bad action. <br /> <br /> Yet this story goes far beyond the Kuund Klan, a careless man, bet on the American people after 9/11. We now know that even capturing bin Laden before the September 11 attack would not have changed or succeeded: the wheels were on the move, with or without this Taliban figurehead, whose involvement was the possible fruit of the feverish imagination of someone to unite America against a common enemy. Contrary to popular belief, "they" did not "attack" us. While Ron Paul was trying to elucidate, there was a case of backlash in the Middle East - "they" were so sick that America was planting their unfaithful feet "out there" that they brought the war back " this way". So, even though George W. Death likes to boast about nonsense, "we are fighting them out there so we do not have to fight here", in fact "because we are there, the fight has been started." "<br /> <br /> The September 11 attack was not so much a matter of complex planning of terrorists, but a serious negligence of the Bush administration, which, we know without a doubt from the commissions. , had all the information from the Clinton administration from now on, information on terrorist cells reaching critical mass and their intent to cause chaos.But the Texas Oil Idiot, who refused to read his daily briefings and prefers spending his holidays on his ranch Crawford rather than spending an extra day at work, repealed the duty he had sworn to fulfill - protecting the American public. <br /> And then, the scum that's is called president used the attacks provoked by his negligence as a political hammer against his own country voiceless, to mark a second term, shred the US Constitution and make America a do false war on the basis of a lie (ADM), with a country that has nothing to do with the attacks of 11 September. Curiously, the film never passes near the Ku Bush Klan, without giving his opinion or his judgment. Leigh Scott wants to stay neutral. Tell that to the hundreds of thousands of people raped and looted in the False War on Terror in Iraq. <br /> <br /> Coincidentally, I realized I was watching this DVD while I was wearing my "Bush lied, thousands died." T-shirt.
