Nowadays, Ridley Scott is one of the best filmmakers and producers and can make huge money for filming - especially since he has films such as ALIEN, GLADIATOR and BLADE RUNNER. So, on this partial list of his credits, it is obvious that he is an incredible talent. However, if you look at his early efforts while at the film school, you would probably have trouble saying he was destined for greatness. Indeed, although the style and style of the camera are interesting, the film is desperately dull and uninteresting. However, since it was not intended for general publication and it was a simple training ground, I am willing to look at it with charity - hence the score of 4. <br> /> <br /> The film is part of the DVD CINEMA 16: European Shorts. On this DVD are 16 short films. Most are not great because it contains THE MAN WITHOUT HEAD, COPY SHOP, RABBIT and WASP, an amazing DVD for short film lovers and that is well worth it.
