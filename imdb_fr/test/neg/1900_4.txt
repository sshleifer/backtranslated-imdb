This was one of Christie's latest stories. Throughout her long career, she has been interested in the changing narrative and the notion of conflicting agents. Both are essentially the same and boil down to the question of who controls or creates the situation. <br /> <br /> In the crime novel, the game is a matter of contradictory realities. The murderer intends to change the reality to deceive the detective, the writer intends to do the same with the reader. The reader and the detective are in similar battles to create what they see. That's why his stories often include a writer. <br /> <br /> In her works, she explores all the combinations of tricks she can think of. Along the way, we often have bodies that are not what they appear, nor at that time, nor the intended victims, etc. But the real magic of books is this notion of control. In 'Bertram's' it was literally a building. <br /> <br /> Here, it's a dead man. Sometimes it happens, but not like that. It's as if the writer was the famous Mr. Rafiel. This is especially nice to Marple readers who remember this same character from the "Caribbean Mystery", which was somehow also framed by his nephew. In this story, Rafiel was the transmitter of history to the authorities. <br /> <br /> Producers in this series have an almost wacky commitment to using a different creative team for each of them. Sometimes it produces bland work. The episode 'Bertram' was brilliantly staged. This one is the most sumptuous of the lot and has an active camera. But unlike the work of 'Bertram', it has nothing to do with history. <br /> <br /> The camera moves and captures simply because it can. Citizen Kane's quote at the beginning was a little too literal and brutal. This story is good, but the adapter has released quite critical information and it bothers the camera. <br /> <br /> Rating Ted - 2 of 3: contains interesting elements.
