If you are looking for a masochistic thrill, rent this movie and show it to a group of sober friends. This film is a lame plane, but it is not completely worthless. The brief breasts are nice, and there is the death of a victim who is funny like hell. Other than that, it's straight garbage. But it's still better than "Grim" or "Spookies"
