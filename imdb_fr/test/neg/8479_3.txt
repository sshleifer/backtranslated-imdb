This film is not worth going to the cinema to watch, I liked and I did not like, the effects on the film are really well done, and we laugh here and there, but the story is really bad. seemed to be running out of ideas, and what about loki and odin? it totally destroys Nordic mythology, and I guess they forgot that Loki's powers only worked during the night !! If you really MUST see this movie for rent when it comes out, do not go to the movies for that! <br /> <br /> They could have done a lot more with that than they did, it was like wanting to make a movie to show nice animation and effects
