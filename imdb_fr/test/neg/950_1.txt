I saw this movie some time ago and I was looking forward to it. My biggest problem was to have seen the trailer. I was expecting a very stylish arts movie with a lot of action and maybe a bit of a plot to ponder along the way. I was deeply disappointed, as it seems that once you have seen the trailer, there is nothing else to watch (if what you expect is as described above). My girlfriend at the time gave up halfway and while I kept looking in the hope that something interesting could happen ... nothing happened. I found no attachment or real interest in any of the characters. I would say it does not bother you unless you lose a few hours of your life.
