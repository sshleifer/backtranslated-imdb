Deepa again tried to bravely bring out a subject that nobody wants to talk about. The scenario is good, the cinematography is excellent, the scenario and the acting are well below average. I guess the fault lies with the citizens of Uttar Pradesh, India, where its original set was destroyed in 2000. This resulted in a totally different cast. I wonder what movie would have been spectacular if she had had Shabana Azmi, Nandita Das and Aamir Khan. Current actors Lisa Ray (who is particularly good at waving in the sheets of Bombay Dyeing) and John Abraham are pathetic and need basic acting lessons. Seema Biswas, Raghubir Yadav and Kulbushan Kharbabda have saved the film as much as possible. The kid had done a remarkable job. The editing and the unfolding of the film are also not what you expected from Deepa. Big subject, sends a strong message about a practice that is still quite prevalent in rural India but does not meet the standards established by Deepa in Fire and Earth. Look at it once ... when it's on DVD, do not pay $ 10 to see it .... well, it beats the average Hindi movie every day
