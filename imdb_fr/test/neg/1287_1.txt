It is a very bad waste of time. I would probably rather go watch a documentary than this one; it's really so bad. <br /> <br /> The acting game is really terrible, and you can say that the producers had a reduced budget because of the poor image quality. It is by far on the bottom of the ladder; Do not waste your money on it. <br /> <br /> I have a hard time believing that the person who made this movie would be fine. I had to watch it with the kids when my mother rented it because she thought it would be good for the kids. Even the kids (3, 4, 6 and 8 years old) all found this pretty boring. <br /> <br /> I agree with the other speaker, Spongebob would be much better looking than that. <br /> <br /> Overall: just do not look. Do not do not
