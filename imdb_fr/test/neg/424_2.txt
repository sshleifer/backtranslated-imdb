The EXPERT, featuring Jeff Speakman, is the definition of DULL !!! <br /> <br /> Tasteless, characters, monotonous situations, monotonous direction, dull actors, sad actors, boring cinematography, monotonous music. <br /> <br /> I do not really understand this movie. Is it supposed to be an action movie? It's almost as if Speakman wanted to be in a serious movie, but the level of actor and writer found in THE EXPERT is below average television series. And there are typical scenes of "Speakman knocking the bad guys" here and there, but the main aspect of the film is based on some kind of credible drama, which is totally wrong for Speakman or is so badly directed that it does not work. just not with the movie. action star. In the end, this confused movie looks and feels very indefinable and bland. The worst aspect of THE EXPERT is music. The composer is an aspiring Jerry Goldsmith, with his pompous and melodramatic score, which simply does not belong to this kind of film (dull). It's as if the producers knew that they had a very dull product on their hands and they asked the composer to make the film more convincing and dramatic with his score, which gives the film as a whole an even more confused aspect , clumsy and dull. <Br /> <br /> Do not waste your time watching this, even if you're a fan of Jeff Speakman.
