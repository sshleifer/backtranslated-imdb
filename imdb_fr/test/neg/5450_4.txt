Jonathan Demme is such a character-driven director that, seeing him shoot a Brian De Palma (ie singer Hitchcock), it's almost predictable that he will not succeed in creating a lot of suspense in this lukewarm mystery . Based on a David Shaber screenplay, based on Murray Teigh Bloom's novel, Demme attempts to find an echo between Alan J. Pakula's paranoid dramas and Hitchcock's hanging thrillers. Roy Scheider plays a retired secret agent mourning the murder of his wife, who is now busy avoiding the villains who want to kill him. Take off right away, but the script is full of fragile threads and all the excitement goes off quickly. The highlight is visually impressive at the Niagra Falls, but Demme draws little from his cast, let alone from this deplorable story. ** from ****
