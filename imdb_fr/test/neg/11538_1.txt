This movie can not decide what it is - a soft porn or sf movie. Not enough plot for a real movie, but way too much for a porn. <br /> <br /> In a galaxy far away, a good princess (we know she is good because she has long blond hair, wears a white toga, is polite and talks nostalgically about her dying mother when we see her for the first time) inherits the kingdom of her older sister who is perverse (and we know it because she has dark hair and is too much makeup, abuses her male sex slaves, sneering and curling her lips all the time, and speaks imperiously of the horrors she will commit when she is queen). The wicked princess gets angry and tries to organize a coup, but the good sister goes to Earth. Of course, it materializes a naked male in a bar during a wet t-shirt contest. It really goes down from there. The acting is ridiculous, the dialogue seems to have been written for a porn and the general scenario is ridiculous. There is not even enough skin to make happy the kind of person who would watch that for the skin. I love the "good" bad movies, and this one is not even nice at the "bad movie" level.
