I saw this film once in a children's morning at the North Park Theater in San Diego in 1959, when it was released. I was 11 years old. It was one of three movies that day. <br /> <br /> I have not seen it since, but I wish it because I am a film buff and I enjoy the terrible with the big, good and average films. <br /> <br /> What I remember most vividly is that the most sophisticated members of the public, consisting of children aged 8 to 15 screaming with laughter at the tree monster. <br /> <br /> A triple ticket to the theater that features 3 adventure films is something an 11-year-old kid does not forget, but I can not remember the names of the other 2 movies. (One of them was played by George Montgomery and David Farrar.) <br /> <br /> UPDATE: The other 2 films in this triple bill were a lot better. They were "Watusi", 1959, with George Montgomery and David Farrar in the lead role and "The Angry Red Planet", 1959, watched by Gerald Mohr and Naura Hayden. Ms. Hayden has also written some books on health and fitness.
