**** Possible Spoiler **** <br /> <br /> If you make a serious film featuring a powerful but elderly father, with three seemingly unrewarding girls, actors of the highest caliber, with great cinematography and beautiful midwestern executive, where would you go with that? Why, of course, you would make a modern tragedy after the "King Lear". <br /> <br /> That's what I expected. This is certainly not what I got. What I got was 105 minutes of feminist guts - a long harangue about man's inhumanity towards the woman. Why, there was not a decent man in all history. <br /> <br /> You see very early where this film could be directed, but you can not believe that someone would spoil all these actors and craftsmen of quality on this film. Banal scenario - you simply want them to approach the theme of King Lear. But that never happens. If you ask me, the tragedy is real. <br /> <br /> Apart from the panorama of this beautiful rural country, the only thing to watch in this film was this marvelous chameleon, the British actor Colin Firth, who practiced his accent of the American Midwest. . Now there was a treat. <br /> <br /> 3/10
