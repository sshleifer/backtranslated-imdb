Usually, when the BBC publishes a television series, it is used with a satisfaction guarantee. Usually, the television series is splendid, even if the story is boring, you can be sure that the acting is worth it. When I came across Persuasion at the local library, I was looking forward to a nice evening because I was reading the story. <br /> <br /> I'm happy to have read the story first, otherwise I would not do it. Think about it. In addition, I was relieved to learn that the production of this television series dates from 1971, because I had thought so far that BBC had lost. It's really bad and should be used in drama schools as a horror movie. <br /> <br /> The only positive thought I have about this series that people in this film are not likely to appear or be involved in any movie. The BBC or other products of this century, with the exception of the young sisters of Musgroves, who apparently were acting for the first time in their role and behaved remarkably well under the given direction.
