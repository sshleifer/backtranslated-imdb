This film is terrible - honestly. The acting is terrible, the scenario made me cringe, the effects are completely ugly (which does not usually bother me for older films, but it was done just two years ago), and everything that annoys me bothers me. Some friends leave Halloween in the woods and meet a witch and her cannibal son. Of course, before that, there is the clich√© "Do you really believe that? Ha ha ha, it's just a story" the routine dragged on for a while. The cannibal son of the witch has become a retard (I do not know if it was for the comic or to make it scary, but this film failed at a time). It has little gore and no nudity, which has made a bad movie even worse. Heck, the only good thing about this movie is the leg scene that eats, and even that could be done better. <br /> <br /> Honestly, do not even waste your time watching it on the cable, and certainly not think about buying or renting this, otherwise you would waste time, which could have been spent on a more constructive activity or more entertaining.
