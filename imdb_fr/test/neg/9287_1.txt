Usually, I really like Lawrence and being in Australia, I did not see a lot of things about him, so when I saw this in my video store, I thought: yes, I'm going to throw a a look. I wish I had not seen it now. It is obvious that Lawrence had a deep experience that opened his eyes, and I suppose he wanted to share this experience with other people, but it was not the moment or the place. <br /> <br /> All this experience seemed like a motivational speech in hell. it really did it. I believe the slogan of the night was "get it up until the wheels fall" to which he mingled with quite lewd jokes that revolved around sex and sexual organs. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, I do not fear rude humor, but Lawrence does not have the gift of classifying him in the manner of Eddie Murphy, Richard Prior or Robin Williams. Lawrence was just lustful, the only time I laughed was when he relived his experience of justice and his recovery at the hospital. If there were less points, I would give them ....
