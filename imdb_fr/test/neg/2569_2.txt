Wow, I have not seen such a bad movie since "Fire Down Below". Wait, it's a Seagal movie too. Like "On Deadly Ground" and "Fire Down Below", Seagal centers the film on his message of environmental awareness and how the army, the FBI and the CIA are incompetent idiots. The problem is that reality and a reasonable conspiracy are secondary to any gobble social comment Seagal tries to make.
