It's hard to stir up enthusiasm for this dreadful epic that looks like a cartoon and for some reason has become a cult classic. This is certainly not because of the totally artificial aspect of the sets or the limpid play of a cast of stars. Nowadays, it is all too often broadcast on Fox Movie Channel or AMC. <br /> <br /> It pains me to point out that veteran actors such as Walter Pigeon and Joan Fontaine are even part of this confused science fiction transvestite, none of which sounds true. It's like watching an expensive budget spent on a children's show on Saturday afternoon full of cardboard characters and unconvincing dialogue. Jules Verne's novel is a cartoon version. <br /> <br /> Fontaine, a mature woman, remains attractive but has a pained expression on her face, perhaps regretting that she accepted the role of psychiatrist before reading the script. It brings absolutely nothing to its cardboard role, except for an imperial and uncomfortable presence, and seems totally out of place most of the time. Robert Sterling, Barbara Eden and, especially, Peter Lorre, as well as Frankie Avalon, who sings the title track, are not better off, but have not become everyone's favorite song. <br /> <br /> A terribly frustrating experience watching a film like this, which spoils an attractive casting and is an insult to the intelligence of almost everyone. Totally unconvincing from beginning to end. The film, along with the fantastic submarine, sinks to the bottom of the sea long before the fight with a rubber octopus ends the film.
