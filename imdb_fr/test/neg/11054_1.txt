Jeff Leroy wanted to make fun of Scientology and so built a horror movie around a cult similar to this one. The problem is that instead of L. Ron Hubbard, the fragile old man, as leader of the sect, there is a centuries-old space monster that turns his followers into vampires. Our hero is a living and dirty student who is researching the occult. Her owner is an attractive blonde who tries to clean her life with the help of worship. It does not take her long to understand that she is after only one thing: her blood. "The Screaming" was shot at very cheap video and I'm just ugly. The space monster (which looks like a giant winged cat that looks crazy and has no skin) is alternately a clay miniature and a large-scale animatronic puppet, both of which look awful. Playing and writing are terrible and the director does not even try to hide the fact that this film was made for nothing. Avoid this little, scary and pitiful excuse.
