The movie "Chaos" takes its name from Gleick's 1988 scientific explanation of the chaos theory. What does the book or anything related to the content of the book have to do with the plot of the film? "Chaos"? Nothing. The filmmakers seem to have flipped through the book (obviously without understanding anything) in search of a "theme" to unify the series of banal action sequences that cover the series of events that replace the plot in the film. In this regard, the film "Choas" resembles the Canadian "Cube" effort, in which prime numbers serve to mystify the audience so that the ridiculousness of the plot is not noticed: in "Cube", a group prime numbers are mixed for viewers to attribute their lack of understanding to a lack of knowledge about prime numbers: the same approach is adopted in "Chaos": disconnected excerpts from Gleick's books are thrown out to show the villain's actions in the film with a diabolical intelligence. This, of course, is an insulting and patronizing treatment of the public, and any literate viewer of "Chaos" who can stand for the entire movie will eventually become disoriented. How could a movie so bad be made? Rewritten like a novel, the story of "Chaos" would probably not have gone beyond the office of the secretary of a literary agent. How (at least) hundreds of thousands (and probably millions) of dollars have been thrown into what can only be considered a waste of time for everyone, except for those who have won money with the movie? Regarding the content of the film, each performance is recalled. Except for technical problems, it would be surprising if several shots are used for a given scene. The story is uniformly insane: the last time I saw a story to be disconnected was the production of an eight-year-old boy. The other major shortcomings are: The villain leaves clues to the police. He has no reason to leave such references. The police do not carry or use radio. The wicked fools have no reason to act in concert with the wicked. Let me urge anyone to watch this movie. If you like another movie (or just do not hate it), look at it.
