Decent action scenes, but the film is darkened by a slow and complicated story, an almost non-existent dialogue that leads to a minimal development of the character and a seriously horrible story ... did not make sense? But in his defense, the action scenes were quite impressive, even if they let you ask why they happened. <br /> <br /> There is not much to say about the film. It's a smooth and senseless action adventure that makes no sense. It's like watching a worst version of the matrix and ignoring the whole story and dialogue.
