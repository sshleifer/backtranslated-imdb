The title, though singular, will undoubtedly remind true horror fans of Tod Browning's immortal classic about a troupe of circus fanatics and how they have been misunderstood by the outside world. I can assure you, however, that this "thing" has absolutely nothing to do with "Freaks" or even the art of making professional films in general. This film was recommended to me, supposedly because it is crude, disturbing and provoking the reflection in spite of the values ​​of production with small budget. Yes indeed?? The person who recommended it to me can now consider myself my personal enemy! The low budget factor is fine, but it sums up just about everything. "Freak" is terribly slow, badly done and every character that comes up is downright unbearable - and that includes the monster as well. Two brothers and sisters en route to a new life meet a deformed mental patient who escaped from the transport truck to the house where he killed his mother at the age of nine. but instead, Tyler Sharpe decided to make a boring and useless family drama. The actress's attempts to appear emotionally devastated are quite laughable and the total lack of suspense and action can hardly be traced to the limited budget. Total failure!
