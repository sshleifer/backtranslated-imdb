It's a terrible movie, and I do not even know why it's so terrible. It's ugly, for example, with that trendy visual style of the '70s that may have seemed a good idea at the time, but now lets you instantly recognize a film from that period as a product of the' 70s. movie keeps the story and the songs that made the theatrical version of the musical so successful, but the songs sound lifeless on the screen. But most importantly, the film is void because of the poor performance of Lucille Ball, who could do something of this larger-than-life character if anyone could. She wakes up in the film like a terrified actress who chokes on the opening night and the film flows with her. Even Bea Arthur, whom I bet he was hilarious in the role of best friend on stage, can not breathe life into this buffoon. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs. <br /> <br /> Grade: D
