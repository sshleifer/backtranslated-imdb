This movie is the worst I have ever seen. You may think you've seen bad movies in your day, but if you have not seen this one, you do not know how bad a movie can be. But wait, there is worse news! The studio will soon reissue this masterpiece (I'm ironic) in the eyes of all! The only things worse than the plot of this movie are the effects, the acting, the making and the production. Bill Rebane, Ed Wood of the poor man (although he loves Ed Wood's films) manages to get things done at a snail's pace throughout the movie. He starts by catching a baby bigfoot (a Littlefoot? - sorry, could not help it) by a pair of unimaginable hunters, who are killed by the parent. As a result, the entire town where the hunters lived participated in the Bigfoot hunting jihad. That's about all for the plot. Nothing interesting happens, and we, the viewers, can never worry about the characters. If one is interested in Rebane's films, I would recommend almost anyone else for that. However, as I said, Troma will re-publish it soon to annoy a new generation of spectators.
