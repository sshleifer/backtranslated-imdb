I can not believe that I let myself go in this movie to do a favor to a friend that my friends ask me early in the day of April 14, 2007. This film is certainly a pain in the ass at the theater and a sickly boredom, I did not even feel the bloody impact. of his "intimidating scenes" that I consider a complete failure to attract his audience. The worst trampled on me, as my friend was not on time at the theater because she was busy helping her boyfriend find a suitable lodge for a night. I'm not really disappointed in this case, but this film is a matter for me, poor plot, unnecessary scenario, created naively and I do not know what to say. <br /> <br /> The title does not insist in any case on the goose bumps and the horror that it did not manage to attract the attention of the spectators. Perhaps beating the animals could have more goose bumps if they showed in the theaters the real game of the situation. Good luck to anyone trying to watch it anyway.
