This film appears as an exposition of the current trend towards globalization and the homogenisation of the wine industry. More and more wineries around the world are joining large conglomerates (the US producer Mondavi, in the case of this film) or paying expensive experts to help them develop "the perfect wine". become very standard and predictable. For some, it's a good thing (especially since few of them can afford to pay $ 50 or more for an everyday wine) and for others it's horrible because the uniqueness of the small vineyards is disappearing. I can really understand the concerns of both sides and I do not think there is a villain or a hero in this case. Of course, a good cheap wine is a good thing, but like what happened with beers (with giants like Unibrew and Anheiser-Busch), food (McDonalds), shopping (European malls are almost indistinguishable from Americans) and mega-stores (like Walmart / Asda) take away much of the uniqueness of the "little guys". So I was ready and willing to listen to these filmmakers. However, with a product of almost two and a half hours AND a general lack of concentration, the film became a chore too heavy to watch and I lost interest. A target film of 80 to 90 minutes would have been MUCH more effective - especially since the average viewer is NOT an oenophile (this is the most erased word for a "wine lover"). <br /> <br /> On the positive side, filmmakers have the intelligence not to talk too much, but to let both sides of the issue speak. Moreover, the subject is so relevant and timely. However, despite the choice of a good documentary style, the film simply continues for far too long and ends up making a very boring movie.
