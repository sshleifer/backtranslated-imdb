A good idea left behind by heavy production. <br /> <br /> Much of the dialogue was unintelligible because of the level of music / background music, and that did not help this reviewer. The Welsh accents either, sometimes impenetrable enough. Towards the end, I lost the desire to live trying to follow the dialogue. <br /> <br /> This movie did not know if it was a joke or a dark comedy - and they need different approaches. Some of the incidents were so thorny that they only deserved a groan, others were so unbelievable even for this kind of plot that they made the information that was just not worth following. <br /> <br /> well - although the American has become a clone of the mad scientist "Back to the future". The little boy was very good. <br /> <br /> I looked at it from end to end, but God knows why: I do not remember having laughed once.
