It had the promise of being an interesting movie. The subject was certainly promising - the excesses of the Catholic Church during the counter-reform. However, not only has this not been developed (apart from an introduction of two paragraphs), many things have not been explained - ie Gypsies, Anabaptists, Inquisitors and their relationship with the only real church. The policy of the time was not explained either, that is to say the relations between the Catholic Church and its supporters as the Holy Roman Emperor. Although this may have been perceptible to an Austrian public, the lack of explanation is confusing for Americans. <br /> <br /> But it may be a good thing not to focus on the story, because what they showed is quite inaccurate in any case. The instruments of torture, bloody executions, witch burns and heretics, the great shining swords and the beautiful golden reliquaries are the stars of the film. It could just as well have been one of those Conan sword and witch movies, only with period costumes ...
