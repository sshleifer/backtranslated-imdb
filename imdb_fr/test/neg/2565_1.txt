I do not know the rest of the viewers of this film, but personally, I'm completely tired of Steven Seagal's films. When Above the Law came out, it was a very good action movie. Wahoo. Now in the patriot, Steven Seagal plays Steven Seagal of Over the Law. I'm tired of seeing no change of character. It's the same character, over and over again. He needs change. This movie was probably one of the worst action movies I have ever seen. To call it an action film gives it almost too much credit because there are too few action scenes and they are very dispersed in the film. I imagine they wanted to play the drama, but it was a meaningless attempt, because the film describes nothing but Steven-Seagal, the shady look we have seen thousands of times. Getting a new look and losing the ponytail is all I have to say, I absolutely do not recommend watching this movie in any form whatsoever, go out to eat, damn it, rent Barney going to Vegas but do not rent this film under the precept that Seagal will make a great performance.
