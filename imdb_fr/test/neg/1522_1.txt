Perhaps the worst film of the genre. It was a comedy announced, but tragically pathetic. I do not think anyone could have done anything more terrible and irritating if we asked them specifically. It's the humor of the toilets that is very poor, I would even avoid looking at the caravan. I only went to see him because it was announced that if you love Monty Python, you will surely love him. Whoever wrote that was either biased or seriously disturbed. I still do not understand how one can honestly believe such an affirmation. I seldom leave the cinema. In reality, it takes a lot of effort for a film to produce this effect: it did so in just 30 minutes.
