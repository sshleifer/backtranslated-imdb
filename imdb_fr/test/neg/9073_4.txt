This film is about a man who likes to explode on cans of gasoline. <br /> <br /> He also loves his mom. So, to keep the money coming in, he takes his act off Broadway. <br /> <br /> SEE! CODY POWERS JARRETT IS BREATHING HIS LARGEST GAS CONTAINER! TONIGHT! 7:30 p.m.! <br /> <br /> However, one day, her mother dies and Jarrett goes crazy. He removes the spectators in the theater and places them all at the top of a huge bottle of gas. <br /> <br /> Losing control, he makes them all scream: "MADE IT MY, TOP OF THE CYLINDER!" in unison. <br /> <br /> The noise is so deafening that it shatters the hock eardrums, tilting it from the cylinder into a vat of acid. <br /> <br /> This Warner Bros. movie is not all he has cracked to be.
