What I liked most in this film is the opportunity to see Joan Woodbury, who impressed me as one of the many beauties of Charles Boyer's classic "Algiers", in a leading role. She is doing well as Rita, an orphan who gets up to become a judicial police chief. His rise makes me think of Joan Crawford's characters, for example. Mildred Pierce, who realizes her ambitions with a determination and a fierce will. If you are looking for a classic film noir, better look elsewhere. On several occasions, it is difficult to know where this story is going. At first I thought it would include Rita's plot to take revenge on the father and son who trapped her to take the lead for an impaired death committed by the son of playboy. But the period of return on investment was finally only a minor point and a springboard to the second part of the film, which is confusing, in which Rita is increasingly interested in corruption in cities. In any case, it's only 72 minutes. A second viewing should dispel any ambiguity. My copy comes from a Platinum box called "Mobster Movies". The quality of the image is good, but the soundtrack is nil, constantly jumping fragments of dialogue. There are eight films in the box at $ 5.50, which gives each film a reasonable price of 69 cents. Look for Anne Archer's father, John Archer, as a childhood friend of Rita, Bob. Alan Ladd does not have much time on the screen. This is definitely the picture of Joan Woodbury.
