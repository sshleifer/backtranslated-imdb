Let's get right to the point ... It's a terrible movie. The story is confusing, the secondary distribution is laughable and the main actors seem to be forced to participate. History tells us to believe that there is a clandestine sexual cult for lesbians in which members are murdered by their psychiatrist, who happens to be a transvestite. Ellen Barkin investigates the crimes and arouses a crush on Peta Wilson, whose job seems to be to be the recruiter of sects. The sex scenes are equivalent to bad porn and when Barkin and Wilson kiss, poor Ellen seems to be hurting. Barkin's talent is totally lost in this sex-grade sexploitation piece of nonsense and I hope she gave her agent a pink slip after landing it in this movie.
