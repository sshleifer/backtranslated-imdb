In 1994, the film production of Heart of Darkness was in no way up to this remarkable book. The film contained useless scenes that baffled the viewer instead of helping them understand what was going on. The director was obviously not experienced and if he did, he did not show it. In addition to that, scenes from the book have been omitted or altered, rather important scenes. The film left me quite bored and was a total waste of time. The characters acted as if they had no idea what was happening, and the actors did not portray the emotions that Marlow and the rest revealed in the book. Overall, the movie was awful and completely lacking the suspense that was needed to make it even more interesting.
