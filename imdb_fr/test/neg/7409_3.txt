This is the beginning of Jonas Quastel as a director and to be honest, it shows. It looks like he has thrown in all kinds of camera tricks he learned at film school to try to add style to a badly written script, which he helped write! Film to Lance Henriksen and a group of people seeking a plane in the Pacific Northwest that caused the fall of his daughter and a special machine that his company has built and that he also wants to recover. The first 5 minutes of the movie are blurry, shaky or blurry! Quastel tries to capture the "Blair Witch" mode with this type of typing and quickly becomes tedious. And there are also POV shots that come directly from "Wolfen" and "Predator". These shots are from the point of view of Sasquatch. The editing is sometimes very unstable, because a scene seems to move in the middle. I've heard that this movie was shot about 12 days ago and I guess instead of "Going Again", they just went on reading without stopping and put the scene together. And the rest of the film is a fade from one scene to another. There are so many faded scenes that I lost count. Now the nude scene with Andrea Roth. It's not her. you can easily see that it's a double body. And you know you're watching a bad movie "B" when in the middle of the Pacific Northwest, a hot man decides to go for a swim in the nearest hot spring! ******** SPOILER ALERT ******** <br /> <br /> And the Sasquatch itself is not bad when you do not really see it and it's just a blurred image behind trees or bushes, but when you finally see it at the end, you are of course disappointed. First, it is not so big. The actor who plays Sasquatch is hairy only in certain parts of his body. It's a partial suit! And he is bald! I heard that a make-up person died during filming, which may explain why the costume was made in a hurry. Some of the sound effects from the Sasquatch are nothing more than the roars of lions we all heard in other movies. I must admit that Henriksen is not so bad. Yes, he works with bad material, but he has one of those interesting faces that can really improve some moments of the film. People keep saying that a good movie Bigfoot has never been shot but I do not agree. I always said "The Creature from Black Lake" is a good movie and I highly recommend it. I'm a sucker for a Sasquatch movie but this one is just for amateur.
