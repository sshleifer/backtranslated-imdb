Clearly, a number of officers did not see more than dollar signs when they signed up for this 117-minute complex at the Courtesan Complex. <br /> <br /> Of course, the film could have gone well, the million dollars was left out. Seriously. The amount of the check does not matter, prostitution is always prostitution and no amount of "love overcomes everything" can change the fact that no vow of marriage never means "for richer for poorer, for pimping than for loyalty ". Imagine the story differently: 2 children, flat broke, limit "hopeless" and completely stupid. They collide with a rich businessman. Child marriage is severely challenged by imperfect times and the fact that the husband is somehow a loser. Enter Mr. Tuxedo, the oozing charm and stability - a virtual magnet for the clinking biological clock - and with it the temptation, the tensions, the suspense of the woman. Who will she choose? Maybe under these conditions, I could really care. As such, frankly, the selfish and manipulative playboy of Redford completes the sympathetic character. A woman who will sell is pretty much what a guy deserves, who will deflate his wife. The indecent proposal makes the husband a TOTAL loser, lacking any positive male characteristics, and making the woman a cheap trumpet seduced by money rather than confused by another potential love, a woman devoid of moral center and respect for itself. <br /> <br /> All the impressive talents (interpretation, staging, cinematography) lost in this film - and that's an impressive amount - could not save him from his dazzling yet trashy launch line . If I see this turkey at another bridal shower, I'll roast it! (Or maybe cross it with Titanic and throw the band into the ocean!)
