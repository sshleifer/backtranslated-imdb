I come from Australia and have observed with respect the extraordinary culture surrounding the rugby union in New Zealand. I can totally appreciate the comments of Kiwis about this film. It was a total insult to a race of people and their beloved sport. <br /> <br /> Anyone who has participated in making this horrendous film should be required to apologize officially to anyone who has had the misfortune to watch it. Note: People do not kneel or cry as they recite the Hakka slowly. What a pitiful scene it was. <br /> <br /> Are we supposed to feel a kind of sympathy for this idiot who nearly killed his girlfriend, who refused to listen to the advice of anyone with half of the brain, then apparently saw the light ? What a totally detestable character (visits to children's hospitals do nothing to redeem his vile personality). <br /> <br /> And why do people even make a film about Americans playing rugby? They are almost not part of the sport on the world stage, not even to the point of justifying an attempt to film about it (yes, rugby is a world sport, unlike baseball and football).
