I just rented Blackwater Valley Exorcism because the cover and the pictures were terrifying, and I do not normally watch movies automatically released on DVD, but it was so interesting and scary! I really wanted a good horror movie and for me, possession is one of the scariest things to watch or learn. Just watch The Exorcist or The Exorcism of Emily Rose, two fantastic films that have made a breakthrough not only in horror, but also in history. <br /> <br /> The Blackwater Valley exorcism is a girl, Isabelle, from the start is automatically possessed, so that we can not even say what kind of person she had to start. But an old woman thresher become a priest is in the business of a gardener ...? I know I know. Then they go into several other stories with Isabella's priest and sister, and the priest hits the sister and kisses with Isabelle? I do not know, so we go into a story with Isabelle's father and his questioning about his wife's loyalty to him. <br /> <br /> I mean, the story just goes in too many directions and has not been well developed at all. Not to mention that the exorcism did not seem authentic at all and was rather a scary movie for pants, which I did not like at all because I could not take it seriously. Whoever directed and wrote this clearly did not know where to go and how to run the story, so I would not really recommend it. <br /> <br /> 2/10
