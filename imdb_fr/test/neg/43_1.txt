I was completely bored with this melodramatic film for no apparent reason. Everything becomes so serious and people swear with really stupid expressions. Then there is a serial killer who can apparently kill a person to get the title of serial killer. Well, the serial killer loves butterflies and is illustrated by sound effects that you could hear in the dream sequence of most modern movies; <br /> <br /> why, why? I've no idea. It really scares me, but I think that in this universe, what is scary is like talking and adding dark ambient sounds. Just for recording, it's by no means a horror movie, it's is really a thriller (barely). Nowadays, filmmakers have to do their homework before making "horror" movies or at least describing a movie as a "horror movie". it makes me say (in words as ironically) "Acolytes, you take forever to say nothing."
