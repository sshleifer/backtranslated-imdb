Jacqueline Hyde begins like any other normal day for individual telemarketing Jackie Hyde (co-producer Gabriella Hall) until her boss (Robert Donovan) fired her for taking personal calls to work. However, this is not so bad news that the appeal she received came from a lawyer informing her that her grandfather (Malcolm Bennett) had recently died and that he had left her home and his fortune (why do such things never happen to me? Very excited, Jackie goes to her house and goes to her house while looking for the thermostat late at night. Jackie falls into a secret room where his grandfather hides the bright red formula he invented, allowing anyone to drink it to change his appearance. Being a little too strong, Jackie finally settled in the prestigious Jacqueline (Blythe Metz). However, her most seductive alter-ego begins to take control ... <br /> <br /> Written, co-produced and directed by Rolfe Kanefsky I thought Jacqueline Hyde was a total and total shit from start to finish and she is as simple and straightforward as that. According to the opening credits, Jacqueline Hyde was "inspired" by Robert Louis Stevenson's classic novel "The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde". Frankly, if Mr. Stevenson could see what was being done here, he turns in his grave. To start, I think Jacqueline Hyde was / is supposed to be a horror movie, the IMDb quotes it as such, but there is no horror, except for its gravity. I would say that Jacqueline Hyde is more of a soft-core porn than anything else and extremely tamed, why sit back and watch this smoother film than shit soft porn when you can watch some appropriate hard-core stuff that actually delivers the merchandise? Why, that's the question I'm asking here. It's not even a good porn, in addition to being too sweet, it's dull, boring and sex scenes that are worthless, are rare. The most intelligent aspect of this film is the title that would have been rather clever without the fact that another film has used the title of Jacqueline Hyde (1998) during the last century and judging by the summary of the intrigue of the IMDb, this seems a lot better than this waste. It's one of those movies that you have to look at yourself to see how bad it is, but hope you'll never have the opportunity to do it. <br /> <br /> The director Kanefsky obviously worked on a small budget but that's not an excuse. Nowadays, shot on a digital camcorder, the film looks cheap and the few examples of CGI seem to come from a Nintendo Gameboy, the last "shocking" twist probably has the worst morphing effect I've ever had seen and is good enough for a laugh like the scene where Jackie's breasts grow via CGI more terrible. It's another thing, the movie takes itself far too seriously. The subject is rubbish, far too predictable and makes a film mediocre, but perhaps if the dialogue had been intentionally funny with dirty pornographic speech, the movie might have been more fun to watch, but alas, it's is not the case. Forget all horror, violence or horror worthy of the name, because there is no more than a decapitation surprisingly bloodless in the end. <br /> <br /> Technically, Jacqueline Hyde is a homemade film, photography is flat. Music, production design and special effects are low enough to match the scenario. The acting was awful, seriously, it's bad. <br /> <br /> Jacqueline Hyde is, in my opinion, a lot of bullshit, there is nothing positive about this turgid film that I can think of. Any good movie lover will have an almost impossible time trying to find a redemptive value in this crap, certainly one to avoid.
