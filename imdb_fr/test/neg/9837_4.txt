This one is one of those classic B movies after the exploits of 2 hobos. It's done the wrong way and Big Stupid runs like a cardboard cassanova. But Jack Elam steals every scene in which he finds himself as a Crepazoid Jesse (now Jerome!). My favorite scene is that of the lynching and the voice of the father who goes up to 10 octaves ("You loved him?"). Danny, the protégé of Big Stupid, is amazingly stupid, but not as disgusting as our main star. There is also a picturesque scene of a guy pimping at dinner. Joyce Meadows is the kind, naïve and probably the least annoying girl. And those yellow ruffles (RAWR!). Oh, and alcohol is an evil according to Mr. Stupid. <br /> <br /> This movie is a hoot. Watch the MST coverage of this movie and Crow's awesome tribute to Elam!
