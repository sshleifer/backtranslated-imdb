The director of this film is a famous French TV presenter, Patrick Sébastien. He loves music and humor for the rednecks, and his incredible movie is absolutely in his image. This is the story of a young laggard, called "Zep" (sic). One night, he sees the sexual relationship SM of his sister and decides to do the same thing: he rapes the girl he loves! Zep is placed in an asylum and his unlucky girlfriend in a clinic. A man will find them. A man will bring them together. This man is a psychologist. This man looks like an angel from hell. This man is ... Patrick Sébastien! With excessive use of clichés, we will see how Absolute Love can break down all misunderstandings and how a humanist doctor can force a victim to fall in love with his rapist. We will also learn how to use sandwiches to seduce a girl. Not only does Patrick Sébastien think he can do better than a century of psychiatry, but he also imposes on us a ridiculous leftist ideology; with the character of the father's girlfriend, a boss who wants to take away the weak of his daughter. Annoying. But it's very nice to laugh at Zep (the mentally retarded are not funny except in this movie.)
