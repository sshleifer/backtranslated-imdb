I am running out of words. This film is beyond the description. I do not believe there is a language on Earth that contains a word that can describe how horrible this film is. If you are trying to watch it, be sure to stay for the "surprise end". I only covered it three-quarters of the way before I could bear it anymore. Fortunately (or unfortunately), some of my friends stayed until the end. When they woke up from coma and after a few weeks of therapy, they were able to make me aware of what I had missed. This movie has no story, no plot, horrible writing and even worse. If you like watching train wrecks or car accidents, this movie is for you. I think my IQ lost about 30 points by looking at this (insert the expletive word here).
