Macbeth is one of the most frequently told stories in film and has been translated many times in many theatrical and celluloid contexts. Originally written by William Shakespeare in the early 1600s, Macbeth tells the story of the betrayal of royalty and the quest for a man in power. Director Geoffrey Wright (Romper Stomper) strives to update Macbeth by planting it in the contemporary Melbourne underworld. A film in which characters replace swords with firearms (such as Baz Luhrman's Romeo and Juliet) and royal vassals for gangsters, Macbeth is a hard, violent but critically flawed film. <br /> <br /> Macbeth (Sam Worthington) works for King Duncan (Gary Sweet). After being elevated to the rank of Thane of Glamis by the king (as three witches had announced to Macbeth), Macbeth begins to put his eyes on the throne. One night, the king comes to Macbeth and Lady Macbeth (Victoria Hill) invites him to kill the king to take power. Macbeth kills his master and then takes his crown. But success has its disadvantages, as Macbeth soon discovers, when he must make a hideous effort to protect his murderous secret. <br /> <br /> OK, first of all. The major fault of the film is Sam Worthington. His description of Macbeth is in a word ... boring. Honestly, I did not care about Macbeth watching the movie. I had more sympathy for Lady Macbeth of Victoria Hill because she took the trouble to act at least. Worthington is dark and wooden throughout the movie. I had the impression that he was making his best impression of Johnny Deep's character in George Jung of Blow ... but without the charisma. Since I had never seen Worthington in a movie, I'm not sure it was his fault or the director's, but in any case, the glue that should have been all tied together to form a coherent unit is weak. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is good, but when it goes with Geoffrey Wright's Australian gangster motif, it seems a little out of place. Frenzy rhythmic action sequences, combined with long Shaksperian reflections, create a stimulating conflict within the film. I understand that it is Macbeth and that the director wanted to use the original dialogue intact. But the hard and fast action scenes that follow a three-minute monologue tend to become annoying, if not a little pretentious. <br /> <br /> The camera work is very stylized and generally works well. One of the things I found boring was the way the camera jostled slowly, almost constantly. It does not bother me that blows like that are just exaggerated. This goes beyond the realm of cool and stylish and becomes irritating. Apart from that, the artistic direction and cinematography are quite well done. <br /> <br /> For all the good qualities that Macbeth possesses; Stylish leadership, Shakespearean dialogue, soundtrack, supernatural naked witches (the strange sisters), and a good dose of brutal and bloody violence. All of these forces are forgotten when you consider Macbeth's uninspired portrait of Sam Worthington. Macbeth's role was essential to connect everything. In this respect, Geoffrey Wright and Sam Worthington failed miserably, making Macbeth a forgettable incursion into Shakespeare.
