I think it's a teen movie "in alternative reality" ... More specifically, a character like Ferris Bueller playing the role of leader of a cheat ring. Yes, I know it's not supposed to be compared to Ferris Bueller, at least not "oranges to oranges", but it'll be fine anyway. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: they are galaxies far from being even a minor classic. It is visible, but only if you do not expect much. That said, the main character has charm, but the premise is thin, because the writing is just not smart. The film just did not generate enough laughs, twists or tensions to keep me interested. <br /> <br /> To be honest, I kept looking ... I was looking in the hope of seeing if something clicked suddenly. It does not have. So, as stylish as it is, I would not recommend this movie. BTW, it seems strange to see Mary Tyler Moore as the principal. She is really wrong, I hope the salary was disproportionately large.
