Regardless of the serious flaws in logic, no matter what the descriptions of painful cliché characters are, it does not matter how you write randomly, and you may like this movie. The protagonist Alyssa was supposed to be endearing, the heroine to whom you want to be saved (or in that case, to flee). But she just grazes and wonders if all pro ballerinas are really so stupid? His busy mother was obviously needed only to spread the illusion that ballet companies are evil monsters ready to seize your poor innocent girl, with a creative director / villain always present and biting. And the cliché! Not only does she become anorexic, bulemic, an over-the-counter drug addict and a pathological liar, but within a few months. It's as if the writer was reading all the horror stories he could discover about ballet and decided to see how much he could accumulate in two hours (with commercials). <br /> <br /> Believe it or not, but I'm a dancer. This "rising" or "resurgence" of anorexia and bulimia that occurs is non-existent in all the dance schools I attended. In fact, teachers are so afraid to even suggest that a girl have a better chance of losing a few pounds less. Most dancers in my classes would actually be considered to be overweight. I'm not saying that eating disorders never happen, but not to the extent that it was described in the movie. <br /> <br /> Another annoying problem of this movie was the medium-to-end writing style. Her boyfriend turned off again probably spent half an hour on the screen, all in the first half. The other secondary characters were only props, decorations to advance the story. Given the good dialogue, it would have been a very complex study of the mind on a psychological problem. As such, it is turning into a women's show, and Kimberly McCullough does not have the courage to succeed. <br /> <br /> For a non-dancer, this film would be a so-called "glimpse" of what really goes behind closed doors in a ballet company. For a dancer, this is a very insulting film, which describes ballerinas as idiots and parents as busy and uninformed people. These adjectives describe more correctly the people who broadcast this program in the first place. 3/10
