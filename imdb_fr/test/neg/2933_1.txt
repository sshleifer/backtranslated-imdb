I may have been expecting too much from this film, but at least one comedy should be funny, and this one has very few fun moments. He manages to insult homosexuals, heterosexuals, women, obese people and probably many other groups. The graduation scene, where everyone claims to be gay, is one of the most unpleasant I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Tom Selleck and Matt Dillon are ridiculously bad and Kevin Kline seems perplexed most of the time. <BR /> <br /> Other critics compare the movie to "Will and Grace", but at least "Will and Grace" is funny.
