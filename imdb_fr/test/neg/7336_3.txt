First of all, let me mention the fact that, despite its title ("Stories", plural), there is only ONE Cooking History. As to whether Isak died or not at the end, I'm not so sure since, in one of the very last scenes, we see HER PIPE lying on the table next to the two cups. On the DVD cover, there is a reference to Tati. He claims that the film is "very funny: reminds Tati!" The great Jacques Tati relied mainly on mime and silent impasse to achieve his comic effects and offer his critical views of satirical his "modern society" French 1950s. Of course, "Cooking" took place in the 1950s and offers some (rather weak) satirical references to the absurdities of bureaucracy and there are long moments when no words are spoken - but are all these little details enough to make "cooking" a "Tatiesque" movie? That being said, I must admit that "Cuisine" deals with the sometimes false objectivity of scientific research in relation to the "truth" of human subjective emotions. In general, the film was terribly slow, there was almost nothing left - almost none "Dramatic impulse": the most engaging parts were the set up in the first 15 minutes or so and during the last Si hour per hour, indeed, the last segment was - FINALLY !!! - interesting and moving. It might seem like a short subject, less than an hour, unduly extended to some 90 minutes. Now, about montage (a "scientific" commentary on the behavior of single men in their kitchen): at first it seemed very promising - with the mapping of the comings and goings of singles in their kitchen as a means of determining which new inventions would be the most useful. But very soon, this premise turned out to be just a prologue, an "excuse" for presenting the real subject that was only fully developed towards the end and that concerned loneliness and the inestimable link of friendship. Please! Honestly, I wanted to love this movie. Yes, it seemed so promising when I heard about some of his unusual "anecdotes" - which existed well and which pleased me - such as burning a man's nose hair (instead of using scissors to cut it), "investing" to have a huge amount of "value" black pepper piled in a barn, role reversals (the observer becoming the observed), the mouth of a man emitting sounds from a radio show. And there is also a sick horse that becomes the catalyst for half-hidden human despair, the relative importance of driving to the right or left in Sweden and Norway (a reflection of the importance for each of these very close neighbors). close to asserting his individuality?). Am I the only person who did not fully appreciate this movie? Does this necessarily mean that I am wrong? It is perhaps almost generally praised that the "beautiful arguments" were in fact "too subtle" for me? Perhaps ... My personal views on this film might ironicly reflect the very essence of the film - which would be a vital necessity to have the right to differentiate, to assert one's individuality and not to follow blindly the trends and opinions of society? Each of us has the right to have different personal opinions and not to be slaves to the demands of our "dictatorial" bread-making demands: we often have other alternatives that would allow us all to be useful to our society . society while respecting its inner principles. In short, be true to yourself - as in this film, Folke (Isak's "scientific observer") ends up giving up his job, preferring to stay in the house of his new friend, Isak, and help him in the tasks of his farm. ... And then, "Long live the difference", as the French say!
