* Hannibal SPOILERS * Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) is back ... for a parody of a movie! Now he is in Italy, enjoying our food (including people like Rinaldo Pazzi (Giancarlo Giannini)), but returns to the United States for Clarice (Julianne Moore) and even the score with a former victim, Mason Verger (Gary Oldman ). <br /> <br /> Let me tell you that this movie does not deserve to be talked about with Silence Of The Lambs and Manhunter, because it's really, completely, absolutely, totally BAD. <br /> <br /> I mean, the scene towards the end with Ray Liotta's skull being opened and forced to eat some of his brain jumped? WTF? So why was everyone so annoying (including Clarice)? And why did not the story go on nowhere? I guess this is the "teenage" chapter of the Hannibal series; terrible, stupid, gore for gore's sake and totally embarrassing. <br /> <br /> Do not look at it, especially if you like Hannibal movies (SOTL, Manhunter, Red Dragon, Hannibal Rising). <br /> <br /> Hannibal: 1/10.
