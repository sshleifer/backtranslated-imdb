The last installment of the Karate Kid series is predictable, misinterpreted and so painful that it gets closer to the pleasant. But not quite, it's just bad. In this article, Ralph Macchio's Karate Kid is missing, having already participated in an episode of too much. The new Kid, played by Hillary Swank, is the teenage granddaughter of one of Mr. Miyogi's friends during the Second World War. Her parents have recently passed away and her grandmother is trying unsuccessfully to bring up this young hell. In stages, Mr. Miyogi to redress the situation. Faithful to the formula, there is a group of neo-fascist intimidators, called the Alpha Troopers, to be put in their place, as well as a new karate movement, called the praying mantis. As I said before, this movie is a mess and should be avoided.
