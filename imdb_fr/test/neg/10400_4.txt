A group of young filmmakers practically well-off have decided to do something clever and original. Even if there is a bit of originality and a clever design in this more playful puppet show taking for "Dante's Inferno", there is nothing clever. Dante's "Divine Comedy" was a brilliant social commentary. This film is a vaguely moralistic student film with pretensions to great art. <br /> <br /> I suspect that those who liked this film were the ones who were easily amused by the sophomoric elbows against some of the icons of the political and / or religious right, and those who hated it offended to see their favorite icons stitched. Be that as it may, few of these jokes have reached the level of satire. <br /> <br /> The highlight of the film is the sudden appearance of "Schoolhouse Rock" about lobbying and the "door revolution." It's a shame that the whole movie could not be a musical. This would have removed much of the boring pretense of film schools and added a much more powerful element of entertainment.
