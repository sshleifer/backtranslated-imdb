********** POSSIBLE SPOILER ********** Madonna plays an ex-inmate who must retrieve valuable information that could deter her from murdering her that she was put in jail for four years ago. Griffin Dunne is a tax lawyer who marries his boss's daughter. Together, they are supposed to meet in a world where chaos prevents you from getting on the bus ... <br /> <br /> When you go there, it's a stupid movie. Without wanting to reveal the plot, the villains of the film try to protect their boss by recovering the information that would incriminate them for the murder for which Madonna was sent. What kind of villains do not commit murder by trying to hide the original murder?!?!?! <br /> <br /> Then there are the cops who follow Madonna who follow the bad guys in a limo have the bridesmaids all tied up! And let's not forget those same bridesmaids who fought from the front door to the front door, still tied together! And I hate to say that, but this patagonic feline certainly looks like a cougar! There may be only four of them in the New York area, so they may be in danger, but I know there are many in the Rockies (see "Charlie, the lonely cougar" if you really want to see a big "cat" in the movie.) And let's look at the old man who falls asleep on his feet ... NAW! <br /> <br /> The plot is there, but that's all that this film contains, I was just out of adolescence when this movie came out and I was a fan of Madonna, but that was the only reason I liked the movie, but since then, its popularity is no longer as appreciated as me. 'I have faced the fact that she is just a terrible actress (good thing, she has that singing career on which to lean) .It may have noted a "5" at the time, but it fell to "barely make a 2" over the years.
