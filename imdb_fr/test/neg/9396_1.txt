This movie was supposed to be based on a non-fiction book. I'm not sure of the book that the scriptwriter (s) read to write their adaptation, but it has absolutely nothing to do with the real adventures of Frances Mayes in Italy. Instead, it's an uninteresting tale that takes liberties at all times to criticize men. Note the following examples: <br /> <br /> ************************************* ******************************* <br /> <br /> DETAILS OF THE SPOILER <br /> <br /> * ************************************************* ***************** <br /> <br /> Bash Number One: Lane's husband cheats on her and her marriage ends in a divorce. <br /> <br /> Bash Number Two: Lane ventures into a local Italian city and is quickly solicited by all the men in the street. <br /> <br /> Bash Number Three: Lane is saved from the folk men of the city by a charming gentleman. She falls in love with him after having spent an afternoon making love. She discovers later that he is already tied up and cheating on her. <br /> <br /> Bash number four: you have to widen your horizon for this one, because the reference is certainly in the film. Her lesbian couple friends decide to have a baby by inveterate fertilization (SP?). I am told that in most lesbian relationships, one person assumes the role of a woman and another assumes the role of man. In the film, after the woman has become pregnant, the "masculine" lesbian decides to run out because she can not handle it. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, this film has nothing to do with the book on which it was supposed to be based.
