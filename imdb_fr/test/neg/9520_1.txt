What a complacent mess! Duncan Roy's film is apparently autobiographical, but it is impossible to find a glimmer of emotional truth in this chaotic, badly played and unfortunately amateurish fiasco. <br /> <br /> In a way, you have to admire the balls of a man Thanks to a fierce determination and a very generous benefactor, he manages to make a film about his own rise and fall - d a boy from the working class abused to an English criminal lord. However, the tone is so apocalypous or so arch that it is impossible to interact with the characters or the plot. The raw material is potentially a great thing, but Roy seems unable to tell the kind of story that should take you by the throat, then move you to tears. And the reason it was never designed to be presented as a triptych of images is a complete mystery, probably because a single image would have been too tedious to look at. <br /> <br /> It is also interesting to see so many actors otherwise good. - Bill Nighy, Diana Quick, Lindsay Coulson - give the worst performances of their career.
