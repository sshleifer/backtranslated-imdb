If I had to score this movie only on acting / scenario / production, etc., I would give it a star. All these elements are awful. I can partially forgive him, given the film's $ 250 budget. The film contains many amusing scenes, mainly those of the unintentionally amusing variety. These include: a 14-year-old boy flying and driving a bus, hooligan teenagers (one wearing a Joy Division T-shirt) worried about harassing the protagonists of the film by a woman brandishing a weapon false and an encounter with the skull of a plastic bull in the Arizona desert. <br /> <br /> I would have awarded 5 stars for entertainment, without the presence of this granny old granny annoyingly and morally pontificating. I had to moor a star just because of her. Who * ble * makes a wedding cake with black icing, anyway?
