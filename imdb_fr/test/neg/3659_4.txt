I may have seen a clean version, but apart from a few bursts, I'm not sure what these other commentators are referring to. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's not as bad as me. I was expecting previous comments, although the end lets you ask ... WTF? It was dark, but not so much that we could not distinguish the scenes and I think it only added to the terror and the terror of the situation. <br /> <br /> The quality of the film could have been better, the acting was rather decent. <br /> <br /> In short, a deceptively scary movie (and yes, brutal) with a disappointing end.
