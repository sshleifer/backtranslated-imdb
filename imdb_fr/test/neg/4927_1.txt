1h45 wasted this nasty little movie is one to avoid, it's like a crossroads pretty much conspired between saw and some other recent movies about kidnapping, why the writer wrote this is obvious .. he has no soul and did it to try and me some money. The twists were obvious, when those who were in danger could escape, they made the obvious and did not, etc. The only good thing is that I discovered a new actress to watch .. Peyton's list, do not look at the shuttle, there are too many better looking movies than that which will make you unhappy and think less in the world. Spend your time wisely watching good movies, exercising, cooking a good meal .. all but waste time on rubbish like this
