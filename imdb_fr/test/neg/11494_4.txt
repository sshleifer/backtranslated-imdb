I just finished reading Forsyth's novel, "Icon". I thought it was one of the most detailed, detailed and rotating books of pages I've ever read, certainly in my top 10. I acquired a DVD version of the book featuring Mr. Swayze. OK, let me first point out that it would have been impossible to properly adapt the novel to 2.5 hours of film. I understand why the teams have deviated from the book version. However, when I say "postpone", I should say "take the characters from the book, add a few, leave some, delete the plot from the book, add a new modern plot, add the name of the book. Frederick Forsyth somewhere ". I do not say it was a bad image, far from it, some of the effects were of superior quality and the acting was not bad at all. The story was nil and did not rest on logic or reality. Forsyth's novel was so good and so real and modified the facts of reality instead of exaggerating them. It could have been a lot more if he had taken his time and had been turned into a series of 10 games. If you have not read the book, expect a decent TV movie with a good cast of actors. If you have read the book, try to forget it by looking at it.
