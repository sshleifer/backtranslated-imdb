Being a longtime fan of Steve Martin, it hurt him to see him in a movie with such a clich√© scenario. The screenwriter must have just rented videos and taken a piece here and a piece there. has begun. African-American stereotypes and references to slaves are also quite shocking. But the worst for me was to see Martin in a film without any trace of mind. He is probably one of the smartest actors and here he totally sold himself to a totally stupid scenario. He must be late in his child support to be in such a limping effort.
