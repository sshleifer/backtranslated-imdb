File this one in the section "How are films like this one made? column. An independent version of 'Macbeth', slipping into the seventies, adapted quite faithfully (but needlessly) to an unconventional black comic style. The cast gives a shot, with Christopher Walken calling eccentricity as McDuff, and with Maura Tierney rising above Pat McBeth's dull scenario. The other actors are wasted, as well as the time of the public. Knee fans of this weird brand might like it. 4 out of 10
