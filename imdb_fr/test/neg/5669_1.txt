If you think that Hannah Montana or Suite Life are at the bottom of the series between two sitcoms, you've obviously never watched iCarly. iCarly is without a doubt the worst show I have ever seen. From the lifeless game to the low budget, the show smells of cheap, like last week's Chinese takeaway, to simmer in your overheated car. <br /> <br /> The show revolves around a pretty, beautiful, and "supposed to be" Carly, a fun girl, as she and her friends perform a live web show called iCarly. Carly lives alone with her older brother, who is in dire need of advice because he only needs a few cells of his brain. <br /> <br /> The intrigues of the shows are extremely ridiculous and unbearably boring. But it's even worse to have to watch Carly and her friend Sam do their little iCarly show. Basically, they show bizarre pictures and paste objects while the laughter repeats itself. Seriously, every two seconds, the laughter trail seems to go on for no reason. <br /> <br /> So what is the purpose of this exam? you can ask. Just to ridicule iCarly? Well, yes, but I warn you also to be wary of this show. Because seriously, if I had to choose between watching iCarly and Barney? No question about it, I would choose Barney.
