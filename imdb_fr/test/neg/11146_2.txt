this movie sucks a big one. so many holes in the plot. If the devil is invincible, why does he need the protection of bodyguards? I did not understand why arnie did not come to work for several days, then suddenly, he appeared, took all his arsenal and disappeared again !! Good job if you can get it. It is unfortunate that the last half hour ended in the Arnie 'uzi 9mm final. Arnies interprets a depressed cop is to lower his head and sniff. I thought he had a bad cold during most of the movie. Arnie is called 'Buddy', 'guy', etc., for 95% of the film, and suddenly we hear him called by his real name Jericho Cane (where do these names come from?). The end is so twee that you'd better prepare the barf bag. Too bad that Gladiator has achieved the same result with 100% more class. <br /> <br />
