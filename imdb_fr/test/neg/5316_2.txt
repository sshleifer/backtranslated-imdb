Get Shorty was an excellent movie. It was funny and had a perfect balance between a very comic acting game and a serious plot. Be Cool is like a cheap imitator trying to pass for a sequel. John Travolta as Chile Palmer seems to have forgotten that he was a day in the crowd. He plays it as if he were a bored movie director, rather than a bored movie director who was previously a Shylock. Uma Thurman, brilliant in almost every role she has ever played, is tense and confused. Is it supposed to be ditezy or smart? The chemistry between her and Travolta is tense and uncomfortable. Other than that, just add every movie shot you can think of. A rap producer well educated by Cedric the Entertainer, an incompetent gangster who would like to play in Andre 3000, a girl with a heart, soul and a good set of pipes in Christina Milian, a very hot black guy who would like to play Vince Vaughn and a stupid celebrity cameo by Stephen Tyler. The only fun part was The Rock, who invented his new clich√© as a Germanic actor gay bodyguard. The plot is probably the biggest crime: IT DOES NOT MAKE SENSE. Get Shorty was smart with Chili playing one group against another and winning. But this movie tries this with about a million different characters. And even Chile does not seem to know what's going on. The fans of Get Shorty are warned: it's a very different film, a lot worse.
