THE STAR PACKER is one of the 152,000,000 Westerns in which John Wayne acted in the 1930s. Well, the number is a little exaggerated, but it seemed almost the same number. Indeed, these B series movies were quickly made with a very small budget to be the second or even the smallest cinema. Most B & Bs were rather cheap and tended to cut corners to keep costs down and THE STAR PACKER was no exception. To save on costs, incidental music is not used, display times have been reduced to one hour, writing has often been rather derivative and actors are mostly less talented - and Wayne himself was far from being a well-known brand at that time. Some of these features of Wayne are pretty good, while others, like this one, are watchable but are rather ridiculous and unimportant. I enjoyed this movie and most of the other movies, but it's probably because I played a lot at Bs. <br /> <br /> Wayne plays the role of John Travers - an American Marshall investigating actions of a local gang the locals come out and steal from the scene. It's strange, because the film was apparently shot in the modern age or so, because they used modern phones and machine guns - things you would not expect to find in the old west. Such anachronisms are in fact quite common in B westerns - Gene Autry's films (for example) abound. Wayne's mate is Yak - played by Wayne's stuntman and true friend, Yakima Canutt. <br /> <br /> The villain is an unknown character called "The Shadow" and he dispenses his instructions on a black screen. who hides his face! It's very much like a character in a movie series - the kind of villain that kids loved but adults moaned because they were so stupid and a bit like Blofeld or Dr. Evil! The problem is that, if you listen to his voice AND pay close attention, it becomes obvious early in the film that this "Shadow" is George Hayes. Now, speaking of Hayes, this is the same guy who, later in the movies, was known as Gabby Hayes, but here and in many other Wayne's early films, he looks and does not act like Gabby . In THE STAR PACKER, he was well dressed, articulated and clean shaven - imagine that! In real life, apparently, it was more the real George Hayes - although I doubt it was evil! As you can see from the last paragraph, there is really no mystery in this movie. You end up with actors (passable and nothing more) and stunts - which were actually quite amazing. Again and again, an incredible waterfall took place, such as men jumping from horse to horse and beautiful scenes of fighting, all this has been done by Canutt and his friends. Canutt was often double John Wayne in the movies - and it lasted for decades. The problem with some of the stunts, though, is that it seems that filmmakers have actually killed some horses to get those great "stumbling horses" seen later in the movie. Until around 1940, filmmakers often put on a thin metal wire and galloped across it! During the process, the legs of the horses were usually broken and the horses were then euthanized! One of the worst examples is the movie JESSE JAMES - where several horses were brutally killed - which led the American Humane Association to insist that a representative of the organization be on shoots to certify that animals are NOT injured in production. Thus, since about 1940, the films carry this little disclaimer. THE STAR PACKER was made well before the disclaimer and I do not see how the horses performed these "tricks" without being killed. <br /> <br /> Overall, he is at best a time-taker due to a bad plot, sometimes mediocre and an incredible cruel attitude towards the horses. I'm not a bleeding heart, but I just can not understand that contempt for an old, poor animal.
