Larry is a perfect example of the Democratic Party in the United States, of which he is a fervent member. King used to be a little fair and impartial and had a variety of guests. The party was also centrist, but it was another time. Now, like Larry, it's the far left. <br /> <br /> At least 90% of all guests in King's show over the last two years are seated liberals who criticize President Bush and all the conservatives they can think of ..... night after evening. Bill Mahar, one of the most viscous, is - and you can verify it - the most frequent guest in the history of King's TV show. You can count on other leftists declared to attend King's show every week, but do not hold your breath while waiting for a curator. They are few and far between. <br /> <br /> King was also one of the pioneers of excessive media exploration. It all started with the O.J. Simpson Trial. Night after night, that's all you've seen in the mid-90s. Whatever the latest gossip about Anna Nicole Smith, the Petersen affair, Paris Hilton, Britney Spears or another tabloid topic, you can bet that Larry will beat him to death. Unfortunately, all other networks are doing the same thing now. Larry was a leader in this regard. <br /> <br /> King also has the nerve to give advice sometimes, especially regarding marriage. I am not joking; I heard him say it. The joke is that he was married and divorced a half dozen times! This man has few scruples, believe me. In matters of morality, he is without intelligence. Perhaps this is why he invited Dr. Phil to explain to him regularly certain facts of life. Larry nods, but he does not understand more than when Billy Graham spoke to him. <br /> <br /> King is also becoming famous for the "softball" interview, which means he does not ask any difficult questions. This is largely due to the fact that most of his guests are of his political belief. People know that being on King's show is eager to have a one-hour talk with public relations. <br /> <br /> What all this has meant is a serious drop in the number of critics over the last five years. People see through him and his liberal mindset and tabloid-TV and have gone from King and CNN to Fox News.
