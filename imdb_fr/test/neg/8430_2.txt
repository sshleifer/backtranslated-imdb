I remember watching this mini-series for the first time in 1984 with a growing sense of anger and indignation. After reading the comments on this title, I agree with those of the Greek population. It was produced to coincide with the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics, and for me it was nothing more than an American jingo exercise, flag-waved, in which American athletes are lauded at the expense others. Some other nationalities would have every right to feel deeply insulted in the way they have been described in this series. However, this can help explain the behavior of many American spectators at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics and the television coverage that seemed to be interested only in events that the Americans were likely to win.
