I had this film, in the back of my head I saw it. I always wanted to talk to people, but I never remembered it. now I have found it. Finally, I can finally tell people what is the worst absolute movie I have ever seen in my life, without exception. <br /> <br /> This film is pure waste and is not conducive to a dump. . all copies and other copies of this film must be collected, loaded into a large rocket and launched into the sun. Only the heat and the pressure of the sun that purifies could purify the materials on which this film is stored, so that they can again be useful to the universe. <br /> <br /> I like movies. I like bad movies and yes it is an opinion. but this film was purely a junk, a filth and feces of a creature that should never be seen and left unnamed by a man. <br /> <br /> I would rather watch a Uwe Boll film marathon than watch this movie. and I hate Uwe Boll's films.
