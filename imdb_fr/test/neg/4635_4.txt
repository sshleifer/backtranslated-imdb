No bad performance. Whoopi plays pretty well the role of wise and warmth. However, the scenario and the situations can not be believed (forced stereotypes of PC). Sometimes, there are good Jews and blacks against evil White Christians (ho-hum). A typical Hollywood fantasy. The film has its moments, but it's not the one that I would recommend going out of your way of seeing.
