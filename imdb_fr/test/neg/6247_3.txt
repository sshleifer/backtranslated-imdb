Hmmmmmmm - massacre of cheerleaders. Let me think - high school girls are sliced, except the cute who survives. I got it. Next film. <br /> <br /> In fact, I was surprised that this one was made in 2003. I really thought they had stopped making these movies in the 80s. It was really your movie of Classic slasher with eye candy, stupid male horned dogs, even silly adults, and a sexy teacher. He continues on the list of dark and stormy nights and abandoned huts in the woods. We have already seen everything before. <br /> <br /> However, this one had some interesting twists that put it above the classic slashers, so if you have some brain cells to fry and 2 hours to kill - you could do worse.
