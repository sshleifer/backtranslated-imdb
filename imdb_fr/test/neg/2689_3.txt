The discussion took place a thousand times. Is the "Venice merchant" anti-Semitic? (I think this is the case.) Is not it unfair to always point out this little bit of anti-Semitism in a work of excellent quality? (I think that's not the case.) Does this play mark Shakespeare's reputation as the world's greatest playwright? (I think so.) Does that play a role if he did not do it for a particular racist purpose? (I think that's not the case.) Michael Radford knew all this and that's why he added to his film a prologue on the deplorable situation of the Jews in the Renaissance of Venice. <br /> <br /> In vain; because the game stays what it has always been and the new makeup gives only a first (but useless) hope that someone dared to fix something that remains a permanent scandal, not because its degree of anti-Semitism would be particularly shocking, but because the piece bears the name of William Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> Why spend so much time portraying the hatred of a man - Shylock? Why use a big and serious actor like Al Pacino, if in the end everything is ruined in this scandalous courtroom (but hey, I'm not responsible, Shakespeare wrote it). And now, I'd like to be very specific, just like Shylock himself. <br /> <br /> He claims his right, according to the contract that Christian Antonio - not very responsible - used to look at him, signed in full awareness of the consequences. Of course, what Shylock asks is cruel and useless, but that's not the point. What we see (or should see) is a man who has been humiliated all his life, to the point that all he has left is his hatred. I think it's certainly a bit inappropriate to lecture a man like this on things like compassion. <br /> <br /> But what the piece / film does (they are one and the same now) is .. Become a soap opera! The cruel madman with his knife, the horrified public (but rather stubborn), the poor "victim" attached to his chair. Admittedly, Antonio accepts his destiny, but why can not he say a word, "sorry"? I think we should not lose a lot of words about the ridiculous verdict of the young Dottore of Padua; it's really a "popular verdict" not very different from what we would see 400 years later during the show trials of the Nazis. From one minute to the next, this Jew is stripped of all he possessed, condemned to be baptized Christian and expelled. <br /> <br /> Is not it scandalous ??? Obviously not. The story tackles the romantic subtleties of the rings and their happy ending. <br /> <br /> What can be learned at the Libeskind Jewish Museum in Berlin and similar places around the world is that anti-Semitism often goes unnoticed by the masses because what is so devastating for a minority or for some individuals is part of the so-called greater good of the majority. It is a task for all of us to develop a sensitivity to detect and unmask such tendencies. <br /> <br /> I do not accept the excuse that this film was created to create an empathy for the badly treated Shylock (it does not work). I do not think anyone can be compelled to be merciful. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend this movie. especially not for an Oscar.
