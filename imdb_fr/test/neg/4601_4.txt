This film has good replicas, but watching the imitation of Rourke, a fool of Dillon, let me want to see the original. I like Marisa Tomei, but it's not Faye Dunaway. <br /> <br /> In addition, in my opinion, the rule of the number one film is to make the main character someone who counts for you. You may not like the character, but you should be concerned about what happens to him. This is done at Barfly with the hilarious gag on fights with Eddie the bartender. The main fight in Factotum takes place when, without any provocation, he goes to the character of Lily Taylor in a bar, hits her on the floor and calls her a whore. <br /> <br /> All this did not work. . Again, some nice lines - some funny - but as a film, it's a failure. A mediocre attempt to reinvent something awesome, and you can not go beyond that. Following? Let's go back to Tiffany's breakfast with Kate Hudson.
