Another Swedish hillbilly country movie, which is still the northern part. If we showed blacks that way, we would cry out against racism and for good reason. <br /> <br /> It's a joke and you're supposed to make fun of the clich√©s of the "joke". But it's mostly tiring. A gangster comedy, with the bad Russians (as always) and the bad (and stupid) Finns. And the most stupid of all is, of course, the Norwegian, according to Stockholm's prejudices. <br /> <br /> Andreas Wilson is the only one trying to do a performance reminiscent of reality. It's not funny It's not even exciting. Burlesque too raw to interest you in any way.
