This fashionable film, which is trying to be fashionable, is a "bundle of fraternities" of friends of middle school students, now 30 years old (whom we all know, of course, that their generation sees as new 20 years "). Composed of four guys and one girl, we talked about the following types: apparently "unemployed" and frequent addicts, as well as a person who does well at work and another who tries to become one. In their own way, they drift while trying to find a happiness both future and emotional. With one exception, perhaps with two exceptions, they are people for whom this critic would never be interested. There is disappointment after disappointment after disappointment in almost all their lives. Except in the case of an individual (who seems about to find him), none seems to be moving towards emotional satisfaction in his life. Thus, the only sincere moment in this film is the moment when a knock at the door brings to the person answering it an unexpected and sincere "I love you". <br /> <br /> With the exception of the exceptions mentioned, these people are the ones who deserve or deserve only hundreds of thousands of dollars to be spent on presenting their stories. <br /> <br /> PS - The screenwriter / director, Johnson, definitely seems to have a hard time showing homosexual sex scenes --- --- without such problems to introduce more prolonged and revealing heterosexuals. Why could this be? <br /> <br /> ****
