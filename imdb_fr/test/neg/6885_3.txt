This episode has just been broadcast in the UK. <br /> <br /> What a disappointment. The brutal touches of humor were badly judged, puerile and harmful to what could have been a very good story. I can not believe Jerry Bruckheimer allowed this episode to unfold. I saw all the previous episodes of this show and even the episode where Jack was playing his own old role was well ahead of this episode. The lesbian kiss was a pathetic sensationalism. <br /> <br /> The previous episode did not continue either. The story contained no information about Martin's dangerous behavior or potential addiction. Similarly, nothing was explicitly written about Jack's incipient relationship with Ann. Generally, no trace is good enough for this type of continuity. <br /> <br /> The next episode must be a considerable improvement.
