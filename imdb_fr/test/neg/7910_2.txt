After a humiliating experience on a plane, Nashawn Wade (Kevin Hart) sues the airline and uses the money he earns to create his own full-service airline. What sets him apart is that he has sexy hostesses, a dance club on board and no less than Captain Snoop Dogg in the cockpit. <br /> <br /> Soul Plane is a very racist comedy, except that it is sometimes funny. Soul Plane has been described as an "urban" version of Avion. The problem is that Soul Plane is not even close to reaching the plane laughs. The jokes in Soul Pane are too offensive and mostly unoriginal. I would be lying if I said I did not laugh because there were fun times. However, I was expecting more and I left the theater disappointed. <br /> <br /> I would compare Soul Plane to Airplane 2. The latter was simply a rehearsal of the first film, while the first was simply a repetition of obsolete, crude jokes. There is really no creativity behind the film and there are only a few fun places. However, I do not think Soul Plane is "bad 100". At the moment, the film is ranked at number 82 and it's a bit hard. I'm not saying it's a good movie, but it's not great either. The race time is only 86 minutes, so it's not very painful to watch. For silly comedies, you can do a lot more harm. <br /> <br /> Nobody in the cast is very good but they all seem to have fun and that helps. Kevin Hart was very annoying as a Nashawn. He had some funny lines but he is a very bad leader. Snoop Dogg, who was a bit funny in Starsky and Hutch, fades completely here. Tom Arnold was actually tolerable and this was the biggest surprise of the film. The most annoying person in the movie was Ryan Pinkston. He was not funny at all and he never will be. The funniest members of the cast were Missi Pyle and Mo'Nique. They gave the best sentences and they made me laugh the most. In the end, Soul Plane might be fine if you're looking for a stupid comedy, but it would probably be best to just skip the movie. Note 4/10
