All I can do is laugh. Sensational. I like Jim Wynorski's movies, really. I mean, Chopping Mall is a classic. But that, what happened to this guy? He used to make funny horror movies, which were trying to be good. But it was hardly funny ... I mean, I guess so, because I laughed. The bad guy is amazing. I mean, CGI horrible. It looks ... terrible. And the film has no gore, and no nudity as redemptive qualities. It is ranked PG-13. A movie called "Bone Eater", you know, will not be a hit movie, you know it will probably not have a smart script. A movie like this can count on gore ... but no. It really does not depend on anything, it's just ... shit. Check if you want to laugh, though. But do not expect a good movie. I hope Jim Wynorski goes back to movies like Chopping Mall and Ghoulies IV, because that and Komodo vs. Cobra is not cutting it.
