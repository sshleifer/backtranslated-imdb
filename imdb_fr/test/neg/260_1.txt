K Murli Mohan Rao did better than BANDHAN in 1998. This film is a terrible remake of the wedding singer <br /> <br /> In short, the film consists of: Salman Khan who then played the role of a depressed lover who loses his daughter and who also had his comic scenes where he badly beat even today, he does well, he does everything here too and also loses his shirt in the scenes <br /> <br /> Jackie Shroff and tired, his role is so stupid. We see him as a lover of Pooja Bhatra, then in a scene, he is presented as a womanizer. <br /> <br /> Inder Kumar - a new confusing description <br /> <br /> Rani Mukherjee - boring, weightless and does nothing special Pooja Bhatra - tall, fair and worthy of actress , but lacking talent <br /> <br /> Kashmira Shah - said a dial as if it were a poetry <br /> <br /> Mohinish Behl - poor fellow, both children were awful too <br /> <br /> The story is the same and features dreadful comic scenes, a sudden love story, scenes of boring drunkenness and a comic title forced from Shakti Kapoo. r <br /> <br /> The direction is bad The music is correct <br /> <br /> Salman khan just goes through the movements, Jackie is mean, Rani is as usual, Pooja is mean, Mohinish and Kashmira are nothing great Inder is terrible
