OK, let's start with the good: beautiful scenery, Channing Tatum is easy to look at, Amanda Seyfried has beautiful hair, that's about it. How much of this movie went on the floor of the editing room? Probably the plot, the action, a good dialogue and the point. Terrible game, horrible jerky dialogue. Let me tell you how bad it is: my friend, who is still crying at the movies, had the role that was to evoke tears, and she laughed so hard that we thought we were crying! The film seems to want to tackle too many problems - war, loss, autism, cancer, but so sadly fails to cover any subject satisfactorily. Make sure you have something to nibble and your cell phone to return text messages!
