I am a big fan of MD. But I call him as I see him. This film was lame. The plot was absurd. In this film, it is easier to have access to heads of state than to have access to the local grocery store. Come on! Tone Loc has the emotion of a wooden board. Relax! The assembly is unstable. The actors, and I use the term roughly, sound as if they read their lines on the valium. <br /> <br /> This film could have been better. Dudikoff has potential, but he chooses scripts that simply scream: "Stinker". <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a good movie about Dudikoff, can I suggest a Crash Dive or Avenging Force. If you have never seen one of his films, it is not the one who presents you his work. You will leave with a bad taste in your mouth and think that all his projects are as bad.
