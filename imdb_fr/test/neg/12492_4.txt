I was really looking forward to Amitabh Bachan's SARKAR role, but I'm disappointed. As director of Ram Gopal Verma, I was not ready for this kind of film. Sarkar is supposed to be a strong character, but the film shows that Amitabh is too dependent on the power of others rather than his own. There is a film in Tamil called Nayakan based on the theme of GOD FATHER and Kamala Hassan starred. The film is well done and the power to the end remains in the hands of Kamala Hassan, not his son. Amitabh Bachan seems to be too powerless in the film and accepts everything instead of changing things. The film does not show the strong impact of God Father.
