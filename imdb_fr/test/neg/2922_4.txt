This film would receive a much higher vote from me in general and I will talk about the reason, but it receives four stars first and should stay four stars because of the ridiculously tasteless portrait of rape and sexual assault by the directors . Not far in the movie, Oyama sexually attacks a woman he rescued earlier. Although his actions do it a little briefly, this attitude lasts only about five minutes before the adoring love sets in and takes his character into the rest of the film. I know that many will argue that this is not so important in a kung-fu beat-em-up, and as a fan of the genre, I can not say that it's so unusual, but it does not not to be completely tasteless. the time I see. <br /> <br /> What I'm going to say in defense of this film is that it's refreshing to see a martial art, or even an action movie of any kind, which offers no real hero to the viewer. go behind. Oyama is described as a rapist and a murderer; an excluded person in society whose only student becomes completely mentally unbalanced before being shot by the police. The last shots of the film suggest that Oyama himself is about to take a major break and seems to be bothered by the woman he had attacked before to love him and has since followed him with similar devotion. to that of a dog dog. <Br /> <br /> Whether it's the message the film wanted or not, we can not help but feel a little hope that Oyama is about to commit suicide at the end of the film. This is a rare emotional treatment of the martial arts genre and it is interesting to see a film that suggests that its violence should not be celebrated. If only Karate Bullfighter had better dealt with the subject of sexual violence, either by creating more emotional depth and recognition between the two characters involved, or by leaving out all that, the film would have been much more interesting.
