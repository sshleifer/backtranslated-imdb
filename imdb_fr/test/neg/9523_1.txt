Contrary to one of the criticisms below, I do not think that a bright and brilliant career is to come for the director of this inept and fastidious work devoted to the navel. While it is good to see a British director trying to get out of the conventional framework, AKA's only claim for innovative brand recognition is based on the novelty of the triple screen. At first you think this might be an interesting device, but his only real contribution to the film is to test your eyesight and patience. Seeing the same character from 3 different angles in a 2-dimensional movie does not make it more revealing or complex. If you can forget the triple screen (which, by the way, is very difficult to do), then you have to tackle the hilarious scenario involuntarily. The public is pushed by Chiche to submit to the British class system. The film has the political and emotional sophistication of an episode of Upstairs and Downstairs. In summary: the new clothes of the emperor. And a rather poor outfit too.
