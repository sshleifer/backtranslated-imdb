I thought I would see this movie while I'm doing a movie on a mysterious box. It would be nice to see how this film developed and developed the idea of ​​a mysterious and unexpected box. <br /> <br /> Before going to the cinema, I was expecting a lot of this film. with actresses, like Cameron Diaz, one would expect that to be particularly awesome for her. the acting was a kind of disappointment for the film, the characters' accents changed throughout the film, made it incredible. <br /> <br /> The very idea of ​​a strange box that can realize your dreams while destroying others is This is a brilliant story, but I think the director has let it down. This film had a much better potential than it was. <br /> <br /> This film did not have a way. it was too confusing and needed a regular script. no one wants to go to the movies and think about what I just watched "I do not have it at all", sometimes it can be exciting and inspire people to see him again, but this film made you want to never see him want to hear about the movie again. while watching, I noticed that half of the audience was gone before the end. I think that each person was dropped while watching this film because of the high expectations and the slowness of the film. <br /> <br /> leave the negative points aside ... I prefer however the scene where the son is in the bathroom at the end. it was unexpected, it made me think of a horror movie and how it was conceived, I imagined it and how devastating and frightening it would be to be in this situation. the light and the effects gave it an excellent appearance, this scene looked a little more like the 1990s than what this movie is supposed to be. <br /> <br /> This film was confusing because it had so many different elements. Parts that you would expect to see crushed in the end, where everything is clear, but that was not the case, it totally contradicted the expectations of the audience, even if leaving the film on a cliff support did not give not to the public the reason why things were happening. work and do really well, but this one did not, it was an unusual creative film, different I thought, it had the potential could be better, disappointed did not like it, would not buy it on DVD for be honest.
