I had never really been interested in cannibal movies before and until a few months ago I had avoided that kind of film. <br /> <br /> I recently had a knee surgery and found that it took a lot of time My hands were unable to work, so I decided, having seen almost all the horror movies offered by our local video store, to try my luck. <br /> <br /> Was Christ a mistake! I have never seen a film so bad since all my years of being an addict. This is just a stack of ** stuck on a DVD disc and sold as a horror movie. <br /> <br /> I have a lot of respect for other horror fans who can disconnect long enough to take advantage of this shit, they're more brain dead than I'll ever be and it's a feat ! 0/10 and it's generous.
