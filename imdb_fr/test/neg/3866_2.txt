The fifth collaboration between Marlene Dietrich and director Josef von Sternberg, BLONDE VENUS is a film that looks great during its reading, but fails to engage the viewer. Dietrich is torn and torn between two men, becoming a huge star of the cabaret and fighting for the custody of his child. It is confusing and often looks like fragments of three separate films, half cooked together. Dietrich plays recklessly a rather passive and responsive role in most of the film and his character stays away from the audience, while Herbert Marshal is unconvincing as a moody husband, and Cary Grant is largely wasted pretending Out of the picture. The film contains some intriguing decors (the "Hot Voodoo" figure is its climax) that are impressive surrealism for that time in Hollywood, although it does not work in such a dull and incoherent film.
