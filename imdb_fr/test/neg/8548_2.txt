YOU BELONG ME (1941) is an example of the "Screwball comedy" that began in the mid-1930s and ended after the war (World War II). Some of these films have retained their status. Others deserved undeserved praise when they were originally critical and box office failures. Like BRINGING UP BABY (1938) or MR. & MRS. SMITH (1941). Then there is this one whose value keeps decreasing. <br /> <br /> Why can be rooted in the story / story. This undermines credibility from the start, betraying a superior cast. BARBARA STANWYCK is married to millionaire HENRY FONDA, incredibly jealous. He would be happy to sit with his million dollars and love him, she wants to keep his profession as a doctor. She wants him to become what his eyes are a useful member of society. This conflict is supposed to amuse us. It can not be recovered by the director or by the secondary distribution. <br /> <br /> The flaws of this scenario can clearly be blamed on DALTON TRUMBO's feet. The character of HENRY FONDA is written so broadly that every spectator has an instant disgust for him. BARBARA STANWYCK simply has nothing to do but react to every silly situation of jealousy. TRUMBO had to spend too much time outside the studio, being a "useful idiot" and then at work. It is obvious that COLUMBIA did not receive their money, maybe ROBERT RISKIN should replace him.
