The only way for me to feel good about giving these precious minutes of my life is to tell how horrible it was every day. And even if I say it once a day, every day for the rest of my life, I will not quite understand. Just idiot. <br /> <br /> There is a difference between movies like this one and movies like Elephant or Fat Guy Goes Nutzoid, two of my other less favorite movies. The last two were terrible, yes, but that was it. Evan Almighty takes a powerful cast and tries to kill them all. Wanda Sykes, Jonah Hill, John Goodman and Steve Carrell ... WHY GOD WHY? All these people have a lot more talent. Now, every time I see them, I think about this terrible movie. <br /> <br /> The only reason I gave a 2 instead of 1 was when I saw the movie. , there was an elderly woman with an intellectual disability who found the poop dam of birds and jokes hurt by the tools while building was so funny that she kept laughing all the time, almost getting to the gap several times.
