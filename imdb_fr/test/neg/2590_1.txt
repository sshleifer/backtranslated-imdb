I could not believe how bad this movie was, and believe me, I was not expecting a masterpiece of a movie on cable. I recorded it because I liked Jane Seymour. I've seen her enough to know she's an accomplished actress, so I do not know what happened here. The characters were shallow, the dialogue open, the game of bad actors, and yes, that includes Seymour. It was good to see her play against a guy, but not in something so serious. I noticed she had a credit for executive producer and so she could not escape responsibility for the nastiness of this movie. And yes, Barry Bostwick played the male lead. 'Nuff said.
