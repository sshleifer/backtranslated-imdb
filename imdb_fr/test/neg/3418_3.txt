Geoffrey Wright, the director of "Romper Stomper", transplants Shakespeare's "Macbeth" into the contemporary criminal world of Melbourne, Australia. The result is a semi-awful film. Sam Worthington is Macbeth and walks around, looking very conscious and bored. Lady Hill, who wrote the screenplay with Wright, is Lady Macbeth, and she is neither terrible nor good. Lachy Hulme, who plays McDuff, is the only player in the cast to clear any authority. The others, including Gary Sweet, are wasted and misdirected. Filmed in HD by the late Will Gibson, the visual elements of the film lack character. Everything is too clean and too bright. Wright's direction is not inspired to the extreme and the action sequences are confused and incompetent. Mistakenly sold as "the most violent Australian film of all time," the film is sometimes violent and relatively bloody, but it fails to deliver a powerful moment. Slowly moving and terribly pretentious, this umpteenth version of the classic piece on the big screen is the personification of the error.
