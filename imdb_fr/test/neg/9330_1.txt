How does a film become a biblical epic? Simply by quoting some scriptures and using names out of the Bible for your characters? The only thing that was biblical in this epic was the name of the characters. Oh, I almost forgot the 3 kingdoms, Israel, Egypt and Sheba were also used. Where did King Vidor get the rest of his story? It certainly was not the Bible. It was complete and absurd. If you want to know more about Solomon's reign as king in Israel, read 1 Kings 1-11 and 2 Chronicles 1-9. You will even meet Adonijah in 1 Kings 1 & 2. The Queen of Sheba (who does not show up until King Solomon has been king for about 20 years or so, which is long after Adonija & Joab found in 1 Kings 10 & 2 Chronicles 9. One of the first things Solomon does is to create an affinity with Pharoah by taking his daughter. <br /> <br /> Yes, King Solomon became involved in the worship of false gods and is the reason the kingdom was divided after his death, not the temple destroyed by lightning.In addition, I think that Solomon was too busy marrying and providing temples to the false gods of his 700 wives and s to take care of his 300 concubines to fight Egypt, let alone a dead brother. <br /> <br /> As I said, this film was a total nonsense.If you do not use the story of the Bible, call it otherwise, it could just as easily be called Romeo and Juliet or Sid and Nancy. <br /> < br />
