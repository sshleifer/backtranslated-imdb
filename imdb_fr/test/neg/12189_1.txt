I've seen this movie for a long time and it's still one of the worst I have ever seen. I like a lot of movies; science fiction, action, drama, thrillers and sometimes even horror. Not a combination of two. It could have been a wonderful movie, but they all blew it up. I did not want to see this movie, but friends of mine insisted on watching it. I did not know it was such a shit. I loved the first part, in which Clooney and Tarantino went through Texas, killing everyone on their way (especially the scene with the shooting of the alcohol was excellent), but at its turn, in the bar at nipples, everything has changed. Stupid vampires took over and what could have been a perfect gangster movie became a stupid horror movie of the genre "Nightmare on Elmsteet". If you like horror, watch a real horror movie. And if you like bloody thrillers, do not look at it at all, you will be very disappointed in the end.
