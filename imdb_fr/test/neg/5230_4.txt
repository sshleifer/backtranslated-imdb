STAR STARTING: ***** The Works **** It just misses the mark *** That little something between ** Late * The pits <br /> <br /> According to another long news from Stephen King, this is happening in the sleepy little town of Castle Rock, New England (where is also the name of the movie production company!), where a new antique store, the owner Needful Things, opened its doors. The owner and owner, Leland Gaunt (Max Von Sydow) hides, one might say, a diabolical secret. There is an item in his store that everyone wants in the small town: a small cash price is first required, before a much more sinister price is asked. While suspicion, hate and madness tear the city apart, it's up to police chief Alan Pangborn (Ed Harris) to restore order and save the city from a terrifying end ... <br /> <br /> I read Needful's novel earlier this year, things were expected and we were anxious to watch the adaptation of the film again to compare (as if it was going to be any contest!). But it was removed on video and DVD and I could not find anywhere to rent it. So I was happy to have found her in a flea market on a shopping trip ... <br /> <br /> It's one of the cruelest ironies that King's novels are usually the best to read, but when they fit screen nine times out of ten, they are completely unwanted, as is the case here. The material that makes his books look great just does not translate into a movie script, for whatever reason. And I guess there's always the question: why bother watching this when I could read the book instead? <br /> <br /> I appreciate the fact that some are just too long (ie It, The Stand) to be transformed into a complete screen work with all the situations and all the characters included, but nothing prevents that it could not be included all the material of the book. As a result, many of the book's key characters (ie Ace Merrill) are not included at all and we have a terrible character development which means we do not care about the characters involved as they are so devoid depth and depth. motivation - for example, we have a character from the book, Danforth Keaton, who kills his wife towards the end, but we did not learn to stick to any reason why he did not get along with her or the hated, and so it was. no impact when this happens, unlike the book where there was a lot of depth invested and it really involved knowing what happened to the characters involved. All the script material to fill in the gaps, if you will, is really silly and nerdy, and the generally goofy stuff that's included in King's adaptations like this. <br /> <br /> Most of the film's problems are that it deviates so far from the book, but there are also some terrific cast actors who obviously do not understand the stupid content they are asked to to play. In the 90s, much of King's work began to jump from film to television and video. Waste like this must surely make it clear why. **
