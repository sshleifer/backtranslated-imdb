For several months, I was eager to read this publication. The insights looked good, the first reports on the net were encouraging, and Golden eye and Timesplitters were excellent shooters (by the same people). It turns out that I was greatly misled! Haze had the potential to be above Call of Duty 4 and other shooters of the next generation, but it looks, plays and looks like something 5 years ago. I played Haze on a 1080 TV and was initially disappointed that the developers of the game limited the graphics to 720. The universe Haze lacks details and atmosphere. The feeling of "they must have really rushed to finish it" is still there. <Br /> <br /> The commands are slow and cumbersome and I have not yet found any adjustment for x / y axis sensitivity. Many parts of the single-player game are very dark (visually), to the point that you can not really see where you are going. Why not add a torch function like in Halo? or better still, night vision? The use of the "nectar", a drug that improves performance, is interesting, but as you get used to it, you change sides and you do not use it anymore! why bother? I could go on with a lot more Haze faults, but instead, I'll just say, Do not be afraid! Wait for Killzone 2 or play Call of Duty 4 and try to unlock the AK in gold!
