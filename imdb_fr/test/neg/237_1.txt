The robot against the Aztec mummy is one of the most stupid and least credible films I have ever seen. O.K, I can buy that the woman of the film is the reincarnation of a virgin sacrificed to an Aztec god. What I can not buy is that this incredibly false mummy and its robot even worse. When you want to watch a movie like this, you want to see a lot of fights. But the robot and the mother argue about a minute! The worst of all was probably the art of the dia de los muertos that they had in the credits. This is the worst I have ever seen. Avoid this one if possible.
