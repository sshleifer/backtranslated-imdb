I went to see myself suspecting that I would hate it. Everything was wrong; it was like they were filming a different book. Granted the very adorable locations and houses (if not a bit of a mistake-yes, even the house was wrong) Keira was too modern, drab and frankly I found it unpleasant to watch her. If all others saw Darcy as a sex god, the author of this idea considered him sexually frustrated and inadequate. Bingley was stupid and stupid (he is not supposed to be), and the Bennetts have turned out to be poor and for some unknown reason, they are farmers, that's inaccurate and ridiculous. The very idea that Mr. Bennett would answer the door in his night outfit with the rest of the family wearing their underwear in the middle of the night is stupid. They had servants. Mr. Collins was not repulsive and fat, but simply stupid and obnoxious, Georgina Darcy was ugly and old and Miss Bingley wore a sleeveless dress, what! As if! This is historically inaccurate and even the end is not satisfactory. I could go on for days. I hated him so much that not only did he not look like the book, but I fear that for many people it's just their first experience of this great novel and that it gives them the worst possible idea. The BBC version is so superior that it's not even funny and everything in this version is an insult to his memory. In short, if you have to see it, make sure you have read the book first or seen the BBC version, otherwise you will be led by the deceived route that makes it that way, which is not not the case!
