It's hard to say if this B-movie brain adventure is a parody, a tribute or just a failure, but it does not work, no matter how you look at it. Inspired by Michael Crichton's novel, it's a mix of hazelnut towns, giant hippos, monster monkeys, naff visuals and nerdy dialogues. The gorilla who communicates in sign language is the first thing that hurts this tosh, and it goes without saying that the film will not improve any more from that moment. Tim Curry, who turns a piece of feverish ham and sports a weird accent that defies identity, and Ernie Hudson, who also seems to know that it is a load of old garbage.
