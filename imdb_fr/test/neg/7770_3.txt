To be honest, I loved this show and watched it regularly, but now (thank you my God!), I do not understand why I watched it. Sex and the city is one of the most futile and insulting TV shows I have ever seen. I really do not understand the purpose of this show, despite the attempts. People say that Sex and the city is funny. In what? By cursing all the time, talking about vibrators and penis size? Give me a break. <br /> <br /> I do not understand the plot: we have four girls trying to find a perfect man sleeping with every dork coming. And this show consists of four spoiled chicks, who sleep with all the men of the city, but who end up admitting that the greatest pleasure comes from penis vibrators. And yes ... the series tries to tell us that sex is the most important thing in all relationships. If you can have a good sex, you are a good husband (or wife). It does not matter if you want to be loyal and have a good heart .. size really matters. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem is also bad behavior. The four main actresses (Sarah Jessica Parker, Kim Cattral, Cynthia Nixon and Kristin Davis) are so bad and unconvincing that it makes me sick to watch this show. Parker screams and complains all the time, Cattral shows her old tits and says "the word-f" all the time, Davis smiles at him (and nothing else) and Nixon acts as if she's bored all the time. And yes ... men are hungry pigs of sex in this show. But, judging by this show, women are not much better. This show is insulting to both men and women. Women are shown so primitive and emotionless, as if they had no heart, just a hunger for sex. It's insulting to everyone. <br /> <br /> Sex and the City is one of the worst television series and I'm glad it's over because it has bad stories and empty stories. The whole world is not just sex and vibrators.
