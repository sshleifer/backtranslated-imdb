I saw this film last night at the Berlinale as part of the competition. It was presented as the "world premiere" of the film by the host (although it seems that people here have already seen it). I must say that I still do not really know what to do with the movie. I do not know the book, I only bought the ticket two hours in advance and I had only a limited knowledge of the plot. Not enough, it seems, because I was having trouble getting into the movie. The film is sometimes told by Jones but in one way or another, this perspective did not suit me. And I really can not say if some of the laughs of the film were calculated or not. The cuts were brusque and disturbing, the scenes seemed a little closed and the story did not always make sense (even leaving aside the supernatural parts) - the actors were really good but could not really save the film. It was fun, but sometimes only in the sense that I sat there thinking about the technical details of making a film and what was wrong with it. I still do not know what kind of mood the director wanted the film to have. It was a strange mixture of light, darkness and supernatural. Unfortunately he did not attract me at all and I looked at him with a technical eye. But thinking about what is wrong with a movie while watching it is the best sign that a movie has failed. I really would have waited for something else with these actors involved ... too bad!
