Let me start by saying how much I like the television series. The nature of class warfare was always going to be a mocking subject, but this television series exploits it better than most others. The chemistry between Yootha Joyce and Brian Murphy was always electrifying and the writers wrote episodes almost entirely flawless each time. In my opinion, this is the best British sitcom from the middle to the late 1970s, surpassing that of RISING DAMP, ROBIN'S NEST, ARE YOU SERVED? etc. GEORGE AND MILDRED having finished the series ON THE BUSES a few years earlier, he became the next pride of ITV (or ITV 1, as it is now called), after four years of broadcast on the channel. <br /> <br /> The film is however absolutely terrible in almost every respect. The general essence of the TV series has been almost entirely unscathed by the writers of this horrendous film (those that everyone will notice immediately are not those who worked on the series). As one speaker once pointed out, Mildred lacks the sharpness she had on the television series and is not as pervasive as pretentious. <br /> <br /> The plot, instead of focusing on the class war with the Fourmiles is the very foundation of the television series, written almost entirely the Fourmiles after the first half-hour. The plot, if you can call it that, is for George and Mildred to go on vacation to a hotel and mingle with gangsters. Stratford Johns, Kenneth Cope, David Barry and Sue Bond are top-notch talents. Most of them have far exceeded their hour of glory and they all look very embarrassed, as if they knew very well that the only thing worth hanging out is a salary (which will not be probably not much). <br /> <br /> The jokes and gags in the film (if you can call them that) are based largely on the traditional British farce, including misleading identities, embarrassing situations, poorly synchronized slapstick, characters losing control of what happens to them and a general confusion. And all of this fails miserably. As another presenter remarked, it seems that the writers of this film have never seen an episode of the TV series, but instead have designed something that looks like a CARRY ON whirlwind. The scene where George is helpless by the character of Sue Bond is particularly out of context. <br /> <br /> The enigma around this film lies in the BBFC certification - 15 years old. Why is it ranked 15 when everything is to be seen? An innocuous and non-vulgar entertainment? <br /> <br /> It is not surprising that the era of the sitcom ends shortly after the release of this film (shortly after the sad death of Yootha Joyce). And the company behind this film, Hammer, well known for producing horror movies of the first order in the 1950s to the mid-1970s, quickly disappeared in total darkness. <br /> <br /> Overall, the film is a near-fading. . My advice - skip this and stay true to the TV series. You will not miss anything, I assure you.
