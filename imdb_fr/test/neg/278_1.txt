It was the biggest disappointment of a movie ... :( Sucks, because I could not wait to see it. <br /> <br /> All the twists were shit, they were all flashbacks </ p> </ p> <br /> <What makes a good movie is the credibility of the work Yes, it must be surprising that the public is stunned, but if you go away and you go Come on, it's bulls #! t ... what's the point? /> <br /> In addition, the main hold-up was carried away by a bag! You did not have the chance to see the team operating at its full potential misleading and brilliant.There was not even a good hold-up in this movie! They were all void, including the breaks of this French crazy to break the lasers ... It's It's easy to do it when they are composed after! In addition, this stuff has already been done in at least one other movie ... and it was stupid so too ... <br /> <br /> Also, there is no reason to have half of the 12 or 11 years in this movie! What difference does the half of the actors really have in the result of this film? SCENES do not even need to be there! <br /> <br /> The first was elegant. It was cheap! And that makes the whole team credible. Especially Ocean himself for greeting the Bennett.
