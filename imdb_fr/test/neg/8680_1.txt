The good news for IMDb is that this movie was so bad that it forced me to sign up and make a comment. I should add here that I am a movie buff who rarely makes a harsh judgment. But sometimes, a movie is so badly played, poorly designed, badly edited, with such a mediocre story that it deserves criticism. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised by all the claims that super, brilliant, dark, and beautifully shot this movie was. I can only conclude that the actors and the team are active posters here. The acting game was extremely thin. The rhythm of the film was scary. I gave him new chances at every turn (mainly because I did not want to feel like I was losing a Saturday morning in New York), but at each new stage, it dragged on longer, releasing characters that did not not interested, with whom I could not connect, for whom I could not understand. <br /> <br /> When I see negative reviews on IMDb of small indie movies like this one, I sometimes wonder if the poster has a personal ax (something like ... he used to go out with the gaffer, she threw it, and now he will put everything in the bag for which she works). But here, no. I do not know anyone who worked on this film. And I wish it were good. But the film was not dark (as some have mentioned) or depressing (as others have claimed). . . those who suggest that I connected with the movie. . . No, Henry May Long was too long, empty and tedious. <br /> <br /> This is the Tomas Take on this one.
