When he came out, this film caused a sensation. I watched it and was delighted. Beautiful nude women, usually young, filmed in the chic style we knew so well from director Hamiltons. His photographs never become pornographic and the same goes for this film. Today, I saw him again and I was bitterly disappointed. The soft core of the extremely slow scenes, all shot with petroleum jelly on the lenses, is actually all there is. There is no real story, the characters are beautiful and beautifully filmed bodies, but they are not real creatures with a soul. In reality, nothing happens. It's as if Hamilton was photographing using moving images rather than still images. And it gets so boring after a while. I did not even look at it the second time because I fell asleep. This is all that remains of this masterpiece: it is a very good sleeping pill. And you will never get hooked on that! <br /> <br /> At the time, 7 out of 10, now 3 out of 10
