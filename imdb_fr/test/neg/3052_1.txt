The worst movie I have ever seen! 90 minutes of atrocious filming. All the ingredients to make this film a real work of CRAP. Bad acting, bad staging, bad storytelling, bad make-up, bad dialogue, bad effects and bad reasoning behind some actions of the characters. He also added a terrible naked bullet shot from a stupid blond and a chest pulled from a stupid Asian girl. Both attempts were frightening because these girls are ugly. Some good horror movies came out of the 80s, but that could never be considered one of them. Kevin Tenney also committed one of the biggest sins of storytelling: he featured characters at the end of the film (an old man and an elderly woman). I would vote for less than 1 in 10, but the voting system does not work that way apparently. From the sequence of the title, I knew it would be zero and I return my DVD, but Best Buy does not reimburse DVDs or consumables as they call it, or my receipt says so. I have "The Dunwich Horror" and it was really horrible, but I still feel that "Night of the Demons" was a lot worse than "Dunwich Horror". It's like "The Howling", how on earth could we draw from this anorexic cow ??? Save your money and get the "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" (but get none of its suites), "The Evil Dead" or "Dawn of the Dead". "Night of the Demons" is a very, very, very bad investment. Every second was just exasperating and painful for the audience, because the whole movie was awful! Do yourself a favor, DO NOT SEE IT! You will save brain cells.
