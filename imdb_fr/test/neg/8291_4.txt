"Graduation Day" was released in May 1981, at the height of the slasher film madness. Earlier that year, fans had been subjected to movies like "My Bloody Valentine," "Just Before Dawn," "Friday the 13th Part 2," and "The Burning." The theaters were still waiting for movies like "Halloween II", "The Prowler" and "Happy Birthday to me". I saw all these movies and, of all the popular slashers of 1981, "Graduation Day" is by far the worst. <br /> <br /> What "Graduation Day" means is an exercise in poverty and low budget filmmaking with bad acting, bad writing, useless characters, useless scenes, useless nudity, derisory dialogues, and a mounting experience that did not work so well. And who could forget the classic 80s disco music that plays throughout the film (the music of the opening stage is only rivaled by the music played during a hunting scene). However, when renting a movie like this, a person should know that these details will appear in this movie. So, why is "Graduation Day" not considered a classic like "Halloween", "Friday the 13th", "A Nightmare on Elm Street", "My Bloody Valentine", "The Burning" or "Prom" Night "? Why do fans always look for these movies but ignore them without the slightest precaution? <br /> <br /> Slasher movies have to be successful before all other areas. There is nothing worse than a slow-moving slasher and "Graduation Day" moves slowly. The most serious is that there are many possibilities to speed things up; there are many useless characters who are portrayed and never allowed to be suspected in the killings or to be a victim. There is a sordid teacher, a stressed director, a cunning secretary, a dopey school security officer, an insecure detective, an alcoholic father-in-law, a headless grandmother and a mother of another victim still in mourning. All these characters might have a motive to kill or a reason to be killed, but they are all wasted. The worst is that the story always focuses on them and sometimes refers to entire scenes only to give substance to their character. But why? <br /> <br /> What amazes me about "Graduation Day" and its small fan base is that people are no more impressed by the scenes of death. Fans go wild in front of the scenes of death, like the raft massacre in "The Burning", the death of the washing machine in "My Bloody Valentine", the death of the kabab in "Happy Birthday to Me", the death upside down in "Friday the 13th Part 3", and the spa's death in "Halloween II", and even the death of the hood of the car in "Madman". But where is the respect for some truly unique (though shabby) deaths in "Graduation Day". A victim is impaled through the jugular with a sword of fencing, while another is thrown this sword like a javelin. The best death includes spikes under a landing pad. Why are these deaths not famous in the genre like those of more popular films? <br /> <br /> "Graduation Day" strives to be a great and unique film, but there is just one element of logic and a missing rhythm that really ruins the whole experience. It's not the worst of its kind (try to check "Do not go to the woods ... Alone") and there is a bit of suspense, plus, it offers exactly what fans are looking for (blood, blood , gore, nudity, sex, and nostalgia), but we will not remember "Graduation Day" as one of the greatest slasher films ever made. It's not a question of budget - almost all slashers have a small budget - but it's all about ideas, creativity and know-how. That's all that any type of filming is ... <br /> <br /> Recommended for hardcore slasher fans. Horrors in general might be a little bored, and those who are not interested in horror at all should stay away. This is not the worst slasher movie ever, but it's far from the best.
