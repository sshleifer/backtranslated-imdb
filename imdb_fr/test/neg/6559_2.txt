I saw this movie quite recently and I thought, "This movie is bad!" William Shatner is a great actor, but he's not a director! <br /> <br /> It's not just that the acting is bad, it's terrible. And instead of a plot, we have a very bad scenario called a conspiracy! What I thought was really bad was when Kirk and McCoy taught Spock how to sing "Row, Row, Row Your Boat!" <br /> <br /> Do I have anything against William Shatner? No. But when it comes to being a director, he fears! This movie is not one of the worst movies I have ever seen. But this is the worst of the Star Trek series! <br /> <br /> I noticed that after that, Shatner did not come back to direct another movie of the series. Apparently, they did not want him to direct another movie after it happened! <br /> <br /> Overall, this film is bad! <br /> <br /> 2/10
