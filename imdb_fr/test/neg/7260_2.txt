This film begins by showing you a map and then explaining the radar. It will take you a long time to see the killing mantis. Probably a better movie in the 50s, this dated piece is a bit slow, and the end result is not very good. Although it has its moments like when the guy from Perry Mason was arguing with an old man and when he said "I reduced the possibilities to an" excuse me, but when you shrink something, you have a couple or more of possibilities that no. if you reduce it to a level that you have not reduced, but you have actually understood what it was. The monster is the science fiction fair of the 50s, better than the grasshoppers from the beginning of the end. The role is mediocre and the heroine is the least attractive ... in fact, on some levels, she looks like a guy in a trail. You see a lot of archive footage of fighter planes and other things, but you will not see much of the mortal mantis.
