A day in the life of a taxi driver not very aware around Christmas: the taxi driver takes a ticket ... he has an interlude "really insightful" ... he drops the ticket ... he takes another ticket ... another interlude ... and it continues like this for 90 minutes ... nothing convincing (or interesting) even a minute ... SKIP IT!
