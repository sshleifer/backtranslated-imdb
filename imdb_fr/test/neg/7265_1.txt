In short, this film is a statement of artistic bankruptcy. <br /> <br /> Almodovar is undoubtedly the most important European filmmaker of the eighties and nineties. No other living director has shaped the style and content of today's European cinema so much. So it's not easy to say that his last effort is not just another disappointment after two mediocre films, but rather a complete disaster confirming that he is short of ideas, humor and, worse still , empathy for the characters. he created. <br /> <br /> This is not due to the complexity of the story. All Almodovar films are almost impossible to summarize. In fact, this time it's pretty easy if you know his previous work. "Broken Embraces" is a remake of "Law of Desire", but this time the director is straight and the jealous lover is a millionaire. <br /> <br /> For those of you who do not know this movie, I 'll make a summary. If you do not want to know too much, please skip this paragraph. A blind man, who was a famous film director, seduces a buxom sexy woman who reads a paper after a chance encounter on the street (yes, really, that's how it all started). At that moment, he receives the visit of his agent and best friend. He tells her that he has learned in the paper that a certain millionaire has died, which goes back 14 years. He can still see and is about to direct his next movie. He stars the inexperienced mistress of the said millionaire, as he is immediately struck with it. The millionaire discovers their business with the help of silent videos of his gay son, which he synchronized on the lips of an interpreter (some great scenes: Cecilia Roth). After violent quarrels, the mistress escapes with the director in a seaside resort where he learns that the millionaire, who produced the film, made it out in the worst possible editing, thus destroying the reputation of the director. The couple decides to return, but has an accident in which the director becomes blind and the alleged actress dies. Back in the present, he learns that his agent has preserved the negatives of the film and begins to rebuild it. <br /> <br /> As in "Bad Education", several secondary intrigues reinforce this rather thin story, and as in "Bad Education", the result is more confusing than satisfying. For example, the agent's son, who works as a DJ, suffers from an accidental drug overdose - which is totally useless for the plot and is also interpreted in a rather deplorable way. <br /> <br /> But most of the time, the actors do not have to blame, but the way their characters are written. Blanca Portilla, as an agent, has so many skeletons in her closet that even a brilliant performance can not save the character from ridicule. Lluis Homar is the dream of an old man of a protagonist, living in an artificial world where an English pseudonym and some sweet words can seduce any super model. And Penelope Cruz embodies the sexual fantasy of this old man. His character is completely lifeless. It remains totally incomprehensible why she would go from an old man, who at least helped his family, to a man a little less old, who does not have the charm to convince as a romantic hero or passion fuse. <br /> But all these shortcomings would not make this movie so terrible. However, Almodovar does the worst thing that can happen to a director (or any type of storyteller) short of ideas: he quotes himself, what he did more and more, without much benefit. The film in the film, which "Broken Embraces" uses as a means to drive the plot, is actually "Women on the verge of a nervous breakdown" (1988), but this time it is called "Chicks and suitcases ". This little imaginative title can give you an idea of ​​how this beloved classic is treated here: while the dialogue that composes the last ten minutes of "Broken Embraces" is a frantic and exaggerated exchange of liners to screw in the film original, here it is a business meeting severe, colorless and annoying. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, this is the DOA original idea of ​​a creator exhausted from the wonders of the past, as dreadful and disappointing as Indiana Jones' latest feature film. Maybe not many people would agree with that, because Almodovar was such a genius. I prefer to pay tribute to his achievements by humbly asking the reader to watch "All About My Mother", or "Tie Me Up", or "High Heels", or "Matador", all of which testify to the unique character of Almodovar. and unmatched talent. Still some movies like this one, and his legacy might be destroyed for good.
