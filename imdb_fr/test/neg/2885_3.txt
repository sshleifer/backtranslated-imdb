Elfriede Jelinek, who has not yet made her name, is a Nobel Laureate in Literature. His novel spawned a film that won the second prize at Cannes and the first prizes for the main roles male and female. Am I a dinosaur when it comes to aesthetic appreciation or is art so low that everything is allowed? <br /> <br /> "Gobble, gobble" is the preferred orthographic representation in Great Britain of the bubbling noise produced by a turkey. In the world of cinema, a turkey is a monumental flop, measured according to the receipts of the counter or the critical reception. 'Gobble, Gobble' and The Piano Teacher are perfect partners. <br /> <br /> The horrible embarrassment of this widely acclaimed film can not be exaggerated. It starts very badly, as if it were done to annoy the spectator. Credits interrupt scenes without consequence for more than 11 minutes. We are introduced to Professor Erika Kohut, apparently the alter ego of the famous author, a stony piano teacher. She lives with her hoarse and domineering mother. Dad is an institutionalized madman who dies without being seen during the action. <br /> <br /> Revise the piano teacher is difficult, beyond recording his annoyance. What we see in the film (and that I could read in the book, as far as I know) is a creepy, exploitative and absurd account of an emotional pendulum that oscillates here and there without continuing. <br /> <br /> Erika, whose name is little used, is initially presented as a person with intense musical sensitivity but who is otherwise totally repressed. Not quite, because there is a pair of handbags early with his mother's deep voice, which ends with abundant excuses. If a critic must (yawn) extract a leitmotif (why not use a pretentious word when a simpler word would do it), the alternating moods would be those of Elrika. <br /> <br /> A young kid, Walter, studying to become a "low voltage" engineer, whoever he is, and playing ice hockey during his spare time is also a talented pianist. He meets Elrika at an old-fashioned recital in a luxury apartment in what may or may not be Paris. In the relaxed manner of so much art, he immediately falls in love and begins to "look at the woman." <br /> <br /> The repressed Erika has a penchant for hardcore pornography, broadcast briefly but graphically for a few seconds sniffs a tissue in the trash in the private booth where she looks. <br /> <br /> Walter performs a brilliant audition and is reluctantly accepted as a private student by Erika, whose teaching style is characterized by remoteness, hostility, discouragement and humiliation. <br /> <br /> He soon declares his love and soon pursues Erika to the Ladies where they engage in light and whimsical and incomplete oral sex. Erika retains control of her loving husband. She promises to send him a letter of instruction for pleasant exchanges. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, jealous for Walter's kindness, for a nervous student who literally fears before a rehearsal for an upcoming concert, Erika fills the student's jacket pocket with broken glass causing serious lacerations on these delicate hands playing the piano. <br /> <br /> The next big scene (bypassing genital self-mutilation, etc.) is Walter's apartment shared by Erika with her mother. Erika wants to be humiliated, tied up, slapped, etc. Sensible Walter is for the moment repulsed and goes away in the night. <br /> <br /> At this point, there is still almost an hour left. The spectator can only fear the worst. Erika follows Walter to the ice rink where he practices ice hockey. They retire to a back room. Lusty Wally is unable to resist the hands pulling her pants. Her "baby sauce" is soon expelled with other stomach contents. Ho hum. <br /> <br /> Repulsed but hanging, perhaps wishing to take revenge for the insults he has recently suffered, Walter returns to Erika's apartment. Can you guess what is happening now? It's not very deep or difficult. Yes, he becomes a brute while Erika becomes a victim. One moment, he locks Mom in his room and slaps Erika, a moment later, he kicks her in the face, makes love with her and renews her declarations of love. <br /> <br /> Am I unfair in this summary? Watch the movie if you want, but I do not recommend. <br /> <br /> Anyone can see eternity in a grain of sand if he is in a good mood. I could go abroad to the difficult description of the human relations conveyed by this film if I wanted it. But I do not "prefer" because it's a cheap and nasty movie that uses basic instincts and says nothing. I am supposed to say that Erika, repressed by her parents, longs for love, searches it inefficiently in pornography, rejects it inappropriately when it literally appears, pink and nagging, under her nose, belatedly realizes she does not like to be hurt, blah, blah, blah. The world has, for reasons not explained, stopped it. She apparently makes a monster from someone who seemed superficially to love - but we all know that every man is potentially a violent rapist, because that's his essential nature, though he's trying to tell the world everything. <br /> <br /> In the end, if you have the patience to be there, there is a small problem. Before going to the final scene, where she has to replace the student in underclothing with torn hands, Erika puts a knife in her purse. For Walter? <br /> <br /> Yes, you are ahead of me. She stabs herself in an area safe for life and leaves. Generate rolls. <br /> <br /> If this earned the second prize in Cannes, how serious was the rest of the entries?
