Who takes care of the store here? How can a producer / network director / director leave a team to stick the most complex plastic palm trees in the history of cinema in the sands of a winter Canadian beach and try to take us to the tropics? These trees were real palms what a pink tinsel K-Mart Christmas tree is a real fir tree. And who left Dermot Mulroney to stand in front of the camera, the painted gray hair, which would not have missed a play in high school? And none of the geniuses who control the quality of this thing has he thought of correcting (the excellent) Canadian actor when he said gas instead of gas? Everyone involved in this "film" story - writer, director, actors - did not just do a good job but a brilliant job elsewhere. Too rhythmic between events and deadly sluggish, devoid of any emotion, apart from the obvious, the exposed and the artificial - perhaps this seems to be only the worst Lifetime movie because of all the hype from Red Carpet with which it was presented. And I say that as someone who loves life. What gives, guys? <br /> <br /> All that said, the work of a certain actress at some point in the film (and if you've seen it, you'll know exactly what I'm talking about) was so brilliant that the film would have gotten a 10 of me if it was the whole movie. Unfortunately, there was only about five seconds left.
