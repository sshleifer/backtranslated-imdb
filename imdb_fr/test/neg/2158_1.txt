I do not see how one can say that it was a very good entertaining film. With some well-known actors, I had a hard time believing it was done in 2005. It's shit! The game is equivalent to amateur dramaturgy, a bad amateur dramaturgy. Unless you want to laugh at an incredible 100 minutes of pure corn, do not bother downloading or renting it - worse than I've known for years. This goes back to the days of acting, when cowboys shot 8 balls from six shooters. More the actor was known and worse, Drury was just sad. Lee Majors extremely disappointed me. Has he given in to this kind of waste? It was bad enough when he played the six million dollar man.
