It's a joke, is not it ?! Lynch could not produce this as a television show. He was short of money, so what? Well, he kind of received a few dollars and "completed" the pilot and created this mess by simply mixing everything up ... How can you see a failed pilot for television as a cinematographic masterpiece ?! <br /> <br /> And now everyone guesses the deep meaning !? Well, wake up, there is none! As in this other Lynch television series, what was the name again? Same procedure there. Build a mystery and then invent nothing. I guess Lynch will repeat this concept until people realize that the emperor has no clothes. <br /> <br /> In Germany, there is a comedian named Harpe Kerkerling. He disguised himself as an opera singer and "interpreted" new "art songs". Sing nonsense like this: <br /> <br /> "The wolf, the lamb, on the meadow Hurrz!" <br /> <br /> It's a classic now. <br /> <br /> Be that as it may, he then discussed it with the public. And they were talking seriously about the deeper meaning of the wolf / lamb relationship. <br /> <br /> You give this movie a score of 8.0 on imdb.com, your team could be one of them. <br /> <br /> So let's say everything together: "Hurrz!" <br /> <br /> 0/10 Macaulay J.
