Komodo vs Cobra is not going to set the world on fire. This is not a mark of film history. It's a group of underfunded filmmakers trying to make another film, get another salary and continue to support themselves and their families. As such, I leave a lot of time to these efforts. I mean, come on, it must be hard to be a Russian special effects technician. Few big-budget movies were shot there. BUT-- they are a dedicated group and more than willing to embark on any lame American monster movie that needs an affordable SFX. And I'm happy to search the same places in the following of these films. If, for some reason, you find yourself watching this again, watch the sequence in which Par√© and his company walk in a "jungle". Look at their feet and you will see paved walkways. And if you still have a copy of "AI Assault" (posted a week or two earlier also on SciFi), you'll see people walking in the same ersatz jungle. Come to think of it, I think helicopters land in the same clearing in both films. I can admire the economical nature of these films. Every dollar really appears on the screen! Too bad there are not enough dollars ......
