Jesus Christ, what happened here? This is one of the most boring movies I have ever seen, how is it possible that they have messed up such a great idea for a movie. To tell you the truth, I was so excited about it, I thought it was like Blair Witch, but real alien creatures chase the man on camera. Fuck, I've been reduced to fast forwarding that bunch of sh * t, and I'm never doing that by watching movies. The high score obtained on IMDb makes me believe that real aliens give 10 for this shit. <br /> <br /> The invasion is pretty much a good invasion. The film starts by saying that all you are going to see is real, blahblahblah. Then they will talk to me about a special camera system used in cars, as if I needed to believe their bullshit to enjoy this movie. The next thing you know is that I see the most boring car ever filmed, in a forest at night, do you think. Is it a movie or a walk in a Disney theme park? The first 20 minutes are a boring dialogue between cops seeing the grass and a straight road with a flashlight. Where the hell were the extraterrestrials ?! They slept, of course! We then learn that the bad acting is not just a play, as the policeman behind the camera gets out of his car to look for a missing man who "was fishing at night" and who had come across a mysterious meteorite . I wonder what's happening to him Out of nowhere, we see the 'night fisherman' guy walking around like a zombie. The cop is apparently too stupid to notice that something is wrong with this man. Apparently, he was really silly, the zombie / alien guy injecting the cop's ear with some kind of extraterrestrial parasite, turning him into an alien. Then the policeman / stranger returns to his car, looks for a young couple who had sex in the forest some time ago, joins him, turns him into a stranger, then the girl runs to the policeman's car and escapes . If this quick introduction to the script did not tell you that this movie was bad, then the next 40 minutes will be. Watching this movie is as painful as stabbing yourself repeatedly with a plastic fork. The script, although it may seem interesting at the back of the DVD box, is misdirected and, unfortunately, we end up with another boring atrocity directly on DVD. <br /> <br /> The only thing that kept me awake is the constant flashing and loud (deplorable) sound effects. If seeing the same forest trail for 63 minutes is not enough, we have to endure crap flashing techniques to "scare" the viewer and the constant lamentations of a bad actress who gets old and boring pretty quickly. <br /> <br /> If you feel that you must praise this, I tell you, why? There are better SciFi / Horror movies on the market. Even the dreaded remake of the body invasion is more entertaining than that. For the sake of good, do not bother with her bullshit. My eyes were bleeding and for the first time, I wanted to commit suicide. At 1/10, avoid this as an illness.
