It's a breathtaking little movie that is well worth your time to find and see. <br /> <br /> It says a lot about all the banal choices we make every day and (like a story of HG Welles that I can not remember very well) can live to want to come back. <br /> <br /> Keep in mind that this is a SHORT (very short). It starts slowly but just when you start to think that it has become boring = bang = it's over. And, believe me, you will remember the "typing line". <br /> <br /> I do not know if the producers will make it available for purchase - or on the Internet, but in any case you would be happy that you took the time to get a copy, I'm sure.
