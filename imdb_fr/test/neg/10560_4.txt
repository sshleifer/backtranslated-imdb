As a professional poker dealer for over 25 years, I found this movie very difficult to watch. Too unreal. It seems that the producers of this film have done little or no research or they just have not done it. Card tricks are something you would never see playing in a real poker game. Common sense, no? Plus, he was full of movie and other cuts during the tours. Who could not do that? Cheating was an amateur thing. Palming, marked cards, etc. Would you like to sit in a high limit game where they use open cards? Do you want to sit in a game where players put their chips in the middle of a pot (at any time), mixing them and verbalizing how much they bet? Let's go! I gave it a 4 because the twists could be interesting for some people, but for those who know how to play the game, it will be quite painful. Next time they should use real players and get a glimpse of how to do things right. OUCH!!!
