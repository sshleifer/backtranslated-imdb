I mostly watched "Gristle" for the presence of Michael Dorn, while I enjoyed his rendition of Worf on Star Trek TNG, but I had never seen him wearing makeup. Dorn seems to have a good presence and probably has the potential for a profitable acting career. This film, however, gave him little dramatic challenge, except to prove that he can, indeed, use the word "F". <br /> <br /> It seems that this film was made by a person posing as a type of thought, with a social conscience. Yeah --- for 1965. Today, the themes are so elaborate and sophomoric that even the awful "Bamboozled" of Spike Lee looks great in comparison. <br /> <br /> This police caper movie has a complex complex of doubloons -, triple, and quadruple-butts, but the plot is so complicated that it collapses on itself in the first 30 minutes . Above all, after that moment, I simply looked out of the momentum and a slight curiosity about how each scene would unfold. There is an excellent cast here - you'll recognize almost everyone as a character actor of much better films. Why are they all in this? I guess it was 1) Work and money, even modest. 2) Maybe the director knows all these actors from the acting classes and social relations around LA --- you know, they may have participated to support him, as a filmmaker in the third and fourth floors of the Hollywood scene. I do not know ... but the film was half-cooked - not really "finished". I gave him a 3, although my affection for the actors involved was not reduced to my admiration for their previous work. Hope everyone has since moved on to more professional, neat and in-depth projects.
