No, just no. That's all that needs to be said. <br /> <br /> Summary: A random guy is in a cornfield. For some reason, I'm not sure, but it's his job to run inside. The next big thriller? <br /> <br /> A five-year-old could make a better movie than shoot an anthill, or even grow grass. Seriously ..... <br /> <br /> You can not say that he has bad behavior because there is NO actor. You can not say that writing is bad because it does not have writing. You can not say that cinematography is bad because there is NO cinematography. You can not say it's a bad movie, BECAUSE THERE IS NO FILM! If you do not believe me, go watch it. Just do not say I never warned you .....
