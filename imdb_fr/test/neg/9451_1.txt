It's really the worst movie I've ever seen. From the beginning, the film goes straight to the point with its chunky music score, mediocre playing and total absence or story or script. Even for a movie B, it's horrible. After reading some of the good reviews, I thought of keeping an open mind and watching it. But all the bad reviews were really correct. I can not understand how anyone could have benefited from it. I'm a big fan of science fiction and it was more than I could swallow. Make yourself definitely happy to move on to another movie. These are many other best films dealing with this subject. YOU WERE PREVENTED.
