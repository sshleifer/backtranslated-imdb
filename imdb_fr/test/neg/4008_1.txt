Let me tell you a story. <br /> <br /> One day, in the streets of Athens, a filmmaker ran into a prostitute and decided that the world MUST simply know her story because ... you know ... he is private ... and he takes off his shirt a lot and ... so on. <br /> <br /> This film is the result of his revelation. Repulsive, depraved, homophobic, misogynist ... but of course filled with handsome guys with a visible chest. If this is your idea of ​​a good movie, then enjoy it, otherwise avoid it like the plague. <br /> <br /> It worries me never to go to Greece, that's for sure.
