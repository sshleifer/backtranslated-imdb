A conspiracy that is stupid beyond belief However, that said, it must be admitted that the main actors play their roles as if it were Shakespeare. And it's as it should be. It's not their fault that the writer seems to be in a coma. <br /> <br /> I would like to congratulate Joanna Kerns for her cunning performance. It proves that the fact that it is not on the page does not mean that a role can not be grasped and dug. And she does it brilliantly. Good for her. <br /> <br /> Ditto for Christine Elise who is called to be a little more confused and crying, but that goes well beyond what the scenario asks him. <br /> <br /> And at Grant Show too. Graduate of soap operas and prime time (Ryan's Hope, Melrose Place). He is always versatile and underrated. His main disadvantage seems to be his flawless appearance. He is a solid and well-grounded actor, capable of doing much more than he is usually given the opportunity to do. <br /> <br /> The rest of the distribution is essentially a window decoration. <br /> <br /> The direction is adequate and the scenario, as I already mentioned, is pretty silly. <br /> <br /> Look at it to enjoy the three good actors of the film taking pleasure in singing landscapes so necessary. It's funny.
