While the film cost only $ 150,000, it explains a lot. But that does not explain why there is no real plot. Halfway through the movie, honestly, I did not care if they took it out or not. I just wanted to finish the movie and go to bed. The end was really stupid and made me wish I had just closed the film and went to bed early. Very good acting, considering that there was not much to do. If you like very bad movies with horrible lighting (even for a cave) and bad camera work (even for a cave) ... then you will really like this movie. By the way, if the boy's plane crashed in 1980 when he was about 10 years old, how could he forget how to talk and accumulate so much anger ?? Would not he want to get help from the first people he saw even though it was 14 years later?
