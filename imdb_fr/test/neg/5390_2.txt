Most other publications have beaten this film and rightly so. I just talked about the technical inefficiency of filmmakers. It would have been nice if the director had at least had lunch with someone who knew what a gun was, because he had no idea. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS AHEAD !!! YOU WERE PREVENTED !!! <br /> <br /> Stupidity: <br /> <br /> The Spec Ops team consists of various military units whose members have never met before. <br /> <br /> Maybe two people from the unit were weapons who used the same stores, parts, ammunition, etc. <br /> <br /> The sniper school instructor uses a secondary (pistol-sized) submachine gun as opposed to a rifle with which it might be more competent. <br /> <br /> The night vision optics of a poor member of the team weighs more than the rifle. You know when he will handle it, that the weight is seriously heavy. <br /> <br /> The team leader sends a member of the team to "challenge" the skeleton man when he confronts himself for the first time. Challenge a 200-year-old resuscitated Native American skeleton with a long spear and an attitude straddling an undead warhorse that blew from the nose? I think no, Bubba. <br /> <br /> The bullets do not spark when they fall on the trees, Mr. Director. (Some people have already mentioned this.) <br /> <br /> The "air support" team consists of a ubiquitous "black helicopter", only this one is equipped with two Sidewinder missiles. Someone forgot to tell the helicopter crew that the skeleton man was not flying overhead and flying over the heart of America where there will be no enemy aircraft. They should have carried air-to-surface missiles instead. <br /> <br /> The air-to-ground munition of the helicopter consists of a gunner with an AK-47 (or 74?) Semi-automatic. Needless to say, it only hits the dirt. Should have brought a light machine gun powered by belt. <br /> <br /> The gunner later discovers that a grenade launcher is also useless. <br /> <br /> A wooden arrow coming from a bow bent not on board helicopters, Mr Director. <br /> <br /> I could not take more after this point (about 30 minutes) and I gave up. You really need a drop of morphine to make this movie a success, it's also painful.
