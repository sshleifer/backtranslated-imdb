I am a big fan of Robert Taylor and I try to find all his movies. It's a movie I did not have, but I watched it recently on Fox Movie Channel and was very disappointed. I know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts, but the acting was as bad as the script. Victor McLaglen was even mean and Brian DonLevy was almost unrecognizable. Given off-screen relationships between Taylor and Stanwyck, it was surprising to see little chemistry on the screen between them. But the premise of the film was so ridiculous: that the US president would order a naval lieutenant to leave the service secretly to hunt down bank robbers and report back only to the film president. The scenes on death row were totally motionless. The only thing worse than Taylor's was Stanwyck's song. She improved later in Ball of Fire - thank goodness.
