I love the first and third masters of animals, but this one was an abomination. It was almost as bad as "The Never Ending Story 3" for the same reasons. They took on a fascinating fantasy world of barbarian tribes, farming villages, witches, supernatural creatures and a cult of religious fanatics using a pyramid; and thought it would be fun to mingle with our materialistic world of rock culture, sushi (I think that's what it was) and vibrant sports cars. These two worlds do not go together. I do not want to see a group of old barbarians who look like rock songs on the car radio. I have a sense of humor, but it's just stupid. That's what Hollywood does to good fiction movies when they run out of ideas. Do not give up however, Braxus's eye is much better. The one I gave a 10. This one, Portal of Time, I give a 1. Believe me, I do not always give such high or low ratings. I just tend to comment on only such films.
