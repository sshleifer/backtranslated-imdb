I saw this movie yesterday and, like most allrdy wrote "I was also expecting a Steven movie", god I like this guy just because his fighting style is unique and very humorous. I had some doubts because I read that "Ja Rule" was playing, but I thought I hope they give it a small role, so I'm not angry looking at it. And of course, the opposite happens, goooooooooooooooooooood steven what on earth did you think he would join a crew as attractive as this one? Steven was broke and needed money? bah = (what a big disappointment, if you like the movie Steven, please skip it in its pure drama, you only get a few special effects that made me vote 3/10. mate kurupt with his irritating hood speech. <br /> <br /> My beer has gone from tasting to water, we do the dishes, the story did not have any "good" about it. felt like a child of 3 years has produced it. <br /> <br /> Hopefully Steven makes me happy again in a future film.I do not even bother to rent a simpel like that. <br /> <br /> Too bad and pitiful :-)
