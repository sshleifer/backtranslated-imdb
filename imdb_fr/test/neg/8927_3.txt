Bad action movies are the cemeteries of old martial art stars. In such films, they struggle to maintain this dangerous behavior that allowed their early works to succeed, but they all lead to failure. Seagal is too old for this type of role but he will not let go ... no matter how stupid he looks. Some hope that his current work will somehow bring back magic, but there is none left. The late '80s and early' 90s belonged to Steven Seagal and his work has made me a fan. I could see it perfectly in a Sopranos slot where his overweight body, his jowly features and his sullen attitude could have found a home. I wonder what the return is on his direct movie series ?! Since he produces them, I guess the $$$ is more than satisfactory. If this is the contract, we will be subject to poorly executed action movies in Seagal until the late sixties and into the seventies .....
