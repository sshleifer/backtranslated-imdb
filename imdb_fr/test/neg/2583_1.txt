I saw that at Inter Toronto. Film Festival in September 2005. The description seemed intriguing - as I was wrong! It could easily be the worst movie I have ever seen - in 50 years! I see that the director is my age (born in 1948) and has lived with Nico of the Velvet Underground, which leads us to Andy Warhol, which is a coincidence that I thought of looking at this - the movies of more than 24 hours of Warhol does not take place en masse. It's not art, it's boredom. <br /> <br /> Specifically: black and white. OK, maybe ... but what's the point here? They surely had the color in 1968! And there is no contrast with the present. And yes, the subtitles were blank, of course. I do not think I missed much, but it made about 20% of them unreadable. <br /> <br /> Then it's a pure chronological order, but with seemingly random events that have been added. What is the purpose of the conversation with the old man at the dinner table? It does not add anything to the movie. There were many similar scenes - almost as if someone was taking a camcorder and filming random people and assembling them to make a movie. <br /> <br /> Intrigue? No. The "riot" consists of a few characters in the distance occasionally raising a rock off the screen. Most of the time, it's an extremely painful time to watch people (off!) Wandering around. Repetitive smoking with opium is just as boring. When the main character had a cute girlfriend, I straightened up, but no, she was so boring! This is perhaps the only French film I've seen where nobody undresses. They were probably too bored to bother. <br /> <br /> Romance? No. The girl seems totally indifferent to everything - maybe her sculpture has an interest, but if it does, it's not shown to us. We are completely indifferent to the fate of the characters because they are not attractive. Maybe that's the purpose of all this?
