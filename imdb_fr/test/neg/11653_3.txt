From the comments made so far, everyone seems to hate or love this movie. I think it would be fair to point out that even though it's not a great movie, it has its interesting moments. First of all, the movie was shot in Colorado (was it Breckinridge or Telluride - I do not remember, but it's in the credits). The location is absolutely beautiful and spectacular. It's beautiful, even for me who lived in Colorado for several years. <br /> <br /> Then, it's Disney's penchant for wonderful actors. Harry Morgan has never been as fit as when he plays in a Disney movie. He is literally hysterical. Also, remember the wonderful Mary Wickes? Although she has a "partial role" in this film, she is great, as always. If you do not know who she is, think of the animated Disney version of Hunchback of Notre Dame (she was a gargoyles), and she was also the most interesting nun of "Sister Act", as well as the best nun. in "The Trouble With Angels". She has always been a great actress of characters and most actors never receive the recognition they deserve. <br /> <br /> In addition to actors and casting actors, Disney may not have had the "biggest" movies, but if you watch a few from start to finish, you'll notice that each film contains really funny or hysterical moments. The whole movie may not be funny, but there is always a comic jewel (at least one or two) in every Disney live-action film. Whether it's Harry Morgan in one of his tones of voice or Tim Conway, or Joe Flynn giving one of its priceless horrors, it's all good. The whole movie may not be good, but there are ALWAYS hysterical moments in all the Disney movies of this period that I have ever seen. Disney at that time still managed to make someone smile, despite the silence of the film. <br /> <br /> Mentioned on these comments, I disagree with the viewers who say that every Disney movie of this era is horrible. This statement is not entirely accurate. It is easier for me to recognize the fun moments and neglect the weaknesses of the intrigues. <br /> <br /> Some of Disney's animated films are real classics (Old Yeller, Bedknobs and Broomsticks, Mary Poppins). but for those who are not, I'm able to appreciate them for what they were - good family entertainment at a time when movies had become vulgar, rude and offensive.
