A mediocre horror film about stupid, not so excited teenagers who discover a devilish video game (GASP) kills those who die in the game (DOUBLE GASP). This film is the prolonged mystery of the group of mysteries in "Scooby Doo". I waited for them to remove the mask from one of the bad guys. I could cover it for 40 minutes, even as a sci-fi film, but go to the theater, go ahead. The effects were very mediocre, this whole scenario is a bit ugly, but the director Uwe Boll, since it would be his casting. As always, the major asset of video game systems is the glorious power button. I suggest using this half-view. * 1/2
