And the title says it all: a title to the cheese voice that is a joke to the cheese voice of the movie "Alien from L.A." Why not just call it "Alien from South Africa" ​​because this is where this film was shot? My advice for watching movies that have been featured on "Mystery Science Theater 3000:" do not look at the original version of the movie at all! Period! Always watch the movie with the shadow of the theater at the bottom of the screen, with a man stuck in space with his two funny robot friends sitting in the lower right corner of the screen. It just seems better like that. <br /> <br /> The film as it was originally seen: Awful! Movie as seen on MST3K: Genius!
