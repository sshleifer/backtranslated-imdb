I still have a hard time believing that a beautiful novel by Dean Koontz has been turned into such an excrement. <br /> <br /> This film is so bad that it is disgusting. Boos to all who participated. Shame on you! <br /> <br /> P.S. The fact that sequels have appeared proves how little taste and discretion remains in Silver Screen Land.
