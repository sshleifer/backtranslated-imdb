An innocent teenager (Meg Tilly, attractive as always) tries to put herself forward with the popular clique at school (despite the fact that they seem to hate her outright) and lets herself be subjected to an initiation similar to that of a sorority: spend the night in a scary mausoleum. Despite the total lack of originality, this low-budget thriller manages to produce decent special effects and has several good performances (including Robin Evans, who peeves the evil as a leader of girls). The scenario is not very precise, but it has enough throttling to make the procedure more bearable. ** from ****
