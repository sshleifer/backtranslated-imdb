It's definitely not a comedy - I do not know what was sold that way. As a serious film, it lacks substance. Unless you come out of Sunday School or need your Noah solution, you will be tired to tears. <br /> <br /> The support cast took away the bit of the film that was left. Lauren Graham plays an empty housewife with no real depth. His children do not add anything to the film. They seem to be only there to talk about their absent father at the beginning. Jonah Hill plays a scary internet addict that does not emerge as humorous. <br /> <br /> I found the original a decent movie. Disappointed that it goes nowhere.
