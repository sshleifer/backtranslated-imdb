The actors and the film crew were they drugged before filming? There was a hole in the plot ... so big ... nothing could have filled it. From the first scene where the co-star is late for dinner, was there any doubt about where he was and what he had done? The suspense was over from there. Now it would take another 85 minutes before the mystery is resolved. I must admit that the biggest hole in the plot prevented me from sleeping for hours. I wondered how writer, director, Chrisian Slater, Molly Parker and Stephen Rea were stupid. , or a policeman, could go into a locked cell in a jail, kill his second victim and tie him up with a noose to make it look like a suicide ??? I kept wondering if I had fallen asleep out of boredom and did not understand how it had happened. If anyone can explain to me, please, do it ... and why, for God's sake, did he kill the third victim? Nothing made sense ... and yet, we thought this film deserved to be an official selection at a film festival. It might have been a comedy and I could not laugh.
