I was in this movie as an additional movie in Dallas in July 1975. Some of the things you see today and that you take for granted in making a movie have been implemented in this movie. The premise of the film, the costumes, the special effects, the acting of the actors. Everything was ahead of his time. This opened the door to movies such as "Star Wars", "Terminator", "Matrix" and "X-Men". Now, people are looking at her and saying, "Well, that does not fit that new special effects story ..." He did not have any computer graphics or the same thing as the new movies. There was a story, and a beautiful cast, and a director of hell! Filmed locations, such as Dallas World Trade Center, Zale Building and Fort. The water gardens of Worth were at that time the most modern and futuristic sets of the world. Director Michael Anderson was very creative and he tried to show a perfect future distorted by human desires and fragility. It was my first cinematic experience, the first of six films I was in. The fact that it was shot in Texas does not make it a wonderful work of art. Look at it again and enjoy it more. This film was the foundation that set the standard for many great movies that we now enjoy. Well, my hand is flashing ... I have to run. The sanctuary is waiting ...
