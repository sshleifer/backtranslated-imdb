In fact, I liked Tycus, if not much more than making fun of production values. Dennis Hopper was doing very well, although I wonder if he would have signed the project if he had seen the special effects used. And what's more, what was there with the scene with the ninja ?? It was just completely out of rhythm. Someone may have had this bright idea in the middle of filming. Oh, this movie is great if you're drunk and need to laugh. Cheers.
