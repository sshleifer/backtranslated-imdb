Snakes on a Train is a movie I rented because of the pure fun of the thoughts I had about the movie. Snakes on a Plane was a nice action movie. The filmmakers wanted to take advantage of this success with such a small budget. At 85 minutes, Snakes on a Train is almost unbearable. I had to keep pausing in the movie to do something to entertain myself, due to the lack of events in the movie. For the duration of the film, it has never been fully explained why this girl carries this curse, or why she constantly spits this broth green / purplish. Not only that, there is an endless boring dialogue of the two main characters, Brujo and Alma discussing how to get rid of the curse. I can appreciate the making of low budget movies. I'm really not hard on movies, I'm open to all genres and all budgets, but Snakes On A Train is really one of the worst horror movies I've ever seen. Were the writers on Acid or something at the end of this movie? Why did the woman suddenly turn into a giant snake? and above all, how could he have devoured the train? <br /> <br /> At the end of the line. Snakes in a train is a movie that must be avoided at all costs. Do not be intrigued as I was by the title, it's a movie that's really bad. Let's put these snakes to rest <br /> <br /> 0/10
