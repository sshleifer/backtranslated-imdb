The comments posted on IMDB made me look at Shark Hunter. The movie was bad but the shark was cool blah blah blah. So I rented it. Bad idea. This film has been so bad on many levels that I am happy to have had the opportunity to move quickly. The shark itself is ok. Its appearance is correct and it's the only thing that prevents this movie from having a 1 (I gave it a 2). The acting is incredibly bad and the dialogue is just as bad. I was not expecting much, but I was continually surprised by this holiday. Antonio Sabato Jr. is a kind of biologist or scientist or something, I was not really paying attention. He goes with the consumable crew of this submarine to find out what happened to this underwater station that the shark has baffled. By the way, all the scenes showing someone working underwater are not. First of all, if they will just find out what happened to this station, what are the huge tranquilizer darts, the harpoons and all the rest. Are these things you normally take when you investigate an accident? Antonio advanced the shark theory while on the way, so it's not like they knew what they were up against. Antonio and this young student, horrible actress besides, jump at the controls of the submarine when this one is in difficulty. What is it with that? Unless everyone gets some sort of under-training before leaving high school, I find that a bit ridiculous. The manager seems to think that if team members are working in the background, it's a good idea to put a welder in the background. Metal fabrication is very important when you're on a submarine, I suppose. Anyway, I could go on but I already said too much. Conclusion: Go to your local video store, rent this video and then destroy it. Then send an email asking IMDB to delete all the recordings of this movie from their site. All the memories and evidence of this film must be destroyed. We can do it if we work together.
