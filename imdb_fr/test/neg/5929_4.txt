This is probably the latest film in the Left Behind series, in which Tim LaHaye, fundamentalist preacher and novelist, gives us an idea of ​​what we can expect from our future in the last days of planet Earth. If this is the case, we can expect an activist presidency in every sense of the word if Barack Obama becomes president next year. <br /> <br /> The Fantastic Four of the Apocalypse are all back with a casting change, Arnold Pinnock, who I would like to know as a guidance counselor in Life With Derek, that the minister is now taking the Place Clarence Gilyard. Brad Johnson as the pilot of the antichrist the day and Christian at night is represented by his daughter Janaya Stephens and the investigative journalist Ace Kirk Cameron. These are the only four people on Earth to have guessed the true nature of UN Secretary-General Nicolai Karpathy and again thrown sand into his machines. <br /> <br /> This time, they were allied with the President of United States which is played by Louis Gossett, Jr. He is going through a difficult period, especially the launch by the guerrillas of the attack by the RPG on a presidential motorcade killing Vice President Charles Martin Smith. That's right, the toad is vice president. Someone has really messed up here because everyone, including those who want to hurt them, know a president and a vice president NEVER travel together. <br /> <br /> It takes the entire movie to convince Gossett what Karpathy really is. Once again, the best of the film is Gordon Currie as Karpathy. <br /> <br /> We can still see another movie Left Behind, the door has remained open even though people tell me they no longer have the source material in stock. of Tim LeHaye. I guess as long as they make money and these players can not get jobs in the traditional film industry. And there are some unresolved intrigue issues involving Brad Johnson and Chelsea Noble, who is Mrs. Kirk Cameron in real life. <br /> <br /> One of the Fantastic Four dies in this movie. It will be the Fantastic Three or another quarter. Stay tuned.
