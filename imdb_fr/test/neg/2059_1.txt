This film is a disaster from beginning to end. 75% of the film is composed of scenes from scenes of HERCULES & THE HAUNTED HUNNING and HERCULES & THE CAPTIVE WOMEN badly mounted, with original scenes that represent a complete scam. I am a big fan of these two films and seeing scenes that are drawn, reissued and dubbed with a senseless dialogue made me turn my head. These inexpensive tactics used by producers to earn more money by misleading the audience killed the Sword & Sandal genre in the 1960s. <br /> <br /> There is a memorable scene in the new sequence and the is where Hercules fights. with the bad Hercules. The fight is rather cool and Giovanni Cianfriglia, who plays Antaius, stands out definitively. It makes a memorable memory to Herc. But the rest is on the edge of the embarrassing situation and probably shot in a day. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs!
