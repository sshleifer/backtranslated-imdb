The artist Daniel King (Chris John) and his girlfriend Laura Peters (Lara Clancy) are invited to settle in an old house in Cornwall, England, by her rich childhood friend, Natasha Carlton (Carol Kentish) . Natasha has a crush on Daniel, who is an ambiguous man about his love life. While alone in the house, strange things happen and Laura is scared and frightened. When Laura meets the foolish old priest Gabriel Norton (Brian Blessed) on the road, he is advised to leave the house immediately, because the evil was living there. But the couple remains and faces tragic consequences. <br /> <br /> What a messy scenario and awful and nerdy movie is what "Devil's Harvest" is! Cinematography and camera work are not totally bad, but the amateur performances of Chris John and Carol Kentish and the staging of James Shanks, associated with the terrible story, the ridiculous situations and dialogues, make this film the one of the worst I've ever seen. I have sometimes seen on YouTube some shorts of filmmakers who are better and better than the disturbing and formidable "Devil's Harvest". In the end, it's not a horror movie but a movie horror. My vote is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "To Colheita do Diabo" ("The harvest of the devil")
