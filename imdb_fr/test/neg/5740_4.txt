I suggest that, in the future, any film made by Sci fi and released on DVD later must indicate that it was made by a channel such that I would not buy this stuff if I had on this fact. Not that all this is bad, but when you have fades for commercials in the middle of your film, it spoils the flow of the film. This makes the movie rather boring. This one had an interesting story, but the light and extremely generic soundtrack distracted it, like most bad actors except Dien and Linda Carter. The story, the vampires are attacking in South America, of course, the rules of vampire movies are not in force, which is not usually the case in the vampire movies I saw recently, at the exception of the Blade trilogy. A group of soldiers is sent to fight. Another team is sent to find the team and find the ex-wife of one of the soldiers ... why she is not only his wife, who knows how this part of the plot really does not or. We still have an interesting boat ride with pretty jungle scenery and lots of blood. This fact, however, does not save the film from becoming too jerky in its presentation and looks really dull at the same time. I do not know, maybe cgi was the blood, the smoke and all that is necessary for them to make cgi now, even if the old effects are more beautiful and do not cost much more. I mean, cheap Italian zombie movies could make a bullet hole without cgi, why can not we now?
