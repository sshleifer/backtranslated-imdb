"Hellraiser: Bloodline" must be congratulated. It's actually the full moon. It bears all the marks of, say, your 'Demonic Toys' or 'Puppet Master' series, without their charm, uh, charm? Full Moon can afford stupid products because they know it's stupid. These Hellraiser things, man, do not they ever take themselves seriously? This increasingly stupid franchise (although not as stupid as I looked at it) once made up for its small budgets by being elegant. Now it's just ish.
