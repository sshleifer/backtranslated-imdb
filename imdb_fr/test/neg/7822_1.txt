I have never seen a film that bored me so much. It's a movie about stupid people doing stupid and terrible things. It's not a funny movie. I must say that the plot is terrible. I did not have the patience to look at it, so I only saw half of it, but that was enough for me. The characters are not very inspired. Just terribly boring. This movie is all about an awkward guy trying to meet the daughter of his tyrannical boss. When he finally manages to talk to her, she asks him to come to her house the same evening to look at her father's owl and he thinks he has invited her to go to a party and be at home at 6 pm. He is very disappointed to learn that he only has to deal with the owl and that he has a boyfriend. Once his father has left the house leaving specific orders regarding the maintenance of the house and his beloved bird, a secretary, a renegade son and all kinds of NOT FUN things happen in the house. But he ends up meeting his boss's daughter. Trust me this movie is terrible !!!!!!!!!!!!
