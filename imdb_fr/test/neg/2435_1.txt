Normally, I do not write reviews, in fact, I never write reviews. This movie was so excruciating that it really inspired me to start. Virtual sexuality tries to be a teenage comedy with a light heart and brazen on the usual traps; Virginity, boys, etc., except that the main character is apparently transformed into her perfect boy, whom she created using a machine during a technology fair. <br /> <br /> Sounds interesting to you? Well, it's not. The acting is the most timid and the most dreadful I have ever seen. The misfortune is that they really seem to support the screenplay and the film, which probably explains why I have not seen them in a memorable production since. I did not bother to learn the names of the actors, nor their characters. The boy does not delight you or delight you, and therefore you do not like him at all. The main woman's friend does not arouse sympathy, even when the script is vocally screaming for you to complain. The only increase he can make you is extreme anger and sudden violence. The only half-decent actor was the blonde-headed man who, despite his miserably weak role, was giving everything he could, which was not much in the light of such horrible work. I will not even talk about the actor's abomination who are the "bad guys" of the plot. But again, what plot? <br /> <br /> I watched this film unfold incredulously, because I did not know at all how one could have the idiotic audacity to write such a scenario, to produce, to play and to direct it. . I can only wonder. The only reason my companion and I continued to watch such a distorted example of film was the incredulous laughter that was able to come to us when cohesion, logic, class and even the powerless scenario were ignored at the time. half an hour of film. I have no idea why someone wanted to violate the film industry by disclosing it to the public. It's a movie joke and it's better to leave the dust in the warehouses for the rest of eternity. 1/2 of 10. If that.
