It might not have been so horribly serious, if not for Raymond Wallace's absolutely horrendous acting! This guy is so bad that it was not even funny! His character was needed in the movie, but the reason they chose this guy is beyond me. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for quality Chinese films, can I suggest "Raise the red lantern" ... "The Qui Ju story" ... "The red Sorghum" ... ... <br /> <br /> Anything but that! I was surprised by the number of people who gave a high rating to this! Really ... the game of this loser Wallace is so bad that it eclipses the other good parts of this film. All six have agreed to watch this movie last night! <br /> <br /> Stay away from this junk ........
