I go on blockbuster, choose a random movie, I got it, and yes. <br /> <br /> That ... it was a good sex porn ... the kind of quality was nil, and it got me a bit of a headache. For me, this movie was good for its sex, but not so much for horror and suspense. It was ... magical ... <br /> <br /> The suspense ... not as good as I expected. I wanted to be on the edge of my seat hoping to jump out of fear, but instead, I lay on the couch and I did not see much. <br /> <br /> The quality ... not really good at all. I mean, if you're very careful, while people are in the COLD mountains, they're barely wearing something. It does not make much sense either. <br /> <br /> So if you're looking for some shit, not really upsetting and a rather sex-oriented movie, you have this.
