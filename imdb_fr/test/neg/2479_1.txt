Really, REALLY ... What pleases the audience (American!) Of this show is totally beyond me. What can we learn from these series: <br /> <br /> 1. Each on-site casino spends about $ 2 billion to $ 3 billion each year to rent a satellite and a huge amount of high-resolution, high-tech cameras for its security team. Let the FBI bite them. <br /> <br /> 2. Every security employee must have voluptuous breasts, naturally natural. Breasts should be shown all the time or they will lose their job. <br /> <br /> 3. If the employee is a man, he must have the breasts implanted, then go to step 2. <br /> <br /> 4. This is only in Hollywood that one can openly decipher the ideas of other series, then apply them as such and call all this shit "original" and "art". <br /> <br /> 5. Any safety with breasts over 39D is considered immortal and can not die. <br /> <br /> I would really like to be able to vote with lower values. -10/10 for this one!
