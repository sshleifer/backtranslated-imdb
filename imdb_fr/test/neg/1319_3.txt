A truly wonderful cast and a very talented technical team have lost their precious career time and equally valuable leisure time, bothering to support this perfectly predictable and perfectly formulated piece of commercial bazaar. The film is based on a really good and very current idea, but the producers and the director simply applied Hollywood's standard "disaster film" and thus ruined any potential value of the production. <br /> <br /> An unusually high level of tide and very strong wind conditions combine to produce a record storm surge that submerges London and floods most of the Thames Valley. The plot is centered on a heroic scientist (Tom Courtenay) who warns the authorities of the danger and finally saves the day, a woman glamorous police chief who runs the entire series and a Deputy Prime Minister (David Suchet) who tries to appear important. <br /> <br /> But everything is so unreal that you feel like an extended tea break after just 30 minutes. The glamorous young policewoman demands full authority over the military during a declared state of emergency and gets it (as if!). The experienced general is just sidelined as a complete idiot who must lick his boots because of his obviously superior abilities. The problem is that our supreme wife, while now responsible for millions of lives, spends most of her time worrying about the fate of her two daughters who traveled to South West London and did not call to say they were fine. Our powerful wife therefore asks her staff to look for them and decides that the only priority of the entire army and rescue services should be south-west London and not any other part of the city. Of course, the minister, the army and all those around her certainly accept her hierarchy. We can only assume that they all had property there. When his children are finally found after endless reports and efforts from his staff, our male hero tells us: "Thank God, they are safe, that's the bottom line." It does not matter the millions of other people or all the other responsibilities she was supposed to control. as long as his own children were safe, everything was fine. <br /> <br /> This film is just another pretext for pushing the same old chauvinistic sex-slapping trap that women are intelligent, conscious, caring and capable leaders, while men serve nothing, except physical courage, blind force, and strength. very specialized knowledge. And yet, the only simple instruction she could have given to the population; to go to the tallest building and calmly ascend to the 4th floor or more and wait for instructions when the waters never retreat from this female superhero - or anyone else. The whole problem was so simple to solve, yet millions of people apparently did not just think of climbing! Pathetic waste.
