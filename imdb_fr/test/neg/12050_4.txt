I was excited about the cool synopsis of this movie and I could not wait to watch it. The first shots show some of the characters as well as the main place where the stories take place. gardening lots. The film looks fantastic. Colorful but simple. Magical but authentic. Unfortunately, it only takes a few minutes to know where the movie will go. We soon realize that this will be a manipulative and seductive story depicting a group of jaded people, enslaved to "pretty refugee victims" and that it will have a happy ending when the jaded people will realize their mistake and accept them. people. <br /> <br /> The characters, especially those who have prejudices, are very "comical" in nature. The story focuses primarily on two refugee families. One of them is headed by a single mother who plays Diveen Henry atrociously. I am saddened to say that any emotion that might have been felt with respect to his struggles was defused by what was wrong to act in a memorable way. <br /> <br /> The other story is much more interesting and concerns a father and his two children. All are marked by their trip to this country using containers, where the wife and mother are dead, but it is the husband who suffers the most. Benedict Wong gives a breathtaking performance here. At first, his emotions are very moderate, but as the story develops, he makes us aware of the inner struggles of his character. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the rest of the movie is extremely boring. There were so many possibilities with this movie. There are several characters to follow, many of whom may have potential but none of this is happening. Worse, even if this film is not very Hollywood, some of the main threads of the plot are solved cheaply, as in Hollywood. Example: <br /> <br /> Character A likes character B Character B rejects his advances No problem! Let's make character C declare his love for character A so that we can all have a happy ending. Yawning. <br /> <br /> I really liked the plot of the Asian family. It was well done. Unfortunately, the affair of allotments, its community aspect, the dynamics of a large distribution are under-exploited. <br /> <br /> All you have left is a film that has very little value.
