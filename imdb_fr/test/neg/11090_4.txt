Julie Delpy is the star of this horrible film about a sadistic relationship between a father and a girl in France in the fourteenth century. The film attempts to break the romantic chivalric image of the heroic medieval knight, showing a rather sad picture of the period, defined by psychological dysfunction and violence. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a child, François, who grew up in the shadow of the Hundred Years War, was ordered to his father to protect his mother and wait for his return. François goes into action when he discovers his mother with a lover in bed. Francis assassinates him in the name of defending his father's honor. Like father, like son, François grows up and leaves his family to make the same war. This parameter is somehow an explanation of future events, because on his return, we already notice that something is wrong with François. The war did not work well with him, he changed. <br /> <br /> The girl, Beatrice de Cortemart (Delpy), is waiting for her beloved father to come back from the British captivity. She is pure of heart and he had to take care of the succession while his father was gone. In the absence of her father, Béatrice faces financial difficulties, which reinforces Beatrice's hope that her father will come back to save her. But on her return, she realizes that he has lost the will to enjoy life, and he tortures and humiliates everything around him, even his own daughter. From there, the film describes in different ways how François torments his family. Beginning to humiliate his own son and ending with the rape of his own daughter, Beatrice. <br /> <br /> The shooting of the film in the Middle Ages supposed to soften the shock, as the spectator may say, that violent acts have taken place in difficult times. And indeed, many incest-themed movies, such as "The War Zone (1999)" by Tim Roth, are more shocking because of this. <br /> <br /> Delpy appears in this film in several nude scenes. Indeed, she seems to be beautiful and angelic. <br /> <br /> I was upset when I saw scenes of animal torture. I believe, and this is not confirmed, that some birds were killed for the making of this film, which really upsets me. The quality of a film decreases when true animal abuse is used. I hope this film will be reissued without these scenes of cruelty. These scenes do not contribute much to the scenario of the film. <br /> <br /> Overall, the film is too long. The script is problematic. We do not see Francis and Beatrice before the war, we do not really understand why he went to such an extreme. I should have spent this film, however, I must mention some scenes that made this film worth watching: <br /> <br /> * The scenes of a young child capable of murder in cold blood are really shocking. I saw it for the first time in "City of God (2002)". Here, Francis murders his mother's lover while his father goes to war. Excellent scene and very graphic. * The scenes of Beatrice's rape by her father until she discovers she is pregnant with him are really shocking and interesting. The scene after the rape, where Delpy burns her clothes and cleans herself up. She asks her brother to punch her in the stomach with the hope of miscarriage. <br /> <br /> * Scenes of humiliation between brothers where the father throws the head of his son in food, humiliating and unleashed around the war. Later, he will dress his son with women's clothes. <br /> <br /> The film wins the César (French Oscar) best costume, I agree, the costumes here really give the film an authentic look for this period. The location of the film is the Château de Puivert, a 12th century castle and historical monument, located in Aude, in the center-south of France. Beautiful view of the castle and the mountain, really helps you to define the period of this film. The film was also nominated for another 3 Cesar awards, but they were all captured by the hit French movie "Au revoir, les enfants" ("Au revoir, les enfants", 1998). <br /> <br /> --- Posted "Beatrice" in New York, March 1987. Will be screened only in France in November 2007. It was viewed on YES3 May 3, 2007 at 17h45 at work.
