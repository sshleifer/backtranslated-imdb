This film is a bad movie. But after watching an endless series of bad horror movies, I can say that it's a little different from many of the ones I've seen. Not in the plot, which is a fairly ordinary slasher story, but rather in the way the scenes are cut off. Murder Weapon gives us a lot of senseless dialogue scenes, but they last much longer than in most movies of this type. For this reason, some of the victims seem a little less like cardboard cutouts. Just a little bit. I struggled to understand exactly what was happening at the beginning and wondered if some events were dream sequences. My favorite scene is where two guys are on the run from the killer and take refuge in a car. In the glove box, they find a handgun. "Thank God!" one of them exclaims with joy. The guy's head suddenly looks like a model's, and it lasted long enough for me to wonder, "What is that man, where's that model versus the two men in the car?" So BOOM! The head exploded and I understood that it was supposed to be one of the guys in the car who had his head shot with a shotgun. I love this scene, but the movie is a very bad movie. 3/10.
