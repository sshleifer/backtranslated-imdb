I can imagine the authors of this story thinking about this script: <br /> <br /> 1.Make a serial killer movie like Se7en, Knight Moves, Copycat and Silence of the Lambs. People like serial killer stuff. It's going to sell ... 2.The killer has to adopt some sort of scheme. I know; he will copy it from a serial killer crime novel. It has not been done yet, at least not exactly like that. 3.Now, we need a way to make this movie unique. of course, the good guy can be bedridden as in the rear window. 4. Finally, we need a finalization that will give this movie the success of The Sixth Sense and The Usual Suspects. <br /> <br /> OK, now that you know these things, you know the film as a whole. Do not waste your money. One thing I really hate about filmmakers is that they adopt a very good concept for movies and throw them out. I wrote better stories than this when I was in college. I checked my watch every five minutes. When the finally ending twist occurred, I was not shocked, I just said, "Oh who cares ?!" The characters are in two dimensions. They have your typical movie personalities. This film is just the proof that stealing the elements of other blockbuster movies is not an excuse for a bad story. I give this film 1 out of 10. Normally, it would win at least 2 or 3, but I'm tired of non-originality. When will they learn? 1/10
