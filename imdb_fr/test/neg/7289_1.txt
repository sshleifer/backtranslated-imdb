This movie was horrible, and it does not even deserve to be called a movie. From what I see, it looks more like three mediocre day episodes of Disney cartoons that are loose to form a single video that claims to be following the first Atlantis movie, which was much more enjoyable and enjoyable. And where do I start with the problems of this DVD? The story? Characters? The images / animation? For me, they are all bad and unassailable. First of all, the story of this live DVD is ridiculous and useless. The only good thing about it is that it is consistent - that is systematically bad, from start to finish. Once the film is finished, I still do not know why Milo came back and how the incidents in the three little stories are related to each other or to Atlantis itself. And all I could remember about this movie was how it made me feel bad after seeing it. The characters feel wooden and lack personality, and the designs are very different from those of the first. You can say that they obviously do not come from the same animators as the first. As I read the DVD, I became increasingly concerned about what could happen to the characters and I was hoping the movie would end soon. Besides the story and the characters mentioned above, the quality of the image is poor in this one too, probably one of the worst of these videoconferencing products ever produced by Disney. As a fan of the original Atlantis: the lost empire, I could not be more disappointed with Milo's return, a waste of time and money. Thank God, I rented it first instead of buying it. Nevertheless, I would have wished never to have seen this shit or even to have known its existence.
