OK, imagine that all states in the United States and all countries have exactly the same growing trees and foliage. Imagine also that a trapper monkey camp so far off the beaten track that you had to make the first half of the approach to the river has a beautiful tarmac road, perfectly straight. Imagine a world in which you have to wear a full biohazard combination to collect a floppy disk. Then you simply put it in a Ziploc bag and transfer it to your pocket without any precaution upon your return to the office. A world where two nine year old girls are happy to give a lot of blood without complaining. This is the world in which this film takes place. <br /> <br /> In addition, it is one of the most cliche fragments of excrement that I have had the misfortune to see for years. </ I liked that. :)
