Anyone who writes that he is a good kid may have worked or put money into this dreadful college experience. It was ugly, slow and painful to watch. Duration: about 84 minutes, three and a half hours. The only person to blame is the director, who knows nothing about how to make a scene, where to place the camera! 95% of this horrible movie was shot by long master shots. Two or three people in the frame talking or screaming forever (or what seems to be forever), no close-ups !! No average shot !!. There are two so-called fight scenes where any filmmaker with a brain would have made close-ups or medium shots. They looked very amateurish. The scenes with the father and son screaming at each other would have worked better if we had cut the role of the father or son acting or reacting. Tri-C must be very mortified to show it anywhere. I saw a lot of bad movies in my day. Some of them are fun because they are so bad that it is not one of them.
