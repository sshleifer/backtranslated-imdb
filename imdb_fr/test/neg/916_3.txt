Why did I buy this movie on DVD? Well, the short answer would be: I really do not know. As for the longer version, it's more like the fact that I really like Tatyana Ali and play Alicia in that role. <br /> <br /> Now, does Tatyana Ali really make a good effort in this movie? I must say she's one of the best, and she's about to become a pretty decent actress. I'm really looking forward to seeing her in action when the best material is available. <br /> <br /> That being said, this movie was terrible - and my rating is based on this: 1 star for not being the worst movie I've seen, 1 star for Tatyana Ali's performance and 1 star not to believe that it only deserves 2 stars, there are worse films for that. <br /> <br /> Ja rule should stick to rapping, not my favorite rapper to say the least, but some seem to like him - and if he's confined there, I'd love not to see contaminating the scene. <br /> <br /> Ving Rhames: Ah! Marcellus Wallace, what are you doing here? You were a cool man. Just because Michael Caine is an extremely brilliant actor, who has starred in so many terrific and excellent movies, you do not have to copy him Ving. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast's big names: It's good, there are bills to pay, and we all have to do things we are not proud of every now and then. <br /> <br /> The film itself. There are so many faults that it's hard to know where to start. It's more like a lot of scenes together, as the director said, "we have to say that, and we have to say that". There is a story, unfortunately, there is nothing surprising about that. To say the least, the storyline changes in the story were all too obvious, so it was predictable what would happen all the time. <br /> <br /> To summarize in one word: Reallynotgood
