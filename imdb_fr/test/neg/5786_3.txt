Top gun without the internal animosity. Or class. Or money. Or cruise. An excuse for a distribution of actors more ambitious and more mobile as possible to highlight their ability to lead a morning that really does not have anything to put in their mouths. It's a shame because the first shot of Charlie Sheen opens with a great promise that is almost immediately wasted with an absurd wedding piece. Barking. <br /> <br /> Dennis Haysbert is a changeable actor for me but in this film he's doing well, especially the action sequences. Michael Biehn is a leading action hero but not an important man: Charlie Sheen is, for all intents and purposes, the main man, but never quite an action hero. There is a cascade of hundreds of people who are also worthy of mention. 3/10
