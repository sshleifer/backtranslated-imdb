Curiously, the film of Kieslowski disappoints me because of the scenario sometimes strange and sometimes cliché which also seems to be a work of bad observation. There is an isolated boy. He lives with one of his relatives, but he is alone and watches every night a woman who lives through their building. It seems! he wants it. He is one of the young people who can not communicate well with the opposite sex. However, he loves this woman, when the woman comes home with a man, Tomek is in pain. We then understand that Kieslowski tells the story of an isolated boy who needs a woman to flirt or fall in love with a mature woman. He does not do anything else, because he knows maybe it's his salvation. One day, he stops this woman, suddenly, he seems a shy boy, but proves that this is not the case, so he explains almost everything. She gives lectures and refuses. Everything is so realistic like the other Kieslowski films, no problem. The problems begin when Tomek visits him. The story of a lonely boy who falls in love with a mature woman (but with an unrequited love) turns into the story of a lonely boy who falls in love with a mature woman. the woman refuses, but soon after, she begins to change her mind. This U-turn makes the film's cliché first. Tomek's personality is strange? or the result of a bad observation? I disappointed this character, it's my opinion and I will try to tell you why. When he goes home, Magda treats him very friendly. She asks what do you want from me Kiss me? to make love with me? go out with me? At this point, I remember people who say it's a femme fatale. See? Back on the scene, Tomek rejects all proposals. Why? Because he's shy? I do not think so, but his communication is direct, okay. After the leg scene at home, some events make the film miss its purpose. I think the purpose of the film is (should have been according to the story) to show us that there are people who lack tenderness and that it is not easy to save this situation because of the lack of communication and to be apart especially for Men. I mean at this point, what does the film say? It's fuzzy and disappointing. We see that he is not hungry for love, nor for feminine sex, nor for sex. So what? And the scene of the suicide attempt corroborates this weakness. As he touches his legs, he wants to kill himself! By the way, as I already mentioned, some say that Magda is a femme fatale. Totally not. She strives to make Tomek happy. Does she avoid having contact with him? Is she insulting him? No. Does she enjoy it? No. Is she cheating on him? No, she has some problems with her (ex) lover, so she is not O.K. However, she does not take revenge on Tomek. She is not an angel, but not a femme fatale too.
