Blackwater Valley Exorcism takes place on a ranch in a small town where the teenager Isabelle (Kristin Erickson) is found stray dog-covered. Her parents Ely (Randy Colton) and Blanche (Leslie Fleming-Mitchell) own the ranch and are deeply concerned for their daughter. Recently, she is no longer herself and is considered a danger to herself and to others. The ranch and ex-priest Miguel (Del Zamora) recognizes Isabella's symptoms as a possible case of possession. When she begins to speak ancient Latin in a strange voice, he is convinced of it. White calls the priest Jacob (Cameron Daddo), his ex-wife Claire (Madison Taylor), to see Isabelle, he confirmed the suspicions of Miguel and accepts the job of performing the exorcism, which, hopefully, will banish the demon inside Isabelle and a free innocent girl. .. <br /> <br /> Directed by Ethan Wiley I was sitting in front of my TV in front of my TV and watching the Blackwater Valley exorcism and I was constantly asking the same question, why I was doing it. Why do I continue to watch all those horrible, low-budget horror movies that seem to have been shot on a camcorder? Let's be honest about it, Blackwater Valley Exorcism is a total scam and unashamed of The Exorcist (1973) and you literally tick key plot points that the two share. There is the possessed teenager who begins to be excited and suggesting inappropriate things, the demon that uses crimes of the past against those of others, worried parents, how the possessed is rejected by the physician, priest with a troubled past and the possessed is tied to his bed among others. I guess the Blackwater Valley exorcism is different (except it's total crap), it's trying to give all the characters a little time in front of a screen and trying to understand how the situation affects them, but it is so badly written and acted that it ends up being boring. The film starts with Isabelle already possessed, so we never know what she was as a normal person, so we do not really care about her or what happens to her, the rest of the character is badly written and badly defined. I have sometimes wondered if Blackwater Valley Exorcism was a parody, there is a silly scene in which a veterinarian tries to calm Isabelle possessed with tranquilizers and after declaring that she needed a little prick he entered his room with a huge needle behind his back! There are some scenes in which people are hit with a stupid comedy sound effect. As a result, the film has an irregular tone, ranging from a horrible drama both silly and serious, or at least in my opinion. <br /> <br /> According to a text before the opening credits, Blackwater Valley Exorcism was based on 'Actual Events', yeah it's true the events of 1973 that took place in a film called The Exorcist ... This text also indicates that the scenes of exorcism were supervised by a real priest. There is not even a decent gore or exploitation to animate things, there is a scene of an arm cut, there is a dead dog, someone is stabbed with a crucifix and it is at almost everything. Surprisingly, there is no bad language either, even if the demon tries to be offensive. I guess the only reason the Blackwater Valley exorcism is on the adult side is because of a very brief scene in which a pair of breasts are seen. A pair of topless is not worth the time you are looking at or the money you could spend on it. There is no fright, no atmosphere and a really amateurish feeling throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> With a supposed budget of about $ 1,000,000, I have to say, I wonder where all the money was spent, the movie looks horrible. and not expensive everywhere. There are no special effects as such and production values ​​are at their lowest. The acting is very mediocre on the part of all players involved. The favorite of the genre, Jeffrey Combs, is at the top of the credits at the opening credits, but has nothing more than a cameo for a time of about five minutes on the screen. Even he must have feared how bad it would be if he hides behind a mustache and a terrible accent, he's better than that. <br /> <br /> The exorcism of Blackwater Valley is a real exorcist scam without anything that has made this film such a classic and producers are thirty-five years late anyway. A total turkey from start to finish.
