Five years after the American civil war, Westerners are more concerned about the old war between homesteaders and cattle ranchers. Herdsmen gather their goods from Texas to the track town of Abilene, Kansas. There, cowboys find not only a lot of money, but also big clashes with homesteaders. Tall in the saddle, Marshal Randolph Scott (under the name of Dan Mitchell) tries to maintain peace in the city. Mr. Scott has experience mediating between the runway patrons and the salon's patrons. He also juggles with the most beautiful women in the city: the sexy saloon singer Ann Dvorak (under the name of Rita) and the pretty lady of the Rhonda Fleming church (under the name of Sherry). Boozy County Sheriff Edgar Buchanan (as Bravo Trimble) offers more comedic relief than sharp assistance. <br /> <br /> "Abilene Town" begins with a promising symbolism and contrast: gunshots interrupt Scott and Mrs. Fleming singing a hymn to the Church; Then, the camera switches to Mrs. Dvorak sexually singing her showroom number, prompting a man to pull his gun with pleasure. After that, it really becomes a standard western; it's kind of duller than it should be, but not quite awful. Young Lloyd Bridges appears as one of the homesteaders. The costume on Dvorak's legs is the greatest asset of the film. in her, she is a real mover. <br /> <br /> **** Abilene Town (1/11/46) Edwin L. Marin ~ Randolph Scott, Ann Dvorak and Edgar Buchanan
