Why did they change the pretty Rugrats TV show we all know and love in a lame attempt to target teens? They do not have to do that. All ages look at ordinary Rugrats. When I heard about it, I thought, "Hey, they did a TV show on the movie, except they really grew up as a teenager, it'll be better." When I saw it, it was like I was watching As Told By Ginger, except that they had pissed him off. Excellent work. <br /> <br /> When, in the Rugrats series, was Tommy a director? Never. Basically, every episode of this series is about Tommy's love for staging. I do not like it. I prefer to watch intrigues that change every episode. Not the same thing again and again. Also, when in the old series does each character have his own version of the story? Never. This series did that. I did not like everyone separating. I do not want to see Angelica's side of the story. I hate her. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend this show if you like As told by Ginger and the Rugrats.
