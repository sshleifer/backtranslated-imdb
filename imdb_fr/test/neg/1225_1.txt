Wow ... as a big fan of Larry McMurtry's western tales and the Lonesome Dove series in particular, I was s-o-o-o and looked forward to Comanche Moon. What a great disappointment. Maybe my expectations were too high because of the overall excellence of Lonesome Dove ... the story, the characters, the cinematography, the music ... everything worked. <br /> <br /> The comparison between Comanche Moon comes across as a bad sketch Saturday Night Live. The characters are completely colorless, the dialogues are noisy and the intrigue meanders blindly in all directions. It seems that actors are all reading in TelePrompTers. I could not identify with any of the characters, the good guys, the bad guys, not even the accessory characters. The performance of David Midthunder is particularly remarkable. Looks like it was ripped off at the eighth grade of high school. I'm sorry, I'd like to find something positive about Comanche Moon, but I just can not do it. There is nothing there.
