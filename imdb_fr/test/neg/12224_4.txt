RKO was trying to give a boost to her starlet JOAN FONTAINE when she was chosen as a flying nurse willing enough to force a doctor (JOHN BEAL) to agree to flee the responsibilities of this little programmer. TCM broadcast it as a springboard in Joan Fontaine's career. <br /> <br /> Fountain is serious and does an acceptable job, nothing more, and John Beal agrees for his love interest. But it is obvious that PHILIP HUSTON (who has the appearance and the arrogant manners of the young James Garner) is the actor who should have shared the highest level with Fontaine. What happened to this beautiful actor? Why did not RKO promote him, with Fontaine? He showed light comedian talents. <br /> <br /> It's the kind of thoughts that went through my head as I watched this rather lukewarm drama that never quite fulfills the promise of its title. The story itself is rather boring, rarely taking life because of Fontaine's fiery heroine. <br /> <br /> She photographs nicely as a nurse and skilfully carries her serious expressions, suggesting that there was more to be exploited for a dating future. Beal has never undertaken a distinguished career and his performance here shows why. Strictly dull. <br /> <br /> But what happened to Philip Huston? It is obvious that he should have had a film career worthy of the name. <br /> <br /> Helpful note: Watch Dwight Frye (of "Dracula") as an uncontrollable patient aboard the plane.
