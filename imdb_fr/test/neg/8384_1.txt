I can not find anything good in this miniseries. Why on earth would you ban chocolate when you could ban something much more convenient like smoking or drinking alcohol? Also, the fact that it is an Australian program and that everything is happening in England and that everyone simulates British accents is stupid. Overall, I think this show is unrealistic and cheap.
