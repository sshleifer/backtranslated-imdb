... but I would lie. A family member was a member of the team and we watched the production of this film for a few days (and I was an extra). I'm dying and I have a second of time on the screen, not that I plan to move to Hollywood anytime soon. I just thought it was great to see how the movies were shot and to be part of it. In addition, I had a copy of the film once it was finally released. They did not have a studio to do this movie, so it was really independent. Why the writing and the game is so horrible exceeds me, but the main character "Cherry" is the sister of the director and could be part of it. But the cinematography was good. :)
