The guy who asked to sue for an hour and a half lost, I can not disagree on that one. The film started as a kind of class project and ended up in a dark room. Whenever the girls were completely naked as if by magic, they seemed all light, I know I can write the script or quite to say. But this one is like a bad copy of redoing a saw with a bad end. Think of a man who wrote this story, sick. It's really a shocking film that I can not say, it's horror because it's not the case. It was only brutality and violence that made me sick. It's really frustrating to watch an endless movie, it's like banging in the eye. the movie is over, you can go home. <br /> <br /> against -cam -lighting (althrue I think it was supposed to do it) -overdone -sickening <br /> <br /> against -real to your face -agir was good in my opinion -It is bad in <br /> <br /> Overall, the film is NOT my taste of the film, the witness asked us to know that these things happen, and the man has write his own little fantasy. If you have ever seen movies seen? they all had a moment of comfort in life. That one? does not. Maybe it's just me, that I'm too soft, but this film made me tremble, and the story is very short, a sick man kills the girls slowly. But the actors sucked you into this movie every time you hit it, with every scream, you could almost feel it. <br /> <br /> And to be honest, I was too fast to judge this one, it's a terrible movie? no it is not. it is an example of exaggerated reality, it is as real as it could be. But do not watch this movie if you expect a great mystery, a real plot or even a kind of story. the man puts the girls in a dark room and kills them one by one, that's really it.
