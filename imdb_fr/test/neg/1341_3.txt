The 2008 update of director / screenwriter Diane English of George Cukor's classic comedy MGM 1939 unfortunately shows more paper balls than her predecessor. Based on the clever play of Clare Booth Luce in 1936 on the relations that evolve within a strictly feminine group of socialists pampered in Manhattan, the story seems ripe for a contemporary remake. Instead, because of the thematic scope of English, the production appears as an extended therapy session with a lack of wit. In addition, the various lifestyles of today's women have been reduced to stereotypes worthy of the sitcom in this film, and the fundamental premise of the original play of eliminating men from the scenario seems even more artificial considering of the openly pansexual evolution that has occurred between men's women since the 1930s. To add insult to injury, HBO's recent large-screen adaptation of "Sex and the City" has made this kind of sorority much better in the manner of sorority and with much sharper fangs. <br /> <br /> The skeleton of the original piece remains. The story centers on the wealthy Mary Haines, who gave up her promising career in creating clothes to become the devoted wife of a financial assistant on Wall Street. Like "Sex and the City", she's surrounded by three best friends - Sylvie Fowler, a fierce and courageous magazine editor in the Miranda Priestly mold in "The Devil Wears Prada" (again a film that echoes); Edie Cohen, always pregnant, representing the housewife; and Alex Fisher, a lesbian author who appears to represent all repressed groups generally excluded from an equally exclusive clique. With an oral manicure, they discover that Mary's husband has an affair with Crystal Allen, a girl with perfumes at Saks, more than wanting to break a marriage as she fights to become an actress. The rest of the plot does not matter, as it is a series of scenes focused on fraternal rapprochement and quarrels, none in it is very illuminating and without the satirical zing that fed the film from 1939. <br /> <br /> young, at age 47, Meg Ryan seems to be playing Mary in a way that tries to resurrect the goodwill she created in the 1990s with "When Harry Met Sally "and" Sleepless in Seattle ". It's not that she's not suited to her age, but her familiarity seems to contradict the passive nature of the character. Annette Bening does a little better in the role of Sylvie in Rosalind Russell, who steals the scene, because she knows how to be tough while masking vulnerability, but that his character undergoes a transformation so commonplace that it seriously compromises the performance of the actress. Poor Eva Mendes has to play Crystal as a transparent, shallow little girl instead of the clever and smart cookie that Joan Crawford had to play. Debra Messing and Jada Pinkett Smith were relegated to the background as Edie and Alex, respectively. Even better, Candice Bergen is the caring mother of Mary and Cloris Leachman, a carefree housekeeper. <br /> <br /> Reflecting probably the mediocre reaction of the box office at the exit of the film, the 2008 DVD does not have a solid set of extras. There are two deleted scenes - one with Crystal and her friends organizing a girls' party as a contrast to Mary's elaborate garden party, and the other an extension of Bette Midler's cameo as a multi-married agent Hollywood advising Mary for a late night. in a yoga camp. Two extras complete the extras "" Women: The Legacy "on the film's history of the original 1936 play and" Women, Behind Women ", where the cast and crew constantly talk about empowerment and the empowerment of women.The irony is that this version of "The Women" directed and scripted by a woman takes a look so condescending on women.
