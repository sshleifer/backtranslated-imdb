This movie is one of the worst movies I have ever seen! The cast was fantastic, but the movie itself was awful. It was so awful that I had to register to say how bad it was. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie and wanted to break it every minute I watched. It could have been great. Had a good premise. If you're stealing an armored car and a homeless person sees you, you have to do what you have to do. That the main character decides to kill a cop and kill his friends and colleagues after the homeless person is dead is just ridiculous. And yes, I'm sure there will be answers about how his consciousness came to him, but go for it. <br /> <br /> The main character crawled to the bottom of the armored truck, no one saw it. He blew up the money and grabbed and dragged the policeman right behind the other guards and no one saw him. He managed to get back into the armored car and no one saw it ... This film had potential, but it ruined it. <br /> <br /> You could not afford to watch this movie anymore! NEVER look! Aggravating...
