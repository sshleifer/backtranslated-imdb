This useless movie was a complete disappointment. None of the characters are friendly at all. So you look at what happens without really caring about everyone. The worst was to rent this film in a gay-owned establishment and discover that this story of prostitutes was filled with homophobic young men engaged in many scenes of heterosexual sex and not a single scene of gay sex.
