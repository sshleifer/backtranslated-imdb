I just saw this movie and all I can say is where have the readers been these days. Looks like it would have been a second feature film touring in 1977 (maybe playing with one of Joan Collins's movies), but it's worth watching now if you feel nostalgic 70s. A stupid plot that is full of holes, but it recalls a time when it was done. Interesting to see Melanie Griffith so young and Anne Lockhart is very attractive, although she is not really an actress. In fact, there are not many actors in this film. It's a sort of adventure of the Hazzard Dukes without vibration or a 1969 Dodge Charger jumping over stuff in the woods. But there is a Mecrury comet jumping over a dump in this one!
