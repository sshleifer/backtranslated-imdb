It is mainly about the biography of a lecherous doctor, "Robert Merivel" (Robert Downey), who has his place in the king's palace during the first half of the film, then helps the oppressed of the second half , mainly "Katharine" (Meg Ryan). <br /> <br /> THE GOOD - A fantastic ensemble decoration (ie the lush King's Palace) and costumes make it a visual treat. The language is also very tame. Ian McKellen and Hugh Grant offer interesting support. <br /> <br /> The BAD - After 50 to 60 minutes, this movie is too boring. It was desperate to give him a spark after an hour, but it's the opposite: he hangs around again and again. The script certainly needed "restorations", shall we say? The film may look nice, but it takes two long hours to sit ..... too long.
