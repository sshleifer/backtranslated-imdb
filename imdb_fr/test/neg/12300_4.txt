'The 4th Floor' is a decidedly mediocre film starring Juliette Lewis as a young interior designer with a pretty problematic neighbor. Jane (Lewis) recently inherited an apartment on the 5th floor of her grandmother and, in agreement with the owner, enjoys a ridiculously low rental rate. Her boyfriend (William Hurt, a scary time man) wants her to move in with him, but she wants her own space. So she settles in, and strange things start to happen, and since this is a B-level horror movie, there is a stupid and inexplicable reason. While Jane, who is not too intriguing, continues to try to tell others - her boyfriend, the police, her co-workers - what's going on, everyone thinks she's in the process of to lose. So, of course, she has to face the problem - the madwoman living just below her - alone. Neither frightening nor interesting, Lewis is one. She is a very good actress, but she is poorly used here, which does not mean that she is not the best in this film because she is. It has a wild charisma and is better screen than a dozen silicone bimbos that regularly populate this type of film. This type of movie, however, is not worthy of it - which is ironic, since it is probably the only reason someone would want to see it.
