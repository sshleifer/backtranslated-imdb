It's a movie that makes me really cringe. In 1951, MGM and Looney Toons made some of their best caricatures - with astonishing animation, exceptional backgrounds and great stories. Then, at the end of the 1940s, a new style of animation began to appear (like the television series "Crusader Rabbit"): the animation with extremely simplistic illustrations to save money. Unfortunately, the cynical ploy of Columbia Picture worked !! Instead of the public hating the toons (as they should have been), many have accepted them and the Oscar-winning people (AMPAS) have in fact awarded this film the prize for best animated short film - legitimacy for a inferior product. Unfortunately, in the world of dollars and senses in Hollywood, this quickly began to slip into legitimate studio products - resulting in rather nondescript cartoons. Later, the situation worsened because, in addition to ugly animation and backgrounds, the stories themselves became almost unbearable for adults. The intelligence and style of classic cartoons have disappeared. And for this tragedy, I blame partly GERALD MCBOING-BOING - one of the grandfathers of cheap cartoons. The story is not so bad, but the animation is a horror and listen to the kid say "boing-boing" is an incessant pain.
