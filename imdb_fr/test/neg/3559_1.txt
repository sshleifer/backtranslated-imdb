This is the most horrible movie I have had to watch. 30 minutes after the beginning of the movie, I could not take it anymore. Seriously, do not bother with this one unless you're a sentimental job or one of those pseudo-artistic types who likes that kind of guts so they'll feel more cultured. Boring, although the game is good the kid is just irritating. Some scenes are a little strange with very strange close-ups. I do not know why they did all the film in black and white, but whatever the effect they hoped to have failed miserably. There was nothing to watch, and although it's a sad tale, so-called, it's so stupid that it's hard to feel sympathy for the characters.
