It was a very good concert of the only GM. The choreography was excellent and the costumes were decent. The voices were good. I must admit that his voice was shit on Human Nature and Billie Jean. You could not hear him half the time. The other songs make up for the singing. The highlights of the series are: Jam Smooth Criminal I can not help but love you. She's out of my life Thriller Billie Jean (The dance does not sing) Black or white man in the mirror The concert was almost perfect. If it was someone other than Mj, it was a 9. It's a must. I would have liked to be born at that time to be able to get a ticket for the best concert in 1992.
