This is the second addition to Oz's film trilogy by Frank Baum. It is essentially the same puerility as in the other two pictures, although I consider it better than others because it is shorter. As in other films, there are performers in animal costumes, an adult woman claims to be a boy, and the characters and plot jump everywhere while the shoot is static. This time, in the center is a magic mantle that grants the vows, and the boy played by a woman becomes a king. <br /> <br /> Most special effects are visible at the beginning. Fairies are represented by multi-exposure photography. And, there is a man in the moon that resembles those of Georges Méliès a few years ago, especially in The Voyage in the Moon (1902). The imaginative fantasies and creative effects of Méliès made him the pioneer of the ancient cinema. His films he made at the turn of the century were much better and even technically more advanced than this tiny Oz series.
