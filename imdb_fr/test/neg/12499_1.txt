This movie was so bad. It was not even funny at all. Even sarcastic scenes were not funny. Oh man, so be it. Thumbs down. Spoofed, Karate Kid, Wolf Teen, Footloose, Dirty Dancing, A kind of wonderful, Soul Man, and probably another one or two. Chris Kattan at his worst level as a high school janitor, talented dancer, who runs a dance studio in a warehouse. He has a jealous girlfriend, who breaks his ankle and his dance spot goes to the cute new blonde coming for which Chris has eyes. I thought playing was really bad. I like to laugh comedies aloud, it was not. "Not another teen movie" was not funny, but had scenes much more fun than Totally Awesome. "Scary Movie" is too funny. I always laugh when I look at them, super nice. This movie, not funny.
