This film has something rotten and, basically, it turns a sinister and twisted character into a hero by exploiting our sympathy for his horrible situation. Sampedro, like many people who have lost hope, chooses suicide. The fact that he has been looking at her for more than 26 years is probably worsening her condition, but the belief that we should do everything someone asks us to do, even if it means ending a life is, in my opinion, deeply wrong. . What a contrast to the eloquent example of scientist Stephen Hawkings, who suffered a much worse condition for much longer! Yet, with the morality upside down, the film revolts in hero worship and the people at odds are painted in simplistic terms and idiots. There is little room for subtlety, especially in meeting with the priest (deliberately manipulating the actual encounter that was with a much younger priest). In this sense, I suppose the film is tied with Triumph of Riefenstahls' will. The insidious idea is that everyone should have the right to commit suicide when he feels he can not live it anymore. It does not matter whether you are physically or psychologically damaged, there are people who believe you have the right to choose. The same people are likely to advocate for abortion. It's part of the current trend of wiping out pain or suffering, just brush it under the carpet, says Mammy. OK, and we are all very happy with ourselves. So, we believe that some lives are not worth living, then we will decide that some people can not really decide for themselves, we will bring the state to do it. Enter Adolf Hitler directly from this other Oscar nominee "der Untergang". Hitler of course thinks that he is doing exactly what nature does by eliminating the weak. Under his regime, there were forced abortions among the "weakest" strains, the mentally handicapped were quietly repressed and the Jews were "humanly" liquidated using gas, he would have applauded this film, and why not because he is in line with his philosophy ... "some lives are just not worth living." I stand out from Ramon Sampedro, Hitler and everyone else involved in making this movie Human life is sacred, it is not a right, it is a gift obligation, no one chooses to be born, so who can choose death? It is not a question of religion, it is a question of to protect the weak and defenseless, something that this movie has a lot to undermine!
