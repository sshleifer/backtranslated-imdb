The director was probably still in his early days of learning when he was trying out westerns. Look at the outfits. Everyone looks well washed, well brushed, well dressed and well ironed, as if he is ready for the church. Even the horses look well cared for and shiny. This is a WESTERN, to shout loudly! He is supposed to look dusty, dirty and sweaty. And then there is the amateur game of females in this bird. All, about a dozen, all pretty and well endowed, had just been raped and widowed, but hardly a tear flows. Instead, they all look with keen interest (if not outright covetousness) at the beautiful seven newly arrived they feed then, bandage and comfort with love in their battles with the bandits. The same staging criticism applies to Lee van Cleef, who does a very good job as an actor. Our Lee, playing law, has just lost his dear wife. But Lee, hard as organic rock, shows no emotion and finds himself in the days following the death of his wife in the arms of a juicy widow with whom, with his offspring, goes in the future. The cad. And then there's another thing that always bugs me with these kind of movies: no matter how many dynamite explosions are in the middle of a pack of fifty or so horses, no matter how many fire fired the rabble above them, only the crooks are killed and the dummies always go their way rejoicing in one piece. (I know ... silly me ... it's just a movie ...). This is not the worst western ever, but prepare for serious yawning.
