Some critics of this film have been extremely "generous" with praise. Personally, I was disappointed because, because of these criticisms, I was optimistic when the opening credits started to roll. <br /> <br /> The all too familiar story is this: the deformed boy and his father live in Louisiana. swamp. Local boys ridicule and torment him. The guys from the area start Gruesome, oh sorry, I mean Victor Crowley's cabin on fire with him. Dad tries to save his son, formerly known as Eddie Munster, meets the elephant, but accidentally places a hatchet in the child's head. Victor becomes a murderous ghost who hunts the unfortunates who enter his domain. Oooo ... scary. <br /> <br /> One of the things I liked about Hatchet was that it was never taken seriously and that some of the gags made me laugh. The fact is that I'm tired of horror B slap-sticks, polite by Hollywood. I love to laugh and I like to scare, but this movie did not provide a solid dose of either. As for Crowley, he will be the next Michael, Jason or Freddy ... Pumpkinhead has better chances.
