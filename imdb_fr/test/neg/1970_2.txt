After the rich story of Kenneth Opel that invigorated me in the pleasure of reading in elementary school, I had a lot of hope for this series. The story of an outsider bat roaming the country to join his colony captivated my imagination and resonated deeply in my nascent imagination. After hearing about this series, I started browsing the site of Bardel Animation and enjoying what I saw. The character's design seemed impressive and the fast paced intrigue seemed to have stretched respectably over a bow of thirteen episodes. My disappointment was great then, when I decided to watch a replay early in the morning. <br /> <br /> The opening episode shows our hero, Shade Silverwing, chasing a tiger in the dark hours of the night. Listening to an echolocatory song, we see a clever effect if a CGI's gross effect illuminates the moth, and the pursuit takes a frenzied turn as the small insect creates many illusory copies of itself misleading its pursuer . As a biology lover, I had a decent understanding of the principles in effect (night moths can sense the sounds their predators use for echolocation and create a sound cover for themselves) but without this presentation I would have been lost. A little worry, I thought. Surely, their director will take care of us in a moment. I waited in vain. <br /> <br /> Once our protagonist is sitting with some of his comrades, we are treated with the dullest dialogue I have ever seen on television. Chinook, Shade's childhood rival, starts taunting the tiny hero with the dumbest lines I've ever seen in a series. I can understand that writers do not produce Shakespeare, but one would think they would have had social contact in their lives - enough for communication to look natural. Oh, I was wrong. <br /> <br /> The vocal action, although not horrible, was not a brilliant example of human success. "Oh Shade, you did not respect the law!" Shade's mother sighs quickly. "You must come with me, young person." croak Frieda, the awake eldest of the Silverwing colony. The actors try, but it does not matter at this stage, because the story becomes less and less fascinating every minute of success. <br /> <br /> Each episode deals with a problem of the week, as it is typical in most cases. television series, dominant narrative arches permeate the saga, for better or for worse. Although the main point of the story is Shade's reunion with his family, later episodes focus on other arches in history, involving cannibal bats from the southern jungles and a brewing war between birds. and beasts. The writers try to do too much at the same time, trying to squeeze as many promising ideas as possible in the hope of capturing enough public attention for the bloody show to continue. Unfortunately, these attempts are futile for all but the 8 to 10 year olds to whom this program is directed. <br /> <br /> It's nice to see the Canadian media continue, but it would be even sweeter if the series was not limited to the immediate family of animators or enthusiastic fans of Kenneth Oppel's books . Your kids might look worse than Silverwing, but much better programs are also available. Pass on mediocrity and read the books instead.
