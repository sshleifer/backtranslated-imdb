I was fooled to look at this by the many warm comments here. Boy, are they far from the mark! Giving 9 to 10 points and calling it "one of the best movies of the 1990s" is unjustifiable. The big problem here is the lack of rhythm and the plot. It's like a slap on the Prozac. Everything is happening in a predictable and apathetic way. The plot is weak to begin with - two scavengers take a look at their foxy neighbor, witness a murder and unravel a conspiracy for garbage disposal - and the film never manages to go much further. There are fun situations and decent acting, but it's not close enough to save this movie story. <br /> <br /> It's just a comedy that does not get out of hand, so why waste your time?
