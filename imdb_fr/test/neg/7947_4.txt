I'm sure many guys will love this movie. The only woman who shows "bullets" (regretted by the unfortunate pun) is forced to look, talk and look like a guy, the other 2 women are described as either sex objects with something on their mind - be sexy, sex as unique attribute and skill (Iris) - or as freaked of pretty little princesses whose neurosis cancels any strength and professional authority they had before their hell (Doc). The only strength that Iris possesses at the end is the result of the advice of a strong man. In addition to my negative reaction as a feminist, I have to give props to the work of the camera and Ethan Hawke is great in the very first scene. After that, his performance loses steam. Empty entertainment for a brain that wants to go slowly. At least the film touches the subject of the duality of good / evil in the criminal mind.
