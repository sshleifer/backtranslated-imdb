Not even "less" Hitch, but just a bad movie. The cinematic equivalent of a dirty old man. Ugly from every point of view: an unimaginative scenario, a static point of view, putrid clothes, abominable hair, unimaginable actors, and a truly gratuitous scene of rape and strangulation. The perverse sense of humor of the director is present, but it is not applied systematically. the film only comes alive in its cruelty. Women are doing particularly badly; "Frenzy" could be used as proof that the director was a misogynist, although a better explanation may be to me than, starting with his television series and "Psycho", which he himself described as an exercise in economy, an experiment to see if a television The crew could shoot a fair feature film - Alfred Hitchcock had practically abandoned art and turned to commerce. In "Frenzy", the grandmaster seems to bow to the convention, trying to keep pace with the times and give the audience what they think they want - in the form of unpleasant nudity, clap nudge eye and general perversity. I do not blame an old man for rest, but I do not want to remember his time, tired, lazy and beseeching: it's time to look again at "Vertigo"!
