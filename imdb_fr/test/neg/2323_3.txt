I watched it last night for the first time in 40 years. It's bad. Really bad. But there are enough hilarious and horrible moments to watch. First, was it deliberate to make the baby completely effeminate? He even told Costello at the Mae West "You fascinate me!" as Costello makes a double take. Only God knows what would have happened if the babysitter had been a handsome kid. This kid would have seduced him in a heartbeat! Then there is the main male dancer. He is totally inept. He yells of laughter as he hops and throbs without any talent on the giant's grave during his life has never been better. The two romantic tracks are zeros, waste. Abbott manages to sing a line and this was dubbed by another singer. Decidedly, I guess he could not even wear a melody! Costello manages to be charming in his number I Fear Nothing, and I guess very young children may like him, but there is not much to recommend. But oh that seductive, effeminate boy! This aspect alone blew me away! In addition to the fact that the family has accepted anyone off the street without any reference to keeping a child! Today, a little female boy would be kidnapped!
