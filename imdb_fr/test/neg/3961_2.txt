The dog can act ... Unfortunately, no one else in the cast of this sordid fake film for children can not. A stray and yet very clever dog creeps into the lives of two motherless children, much to the chagrin of their bitter and cold father. In what can only be described as Dickensian, the evil widower forbids his children - who may or may not be mentally disturbed - from playing with Benji. Neither children nor Benji obey. Soon, the children are kidnapped and Benji has to help the police find them. Only then does the old man realize that Benji is good, not bad. <br /> <br /> Tom Lester, whose only acting experience seems to have played the dark Eb on GREEN ACRES plays one of the kidnappers. The same is true of the regrettably overused Deborah Walley. Walley's previous on-screen triumphs include BEACH BLANKET BINGO and the sad world IS A WORLD OF BIKINI. She has also played with both Gidget and Tammy in the past and tries to erase her reputation as a wise girl by playing her badly! <br /> <br /> STAY AWAY FROM BENJI ... it's a dog and this movie is a dog!
