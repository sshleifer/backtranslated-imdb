Bled is a very appropriate title for that. Looking at it, you will feel that your life is bleeding from you. The clich√© in the horrors is that people do exactly what they should not (go down to the basement or go up to the attic). Then the problem follows. Be careful so do not watch this movie. Stay clear Do not enter. And if you need encouragement This movie? is as bad as Uwe Boll's worst film I mean, The House of the Evil Dead. I often thought of writing a film review on I.M.D.B. and, after watching some of them based on the comments below, I discovered that everyone was fascinated by his opinion. Please trust me
