Seeing the title of this movie "Silly teens must die" made me believe that it was a parody somehow. I later discovered that the original title was "Blood and Guts". Both titles are misleading, however. This is not a parody, nor a serious splash film. It's something in between, failing in both areas. A group of teenagers attends a meeting in a sinister house and the massacre begins. Sounds familiar to you, does not it? Well, this movie adds absolutely nothing to the endless flow of similar movies. And it's badly done. Due to the lack of light, the whole film is grainy. Now, this effect can be very effective, but it is not. The young cast does not act too badly, but the director has no idea what to do with the actors. In many scenes, the actors are clearly waiting for instructions, but these are given too late. It could also be a publisher error, of course. The characters are unrealistic and the plot stinks. The sound is sometimes appalling: the conversations are indecipherable, but when we speak loud or shouting, the actors are really very strong. <br /> <br /> This is not the worst horror movie I've ever seen, but it's still a bad one. For me a 3 out of 10.
