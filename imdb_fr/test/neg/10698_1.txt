Norris plays a Chicago policeman who falls on a devil's apprentice? who wants, well, create Armegeddon. He ends up killing the creature by getting this, throwing a 24-inch solid gold tip, not very sharp, about twenty feet, hard enough to penetrate the chest. Unlikely? The same goes for the rest of the film. A lot of it consists of CN and his sidekick driving cars and nonsense. The Israeli (or Arab) boy is apparently there to humanize CN. OKAY. It does not work, makes no sense and advances the plot, so called, not a bit. In addition, no police officer is invited to leave the country for questioning by other police officers. It's ridiculous as a premise. The whole thing is bad. Unfortunately, it's not so bad to be entertaining or campy. Simply bad. But we can see how Norris was trying to find his way into the hit series Walker: Texas Ranger.
