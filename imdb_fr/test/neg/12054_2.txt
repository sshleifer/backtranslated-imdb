Well, what can I say. WHAT IS F ** K? There really is not much to say about it, really. The only way you would like this is if, like me, you make fun of the bad horror. <br /> <br /> ACTION- VERY INCONVENENT! Just watch the last scene with the main actresses running! Texas scam MASSACRE CHAINSAW! but in the wrong way! Simply horrible! <br /> <br /> Gore- really not believable. In a scene, they use one of these knives, some of which has been cut and which goes on a part of the body, etc. By using this, with the addition of red ketchup, its supposed 2 seems real, although it is not. Predictable Trail of the movie 'Children get lost in the woods on camping weekends' from Friday 13. 13. Scary mask of deadly quality if you are afraid of clowns, a little incredible that someone would choose that as their costume though. The director obviously understood that all the good costumes had been used in all the other horror camp movies. <br /> <br /> TOTAL - 3/10 * / ***** stay away from CAMP BLOOD II. , this one did that looks like LORD OF THE RINGS.
