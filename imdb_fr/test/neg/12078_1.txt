The 80s were the best and worst periods for James Karin, he starred in one of the best cult horror comedies with "Return of the Living Dead" and a year later he plays in this play. ... this bad movie. A suite of Hardbodies (but not really) contains a group of rather unimportant characters who are trying to make a film in Greece. Whether by design or pure laziness, the dividing line between the film and the "film in a film" is not only blurry, but also non-existent from a scene in First Place. Unfunny would be too generous a mandate. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Nana, Fabiana Udenio and many extras find themselves shirtless; Brenda Bakke shows some T & A <br /> <br /> My note: F <br /> <br /> DVD extras: Just trailers for "Hardbodies", "American High School", "Strike" , "Virgin Territory" (a double DVD with the first film, for the masochist)
