I do not understand how some people can stay playing "Half-Life: Counter-Strike" when there are so many better first-person shooter games available. <br /> <br /> "Counter-Strike" is a game that uses no imaginative idea in its armament. All the weapons in the game are real life weapons, but there could have been at least one trick that allowed players to have access to a "supernatural" weapon, such as the all-powerful BFG in Quake & Doom games. <BR /> <br /> Another problem is that the player has to reload the weapon manually. This can become extremely boring, especially in the middle of an exchange of fire while you are about to kill the enemy. The reloading time also gives the feeling that the gun is slow to perform its task. <br /> <br /> There are not many choices of characters to choose from. If I remember correctly, there are 4 types of characters for the terrorist and counter-terrorist forces. This means that many characters are alike, which really harms the realism of the game. <br /> <br /> The game is rather sexist when it comes to the selection of characters. In the first version of Counter-Strike, there was a woman available to choose (in the selection of the terrorist force) which was good for female players. In later versions, however, the female character has been removed and replaced by another male character. I wonder if the women who played the game were disappointed by the new versions. <br /> <br /> Finally, the cards of the game are very small. The largest map appears to be the desert map, but it has standard details. In fact, all cards in the game have standard graphics. In other words, nothing new. <br /> <br /> To summarize, I think "Half-Life: Counter-Strike" is the most imaginative first-person shooter of all time. There are many better and more imaginative shooting games to play, so why waste your time on this boring game? You'd better play Unreal Tournament, Quake and Doom games. Avoid this overestimated and oversized game. <br /> <br /> I give the game a 1/10.
