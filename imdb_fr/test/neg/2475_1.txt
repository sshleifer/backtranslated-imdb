What's the problem with American movies these days? Hollyweird continues to make movies in which men act like women and women act like men. The silly director and screenwriter of this film must be examined. The main problems of this film are extreme feminist representations of its kind. <br /> <br /> Behind the scenes of the bar, Eva Mendez and her friend suck bottles of beer as if you meet sailors on an oil. oil tanker doing so in a bar in Iceland. Mendez continually kisses every girl she sees after that. She also dresses provocatively in every scene, but curses like a guy. She is very emotional when she fights with Will Smith for a while, while trying to "defend" all women against the bad guys around the world. <br /> <br /> Men are not better in this movie. What we see is a group of idiots trying to do everything to win an appointment. The men in this film are concerned about obtaining sexual favors or the inability to speak clearly to a woman. Men in real life do not behave this way. <br /> <br /> What we see in this film is a product of the culture that went wrong. Everything is returned. Guys act like girls, girls act like guys. All of this is done by keeping the extreme predilections of the sexes an integral part of the story. Men are portrayed as soft and stupid but are interested in sex only most of the time, while women are portrayed as macho and domineering but only as facets to their emotional insecurities. <br /> <br /> This film would be useful if it was not odiously presented to the public. The content is not the culprit. This is the way the content is presented.
