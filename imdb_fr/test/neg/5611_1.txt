This film had so much potential to be hilarious but moving, but it was far from it. There was a beautiful story, it just was not executed as well as it could have been. The strange "hallucinations" during his sleep scenes made absolutely no sense and were absolutely unnecessary, they had no impact, nor did they allow to improve or give an understanding of what was going or would happen. <br /> <br /> Jon Heder's character was OK but could have been developed on more. He played the role of shit that he was given the best. The character was funny, but again, he was far from what he could have been. Mila's character was perfect and her performance was perfect. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, the writing was horrible and most often, it makes no sense and his hallucinations do not correspond to the film at all. This film, with better scripting and directing, could have been a pretender to National Lampoon's Vacation regarding the fun and bad things that happen to a person traveling across America. <br /> <br /> Instead, it was worth it. a second "flush". If I had seen this in the theater, I would have claimed my money and boycotted the film. <br /> <br /> The only thing this movie did was lose an hour and a half of my life. He also managed to give everyone involved in the film a bad image, simply because the movie was a whore. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend this movie to anyone! Already!
