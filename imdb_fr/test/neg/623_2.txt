I am atheist. For me, history and truth matter a lot. <br /> <br /> This film was made following a novel published in 1921, which is still updated to date as if it were a history book. Well it's not. The movie is about the 1950s romance version. Some actors were great but it does not cover the plot. <br /> <br /> In short, the man invents a super-bomb so that God and his friends hold a court to see if they should intervene. The analogy of the devil persecutes man and, for the defense, we have the spirit of man. What is the mind of the man anyway? And why was the first accused Adam? Finally, you just get American Christian propaganda in a 5th grade history book of the time. Although other religions are mentioned, only European Christianity is explored. <br /> <br /> First of all, we have the story of the cavemen. Women are lean stereotypes of damsels in distress. The real cavemen were as strong as men and just as strong. Difficult times, difficult life, adaptation and survival. All this is mitigated by mid-century stereotypes. <br /> <br /> Then we move on to the construction of the first pyramid in Egypt. Today we see another story and know that there have been far fewer deaths and ordinary citizens at work. The loss of many lives in the process would have been a national disaster and no one would have tried to defeat it. As if there was only one pyramid built. <br /> <br /> The part about Moses and a real god was as if the Spanish inquisition asked him nicely. The Inquisition itself was never mentioned in the film. <br /> <br /> Helen of Troy's diabolical agility was so vile that I did not understand why so many people were interested in her. In fact, they were just soldiers, obeying the orders of the commanders, who "discussed" a political issue of power. She was just an excuse. <br /> <br /> The story of Cleopatra was the one where I saw this film too inaccurate and full of propaganda. Here, the brother was MUCH younger. She was not obsessed with poison, was educated enough to restore the contents of the library and was politically competitive to drag Egypt battered to the ground. <br /> <br /> The party with Nero and the Christians praying in a cave were disgusting. Yes, Rome burned. Yes, there was a persecuted Christianity. But as they described it, it was as if the Colosseum were building autonomously and there was no Vespasian to rebuild Rome. <br /> <br /> Attila the Hun appears briefly and we move to King Arthur. Crusades are mentioned with a minimum of bloodshed. And there is no mention of the crusades east of Russia that ended in an ironic battle. The knights just returned home and started jousting for fun. A LOT of things are deposited as if there were no indoor feathers, hygiene and wounds. <br /> <br /> Then they cover Joan of Ark, where she must always wear makeup and looks like a princes. Territorial policy has been replaced by an unfair tribunal. The saddle alone on a stool makes me want to ask how someone could follow here. At that moment, I wanted to shout: "Hura, Die already! Cheap special effects, where is the fire?". <br /> <br /> By the time they mentioned Leonardo, I was already fed up with the movie. Columbus, the Spanish massacre of the United States, shouting at Queen Elizabeth to "kick the Spanish armada" and so on. <br /> <br /> The ONLY reason I wanted to see this movie was the fact that it was the last movie with all 3 brothers brands. And all they have is the scene with Manhattan and the Indians. Fun, but not more than a smile. <br /> <br /> The witch hunts are briefly mentioned, as well as the plagues (after the rebirth). When they begin to describe revolutions, things are thirsty for power and anarchists. The American Revolution was continued by the French Revolution. Oppression and incompetence are bad, but you can not just eliminate the old anger of anger, you must replace it with something. They therefore replaced the French monarchy by a new French monarchy. So we have Napoleon and his ambitions to go to India by land. But they replace his motives by those of the unit and claim it only for the title "Emperor". The conquests in Europe, the defeat in Russia are sent back to Waterloo. <br /> <br /> The American Civil War, the rich English inventors (Tesla not included). "Mr. Watson, come here, I want you" almost made me laugh for teenage reasons. The arduous technological work was diluted until the final discovery and comic misuse. <br /> <br /> Finally, after 85 minutes, we come to the world wars and organized crime, but none of its horrors. Adolphe's words "I envy Russia, this is my last territorial demand" were hilarious. This was his LATEST territorial request. <br /> <br /> To spark suspense, God has set a countdown to Doomsday on the "wall" for the last words. All powerful can not pause the universe for a second? The speech of persecution was not necessary, but the defense made a last throw. <br /> <br /> Finally, we see the man of tomorrow as the final defense. Apparently a paradoxical man, because the bomb had to leave today. His toys are a rifle-shaped music box and a pencil box sword. Now it's so wrong ?? Pens and pencils have drawn so many plans of arms that his death toll exceeds the atomic bomb. And make music with a weapon? Deceived egoistic generals make music with guns. So the man of tomorrow is already a monster. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, all the defense had to do was to blame the devil as a real conspirator for the death of the man and the closing of the case. And honestly, compared to all the barbaric stuff that our ancestors did centuries ago, we are rather human: these stab wounds without pain. <br /> <br /> In summary, I will simply quote the episode of "Firefly", "Jaynestown": "I think every man who has ever made a statue is a type of son of a bitch or whatever. Not for you, Jayne, that's what they need. "
