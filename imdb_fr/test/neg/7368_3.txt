According to the title, the slogan, the plot summary on the DVD, etc., I was expecting something a little at least epic, with concurrent historical fiction and romance to amaze you; That's what they did in Last of the Mohicans, for example, and I think they did a great job. Maybe I had too high standards for this film and I did not give him a chance. But the landscape was hardly acceptable (how could they not offer something more beautiful when they have to work with such landscapes?), The two lovers had no chemistry, and the plot was so predictable that it felt like it had been. in 5 minutes by a child of twelve - and not very imaginative. New France is a love story unfolding in a turbulent historical era. But the story of New France is hardly a side note, and the love story is trivial and fails dramatically to ensure that the viewer cares about the fate of lovers. Surprisingly, the only good sides of the film come from something quite unexpected and unannounced: the relationship between Marie-Loup, the heroine, and her children (a natural, an adopted). If only they had focused on his family and had forgotten the love story, the film would have been much better. Marie-Loup's parents should have had more time on the screen and character development, the policy in Britain should have been more than a three-minute Remain, the rotten villain should have been more developed or removed from the script completely (why hire actors like Vincent Perez, Tim Roth or Jason Isaacs to abuse them so badly?) In general, it's a bad job.
