Jim Wynorski strikes again with the very literal KOMODO VS. COBRA. No guessing here. A giant CGI komodo dragon - which looks like a fur-free dog - tackles a gigantic CGI cobra, with a group of cheaters and others caught between two fires. The tree kidnappers are asking boat captain Michael Par√© (who else?) To take them to a forbidden federal island. An experiment led by a mad scientist in the cultivation of very large vegetables has become an experiment in the growth of very large creatures, thanks to our crazy servicemen. All that remains on the island are the very great creatures and the little girl, well made of the mad scientist. The group meets her in the old laboratory of the plantation, the monsters arrive and the hunt is launched. If you watch enough Wynorski / Sci-Fi Channel movies, you'll recognize some of the backgrounds and locations of many other movies. Acting is non-existent, as is the plot. At the very least, you'll be able to watch the misbehaved compo / dog stomp on its victims before scare them. The cobra strikes and swallows. No imagination at all.
