This movie was so bad that it was funny! For a while there, I thought I was actually watching a parody of a bad movie (at the "For your sake"). The "cliffhanger" scene at the end made me laugh until my guts hurt me. The screenplay was pretty dreadful, but coupled with Sean Young's dreadful acting - especially as she explains the whole plot in detail (with flashbacks) while swaying at the bottom of a cliff - actually a movie really bad to watch! In fact, the fake shots of this scene reminded me of a film by Ed Wood. I still can not believe how this thing was made. First, how did such a bad script get the green light? How did the stars act? Were they at the bottom of their careers? Questions, questions.
