This movie was incredibly bad ... It's gore but the violence is too much to the point where it looks extremely wrong and predictable. Since everything is shown to you, nothing remains to the imagination. And the plot ... what intrigue? There really are not! The pace is incredibly slow (despite random acts of violence) and the storyline must have been written by a 12-year-old boy who kills kittens for fun. So, this film was banned in 31 countries? I could see why ... not because of the gore (boring and banal) but because it was a terrible movie. He should have been banished from existence. Avoid this one like the plague. 1 of 10
