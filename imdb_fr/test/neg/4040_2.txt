It's just the same old crap vomited by amateur idiots who have no idea how to make a movie - so maybe that's why it's a wannah movie be direct! <br /> <br /> I guess it's my fault for spending money to see it (one of the worst decisions I've ever made). Such a waste. I usually like B-movies, some of them are actually pretty good, but it's too ridiculous and stupid to be funny, even. <br /> <br /> The losers who made this junk deserve to be decommissioned to waste everyone's time and money to make a movie that does not deserve to be filmed! These so-called filmmakers have absolutely no talent! <br /> <br /> A stupid plot, a horrible acting game (especially the drag queens - which patient would it find that sexy too!), A lame writing (if there was even a scenario - it looks a little like the bull **** that we just invented on the spot) <br /> <br /> What is stunning in this film is its complete lack of work well done at all. <br /> <br /> How much attention to detail would it take for each image in a film to fall short of reasonable standards? I do not think it would be possible to intentionally make such a bad film, and it is inconceivable that mere bad luck can produce results that are always so horrible. <br /> <br /> Anyway, avoid this stink bomb at all costs! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
