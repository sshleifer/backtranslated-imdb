Wrestlemania 2 is the only Wrestlemania | thank god | take place in three different places and although it was an interesting idea, it did not really work. There are really only two matches that have been scored, the others being rather decent, even terrible. Susan Saint James, Ray Charles and Cathy Crosby are fun celebrities, but the experience has been a waste of time for most. The match between British Bulldgos and Dream Team is worth the price of admission, but you can honestly see it anywhere. <br /> <br /> Matches. <br /> <br /> Nassau Coliseum. <br /> <br /> Paul Orndorff Vs The Magnificent Muraco / W Mr.Fuji. For the moment, and despite the shitty finish, it was surprisingly bearable, with everyone. The crowd sings "Bullsh * t" at the end. That being said, it did not do anything for the career of one or the other. The match ends with a double countdown, the fights taking place outside the ring. Randy Savage | C | Vs George "The animal" Steele. This is not very wise from the point of view of the fight, but very entertaining because of the antics at stake and the good comedy of Steele, in addition to the savage who can fight against a potato and make it interesting. Savage wins when he puts his foot on the ropes, to leverage. <br /> <br /> 2 1/2 / 5 <br /> <br /> Jake "The Snake" Roberts Vs George Wells. It was better than expected, but it's too short to make an impact. Roberts wins with DDT, pulling out the snake, which disgusts Saint James. <br /> <br /> 1 1/2 / 5 <br /> <br /> Boxing match. Mr.T / W The Hati Kid & Joe Frazier vs. Roddy Piper / W Lou Duva & Bob Orton. A huge failure in my opinion. It bothered me to be foolish and, while it may have been a marketing success, it certainly did not keep me entertained. Many of Rowdy's songs are also noticeable. TQ wins, when Piper slams. <br /> <br /> 1/5 <br /> <br /> Rosemont Horizon <br /> <br /> Match for the women's title. Fabulous Moolah | C | Vs Velvet Mcintyre. The race ends too fast, even before the match begins, creating a record for the rapid decline of the pins with regard to the matches of Women. Moolah wins when she enjoys the missed splashes of Velvet by the top rope <br /> <br /> 0/5 <br /> <br /> Corporal Kirchner versus Nikolai Volkoff / W Classy Freddie Blassie. Big pop for the corporal. Stupid match up, offending boring of both parties, while being far too short. The corporal wins when he hits Volkoff with Blassie's cane. <br /> <br /> 1/5 <br /> <br /> Battle Royal. William Perry and Andr√© get the biggest pops. It's quite entertaining, despite all the talents of the NFL. It is also interesting to note the first appearance of Bret Hart in Wrestlemania. Andre wins when he releases the Hart Foundation. <br /> <br /> 2 1/2 / 5 <br /> <br /> Team titles of labels. British Bulldogs / W Lou Albano & Ozzy Osbourne Vs The Dream Team / W Johnny Valiant | C |. An absolutely great match is one of the best wrestling matches in the world. You will not have time to catch your breath, with all the maneuvers at your fingertips and the excellent psychology of the ring. It's pure wrestling at its best, you can not call yourself a Wrestling fan if you do not like this game. The Bulldogs win when Dynamite Kid collides with Valentine <br /> <br /> 4/5 <br /> <br /> Memorial sports stadium in Los Angeles <br /> Ricky Steamboat against Hercules Hercules. The match is pretty decent here, both men performing well. Hercules is a nasty brute, with above-average skills, which contrasted well with Steamboat's style. Steamboat wins with a cross body above the top rope. <br /> <br /> 2 1/2 / 5 <br /> <br /> Adrian Adonis versus Uncle Elmer. Terrible match, with a boring comedy. Fans love Uncle Elmer, but not me. Adonis wins with a maneuver at the top of the rope. <br /> <br /> 0/5 <br /> <br /> The Funk brothers against Tito Santana & JYD. Solid match here, with lots of memorable bumps taken from Terry Funk | the one across the table was something else for this time. I should evaluate this as my second favorite. Funks wins with the help of Jimmy Hart's megaphone. <br /> <br /> 3/5 <br /> <br /> WWF Championship. Hulk Hogan | C | Vs King Kong Bundy. Decent pop for Hogan. One of the most excited games in Wrestlemania history. Hogan can not fight, and Bundy is not very good himself. The violence was brutal for the time, but Hogan's act of superheroes is quite boring, and there are too many boring moments. Hogan wins when he escapes Bundy. <br /> <br /> 1/5 <br /> <br /> Final result. Wrestlemania 2 is a failure in most areas. Fighting fans should see this once, but you really do not have it too. There is not enough here to satisfy a real wrestling fan. Vince blew it on this one. Do not be fooled by the hype of the main event, it's really a boring affair, like most cards. Not recommended and ranks among the worst of Wrestlemania outside the tag title match. <br /> <br /> 4/10
