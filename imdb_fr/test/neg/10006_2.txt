Being a long time Japanese movie fan, I was expecting more than that. I can not really be bothered to write too much, because this movie is so poor. The story is perhaps the cutest little romantics of all time. Too bad I can not stand the dramatic game, the mess they called stimulation and the "weird" Japanese story. If you've noticed that many Japanese movies use characters, intrigues and twists that seem too "different", then force yourself, so avoid this movie. Seriously, a 12 year old teenager could have told you how this movie would evolve, and that's not a good thing in my book. <br /> <br /> Fans of "Beat" Takeshi: His role in this movie is really no more than just a cameo, and unless you're a rabid fan, you do not need to suffer from this waste of film. <br /> <br /> 2/10
