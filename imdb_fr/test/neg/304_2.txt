In fact, I have lost enough time watching this chore of a movie, I do not want to lose more to write a big review. Not once did I smile. ALL the jokes were boring, forced and lacking in spirit. I kept saying, "where is the punchline?" Almost every character was an uncomfortable stereotype and all situations were clich√©d and half the time, there was not even a solution. Things just happen to get to the next scene. Throughout my life, I do not understand how it has been so good. If you like clumsy acting and poorly composed movies, Fat Girls is for you.
