This relatively obscure "masterpiece" in Hong Kong is the ideal movie on a desert island for the seers of the video age (at least its first half is). Every montage, every scene, every sequence is an excuse to look at a girl's skirt, look at her breasts, look at her stockings and watch her tight crotch. What establishes it is the perversities of the main character, of course (!) <br /> <br /> The faithful guy Anthony Wong is a slightly perverted married man, struggling with erotic reveries and fantasies scandalous. All of them involve sexy Chinese ladies, lightly dressed, with nothing but sexual servitude in their minds. <br /> <br /> The plot is thickened by a murderous intrigue, a voodoo doll and a small rape and looting. <br /> <br /> Some sex scenes are pretty hot and the gore liberal, but the supernatural elements introduced in the second half are half-cooked and the plot developments are ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Clearly, garish garbage producer Wong Jing was extremely eager to get this in and out of the theaters. <br /> <br /> The sequence of arty titles did not deceive this blas√© bettor.
