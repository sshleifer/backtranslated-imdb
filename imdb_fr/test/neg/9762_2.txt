I always wanted to see the movie because I loved the novel, but I was warned because I had heard that the movie was a whore. It is. Fowles wrote the script and I could follow him, despite the fact that I was reading the novel more than thirty years ago. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is execrable - jerky, shocking and utterly inappropriate - breaking any attempt at mystery or mood in the movie. I suspect that the director has to take a lot of blame, because even Michael Caine is terrible and he was already doing a great job at ALFIE a few years ago. <br /> <br /> The "mysteries" evoked by the book are not well translated on the screen. I would like to see someone remake this one.
