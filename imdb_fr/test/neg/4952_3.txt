I can not understand why you would give this film more than 4 ... It's no coincidence that this brings me back to the 80s and the "good old days of horror comedy" but that genre does has not improved since - it is LAME Small budget - low tech - bad acting - bad story - not at all scary and not funny enough ... in fact, there is not much good to say about it. The so-called monsters are just horribly bad! I mean, we came back to the days when they made the plasticine monsters and realized the glory by stage ... I really do not understand why someone would invest money to turn this scenario into a film - but I guess it would have been almost OK if it had been a bigger budget movie. <br /> <br /> The recommendation would be this: do not make the mistake of wasting your time on this unless you want tips for a bad Halloween makeup! Personally, I enjoy independent films and anything that is off the beaten track, but that did not do it to me at all.
