Who wrote this movie? A young man of 15 years without inspiration? <br /> <br /> It could have been written by one of the children who filmed Columbine. <br /> <br /> Absolutely absurd, not funny, booooooorii ... Moreover, the French do not put their flag everywhere. You do not enter a French bank and do not see the tricolor flag displayed like that. Even the day of the Bastille. <br /> <br /> I have nothing against the bloodbath. It's just that none of this is credible or fun. Or parodic, or something like that. <br /> <br /> Ok, those who liked this film will tell you that I must be a kind of fascist, so forget my comment.
