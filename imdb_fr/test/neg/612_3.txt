I've been a fan of the Carpenters for a long time, read the biography, watched the specials and saw Karen Carpenter's story. This movie did not really show the real Karen Carpenter. In the film, she seems to be a shy and a rather lonely (except for a girlfriend). The real Karen Carpenter was different. She was sociable and friendly. She had a lot of friends, including Olive Newton-John. The film does not even show Karen's attempts at a solo album and her meeting with Phil Ramone and his wife Itchy "Karen". Itchy knew the real Karen Carpenter in New York. When Karen was in New York, she went to a psychologist, but it was voluntary and once a day she would go to her hotel room. In addition, Karen was taking medication to increase her thyroid weight, but stop taking it because the psychologist did not recommend it. Also, Karen's husband in the movie is called Bob Knight, but in real life his name was Tom Burris. Plus, Karen did not divorce Tom, but only separated. Karen had to sign the divorce papers on the day of her death. In addition, Agnes found Karen naked in the closet unconsciousness, unlike the movie where she was dressed in white. The music was very good. It was the only thing I would recommend seeing it.
