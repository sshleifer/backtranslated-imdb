I probably have to blame myself, but I was certainly expecting more than one movie that bears the title "Black Dragons" and talks about secret conspiracies of the Second World War, Nazi plastic surgeons and revenge . This film is a failure with an incomprehensible structure. The plot (which is fundamentally rather ingenious and intriguing) only becomes clear in an explanation towards the end, but the problem is that you stop worrying long before. We see how the horror icon Bela Lugosi infiltrates into a society of prominent American politicians and kills them one by one. The story is timed just before the Second World War and ?? especially after attending the end ?? it is surely a premise with a lot of potential, so it's a shame that it is not developed in a more appropriate way. There is, however, a great dialogue that I can not resist sharing! Man to woman: "Do you want to marry me?" "Why?" "Then I can beat you - that's the only way to leave this place!" This is the only highlight of a very boring movie. Bela Lugosi is beautiful ?? as usual ?? but his phantasmagorical performance alone is hardly worth the purchase of this film. If you'd like to see more of his macabre performances (in movies with decent scenarios), check out "Invisible Ghost," "The Corpse Vanishes," "White Zombie," and of course the 1931 version of Dracula.
