I really wanted to love this movie. Large retail ?? Walter Pidgeon in a role that reminds us of his iconic "Forbidden Planet", Barbara Eden and Robert Sterling as young lovers, Frankie Avalon as a sailor with a musical inclination (is a guy on a submarine a sailor?), even Peter Lorre as a scientist with a fondness for sharks. It may be a good children's movie, but I struggled to stay awake. Lorre was severely underutilized. I guess he was a red herring, like Pidgeon ?? you might expect him to go crazy and try to throw the hero or his daughter into the shark tank. No chance. By the way, why is there a shark tank on a submarine? This is typical of the film's lack of ambition. They explain why Lorre walks the shark back and forth (because we see it), but we expect us to accept the fact that there is a shark on this submarine for whatever reason. "Research?" Yeah, scientists are still doing this research work, who can understand them? Of course, if there was no shark, who would kill the diabolical psychologist lady (Joan Fontaine)? I'm sorry but even children's movies in the 50's are able to be less predictable and frankly idiots (not to say exploiters). <br /> <br /> The first 10 or 15 minutes really sparked my hopes. Great song song sung by Frankie Avalon. Pidgeon driving Floyd the Barber (Howard McNear actually, sorry Howie loved "Blue Hawaii") and Joan Fontaine for a guided tour, taking care to jump the room with the huge "WARNING" sign on the door, in front of Peter Lorre with the aforementioned sharks, then we see a full-screen screenshot of Eden waving his genius at Avalon's horny horn game! The film passes quickly downstream from there. There is no real explanation for the fire storm that threatens the Earth, so there is a flagrant lack of dramatic tension and no bad guy to start. Instead, the character of Pidgeon is transformed into a dimly unconvincing red herring of the Ahab variety (I guess "The Caine Mutiny" was still fresh in people's minds), and the character of Fountain suddenly turns to the heck for no reason at the end. Oh, I guess the reason is that it's a surprise to the public. And it's a bit surprising, because the only negative thing she's done is to talk about the captain's mental health and that there's ALWAYS no reason why she sabotaged after she turned out to be the nasty. Very badly done and unconvincing. The guy who was the pessimistic Bible nut was better ?? at least his character made sense. <br /> <br /> So what else could go wrong? Endless and endless dive sequences. I never understand the attraction of this kind of thing. A giant squid attacks the ship for a minute, so that there is a monster for the theatrical caravan. This may have prompted some people to think that it would be a fantastic adventure movie, instead of a half-cooked thriller movie about military scientists who are never wrong. Yes ?? worst of all, it's hardly a fantastic movie let alone a sci-fi movie. It never did anything for my imagination, because the principle was nothing but a disaster / apocalypse and these characters never experience wonder or discovery. I'm done with Irwin Allen. Anyway, I never liked his latest films, but he claimed to be Jules Verne, when it is actually a new escape formula. All the movie is waiting to know which character will become improbably demonic and die. He has always hired an actor / actress with a charming and friendly personality on the screen to play these roles and this is the only element of "surprise" to find, because there is no logic for these characters anyway . What a pathetic waste of time for these actors. The films of George Pal are 100 times better (the only one that was lame was "Atlantis", which was not a coincidence if it was the most Allen-Esquire), full of wonder and excitement and ?? Think about it! ?? ideas! Apart from a few scenes of effects and Barbara Eden, nothing is worth seeing here in my opinion. I guess it's a lot of fun for people who love disaster film, but I think it's a hollow and boring genre.
