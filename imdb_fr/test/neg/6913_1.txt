Oh my god why? I am stunned by the sheer ineptitude of this delightful, blaming absurdity ... as if all that made sense. Well, like this last-ditch Hollywood movie of the 1940s, nothing in this door that slams the horror - done on three plateaux - makes sense ... except for the frenzy of Dr. Markoff (jerkoff ?) Who covets uncontrollably a plonky piano - The player's daughter who has big melons and a flying hairstyle. It's just terrible ... and even has a gorilla and a big dog for unnecessary distractions. More elephantine than elephant man and it's just 62 minutes! .... THE MONSTER MAKER is the kind of film the 2005 kids scream in disbelief, wondering what their grandparents saw in their youth and made them the adorable moviegoers they are today. I guess you just had to be there. In 1944 or at any other time, this crazy drone was presented to 13-year-old printable children in glorious velvet film palaces with a seating capacity of 3,000 on a rainy day. Somehow. This was done for no reason, by bastards of PRC Pictures botchville movies during the war, by fleeing German refugees who knew who to make a film since they had come out of Europe while the Nazis were moving into the studios UFA ... the monster in this movie, as the mad scientist is actually a Nazi nightmare.
