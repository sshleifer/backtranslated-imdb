Fun thing. Charlie Sheen, Donald Sutherland, Sam Waterston and Stephen Lang all had incredible performances. Who can forget Sheen as a naive callow on Wall Street or Sutherland as a cynical surgeon of the Korean War in MASH? Waterston and Lang have also had great careers in television and film (Law and Order, Killing Fields, De Niro's Tribeca, etc.). So, what would these good actors do in the world with a stink bomb like this? <br /> <br /> Shadow Conspiracy's plot about a coup in Washington is not so bad, it may be original, but not as serious. . Of course it was done (Seven Days in May - a good movie!), But with a little tweaking, it could have been entertaining. <br /> <br /> The main problem of Shadow Conspiracy lies in its execution. At the beginning of the film Sheen, extreme political strategist, ridiculously and improbably solves a possible public relations blunder by making a member of Congress sing. Later, the game show with Lang's mute killer, tearing up half of what is supposed to be Georgetown, is explained to the news as "gang wars". Has anyone remotely associated with this film ever lived a day in Washington? Sheen is about 20 years old too young, far too young to be as experienced in a White House administration. Sheen's response to avoid a political crisis is so full of false machismo that he seems to be going to actor David Hasselhoff's school. And when was the last time gang wars spread to Georgetown? We are talking about a Washington section where citizens voted against the creation of a metro station to retain their exclusivity. <br /> <br /> I agree with another reviewer that this movie would have been unbearable without the quick help button. . I recorded it at HBO a year ago, and then watched three separate views. <br /> <br /> In summary: do not buy this movie. Do not even rent this movie. If you see him at Blockbuster, run as fast as you can.
