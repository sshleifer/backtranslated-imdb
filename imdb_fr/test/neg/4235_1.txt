The director gives this film a false depth by repeating a gadget throughout the film. EVERY shot in this movie is 3 times longer than necessary. You could easily cut an hour and a half from this two and a half hour long film without eliminating: a word of dialogue, an image, an event or a little movement. <br /> <br /> This was one of the most free movie wastes I've ever seen. Other commentators have called it pretentious, which is a euphemism. Humanity is a pseudo-intellectual junk designed to be anti-Hollywood so that Cannes judges can assert their independence from the Oscars. <br /> <br /> The IMDb critic says: "Unlike Hollywood movies - which usually force the overdrive audience - it forces the audience to slow down and look in detail at some of the slimmest and mundane features of life. "It would be necessary to be catatonic to look at some of these images for such a long time and to move so slowly towards these characters. It's not real life unless you take heavy drugs. <br /> <br /> Finally, I had the impression that Schott√©'s performance was a sad scam of Peter Sellers' masterful "Chauncy Gardner". He uses the same facial expressions and postures. He even has gardens! In many ways, there are parallels between these two films. The main difference is that "Being There" is evolving and not relying on shock or tricks to create a meaningful experience while challenging various things we take for granted in life.
