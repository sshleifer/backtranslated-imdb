Spheeris used this documentary to promote a stereotype of punks. This documentary is biased and guided, not objective. Cutting techniques that pass from one interview to another can be used to get people out of the conversation. When you watch the movie, the persistent idea that comes out of the punk interviews is that they are pretty stupid. Band members and other punks appear to be unintelligent and unable to explain their motives or provide detailed or consistent answers or answers. I strongly doubt that if some of the interviewees knew what Spheeris was creating or were seeing the final product afford to be included in the project. This film puts punks in a bad light by making them seem unintelligent and simple-minded. Spheeris's film should not be seen as a representation of LA's punk scene. If you want to see a good punk documentary, look at "Another State of Mind" with Youth Brigade and Social Distortion.
