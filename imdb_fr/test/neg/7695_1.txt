Total shame! Really horrible! The script and the dialogue are a joke and are combined with a director who has no idea of ​​life in Saudi Arabia. It's no surprise, a Saudi film, the director is of Canadian origin of Palestinian origin, the writer is Lebanese, the main actress is Jordanian, and the filming took place in Dubai, and all these elements show very well that the film is far from representing Saudi society. Yes, it contains Saudi clichés, which we see every day in newspaper cartoons, but that's about it. The film had the opportunity to show a real problem with Saudi society, or at least to give us something new and authentic about the problems and worries of young people in Saudi Arabia. Even the so-called love story in the film does not exist or at least we have not seen it. The only positive side of this total debacle lies in the action of the supporting actors. The veteran Khaled Sami was funny in a badly written role as grandfather, he is clearly lost, because he looks younger than the actor who plays his son. In addition, the actor who plays the role of the fanatical brother, Turki Al-Yusuf, has been successful. In fact, he was the best actor of the film. The rest of the cast, long-time professionals, did a decent job, but lead actor Hisham Abdulrahman was just plain bad. He had a look of a cute little bobby for all situations. He could not even say his lines in a proper way. He has a charisma that earned him the title of Star Academy, a very famous reality show, and he is good at interviews and TV shows, but he was only the weak link in this movie . The main actress did not bother me very much, but even she had acted badly in some scenes and unnecessarily exaggerated her sensuality. <br /> <br /> The film was a huge success, the Saudis flocked by the thousands to neighboring Bahrain and Dubai was to attend when it was projected there, and it gave a silver tone, then it was screened in pay-per-view, then in television, and it was in a few weeks. It was to take advantage of the Saudis' eagerness for local entertainment, but alas; the film was neither homemade nor entertaining.
