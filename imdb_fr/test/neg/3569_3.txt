Why spend a moment browsing this clumsy and unconscious film? From time to time, after an hour of tedious intrigue and amateur acting, we begin to discover some fragments of the big band swing that made Tommy and Jimmy Dorsey, separately and together, the great musicians they were . From time to time - during a jam session with Art Tatum, with Tommy Dorsey and his orchestra with "Marie" and an eminent, Jimmy Dorsey and his orchestra with Bob Eberle and Helen O'Connell singing "Green Eyes" - we get a song. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the film is in the public domain and the transfer of DVD is as serious as the actor. My copy has only four chapters. That means you can get arthritis with your finger moving forward quickly, trying to find what's best. The swamp you cross is the Hollywood version of the life and battles of the two Dorsey. Tommy, superb trombone, and Jimmy, superb on the saxophone, could not stand each other. In 1935 they eventually broke up and Tommy founded his own orchestra. Each one had more success than they had done together. They were reconciled to the death of their father in the forties, where the film ends. They later tolerated themselves in the orchestra conducted by Tommy at the end of the big band era in the fifties. Tommy died in 1956 at the age of 51, vomiting in his sleep after drinking alcohol, taking pills and eating a big meal. Jimmy died of cancer at the age of 53 in 1957. Jimmy was extremely talented and, in every way, quite easy-going. Tommy was extremely talented and, in all respects, often a domineering fool. But good music makes up for a lot of faults, and the sounds of the Big Band that were created helped define the swing era. <br /> <br /> They play themselves in the film, and we see them evolve from scrambled tykes (with children actors) to adult men who fight and hurt each other. The movie is cluttered not only by their two parents, portrayed by Irish Hollywood clich√©s, Sara Allgood and Arthur Shields, who just want their boys to get along well, but also by a major story-telling sub-story. love between Janet Blair, as a childhood friend of the Dorsey, who becomes their singer and plays the role of mediator and facilitator almost full time, and William Lundigan, pianist. Blair is not bad at all. However, if you want to see why she never became the star she probably should have been, just watch the movies, like this one, in which her studio put her. No wonder she left Hollywood. Lundigan is simply taking up space. <br /> <br /> How serious is this film, other than when we can actually hear Dorseys play? Well, here's a song written specifically for the film and given to Blair. It's called "To Me". <br /> <br /> For me ... you are the rosary of a rosary ... the rise of a rising sea ... the glow of a star ... <br /> <br /> > The rosary of a rosary? The film is not better than that, and it can not get worse. Nevertheless, if you like the Dorsey and if the price is right ... well, in hindsight, I still would not buy it. The highlight for me is Eberle and O'Connell singing "Green Eyes". You can watch them for free on You Tube. You will also find a lot of each of the Dorsey. I would have liked to know.
