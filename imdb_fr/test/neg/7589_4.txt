Butter Battle is an entertaining story about two fictional cities and their arms race. It is also a misguided allegory about the Cold War and the arms race in general. Yes, it's a children's book, but like so many works by Theodor Seuss Geisel, he hits people with his morals. <br /> <br /> And what is this morality? It is certainly commendable to encourage us to focus more on what unites us than on what divides us. Encouraging international cooperation is even a good thing. But to assimilate the differences between the Warsaw Pact and West NATO nations to a different application of butter is simply not true. To underscore the obvious, many Warsaw Pact countries experienced intermittent periods of shortage of butter and bread - they would have been happy to eat it on the side if it were available. On a less literal level and whatever your political inclination, Soviet socialism against Western (especially Anglo-American) democracy is not a simple matter of preference and custom. <br /> <br /> To be more precise, nuclear weapons were not developed in a cold war with the Soviets, but in a hot war with the Axis powers. There is no doubt that Germany was developing its nuclear capabilities during the war. Should the United States have refrained from conducting nuclear weapons research by relying on their (hardly inevitable) victory in the classical war? Once the weapons were developed, they were used against the enemy who attacked us at Pearl Harbor. What does a nation do at this stage when the genie is out of its bottle? In addition, the decline is 20-20, which means there was no way to ensure that another half-crazy dictator would not return to the development of nuclear weapons. The second Gulf War demonstrated the incredible difficulty of establishing credible threats and neutralizing them. <br /> <br /> Be that as it may, the cartoon is nothing more than a simplistic propaganda that does not explore the nuances of nuclear-related ethical issues. armament and tries instead to inculcate in children the fear of weapons technology.
