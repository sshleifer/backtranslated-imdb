It's 2 stars only because they have put a lot of work into making this game look good. I've played a lot of good and bad games and I think this game has the dullest story I've ever had. never had to listen. The best thing they could have done is to let you get through the conversations (but no, you have to listen to them for 10 minutes) and just keep doing the same over and over again. Climb the building, save the citizen, kill a guy. IT'S ALL ABOUT Ubisoft should really engage someone with imagination. <br /> <br /> I am a big fan of the Prince of Persia series (3 first). The story was good and you wanted to know what was going on all the time. I do not even hate Prince of Persia 4. But I think anyone who develops history for Assassin's Creed should be forbidden to write anything else for the rest of his life. <br /> <br /> Boring history and the same missions again and again! If only one of these two things were good, the game would be worth it.
