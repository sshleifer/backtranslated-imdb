I had not seen this for many years. The acting was so good that I started this time, I thought, "Awesome! Another movie that I misjudged as a stupid young man." But then the theme started to be clear and I felt the same thing. <br /> <br /> It was Hollywood, the seat of glamor; the concept should not be a surprise. But it's such a condescending concept that I feel the need to take a shower after watching it. In summary, this tells us that even physically ugly people can look beautiful and even feel attractive. <br /> <br /> Dorothy McGuire is friendly as a warm heroine. She seems to have been filmed with a minimum of makeup. Robert Young is wounded in the war and feels scarred. His parents can not bear to watch him either. He seems to have all his faculties and, in part, the notions of disability are outdated. <br /> <br /> Herbert Marshall is a blind pianist. His character speaks is low and omniscient. <br /> <br /> The best performance is given by Mildred Natwick as owner of the main residence. It is bitter and hard but not made of ice. His story is much more interesting and credible than that of McGuire and Young.
