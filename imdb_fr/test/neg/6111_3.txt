In a way, I failed for a few years to see this film, even though it was very successful and generated a lot of discussion in Israel. I'm sorry I did not delay seeing him indefinitely. <br /> <br /> The theme of 'Kadosh' is very real and painful for those who know the Jewish religious world - the place of women in the Orthodox family and society. The basic situation that prevails on the scene of the film is possible, the problem is that the way it is presented on the screen and the "solution" that the conflicts described in the film receive are false. Gitai does not seem to have too much sympathy for men in the religious world, but his approach of choosing characters either fanatical or unable to express their human feelings makes the whole story simplistic. He does not offer much better service to his female characters, although at least here he shows more sympathy and he also appreciates the participation of two beautiful and talented actresses in Yael Abecassis and Meital Barda. Overall, Gitai's vision is too one-sided, his film resources are too basic, he focuses on the technical details of Jewish religious life, which can be interesting for people who do not know them but are not really relevant. at all in the context of the whole story. We start here with a boring film that seems longer than it is, with a very static way of playing, an obsessive use of music that plays in the same register, not only from a musical point of view, but also an emotional point of view. very inconclusive if not even end confusing. What a difference between this film and "Ha Ushpizin" inspired and describing the same social landscape and who managed to convey human feelings to the screen. In 'Kadosh', there is both too little cinema and too few human emotions.
