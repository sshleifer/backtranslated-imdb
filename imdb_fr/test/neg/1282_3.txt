Everyone had a lot to do and there was a lot of hype when the announcement was announced. Now it's easy to explain why it did not meet expectations: First, this show failed to create a realistic world for pre-teens the way Rugrats captured the world and the imagination toddlers. Secondly, the characters in the series are stereo type (Angelica: spoiled white blonde as opposed to Suzie: modest colored family girl, ...) or boring (Tommy, Chuckie) and boring (Dil). Finally, there is not an ounce of innovation or an original plot. To summarize, All Grown Up is a waste of time and a bad idea for a series following a show such as Rugrats. It's boring, it lacks imagination and it seems that producers do not even know how to behave 10-13 years. To be fair, should not Angelica and Suzie compare the size of the bra rather than fighting over who is best able to do the housework?
