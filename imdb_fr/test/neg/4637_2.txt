This film was announced for over three months in Greece as the greatest Greek production of all time. That might be the case, but ... When you hear about a big production, you expect to see something new, different. What you see here is a film without reason. George Corraface seems to have not really liked making this movie. His game is so simplistic, it looks almost amateurish. The sound, especially when some Turkish actors speak English (dubbed?), Is full of hissing. Fortunately, the rare special effects of Istanbul and Athens in the late 1950s and early 1970s are more like digital paintings than computer-generated images. Finally, we see the same boy from 1959 (5 years) to 1968 (14 years), but miraculously, he becomes a teenager five years later. <br /> <br /> That's the biggest Greek production. "At least you would think there would be some sort of interesting scenario to qualify for such expensive production, and all you get is a love story between 7 years old and 40 years later Oh, there is also a political side Some ironic remarks about the Greek "junta" of 67-1974, so childish that seems almost forced. There are of course some good things in the film: most of the actors are great, mainly Ieroklis Michaelidis, the beautiful landscapes and the beautiful music of Evanthia Remboutsika, but they are so few for a production so expensive. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: is it so serious a film? To tell the truth I do not know .I just know that this does not justify in any case its huge budget (for the standards Greek).
