First, I am a big fan of Alien and Alien II. In my opinion, these two films created and defined the genre of Si-Fi Horror as we know it today. I noticed that Lifeforce was often compared to the Aliens saga - after watching this movie, I totally disagree. There are certain special effects acceptable with extraterrestrial vampires, and the scenario could have been acceptable. I just can not go beyond a naked woman vampire throughout the movie, it's absolutely nonsense (even if it looks good). Add to that a bunch of bad British actors and that's about PLUS. Most of the film ends up in London or somewhere in England. After 20 minutes, you lose the decor of the outdoor space and all hope of real action and suspense Si-Fi Horror. <br /> <br />
