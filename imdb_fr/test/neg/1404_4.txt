It was a character film. The plot was not so hot when she was there, but the characters were interesting and very well played. The story focuses on the Travis family following the suicide of the eldest son. I say that loosely, because the story is mainly about the surviving son and the mother, because if the father was supposed to have the story centered on him too, they put the film wrong. The acting was very good, especially Emile Hirsch as a confused son surviving. The characters were all very interesting and I did not mind watching them until late in the movie, when it seemed to drag on. <br /> <br /> My big complaint, though, was the story. The son who committed suicide was to be the center of the plot. However, it really was not. It was something that happened at the beginning of the story, but then everything happened in every way. Then they mentioned that the son had killed himself to remind you that it was the common thread. The other thing was that the big twists of the plot, of which there were a lot, were never really explained or complicated, but simply thrown there at random and often from the extreme left. In all fairness, the end was very, very cool. But it was also clear where the inspiration for the story came from: about half of it (half that was not padded) was drawn from the story of Pearl Jam's song, Alive. What reminds me ... <br /> <br /> There was a "poem" in the film that was written by someone who killed himself. I could not be the only one to recognize that this poem had been raised word by word from this same song. I do not know, it was a movie I had hoped for, and they really, really, dropped the ball.
