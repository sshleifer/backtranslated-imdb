The only factor that bought this film was the fact that it was broadcast free on television and that it probably helped the Romanian economy. Apart from that, Hallmark must reevaluate this division of his empire and perhaps direct his films further toward strange love relationships between hemophiliacs with cancer in Mississippi. Entering the details of the stupidity of this film would give him the merit of being memorable. It was not. I remember the act of watching, there are vampires (some of them are teenagers) and very bad dubbing. Anyone who has worked on the dub track of this film must be transferred to another sector of society ... perhaps in the restaurant sector, among the deaf. If you have the opportunity, watch this movie, just because it makes so many other very bad movies look like the Oscars retrospectively. Once again, if you find yourself in the profile of this film, I guess it may be too late ...
