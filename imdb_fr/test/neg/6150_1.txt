AWFUL wot more can I say that I remember seeing him at the movies (see how painfully it sticks in memory) like a 16 year old boy. Mark Hamill was the skywalker of older generations and was not good at that, he was worse at that. Plus a soundtrack of Then Jericho AAAAARRRRRRGGGGGGGHHHHHH. There is a movie as bad as the one I saw at Arthur 2 on the rocks. It's funny like this question "What's the worst movie you've ever seen?" is easier than "what is the best movie?" which also varies between The Italian Job (original), Untouchables, Casino, What to do in Denver, Goodfellas (get an idea of ​​what I like ??? - it will fool you!) Find Nemo , Pirates of the Caribbean and Moulin Rouge! Please never watch this movie or it will stay in your memory too!
