This series and Elon Gold were becoming HYPED as "the next big thing" in sitcoms for NBC. Well, they have not been. Dennis Farina was terribly mistaken as a father-in-law. He just seemed so uncomfortable and moved here. The term "private" convo 'time! " was supposed to become the "Dyno-mite!" slogan of the 21st century. Well, it was not. People then asked, as they still are today (when his name will be quoted), "Who the hell is Elon Gold?" I saw it in an episode of "The Mentalist" tonight. I mentioned his name and my girlfriend asked, "Who?" Not funny. Total loss of airtime. NBC really had high hopes for this show, but it just fell flat.
