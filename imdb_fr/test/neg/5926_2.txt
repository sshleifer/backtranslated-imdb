I must say that it is not very good. Polly Bergen is doing well in this movie. Others are too. I'm gay and honestly, there are so many clichés for this period of history that it's just sad. We started watching it and then turning it off, and then we decided it would be fun to make fun of the rest of the movie. But all in all, the basic idea of ​​the film is good. If it had been rewritten with less artificial lines and better interpreted, it could have been really good. Overall, I would not recommend it. In addition, this line of thought is so lame. On top of that, the fight in the hair salon is funny because it's so bad. The lesbian sister in the room with them while they were trying to do it is so weird that it's sad.
