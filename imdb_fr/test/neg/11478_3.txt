I saw this film when it came to theaters in 1988, and although I knew it was not of an award-winning caliber ... I liked it a little bit. It tells the story of five former scouts gathered to do the job they never had to do in their childhood - it's climbing the mountain. Whitehead. Of course, young Scouts have all grown up and developed their personalities in different ways, but nothing more different from what they were in their childhood. Richard Lewis is still neurotic, Richard Belzer is still a playboy, Franklyn Ajaye is always a kind of group's Dear Abby and Tim Thomerson is still the surfer of the group. Of course, the most successful star is Louie Anderson, a "true believer" in everything related to Cub Scout. He still lives in the same house as his mother, continues to read the Scouting Handbook daily, is courageous, respectful and clean, and is the one who brings others together for another great adventure in Scouting. However, the Grunski brothers complete their task. Two tyrants were beaten by the aforementioned scouts. Coincidentally, they collide with their old burrow and decide to harass them a bit, even if they are safe. It's not so harmless that three escaped convicts think Pack 7 belongs to the FBI and intends to eliminate them. Overall, the film still has charm. Watch Richard Lewis try to get comfortable on a folding bed, for example, and you'll have a funny feeling. After a closer look, the whole movie needed more of that kind of observation humor. It does not hold well after all these years but remains a guilty pleasure.
