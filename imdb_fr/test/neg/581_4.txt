"May contain spoilers" Unfortunately, the latest film by Lou Costellos has the distinction of being slightly better than the latest film by Abbott & Costello together with "Dance With Me Henry". This movie is not quite terrible, it's a fun career miss. Dorothy Provine is nice to watch and makes the film a bit bearable. You can not blame Lou Costello for that, because a big studio published it, which meant that someone had to give him the "green light". In my opinion, Lou Costello overcame problems with his son's loss a few years earlier and unjustified attacks by the IRS. If you look at the last 3-4 Abbott & Costello movies, you will notice that the magic is gone. Watch "Dance With Me Henry", this is a painful film to watch.
