This is a pale imitation of the Die Hard franchise that fears. The low ambitions of the film are clearly visible when the terrorists hold the vice president hostage and he has to call the White House to ask them to transfer money. In most films of this kind, the president is kidnapped or held hostage because he is after all the most powerful person in the country with his finger on the nuclear button, and so on. Would most Americans really be worried if Dick Cheney had been kidnapped? The honest answer is probably not. Why would the terrorists choose a Stanley Cup final to carry out their operation and why, despite the many explosions that surround them, the audience in the hockey stadium is unaware of the situation, are unanswered questions. Let's say this movie is really hokey, no hockey. Those who liked the film and found it exciting should have a life.
