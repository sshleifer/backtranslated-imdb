The scenes of pet consumption (geek) were not as bad as you might think. After watching Mondo Cane and Mondo Magic, these scenes are average. The worst thing was when the guy ate the head of the mouse. But they were so fast and small that they did not bother me. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, the movie was really interesting. I always like to hear stupid voiceovers. They never look like what you think the actor / actress would look like in real life. I liked the bright colors worn by the princesses. The plans of strange insects were also cool. The youngest princess looked REALLY young, almost 14 years old or something. The fight scenes were not as long and as boring as most fight scenes, so that was fine. <br /> <br /> 3/10.
