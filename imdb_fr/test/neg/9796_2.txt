Some "bad" movies are quite nice (like Norman J.Warren's Inseminoid), others "bad" are just bad (like Kent Bateman's Headless Eyes), but "bad" movies that try to make post-modernism to be knowingly wrong should always be approached with extreme caution. Many people think that Troma's Terror Firmer is a tasteless masterpiece, for example, but I suppose anyone over 19 will ignore it as a worthless moron. Then there is John Carpenter's Dark Star. Yes, it's quaint, and certainly a product of its time, but as a film, it's only two notches above nothing. This British budget-free comedy-horror release seeks to achieve a satirical tone, with its endless references to its minimal flash movies (including Psychomania, Horror Hospital and just about anything from Pete Walker), but because of the lamentable performances of the second actors on television (the main lady looks like Amy Winehouse), a scenario that seems to have been written on the back of a beermat peeled by two boys, without understanding the functioning of the movie comedy, according to Dean Friedman ( intentionally?) The elevator-rock soundtrack and production values ​​never exceed mediocrity, the end result is a movie that can only be ridiculed, rather than WITH. If your idea of ​​"whoopee" is anthropomorphic crudités, Chinese take-away dishes called Fu King and references to long-forgotten TV commercials, you'll appreciate this one, but do not expect too much.
