Dear readers, <br /> <br /> In my film studies, I find that every time Michael Bay makes a film, people hate and hate him, but they will still see him and that brings in about $ 100 million. Why? Because Michael Bay is one of the top five directors of all time. Along with Ridley Scott, Spielberg, Kubrick and Miyazaki, Michael Bay has established himself as the best action / adventure director in Hollywood. This is proven with his most filmed film, Armageddon. <br /> <br /> A Texas-sized asteroid rushes onto the planet and the only way for NASA to think of destroying it is to land a team the asteroid, break through, drop a nuclear warhead inside then blow up the asteroid. Only one person is qualified enough to do it: Bruce Willis. Willis plays Harry Stamper, a hardened and tempered oil driller who tries to keep together what is left of his family. Her daughter Grace (Liv Tyler) has an affair with her best driller AJ (Ben Affleck). Hired by Dan Truman (Billy Bob Thornton), NASA's Chief Stamper, and his team of veteran drouetters train to become astronauts and save the world. <br /> <br /> Armageddon is a film in two parts. First there are the fun places where we meet the gang and the delirium that abounds. Then they enter the space and all the comedy is sucked out of the window and replaced by stunning special effects, cool music and serious acting. Murphy's law goes crazy in the second part, which means that anything that can go wrong reaches him, increasing the tension of the film to exceptional levels. <br /> <br /> With a cast and a friendly crew (Michael Bay as director, Jerry Bruckheimer and Gale Anne Hurd as producers, and JJ Abrams as screenwriter.), tons of special effects , great humor, great music, as well as an intro by Mr. Ben-Hur himself, Charlton Heston, Armageddon It tears. <br /> <br /> Signed, The Constant DVD collector, Matt Macleod <br /> <br /> Parental Warnings: This film is not meant for children. The F bomb is used repeatedly and many other big words are also used. In addition, there is a striptease scene and the extremely intense second part may be too difficult for a child to handle.
