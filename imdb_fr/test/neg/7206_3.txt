OK, I gave a three a three! He deserves only one star without asking questions. <br /> <br /> If you look at the film seriously and consider it a legitimate B-Horror film, you will get a star. But I think it's obvious in the first few minutes of the movie that we're dealing with a piece of shit. <br /> <br /> With this movie, my boyfriend and I were looking at it with the ability to turn it off and put it on something more "Hollywood" but instead, we just decided to rip all this movie, from beginning to end. We laughed so many times that it was almost if I was watching a comedy. <br /> <br /> The acting is terrible ..... The effects and death sequences are so bad .... The complete story of the shit .. ... <br /> < But the fact that they are trying to make a serious horror movie ... without a price! <br /> <br /> The most memorable part for me is when two of the characters enter the room a supposed "dark basement" that is clearly lit, and they claim not to be able to bump into the bones that were hanging from the bahahahaha ceiling just terrible ..... <br /> <br /> So, if you want to laugh how bad this movie is, with the fact that it was shot in 2004 only to see this movie ... . <br /> <br /> Wait, why am I writing so much? no one knows about this movie ... I doubt that anyone even reads this hahahaha.
