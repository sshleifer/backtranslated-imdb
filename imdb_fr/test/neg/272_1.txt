Like most people, I can not wait to see the rest of this ocean 11, but it really stinks, I must say. It stinks because there is simply no good scenario, it was just cheap. I hope the producers will donate all the money this film has made (or will bring) to the victims of the Asian tsunami so that this film has at least a good reason to exist. It's so bad that I can not even write a comment worthy of the name but ... I always advise the creators of this thing to do "Ocean's 13". Ocean's 13 will be about the same thieves who are trying to steal a well-hidden scenario somewhere in Hollywood. The 13th member will be a foreign screenwriter (maybe Russian) who knows all the tricks to write a copy of this scenario well hidden, in order to replace the original they will have to fly. Or, they must find at least 13 people to write a decent scenario for a movie in which Julia Roberts is playing herself but also all the other star members of Ocean's films. 13 people because that's the lucky number of Andy Garcia's character.
