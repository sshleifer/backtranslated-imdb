First of all, I would like to apologize for my "1" rating ... The only reason I give this movie a high score is that I can not search the entire negatives. All the ideas "This is a parody" apart, and although I have certainly tried to give it all the attention it deserves, have left me some idea, namely; "It may be the worst movie of all time." Whatever the level and the plausible quantification of qualitative measures ... Seriously, I tried, I'm like in any independent video distribution film born for worship as the next buff, but seriously, this movie was sprinkled with rhinoceros balls ... <br /> <br /> Honestly, if I had directed this "film", I would have seen it as a legitimate cause of suicide.
