When moviegoers hear that two villains / popular characters are going to fight, they rush to theaters to see the end of the fight. There is Freddy against Jason, in which two very popular horror icons are trying to kill each other. And, more like that, there is Godzilla vs. (Insert the name here). But the very generic Komodo vs. Python is just a horrible title, and a premise is even worse. Obviously, the film is an image of D-list, but, at least, come up with a more convincing name, perhaps something that could make the unsuspecting viewer look at it. With a name like this, you know where you are coming from. <br /> <br /> A group of military men and women, including a sexy female scientist in her early twenties, is left for death by the army an island inhabited by a giant komodo dragon. As long as they can get out of the island and the boat, everything will be fine, but ... no ... there is a giant python that keeps the ocean and the path that separates it. Let's hope that all these guys manage to get out of the island and that the python and the komodo do not throw themselves against each other in a kind of horrible battle of special effects. <br /> <br /> In reality, this film is bad in almost every case. way. The acting is pretty bad, or maybe the special effects are so nerdy, that the acting is incredible, because no one believes that these people are in danger with creatures that seem to have been created on a computer of the early 90s. Nevertheless, this film is actually quite funny. The creatures look so clumsy and the actors really pretend to be in danger. <br /> <br /> I would like to say that this film is a pile of sh * smoking! * ... but I can not. This film rated PG-13 disappears completely. Whenever a word curse comes, a parrot sound will beep. Even words that can be said on the network television. It's cheap to say they have words, and no less with a parrot. Finally, these parrot noises came to me and I could not help but laugh at the incompetence. <br /> <br /> This film is bad, from the stupid beginning to the ridiculous ending of Night of the Living Dead, but it's also a little funny. As a horror movie, it fails miserably, as an action movie, a little less, but still pretty bad, and as a comedy, it shines. <br /> <br /> My note: * on ****. 95 minutes PG-13 for violence and Squawk.
