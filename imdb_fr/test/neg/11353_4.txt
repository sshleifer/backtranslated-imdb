"Mararía" really disappointed me. I can not think of it as a bad movie, but the development seemed too hasty and implausible to evoke emotions. Dr. Fermín displays an unprecedented bizarre behavior, inspired by a passion that one can not really understand from where he was born. I mean, how many times has he ever had a conversation with Mararía ?? Maybe once? In addition, Mararía never seemed to be a real character, but rather a stereotype of a film that simply had to appear in the film (... or was another title needed?). Some of the best actors come from a role that does not really matter in history, that of Marcial, this sub-intelligent but humble drunkard. Of course, the landscape, the cultural details of the Canary Islands and other moments of "wow" were interesting, but the film lacked a documentary (in case it was his true intention), and especially a drama solid.
