This film tells the story of John Belushi, based on his biography "Wired", written by Bob Woodward. All the film is narrated in flashback in no chronological order, where after the death of John Belushi, we see an angel accompany Belushi for a few points. Michael Chicklis in the character of John Belushi is quite credible, but totally devoid of the devastating force of Belushi, and his piece remains a pale animation.The director, in addition, does not succeed in giving the story continuously, that for who does not know the book is very confused. But the worst is that they introduced Bob Woodward who spoke with Belushi before his death. For these negatives, the film is just an attempt to tell the story of John Belushi's controversial story. My rate is 4.
