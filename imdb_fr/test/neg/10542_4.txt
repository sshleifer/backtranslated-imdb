Oh dear! What can I say about Half Past Dead? I was really disappointed. I thought .... A movie by Steven Seagal! Cool! We will see him kicking people, knocking them over and breaking them. We could even get to see him fight with someone! Excellent! <br /> <br /> However, I was treated to a brutal awakening. This film can be summarized as follows: <br /> <br /> Take an episode of the A-Team, remove the adorable and naughty characters such as Murdoch, Hannibal, Mr T and Face. Then ask a screenwriter / director to write a screenplay, even of which Ed Wood would be ashamed and who is too fond of The Matrix and John Woo movies for his own good. Add to that a group of people with very bad acting skills who do not have real names. Finally, add a main star that collapses around the belly and seems to no longer be able to do its own stunts. <br /> <br /> The result? Half Past Dead. An action movie so ridiculous that it made me smile at least. The holes in the plot are incredibly large, for example, prisoners who, when the prison is invaded, fight against the invaders rather than trying to escape. Or how about the prison itself, which has an arsenal of heavy machine guns and rocket propelled grenade launchers? You also have a helicopter (looking like a Huey) with a kind of video gaming machine mounted in the nose. <br /> <br /> Then there is Seagal himself. I like the guy. He can fight. He is even spiritual in a way that Jean-Claude Van Damme will never be. But throughout the film, I have always hoped for an exceptional fight scene. Never happened. Instead, we forced many people to shoot with guns without touching a hell. I mean, when someone runs down a narrow hallway and you shoot him a machine gun, there are not many places where bullets can go other than in the hallway and in the target. Yet, they miss? Even team A would crack this stupidity. And then, when there is a particular physical problem, we are entitled to a shabby matrix scam, without the benefit of bullet-time. People are kicked in the air and various other ridiculous acrobatic absurdities. <br /> <br /> C'mon Steven, you're better than that. Your career can not be completed. Say that's not the case! <br /> <br /> It's instantly forgettable (except that I force myself to remember for the purposes of this review) and if you look at it, try to find it amusing in an A-Genre team way . But I doubt that this figure prominently on the list "to watch". For justice it is not. More like Out to Lunch.
