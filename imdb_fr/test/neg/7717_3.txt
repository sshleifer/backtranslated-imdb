So lame that it's not even funny. A zombie infection settles on a small university campus and a government squad composed of secret agents supports a couple of scientists sent to search for the origin of the epidemic. Picking up zombie DNA is not easy. Once bitten, you are one of them. The entire university was completely infected by the undead amoks. <br /> <br /> This suite does not even buy the terrible original house OF THE DEAD (2003). A senseless entertainment is however accomplished. Some glimpses of female nudity added to a volley of explosive heads and heads should delight all zombies. Members of the cast: Emmanuelle Vaugier, Victoria Pratt, Ed Quinn, Sid Haig and Nadine Velazquez. The word "F" contains a script without imagination.
