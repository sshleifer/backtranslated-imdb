Code 46 is one of those scifi movies where the government controls the people you are allowed to love and will punish you if you are trying to procreate with the wrong person. The haves and have-nots live in completely separate territories, the powers in place can erase your memories, and so on. We have seen this before, but it's ok, no movie is 100% original. This kind of premise is always fun to contemplate. Unfortunately, imagining such a future is more interesting than looking at Code 46. The characters are boring and rarely say anything interesting. Maybe it's a comment on a dehumanized future, but it's always boring to watch. It's slow. <br /> <br /> Sometimes the images are beautiful, but usually (coupled with its "evocative" soundtrack), they look like an advertisement for a glorified scent. Code 46 also sometimes uses the kind of television camera work that I find annoying. You know, two characters are arguing as the camera floats naively on one side. Two seconds later, he floats on the other side in a vain attempt to hold your attention. <br /> <br /> My friends liked this movie. If they tried to make me look again, I probably would not do it unless they agreed to pay me $ 50.
