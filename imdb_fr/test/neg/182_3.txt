The young and honest insurance agent Ronald Reagan (like Eric Gregg) is optimistic, but poor. His wife, who prepares Sheila Bromley (as Nona Gregg), longs for the good things in life. Describing herself as "not lightened with tons of righteousness," Mrs. Bromley begins to spend more than Reagan earns. Bromley gets the best things in life, but the couple is in debt. Bromley is a fun shrew. <br /> <br /> The handsome Reagan attracts other women, like Gloria Blondell, a marshmallow employee (as Patricia Carmody); but, he does not let go. To pay the bills, Bromley gets tangled in the racket of insurance fraud - which helps her husband get fired. Reagan, unemployed, seems to be tempted into a life of crime - will he stay right in the legs or become deceitful? Clinton Rosemond has an uncomfortable "broken arm" scene. <br /> <br /> *** Accidents will happen (1938) William Clemens ~ Ronald Reagan, Sheila Bromley and Gloria Blondell
