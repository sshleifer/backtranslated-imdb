Saying beyond belief. Obviously, it takes place on the Isle of Man, posing as the United States - very badly - and teeming with fashionable British actors who can not do the American accent. A monster that looks like a non-articulated promotional cutout for Alien in a movie store, with the most inflexible feet ever seen. Girls in the shower, undressing, cat fights, blah, blah, blah. You had the idea. Do not look at him, flee, hide, AVOID.
