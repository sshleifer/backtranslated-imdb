Oh man. Where should I start on this piece of slime? This is one of the few high-budget films on my list that I thought was good for rating 1, and not for production values, which are quite high. This film has absolutely no respect for the story of the Bible and treats the whole story as a laughable fantasy. I could not recommend it to anyone except to see how low our society was ... <br /> <br /> For the first time, Noah was absolutely no friend of Lot. Anyone reading Genesis could tell you that Abram was the person they thought of. The writers were just trying to complete the story with the entire secondary plot of Sodom / Gommorah, and that sounds out of place because it is. Noah is treated like an idiot prude ("You were kissing! You were kissing!") But at least it's a step forward from the hilarious act of Voight at Anaconda. <br /> <br /> However, these offenses are nothing compared to the heretical treatment of God in this film. God is described as a mean and incomprehensible being who changes his mind at the slightest whim. ("I am an eternal perfect, but I can be wrong") What? Where do they come from? That kind of God ... no one should ever pay attention, let alone worship, praise or love. What the director says in this, I do not pretend to know. I just know that responsible treatment of Noah's ark should not be such an easy way out. Shame on these people.
