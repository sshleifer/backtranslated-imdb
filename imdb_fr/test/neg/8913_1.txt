I like to watch movies steven seagal not because of the action of the big holes of the plot but just because it makes me laugh <br /> <br /> oh it makes me laugh so much that this movie does not has absolutely no point and is ridiculous compared to that Pearl Harbor Rock movie !!! and Ben affleck does not need any drama school just to give the impression that it's serious <br /> <br /> first of all, there are so many gaffes and bad actors, that does not matter that getting worse, as when Steven is trying to get out of jail a helicopter lands at the beginning of the security instruction and led them when they flew away suddenly, a guard started shooting <br /> <br /> or when he killed this guy in the car, he tracked them both and went away I do not see oil on the ground behind him. steven notices that there is oil without even looking at betrayal throws a lighter and that the car explodes <br /> <br /> and that there are many other blunders that Steven uses as basic action points a Rifle on him, he catches her and shoots him totally! as if a gangster let him do it. <br /> <br /> the acting game is also very bad on the scene of the fight in the prison, you can clearly see that Steven is waiting to get into the action just rewind it a few times and you notice the bad game actor <br /> <br /> it makes me laugh, I hope that one day the cinema will take place here in Holland, so I'll go there with as many friends as possible, just for laugh at myself until you die
