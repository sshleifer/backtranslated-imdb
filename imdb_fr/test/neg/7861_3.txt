During the 1990s, several attempts were made to revive the series of ancient Matsumoto. Yoshinobu Nishizaki tried to revive the old Yamato saga in the form of a ridiculously bad "Yamato 2520", which was completely abandoned after only two episodes. Captain Harlock suffered a confusing and useless "saga of Harlock", while the Galaxy Express 999 was the victim of this stitched movie story in his name. <br /> <br /> If you've seen "Queen Millennia", you'll remember it was a wonderful film in its own way. Maetel Legend tries to give a follow-up to this chapter already concluded, while finding the way to suck it. <br /> <br /> This film takes up all the unpleasant aspects of a generic sci-fi film based on pulp and melodrama mixing rhythmic rhythm, and to add an insult to injury, throws in some of the most renowned in the world of Matsumoto. <br /> <br /> The only redeeming aspect of this film is a good work of art, but the rest is incredibly bad that it can not save this film from total loss. <br /> <br /> If you enjoyed Queen Millennia or Galaxy Express, do yourself a favor and skip this movie. You will thank me.
