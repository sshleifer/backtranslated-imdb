I never fell asleep during a movie. Never. This film did the impossible. <br /> <br /> While many people claim the superiority of Japanese horror movies over their American counterparts, this film is a lesson in overabundance. As in, the movie was too long of 30 minutes. It would have helped if the movie had a little more movement in the plot and the work of the camera, but instead, we had only awkward silences and a lot of slow movements. The acting was absolutely dreadful, close to the levels of student movies while everyone had trouble adding something called a storyline. Did these people even get instructions? Were they persuaded to be boring and boring? Either the theory would not surprise me. <br /> <br /> What was even worse was the scary makeup involved with the creatures on the other side. Anyway, they are all stinky. Do not watch this movie. That's all I can say (unless you're an insomniac).
