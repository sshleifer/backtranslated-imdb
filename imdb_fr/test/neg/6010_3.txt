For producer David O. Selznick, no director would ever do it. Therefore, in "A farewell to arms" (1957), we have two ?? Charles Vidor and John Huston. Although the two men have been quite accomplished, none of them could give pride to this disastrous remake of the magnificent opus Hemmingway. Hemmingway in general has never translated well from a book on screen. But under the zeal of Selznick to turn it into his next "Gone With The Wind", this tour is both painful and exhaustive. At this point in Selznick's career, he was no longer the titan who could take the "box office poison" and turn it into Gone With The Wind. Tired, frail, without her studio, and with the imminent feeling that her second marriage with Jennifer Jones might have been a mistake, Selznick entrusted Fox Studios with the creative reign of this film. but he kept enough of himself to become a damn nuisance on the set. <br /> <br /> We are now or should be aware of the tragic love story of a nurse, Catharine Barkley (Jennifer Jones) and her soldier hero, Lieutenant Frederick Henry (Rock Hudson ). Their passion is supposed to serve as a stabilizing force to what is essentially a war correspondent tale with romanticism to say the least. But the chemistry between Hudson and Jones is both turquoise and dull. In the final reel, Jones's facial writhing during delivery is so bad that I am surprised to see that none of the filmmakers chose to cut them off the general release. Part of the problem with Jones is that at thirty-eight, she is far too wise to play Catharine with optimism with great conviction. Yet older actresses have often been able to make the age differences disappear to the audience. Not so with Jones. We realize with sadness that it does not match the bill, whether as a filmmaker or as a year invested on the planet. The laconic charm of Hudson is desperately disconnected from the stoicism of a broken-hearted army soldier whose head remains strong. The support troop is peppered with personalities such as Vittorio De Sica and Mercedes McCambridge, but these are bits of lost nonsense that do not reflect the formidable talent of one or the other actor and are better put highlighted elsewhere in their shooting guns. > <br /> The anamorphic picture element of "Farewell to Arms" looks pretty good, but there is just a little too much grain of film present in some scenes for the taste of this critic. Overall, the colors are subtle and faded, although they are balanced in accordance with the DeLuxe color treatment used at this time. Some discoloration is obvious. The flesh tones do not seem very natural. The contrast levels are a bit low. Blacks are generally strong. The whites are almost clean. There is not much to recommend his film. It's basically a wordy picture with gunshots in the background. There are no extras.
