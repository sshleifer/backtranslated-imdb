Supercraptastic slasher rate, which seems too long at 80 minutes. Years ago, a group of "gypsies" who lived in the caves of a mountain were burned in a forest fire. Years later, campers disappear from the fire zone. Of course, a group of excited kids are heading to this area for a camping trip. Despite a grim welcome from the ranger (Jackson Bostwick), the kids are climbing the mountain anyway. Shortly after, children begin to get caught by the monster, which remains invisible until the very end of the film, probably because the makeup was so embarrassing. No surprises to be told: they are killed in the exact order that the formula of these films dictates, leaving the "final girl" to fend for herself, although in a refreshing denouement, the final girl finds herself imprisoned and impregnated by the monster . <br /> <br /> The story itself could not stand the weight of the feature film, so it was complemented by seemingly endless shots of wildlife and insects, which obviously were shot for another film and inserted here randomly as a way to make the movie long enough for a video output. On the positive side, the images of wildlife is rather pleasant. Bostwick also talks with a baby deer, a decent death-climbing sequence, OK Gore, and Grand Jackie Coogan in his last role in the movie, as a local sheriff. It's far from Charlie Chaplin, but it was still nice to see him. This is for slasher finalists only.
