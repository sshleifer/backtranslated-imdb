This film is one of the worst I've ever seen, it did not leave a single cliche that one can imagine about a so-called thriller in Hollywood. The protagonist is a loving father and a private investigator who has engaged in a special task: to determine if a suspicious movie is likely real. <br /> <br /> Certainly, he gets involved in increasingly deep and stained pornoshops (led by Mexicans) and sex theaters are his area of ​​investigation as he searches for the murderers of the woman in the movie "snuff". Assisted by a "smart" employee (he read a book) of sexshop, he is catching up with a murderous slavery film producer and his own personal movie makers ... ... and you wait what? They are described as mere evil, no need for explanations, backgrounds, history: they are the wicked, and he is the purifier. Boom. Killer of killers. End of the movie. Is it so bad? Yes, I'm afraid. <br /> <br /> Ironically, "machine" (the mega-pervert who murdered) even points out his ridiculous character: In the last scene, our hero forces the "machine" to remove his leather mask (yes, well sure, he wears one) and recognizes that "machine" looks like an ordinary guy from the street 08/15. Then "machine" says: "blah, I'm not a monster, my parents never abused me, I had a good childhood, I love doing what I do!" <br /> <br /> I love killing people. Yes, of course, "everyone loves to kill people" (Bender). It's not just the total lack of character that has made this movie so boring, it's also ugliness "I have to kill these people" - an attitude that makes you sick. In one scene, our hero tied up one of the killers and tried to shoot him ... but he can not. So, what is he doing? He calls the mother of the deceased woman, tells her that her child is killed and asks her if she loved her child so much that she wants to see the dead murderers. The mother is crying yes, she would love her child, he goes back to see the killer and kills him. <br /> <br /> To come to the point: this film breathes the vicious air of supporters of lynchmob (certainly the police play no role), moralizes in a ridiculous form pornography, does not take his characters seriously and was wasting time with a stupid plot. The only good thing about this movie is probably that it does not try to pseudo-psycho-analyze ... even if it would be too much of a plot. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time with that. <Br /> <br />
