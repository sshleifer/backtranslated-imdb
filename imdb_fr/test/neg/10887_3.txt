SPOILER Wolfcreek meets the chainsaw massacre in Texas ... If you've seen them, do not waste your time with this one. A typical slasher movie, nothing new here apart from SPOILER's "visions", which add fluff to an already weak plot. I would recommend this movie if you have absolutely nothing to watch and either see it or staring at a bare wall for an hour and a half. The only semi-interesting part of SPOILER is when the girl starts drinking in the empty sheriff's office, I say it's interesting because at least she used that liquor instead of using it stereotypical way to light a fire to kill the villain, went this road towards the end. Overall, lame, bad and not worth the effort.
