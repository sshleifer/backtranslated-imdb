This film was a mess. There was nothing really going on for that. Maybie Bobbie Phillips was the only character likely to seduce and she was not worth it. <br /> <br /> The plot is classic, you have to double the double-cruiser. With a little too much double crosses to make sense. Sometimes it means that it "lets you guess", in which case it makes you wait. In the end, I just wanted everyone to be thrown in jail or shot.
