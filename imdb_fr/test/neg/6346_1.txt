I'm not sure who should be blamed for this debacle - in fact, the acting is not so bad and the story is not as bad as some of the Disney movies have been. The story itself is shallow and undeveloped, but that's not surprising in a movie of this type. The acting is more than a bit two-dimensional, but I give the credit to the actors for having managed to do anything with the material with which they had to work. base a story on the theory that they created a "perfect" pop star, then choose an actress who can not sing to save her life. If the girl can not sing, ask someone to record the music! <br /> <br /> This actress is a TERRIBLE singer - she was so flat that she usually sang in a totally different tone!
