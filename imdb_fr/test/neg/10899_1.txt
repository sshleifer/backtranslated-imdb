If you just want gore and nothing but gore and torture, you're in the right movie. If you want at least a net of good acting, logic, history, consistency or even a good guy end, go elsewhere. <br /> <br /> I could not help but think in myself: "Jeeeez, are these people mentally challenged?" For example, after being pursued and seeing others mutilated, the main actress meets a policeman and tells his story to the policeman with tears and all, and told him about the psychopath driving in a yellow truck. The yellow truck stops and the officer approaches him, speaks to the guy and the truck starts without problem. The actress goes out and says why you did not stop him. And then the truck runs on the police officer ... after being hit, the truck stops on the road about 20 feet from the road while the actress tries to drag the policeman but it is too heavy. (At the time) At this point, the truck moves back and passes twice on the leg of the police. The truck then leaves. Why did not the actress get the rifle? (After that, she fired twice in the policeman's head because the psychopath was about to burn him alive) Once in the mouth, who did not kill him (Duuuumb) and twice to finish the job. * Rolling her eyes * Just after that, she turns away to escape the bathroom that would explode and when she climbs near the roof, she turns around and the policeman is no longer there ... OK ... <br /> <br /> <br /> Another example, the main actress meets a woman trapped in the bathroom, she spits like a gallon of blood on the floor, covering about 1/3 of the room. (Probably more) After the main actress has gone to get a towel, she comes back and everything is gone. : / They do not explain why everyone continues to disappear either. Dumb Dumb Dumb. <br /> <br /> I love horror / thriller / gore movies, but this one was way too silly. I lost brain cells by watching this dribble and you should not be too much.
