As if the world needed another Seagal movie. Add to that a group of actors who, well ... are not really actors, a band of heavy metal music to compliment the rap and of course, a hot and crazy girl in leather without hips, and we prevent ourselves to have a budget of half. . Why, oh why do people sabotage themselves by participating in such films? <br /> <br /> The FBI captures two friends and sends them to "New Alcatraz", where the first inmate to be executed has unexpected guests. <Br /> <br /> A top-notch actor, especially in tragedy scenes for the good guys. Seriously, the director has tried and made the best possible film for the film. Either he goes to the well too often, and HALF PAST DEAD gets bored too soon. What more can you do when inmates talk while the hostages continually ask what motivates the main villain? A stupid action movie that equals little, if not "a-light".
