This movie was a total nonsense. I was sitting watching what was absolutely furious that it was funded. They certainly spent all their budget in special effects rather than screenwriter and director AND some actors. <br /> <br /> First, the acting game was bland and nil. The story was not narrative enough for the audience. Rather than being from the point of view of the people in the face of the storm, the government and army representatives explained the story, which is really not a way to communicate with them, most of them we hate politicians anyway. The writer tried to add a human element to the unrealistic characters by adding the little subplot on the father and the son, which completely failed. <br /> <br /> As for the staging, oh my god, his techniques create tension and discomfort are repetitive and on top. The movements of the camera accelerated, then the sudden flash stopped on a character's face when something horrible was happening was pathetic. <br /> <br /> The only reason I looked at it until the end was to see the special effect. Which is a bad thing because the special effects should not make the film, but only amplify the story and experience. There was no story. <br /> <br /> I really would not want to look at this story, a total dirt and embarrassment for the British film industry.
