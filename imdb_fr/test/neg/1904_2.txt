If you need a clue as to whether Playmaker is decent or not, watch his star actor, Colin Firth, who describes it in an interview as "an absolute waste - I sincerely hope no one will ever see it". <br /> The script and the plot are ridiculous, the female role is not convincing. The only thing worth it is Colin Firth, and he seems a little embarrassed. <br /> <br /> For fans of Firth only - the shower scene alone is worth the $ 3.99 you may need to pay, if you find a video cutter as I did . <br /> <br /> I'm happy for Mr. Firth that his days of projects like this one are over!
