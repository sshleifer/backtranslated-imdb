This is the first time I feel the need to comment on IMDb, write a kind of criticism and, as often happens, it's not because of a really great movie, but really appalling. <br /> <br /> Take the style of storytelling that the youngest could relate to the video game series Max Payne, a cast of almost unknown (which is not a bad thing in itself), mediocre dialogues , dark scenes but not enough, and make a film of that. Do not worry about the bad acting, the length (much too long), the lack of immersion (the main character must be one of the least interesting I've seen in a long time - he would not care if he dies) or the often ridiculous solutions they find to certain problems in which the main character is found. <br /> <br /> I would not have written anything without another criticism, giving it 10 stars. I gave four, but maybe three is closer to how I feel. Not only do I not want to see him again, but the mere thought of doing so puts me dangerously close to wanting to kill me. Oh, and a so-called film noir is nothing without a good soundtrack - not the case here. The end song sounds like it's better suited to a Western movie. <br /> <br /> It's not romance, it's not action, it's not black, it's not good. That would be my opinion if there was not a minimum of 10 lines.
