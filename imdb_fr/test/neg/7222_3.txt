Riggs and Murtough are back but the magic of the first film has disintegrated. The scenario is just horrible! I mean really, the South African diplomats who smuggle the mythical Krugerrands into the United States. It's painful! And the accents are absolutely abominable! Nobody can get a South African Afrikaans accent? Or will we ever hear the British or the Americans make them sound like drunk Dutchmen? Tim Robbins in Catch A Fire was the only one to get the Afrikaans accent. Another thing I do not like in this movie is when Danny Glover so naively describes an Afrikaans accent as being shit! I mean what a slap to the Afrikaans. There is also enough hypocrisy in this movie to make me vomit. I mean, the character of Mel Gibson is like against diplomats, but he sleeps with his typical P.A. Do not waste your time watching this film devoid of research. If you want to see a film that does not completely insult a cultural group, rent Die Hard 2.
