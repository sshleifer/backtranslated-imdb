Dae-su is fed and cared for by unknown captors but is never allowed out of the room, Dae-su begins to practice revenge after his release, which he intends to do by removing masonry cement with chopsticks. However, before Dae-su has finished, he is gassed and rendered unconscious, when he wakes up, Dae-su is free on the roof of a large, fully equipped, dressed building. Dae-su immediately tries to find out who imprisoned him, after meeting the pretty Mido (Hye-jeong Kang), both fell in love and together with his help, Dae-su finally finds what he's looking for, but the truth is true. a price ... <br /> <br /> This South Korean production was co-written and directed by Chan-wook Park and garnered a great deal of complimentary reviews (the kind that distributors can choose to give quotes and paste them to the plaster). video box) & even won the Grand Jury Prize in Cannes while he was also nominated for the Golden Palm, so is Oldboy a real classic? Well, not for me that's not the case, because I do not understand why we love him so much and I would go so far as to say that I hated him quite well except for one or two isolated moments. For starters, I could not go into the story at all, I just did not like it because I thought it was slow and boring & while many people would like to believe that Oldboy has the best shocking twist I have never seen. rather simple and not very well executed either. The end in which Dae-su travels to the New Zealand Alps to be hypnotized is almost as good as if the manufacturers wanted some sort of happy ending. After almost two hours, I almost fell asleep. I was so bored that the violence was under control and it was the thought of what was happening that I imagine most people have a problem rather than what is actually shown. In fact, Oldboy has a very low body count of about seven people and a moderate sex scene, it's really not very graphic nor memorable. I'm not sensitive to any of the characters and even if I accept, Oldboy has a concept and premise that can not be delivered. It's a movie I will never understand why so many people seem to like. <br /> <br /> Based on a Japanese manga of the same name, Oldboy, the film looks good, there are one or two beautiful visual moments here, although everyone marvels of the fight in the corridor that takes place in one continuous shot, but I was not very impressed and found the choreography of the fight quite dull. . The gore violence on the screen is very little, Dae-su eats a live octopus, which is apparently quite normal in Korea anyway, there are scenes of fighting, a cut hand, teeth are torn off and there is some blood on the ball. the end. <br /> <br /> The budget was supposed to be around $ 4,000,000, which is a fair bit, filmed in South Korea and New Zealand. The acting game looks ok, but it's hard to tell when the actors are speaking a different language. <br /> <br /> Oldboy is a film for which I found an absolute chore, that I do not deal with subtitled or foreign films. paying attention to the plot while I followed the thing to perfection, but I did not like anything at all and it was as simple and straightforward as that. Apparently, the second in the revenge trilogy of director Choi-wook Park, which also includes Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance (2002) & Lady Vengeance (2005).
