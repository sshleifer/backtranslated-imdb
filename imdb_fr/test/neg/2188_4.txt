The film is fine. Which means I do not regret watching it! I found acting purely and most stupid dialogues ("oh no, that was my grandmother's Bible!"). It's a kind of bad remake of a U-turn. A man arrives in a desert city out of nowhere, meets the wrong people and falls in love with the bad woman. And out of the way is involved in something, he thought he could leave behind him. The movie is pretty predictable and there is really nothing new. When it's over, you will not really care. Most characters are stereotypes, especially Brian Austin Green !! All in all, it's just another US movie, but very entertaining Wednesday night, boring. IMDb Rating: 4/10
