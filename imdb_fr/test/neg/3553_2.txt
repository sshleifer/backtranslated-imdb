I had high hopes for this one after reading the previous reviews, but it was so slow and the plot so basic that I wondered if I had read the bad reviews. <br /> <br /> Please, a boy meets a girl next door, at age 11, and both aspire to love and become basketball legends. Separate yourself, but watch everyone's progress. Guess what! Both get scholarships for the same university and become lovers again until her father is caught playing with a young woman. Our young hero unable to cope has lost focus from the courts, but some decide to go to vocational school and drop out of school, and guess what the Lakers are capturing. Discharge the heroine because she was not there for him during this emotional time. So for 5 years, they follow their own path. She returns from Spain after losing the taste of the game and our hero gets married in two weeks. Mom tells her that she should fight for her love, so she professes her love and challenges him in a basketball shootout. He wins he gets married she wins he loves her. Well, he won but decides to send another girl for our daughter. The End makes her play basketball and has baby homework. Sorry 2 is my best score. My partner, she scored 0 for a soapy story for those who read Mills and Boon
