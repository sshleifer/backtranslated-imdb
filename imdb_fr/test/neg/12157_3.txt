I was waiting for this movie for a moment. On the first day of the air in Turkey, I watched it. It was totally a disappointment for me. I planned to watch a historical film, but the screen was a fiction. First, the main character of the movie Cengiz Han, the great conquest has been portrayed as a gentle, calm, even a loser. You can not feel the power in the movie. Historically, the war machine he created has been conquered - better known all over the world. To do this, Cengiz first brings together the Asian tribes. However, in the film, this loser is in a scene a poor man and, in the second, he commands armies. The war scenes were incredibly week long. In the final battle, the Mongolian rider used double swords on his sides and cut off the enemy. :) As a result, my friends and I are just laughing at these scenes. Mongolian Army means Mongolian archery jumper. You can not see that in the movie. Another bad thing was the use of fantastic elements in the movie. I do not want to enter the scenes that have described Cengiz as a prophet. We can say that in the integrity of the film, it is acceptable. However, the scenes where the old monk saw the future and goes to find Cengiz Khan's wife after Cengiz entrusted him with a mission is really funny. When the monk died in the desert, Cengiz's wife felt the death and she found the corpse on the mainland. We are talking about Asia ?? Once again we laughed. There is much more to say but, I do not think this film has the value to speak more.
