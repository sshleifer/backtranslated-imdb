Some aspects of this production are good, such as the performances of Angela Lansbury, George Hearn, Cris Groenendaal and Sal Mistretta. But am I the only one to be distracted by the horrible interpretation of Betsy Joslyn as Johanna? She is terrible! She skips the songs with her strident and exaggerated voice in a role she clearly does not understand. I also think that the chorus is not up to par. They drag the tempo and make the worst facial expressions. Overall, I think this production is acceptable, but Sweeney Todd can be a lot more if it's done correctly. This production does not reach the level required by this material. The version in concert with George Hearn and Patti LuPone is much better.
