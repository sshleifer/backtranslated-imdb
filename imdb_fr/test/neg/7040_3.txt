Two escaped convicts come out of the woods and shoot two campers in the head. This is the first scene, and it made me wince, fearing what was in store. But at the end of the first half hour, I was overwhelmed by the flow of images. Not because I cared less about the characters, but because I'm shocked to see how bad the film is and curious to see how it can flow. <br /> <br /> Frank (Remar) and Red (Woolvett) are ex-inmates. After murdering the two innocent campers, they crisscross the woods and make their way through the isolated cabin of Dean Stockwell and his two sons, lawyer Keith and homosexual Behr. Escapees first claim that their car is out of order and that they need to use the phone, but they are gradually revealing their identity. <br /> <br /> Well, that sounds like a familiar territory so far. "Desperate Hours" or "Funny Games" maybe. But, hold on, the gay son disagrees with both. It seems that Stockwell, after discovering his son in flagrante delicto with another man by the name of Billy, had him fired up and down. Billy is dead and Behr now accuses his father of death. And, indeed, Dad is a little Neanderthal with regard to paraphilias, despite the fact that he was found cohabiting with a secretary. <br /> <br /> Behr, afflicted with grief, has just searched and searched, another who had known Billy, someone with whom he could share his despair. It turned out to be one of the escapees, and Behr is now determined to see them free. <br /> <br /> All this is wrong then. People are talking. They speak and speak. They speak continually. And NOT two crazy killers who can not wait to put one between their eyes. No - the dialogue looks like this: "You were so afraid of something in you that you even chased your own SOUND." It's Behr, the young gay guy who talks to Stockwell. It's as if a national drama of the afternoon had had its genes mixed with a murderous thriller in a sort of transformation apparatus or cocktail shaker. <br /> <br /> The only real performance is given by James Remar, the most talkative and disturbing of the two escapees. And it's mainly because of his rough but fluid baritone, which resembles that of Lance Henrickson, and his wide, guppy lips. It is gentle on the eyes and ears. <br /> <br /> Dean Stockwell gave excellent performances, including his priceless bizarro trick in "Blue Velvet", in which he was my second supporting role, but in this case, laziness, years or The relaxed direction has shaped each of its movements and each utterance into a stereotype. It's like reading the instructions from the scene - "Look surprised" and "Cry with anger" - and follow them literally. There is no surprise in a cart. <br /> <br /> If the gay son, Jason Behr, always blinked, it was probably while I blinked at the same time, because I missed it. He has a long neck and a single expression in his instrument. Woolvett as a secondary villain fades into the woodwork with pine knots. The lawyer is Robert Glen Keith. I hope he did not quit his job. <br /> <br /> The direction is pedestrian, the staging functional without being the least innovative possible. Sometimes it's confusing. I lost track of what everyone was supposed to be as the killers went around the porch of the cabin and the family locked themselves inside with a shotgun. I also did not understand how Stockwell could explode through the cabin door, hit Remar and hit him at the back of the porch, and then Remar could simply get up, dust off and create a grumpy riposte. like, "Ok. Two can play this game." But why continue? See if you have to.
