I guess it's a film as pretentious as a director as superficial as Joel Schumacher could do it. A group of medical students dies in turn for several minutes; when they wake up, they discover that their sins have manifested themselves in one way or another. While some characters are visited by deceased people and some seem to be haunted by their guilty consciences, the connection between them is not entirely clear, but visions all seem like sixth-generation art films. Why do students treat their experience as a kind of grand journey that will make them famous is a bit of a mystery, because the results are completely impossible to prove and, as the film repeatedly mentions, have been documented many times before . Nevertheless, it's nice to see Schumacher training for his Batman train wrecks with a bit of old neon paint and colorful bulbs. And William Baldwin is a board.
