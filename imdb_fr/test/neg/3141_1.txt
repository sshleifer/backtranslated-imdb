Looking for something shocking? Ok, ok ... the pictures, that's it. It is more or less that. This film tries to establish deep bonds with the public through various symbols and ends up being annoying. I'm not quite sure if the director intended to really convey a kind of deep message to his audience, or if he was just trying to shock them with blood, sex, and violence. I think it was probably the first ... but in the failure of the attempt ... it was simply an artistic trash with lots of blood, hateful characters and an excessive reliance on religious symbolism. If you are looking for an independent film to criticize for using the metaphor, try your luck. If you're looking for a gore movie that will make you nauseous and uncomfortable ... that's ... If you're looking for a film that will irritate you the most because you realize that the message was ultimately stupid ... the movie was stupid. .. and you will never find those minutes of your life ... this is surely the movie for you!
