Eaten Alive follows a young woman (Janet Agren) in search of her lost sister. It turns out that his sister joined a sect that disappeared in the jungle of Borneo. With the veteran Vietnamese Mark at her side, she goes in search of her sister. <br /> <br /> As usual, the acting is not of the highest quality, but you will get a girl in the cannibal poster, Me Me Lai, who spends most of the time spent the screen with her bare chest, the main female Janet Agren covered with golden paint and abused a dildo soaked in snake blood, among other things. Now, it must count for something! <br /> <br /> But, I must say that I find it a bit difficult to recommend this title. If you're a fan of the genre, you'll probably recognize some gore scenes from the movie bar. And I think so literally. Many gore scenes have been released directly from other Cannibal movies, such as MAN FROM DEEP RIVER and LAST CANNIBAL WORLD. There are probably more movies stuck in there. <br /> <br /> In the end, it's a check movie for hardcore fans. If you have not seen Italian films in the jungle, look at CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST instead and, if you're a big fan, you've seen most of the scenes in other movies.
