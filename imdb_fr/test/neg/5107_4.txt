When I heard for the first time that there would be a video game The world is not enough for the Nintendo 64, I was so excited. When he finally came out, I was one of the first to rent it. I rented for 7 days and I managed for all the game! The game was too easy and gave too much clues. A disappointing majour following GoldenEye. Follow my advice and DO NOT RENT THIS GAME. <br /> <br /> Of course, weapons and gadgets are cool, but we're tired of a chronograph watch that seems to come from GoldenEye, with the exception of red. color instead of a blue color, a bad excuse for a dart gun, a stunning and amazing and a stupid grab hook that can only attach to things that are yellow and black. <br /> <br /> I think RARE should be made this game instead of EA, which should stick to games that do a good job, like sports games, and that should be held at away from the first-person shooters and let the masters do the work.
