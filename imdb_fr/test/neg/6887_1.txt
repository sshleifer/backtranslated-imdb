I guess when people say it's beautifully filmed, they talk about frogs' closeups and cooking meals. This certainly does not refer to the set that seems to consist of about 3 rooms without any outside shot. Moreover, everything is filmed too closely. <br /> <br /> I got tired of the little boy who keeps farting against Miu or pouring hot wax on the ants ... do the Vietnamese also spend all their time sitting on their hips? It's a little disgusting at least the way this movie describes it - a close up would have been a lot more than a dozen or more. <br /> <br /> Then comes finally the second part ... a film for the Vietnamese girls with the handsome rich and handsome man who spends the whole day playing the piano (he is cultivated). The pretty maid steals it like a forbidden green mango. Deep. <br /> <br /> Except for some nice close-ups, this film is a failure. It's a kind of soap opera without dialogue. He is disgusted. How is this beautiful ?? The set looks completely wrong. <br /> <br /> No, do not make the mistake I made and praise it because someone recommended it. I was expecting beautiful cliches from the coastal mountains of Vietnam or something like that when I heard it was a visual jewel. <br /> <br /> I wanted to love this movie. I like foreign movies, even prefer them. But this movie is stupid. You will be irritated to see that something like this has won many awards.
