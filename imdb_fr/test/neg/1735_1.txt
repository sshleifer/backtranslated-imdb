What really struck me in this film is the little sense of intrigue. So many characters were introduced randomly, it was as if I imagined that Tommy Wiseau's "THE ROOM" would be revisited for the Disney Channel ensemble. We had the wise elderly couple hanging around where "Jane" was working, telling the same story about how "soda" had brought them closer, or Jane's weeping mother / wife who were all coming out randomly. /> <br /> Aaron Carter's play is definitely the highlight of this film: I was really waiting for every scene in which he appeared. The editing is terribly bad, with cuts of scenes without any sense. The character of "Jane" is really annoying, making fun of "J.D. McQueen". The scenes with the "Music Awards" are more depressing than anything else. And the end of this film is surreal.
