Dubbed beyond comprehension, the HBO version of Lumumba is a disastrous rendering of what looks like what was once a decent movie. Some scenes simply do not make sense in English and the actors bring no energy to the reading of their voice. Add to this the self-censorship of Frank Carlucci, CIA agent, and you get a film stripped of its drama and power. Hoping that the subtitled version will reach the US TV screens at some point.
