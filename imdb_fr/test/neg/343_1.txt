It's OK if high school students do it for their friends. It is well below the limits to be qualified as "professional". There is no plot, no actor's piece and visual, it looks like we see it through the plastic film. I was so happy to have the FF button on my remote, 32x worked really well. I understand that everyone has to start somewhere, but it should not be a reason to make it public. If you have concerns about quality and budget, $ 600,000 has been allocated to Open Water and more than half went to the Ocean Safety and Shark Training Officer. And this movie looks 100 times more professional and it was an event in the indy movie.
