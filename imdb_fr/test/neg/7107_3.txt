The film is very fast, weird and colorful, it's like Mad Max on speed with a lot of dyes and makeup. Also very cartoonish, as has been said; sequence of cartoons appears here and there. The plot is also very sassy, ​​but I will believe that it is supposed to be too. What makes me really crazy in this movie is the characters, they are painfully irritating, especially Rebecca played by Lori Petty, she is really annoying (I think she is the most annoying creature I have never seen). The editing is also annoying, very stylized MTV. Another thing that is missing from Tank Girl is an exciting adventure. The humor is not very funny either. He has some beautiful visuals though. <br /> <br /> However, many people like this movie, most of them are women, and it's not strange at all, because this movie is all about the power of girls .. Tank Girl this is a real girls movie, and the best example of a hate / love movie.
