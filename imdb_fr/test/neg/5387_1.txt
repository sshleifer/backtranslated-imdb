I had not heard of Soap Girl, but I saw a poster with a five-star review of Film Threat outside the theater. So I thought how serious it could be. Well, I soon discovered. My god this movie was awful. The most wooded comedy I've ever seen outside of a porn movie. An absolutely frightening dialogue. I just can not understand how this was done and why anyone agreed to join. And I find it completely unfathomable that it was shown in a theater and that fees were charged to see it. How did it happen????? And above all, IT WAS WHAT THE GUY OF THE FILM THINK THREATS?!?!?!?!
