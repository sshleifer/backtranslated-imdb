Ask a thousand people what is the biggest unintentional comedy of all time and they will almost invariably tell you Battlefield Earth or Plan 9 from Out-Space. They are wrong. American Ninja has these two turkeys cut down for a number of reasons, the least of which is a scenario that has obviously not been thought of. Although I fully support the B photo industry to keep slobs like Michael Dudikoff at work, a little work on the product would have been very helpful. <br /> <br /> For those who give a rat posterior, my next paragraphs will give significant parts of the plot. <br /> <br /> First, when we are given general information about the titular hero, we are told his date of birth, close relatives, parents, etc. , are all unknown. I do not know about you, but I expect the US military to take the investigation a little more seriously about its staff. They also manage to ruin the continuity of the dates in a fairly efficient way, even if I do not really remember which dates were ruined and when. This is actually one of the less obvious faults of American Ninja. <br /> <br /> This has already been pointed out, but a common flaw in many martial arts movies is that when our heroes are confronted with a large number of antagonists, these antagonists attack one at a time. More recent films such as The Matrix Reloaded are challenging this convention, but just about every film from the 1980s has the audience shouting, "Hey, why not attack all at the same time?" Martial arts films tend to be much more impressive when the fights are larger than face-to-face. <br /> <br /> The central principle was originally a joke, but in the light of recent events where the US military can not crush a crowd of insurgents simply because they do not want to delegate to specialists, this seems strangely ironic. Filipino renegades steal weapons from the local US Army division and sell them to wealthy customers. Regardless of whether such a robbery would prompt the military to give local, responsible, or even responsible, airside rectal exams, this is a nerdy action movie of the 1980s, after all . <br /> <br /> By far the funniest part of the movie is the decisive battle, though. While Joe and Jackson combine pose and fight into an art form, evil Ninjas begin to explode for no apparent reason. I agree with a previous commentator that this film should have been called Ninja Holocaust, because I'm willing to bet at least three hundred evil Ninjas bite him during the movie. On top of that, the Black Star Ninja is starting to fight with rocket launchers, laser beams and all kinds of ridiculous tools that are not only badly thought out, but perfectly executed. You will never see a laser beam effect as cheap. <br /> <br /> The film is taken seriously. During the scene where Joe finds his former mentor, I dare the defender not to laugh at the hideous dialogue. Not that I know the modern practitioners of Ninjitsu, but the logical part of my imagination is hard to believe that they have spoken at all times of their history. During this mentoring scene, I almost expect the old man to tell Joe that he has to prove his manhood by cutting his head with a blunt plastic spoon. <br /> <br /> All in all, I gave American Ninja a 1. This is a special score in my system as it is reserved for the most terrible, the most shocking and the most shocking that I have ever seen, or movies that make me laugh without even trying to try. American Ninja is certainly an example of the latter.
