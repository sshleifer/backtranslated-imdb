It's a shame to see so many talented people involved in what is really a waste of talent. The plot is clich√©. The staging is too self-conscious and the characters are almost caricatures. One of the most disappointing aspects of this film is Gerard Depardieu's performance in the English version (this film was shot in French and English at the same time). Although he is one of the best actors of the film, he gives the worst performance of all. I must say that Bianca Gervais is very close however ... <br /> <br /> On a more positive note, I must say that the newcomer Juliette Gosselin gives an incredible performance in both versions. Unfortunately, that's the only good thing I remember about this movie ... <br /> <br /> By the way, I have to apologize for my not very good English ...
