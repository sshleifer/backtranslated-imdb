This is my first review on IMDb.com and probably the very first written review of a movie I did on my own - not for a class assignment. I think this fact alone says something about this movie ... not a good thing! I am neither a journalist nor a seasoned critic (although I have seen quite a few films), but I found this film so terribly painful to watch that it was necessary for my peace of mind to allow me to live. experience. Where to do better than IMDb? As I forced myself to stay in the movie, physically trying not to be able to connect the dots, I was sure there would be a "light at the end of the tunnel" - a revelation to explain what's going on in the samhe . happened. The movie ended and I was as enlightened as a dog ****. After several rewinds to review some scenes, I still could not conclude anything reasonable. I found myself wanting to shout "Does this make sense to anyone?" I would recommend not wasting your time, but again, if I were you, I would probably like to experience it myself. If so, bring some crosswords or something else so you do not get bored.
