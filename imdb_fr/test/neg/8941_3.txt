Even though I like trains, I could not stand this movie. The premise that you can steal a locomotive and "drive" from Arkansas to Chicago without hitting another train along the way must be above the dashboard of the Impossible Plot lines. Imagine that two disgruntled employees of NASA are stealing the "robot" that is transporting the shuttles and driving it to New York and you understand the idea. <br /> <br /> That said, the test is nice. Wilford Brimely is at his best Quaker Oatmeal, and Levon Helm performs well as his well-meaning but well-matched sidekick. Bob Balaban is properly worm-eaten as the type of business, and the story of the "little guy is attacking Goliath" is airing again.
