What Game Over: Kasparov and the Machine is the best thing is to plunge into the spirit of Garry Kasparov during the 1997 competition against Deep Blue IBM. You see him becoming more and more paranoid and less and less comfortable, all because in the second game, Deep Blue made a gesture that seemed too human for his preconceived conception of chess computers. Kasparov thought then and still thinks that IBM cheated. <br /> <br /> Game Over tries to appear impartial, but it is clear that the director thinks that IBM has cheated. However, they provide no concrete evidence to support the cheating complaint. Only some people have suggested that IBM's security surrounding the computer room was due to the fact that IBM's grandmasters were hiding the computer on certain key occasions. a computer usually does this at a time of the second part. In the second game, Kasparov played a game designed to deceive the computer by attempting to sacrifice a pawn in a situation where previous computer chess programs would have taken the pawn, resulting in the possible loss of the computer. Deep Blue did not bite the hook and Kasparov was so shaken because the computer seemed to play like a human, he did not even realize he could have played Deep Blue tied and ended up resigning. This match shocked him so much that he was unable to recover, and after playing games 3, 4 and 5 in the draws, he lost the match 6. <br /> <br /> The question of knowing if IBM cheated everything comes down to this one shot in the second part, where the Deep Blue made the gesture that any human would do, but that until then, the computers would have been triggered. Joel Benjamin, a great chess master of the IBM programming team, explained in the documentary that they knew that chess computers were always down, and therefore spent a lot of time and effort programming Deep Blue to avoid any mistake other computers make. If you believe Benjamin's claim, then the case is clear, IBM did not cheat. Unfortunately, the director quickly moved on and never mentioned IBM's explanation for the rest of the film, preferring to cut between the plans of the 19th-century game hoax, The Turk, and Deep Blue's plans. , hinting that Deep Blue was really controlled. by a human too. As a person with an understanding of programming, IBM's explanation makes perfect sense - if you knew what you were doing, it would not be very difficult to put something in the code so that, if this or that state This is done, do this or that - in other words, tell the computer what to do if a situation such as the one created by Kasparov in Game 2 had already occurred. It's not cheating, it's a good job programming a chess computer. <br /> <br /> In the end, it is quite clear that the director thinks that IBM has cheated, and repeated comments on the stock of IBM have increased by 15%. the day that Deep Blue won suggests the idea that IBM cheated to inflate its stock price (Kasparov even compares IBM and Deep Blue to Enron). However, there is a host of external opinions, both in the chess community and in computer science, that Deep Blue won fair and square and that Kasparov lost because he simply could not go beyond his viewing computers as "stupid machines" and frightened by a machine that did not seem so silly after all. I just wish the manager let us see the alternative notice. <br /> <br />
