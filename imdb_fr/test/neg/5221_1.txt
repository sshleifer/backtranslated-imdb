Normally, I do not like Chuck Norris's movies. I appreciate his work as a martial artist and his fight scenes are usually quite well choreographed. Chuck is undeniably one of the great martial arts. So in my local used bookstore, I found a movie I had never seen before and took it home. <br /> <br /> Although playing in this film is worse than most of Chuch Norris's films, I was hoping to see at least one fight scene. I quickly realized that it was not a typical film of Chuch Norris; it was rather a Christian film, intended to illustrate the paradigm of "good will". <br /> <br /> The packaging does not really contain anything that indicates that it is a Christian film, with the exception of the label. .. Goodtimes Entertainment, which I had never heard of before. I will certainly keep that in mind the next time I see a movie from this company. <br /> <br /> I do not have a problem with Christianity ... I have a sneaky proselytizing problem. If anyone wants to make a religious film, at least have the good sense to tell the viewer that this is what he will get. The only thing that redeems me about the exercise is that I spent only $ 3.25 to spend 97 minutes watching a great martial artist not fighting. At least it was during supper, and I spent some of that food eating. <br /> <br /> In short, if you are looking for a mediocre martial arts film and do not expect much, do not worry. do not bother with this movie because it does not even offer that.
