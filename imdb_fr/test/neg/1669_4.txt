It was an irreverent comedy from the 1970s, which made fun of the profession of psychiatrist and Beverly Hills. That did not bother me, but I was opposed to more irreverence with regard to marriage and religion: two topics that lay filmmakers (ie, who are talking about everyone in Hollywood and elsewhere ) can not help but get upset. <br /> <br /> Walter Matthau plays the character "Donald Becker", who walks around with a cleric's collar, which shocks me, but since when does Hollywood worry about offending Christians? <br /> <br /> Anyway, despite these nonsense, the film has its moments of entertainment and even a certain charm. Dan Aykroyd is good at paying a walnut deal and Donna Dixon ("Laura Rollins") is a knockout. I'm sorry she did not have a bigger role.
