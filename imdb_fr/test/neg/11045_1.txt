Please do not blame Korea for this bad movie. I am in Korea (please excuse the bad english). It saddens me to see these films that give Korea an obsession with blood and sex. It saddens me even more to see animals killed and to hear Americans say that Korea is like that. We do not eat live animals !! So, stop excusing the movie for its crime saying it's culture! There are scenes where man eats live animals and non-Koreans think it's normal. No, it's disgusting for us too. The director is a clumsy, sick individual, obsessed with murder and sex with family members. I hope that America and France stop glorifying this nasty, laughable man in his own country. Watch any Korean movie, it will give you an idea of ​​our artistic sense. This film is nil.
