I read all the reviews for this direct movie. I can agree that the film is not of "Armageddon" or "Deep Impact" quality. Nevertheless, if you are looking for a way to spend about 90 minutes, then this is a movie that is bearable. <br /> <br /> I started watching the movie early, while I was a geek. Things. It was great because I was able to switch between what I was doing and watching the movie, without missing a beat. It's a predictable movie, and the cast of actors is not up to some veteran actors (eg, Dennis Hopper). <br /> <br /> But I must point out that I only paid $ 2 and as the old saying goes: you get what you pay for! If you are looking for a film in the deep sense that will require you to watch it again and again, this is definitely the long video. On the other hand, if you are looking for something to pass the time, then there is nothing wrong with Tycus (which was also called "Comet: Final Impact" in Mexico where I found this video) .
