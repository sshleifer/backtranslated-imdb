Can this "film" be considered a film? Imagine the situation: someone puts a handy camera on a tripod and in front of a boardwalk and films people walking or running on it. Then he places the camera on a beach, buys ducks from a pet store, opens their cages and lets them run in front of the camera. Later, it only captures the surface of the water and the sound of birds and insects in absolute darkness. Is it an experience or just an insult to the public's intelligence? What would happen if an unknown director made such a film? Would we score his job with 10? I still disappoint directors who believe they can do anything they want once made famous.
