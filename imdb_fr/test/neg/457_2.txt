A second Universal Pictures feature on the Universal Act, which says that a mom's movie actor was conducting criminal investigations for the army, repelling the advances of the impetuous young woman to whom he had been entrusted. Robert Montgomery directed and played the leading role in this adaptation of the new "Come Be My Love", and his acting performances of this era are incredibly lazy. The plot is sober and predictable, and the writer Robert Carson has given all the really fun lines (as usual for movies of this period) to the darkroom maid. It's always nice to see Ann Blyth and Jane Cowl back, but they can not do much with this hokey material. * from ****
