"I assume you are here to have damaged your mental circuit." - VAL <br /> <br /> Mike Nelson made me look at that ... he talked about it in his book "Movie Megacheese". I asked myself, "Why would Mike Nelson have misbehaved me?" I now know why robots have never trusted Mike Nelson. <br /> <br /> The music is from John Williams, which is probably part of his payment to the Devil. In fact, I'm sure anyone who worked on this film is probably linked to the former Slewfoot, or is now cursed, from the executive director to the guy who ran the catering truck outside the studio. Do not look ... for God's sake ... do not look !!! Even making a copy and showing someone else will not curse you ... I am doomed now, I understand that. I accept this But save yourself ...
