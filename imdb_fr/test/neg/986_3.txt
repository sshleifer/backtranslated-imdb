The best part of this movie is the first, located in Sicily, I guess. Crialese shows a good talent for photography and the beginning of the film is delightfully surprising. The rest of the story is pretty boring. Crialese unnecessarily insists on stereotyped situations and characters, trying to melt neorealistic suggestions and video music technique, surrealist memories of Fellinian and a very boring and completely off-topic soundtrack, leading to a goal which gives you the sensation of an exaggerated length. story cut off abruptly. Frankly, it's a real overestimated film and Crialese is a real overestimated director.
