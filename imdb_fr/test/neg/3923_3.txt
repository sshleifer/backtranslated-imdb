It is said that there are people there who make the films of ADMIRE Monogram. Well - and why not? Monogram studios lived on some kind of cost more; cost, plus enough to pay the rent and buy a pizza and a bottle of sturdy muscat from time to time. Of course, they are cheap. But let's face it: they are rude, quick, philistine, vulgar, but exhilarating. They have no pretensions at all. They are designed to distract the public for about an hour at the bottom of a double bill. And if John Wayne galloped in the Wild West by a road lined with telephone poles? It's not art, it's entertainment. <br /> <br /> Take this movie, "Flight to Mars". At first, when we meet the characters for the first time, a man can suddenly introduce his companion, avoiding any tedious subtlety: "Professor, here is my fiancée and assistant, who is a rocket scientist and a beautiful woman. but I'm getting impatient because I'm still in scientific work, maybe you could steal her, marry her, give her the babies, and keep the house protected by a stake for which she aspires If necessary, I'm going to die traveling to see her dreams come true, and she also likes a bit rough. "That saves a lot of writing and shooting time, does not it? This is what people mean when they say that a story is "fast". (This one was shot in five days.) Why should we have hints about these things? I mean, what is this, a cheap science fiction movie or Henry James? In fact, this is a particularly well-financed example of a Monogram movie. It's in color, on the one hand. "Cinecolor" to be exact. (You can say that this is not another "color" that you recognize.) And watch the casting. The main female role is fictitious, as usual with Monogram, but the main male role is clearly at the top of the list B. Cameron Mitchell, as a journalist, has not yet managed to play the male lead, this who, thinking about it, never really did. And Arthur Franz as the main scientist who smokes the pipe, the pride of Perth Amboy, New Jersey. And for fans of science fiction, how about this pair of aces: Morris Ankrum AND John Litel! It is not really useful to describe the plot in detail. The five crew members crashed on Mars where they discovered an underground civilization populated by organisms whose evolution was isomorphic with ours, until they had five fingers and babes salient to the short skirt. And they learned English by listening to our shows. American shows, that is to say judging by their speech. They are led by a sinister cabal trying to hijack the spacecraft, build many imitations and colonize the land. They do not succeed. <br /> <br /> The special effects are not very special. The men walk around two spare sets dressed in black suits with stylized flashes on their chest and scarlet capes floating behind them. Their names consist exclusively of English phonemes - Alzar, Terris, Ikron. The little Martian fallen in love with Arthur Franz is called Alita, with a diminutive Indo-European appendage, and she already knows what a kiss is. <br /> <br /> Overall, I found it as sharp as it was destined to be, but boring too. The story is that of any series of Buck Rogers of the 1930s. Once the earthlings and the Martians have met and it has been established that they have a common language and that the Martians have a program sinister, that's all. In two hours, even an indifferent screenwriter could turn this into a Nazi spy story during the Second World War. The plot is done by the numbers, the dialogue has no spark, the game of actors is pedestrian. <br /> <br /> However, passionate fans of Monogram productions should enjoy it. After all, Jean-Luc Goddard, the French counter-master, dedicated "A Bout de Soufflé" to Monogram, so they could not be so bad.
