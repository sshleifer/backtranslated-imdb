Positively ridiculous film. <br /> <br /> If Doris Roberts, Shirley Jones and Shirley Knight persist in this type of film, they can submit their retirement papers and collect social security full time. <br /> <br /> Although the idea is that a 35-year-old swinger who works in video games loses his apartment and is forced to move in with his grandmother Roberts and is the border between Jones and Knight is stupidly treated. Imagine the 3 bags coming out of their homes, grandson Alex at home and Jones sleeping with someone who could be described as his grandson! <br /> <br /> The video game sequences are as crazy as the rest of the world. movie. The assortment of characters Alex works with is unimaginable as he appreciates his citrus habit with others. <br /> <br /> Terrible best describes this miserable movie.
