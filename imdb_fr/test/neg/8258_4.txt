In "Red Letters", Coyote is vortexing his position as a university professor. He writes to a penitentiary inmate and gets more than he expected. There are two reasons to watch this movie ... Kinski is one and Piven the other, although it's hard for their sparks to shine in such a disaster director. Everything is wrong with "Red letters" ... complicated and ugly scenario, camera, editing and especially acting, which is inferior to reality for Coyote, etc. not worth the time.
