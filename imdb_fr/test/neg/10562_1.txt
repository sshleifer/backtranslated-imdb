I have been a big fan of Jane Austen for many years. I had never seen this adaptation, so when I heard about it, I came here and read all the great reviews. On this basis, I eagerly ordered it to Netflix. What a cruel disappointment! They took one of the most subtle and brilliant comic novels and made it dull. Each character seems to have received a single facial expression, a single tone on which to base his flat characters. Although this adaptation seems to have used every word written by Jane Austen, they seem to have been transmitted to the characters in a random way. Although it was a mini-series, this adaptation manages to confuse and feel as fast as if it had been a film of the week. <br /> <br /> Mr. Bennett too harsh, Mrs. Bennet just a talkative chipmunk, Mr. Darcy as punctured as a nutcracker, Bennett's daughters are almost indistinguishable and Mr. Wickham, a man that nobody would look twice - hardly an attractive boy! I am totally out!
