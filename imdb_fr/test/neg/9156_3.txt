This was Chan's first film directed by Monogram. What a result of Fox's values ​​and standards! I was shocked when I saw my first monogram after watching Fox's big movies. This is boring and uninspired with wild music as Chan walked calmly down the street. Chan now works for the US Secret Service rather than the Honolulu Police Department. He is assisted by Benson Fong, who plays for the first time his son No. 3, Tommy. He also has a daughter, Iris Chan, played by Marianne Quon. Mantan Moreland also makes his debut as Birmingham Brown. He is a taxi driver in Washington, DC, here, rather than the last Chan driver in the following movies.
