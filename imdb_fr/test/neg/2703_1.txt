As a cartoon, the movie Spytroops was pretty bad. It lasts only 44 minutes and yet, several battles have taken place, which resulted in the destruction of the headquarters of the COBRA. One of the lows was the very beginning of the film. An animated battle better than the rest of the film proved to be a kind of battle simulation. This right was a major turning point and made the rest of the film unreliable. Then there was the Shipwreck number attached with his parrot and thrown into a room where no one had checked for several days. What have surveillance cameras become? <br /> <br /> The COBRA base had only a few characters and the others were BAT robots. In addition to many corridors, the COBRA base did not appear to have weapons, tanks, trucks or other equipment. Then there was the silly notion that 100 complex androids could be created overnight. The plot was ridiculous even though it was meant for young children. Spongebob, Powerpuff Girls and even Barney The Dinosaur pay more attention to their intrigues. <br /> <br /> The characters were not bad, except that I could never understand what Destro was saying, and the commander of the Cobra was silly and not much of a villain. In fact, with the exception of Storm Shadow and Xartan, the rest of the characters in COBRA were comical and unimpressive. GI Joe's characters were pretty good. Scarlett, Agent Faces, Road Block and Snake Eyes were my favorites here. Shipwreck and Beach Head were the worst. Shipwreck is written like a blunder and Beach Head looked like a 1990 guy's surf guy. I guess the writer, Larry Hama, was trying to create a character that would appeal to teenagers, but he was ten years away. Just listening to Spicoli's talk from Beach Head (Fast Times at Ridgemont High), I wondered if the new GI Joes was going to smoke a dawn before the big mission. <br /> <br /> The CGI was pretty good except Cobra Commander had a jerky march and the vehicles did not look very realistic. The flying chariot and the explosions were not very impressive. The old-fashioned animation would have been much better than that. Since Hasbro likes to do cheap things, they get what they pay for. I was having a hard time looking at all of this, it was boring and it lacked GI Joe's soul or spirit. Even the old GI Joe ads would have been better. In fact, the DVD included extras such as four or five current advertisements for GI Joe Spy's troops, and these commercials were much more entertaining than the movie. The ads had more fun and kids-oriented minds. The commercials were lively, while the movie was dull.
