The story of Ed Gein is a troubling and terrifying story. Ed was really a messy character and his legacy inspired "greats" like The Tooth Fairy, Norman Bates and Leatherface. How come when such a fascinating man has inspired such a boring melodramatic drivel? Ed Gein made nipple belts, skull bowls, skin lamps, dancing under the moon in human skin suits. This is not part of the film because they needed to tell us the fictional story of a ridiculously abominable MP and his rather simple, sex-hungry girlfriend. This film seemed to go out of its way to falsify the story. What bothers me is that most of the movies are moving away from the path of truth to exaggerate history; this one seems to do it to minimize it. I just do not understand.
