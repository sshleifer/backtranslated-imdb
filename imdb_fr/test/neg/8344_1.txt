I saw this movie and thought it was a stupid movie. What is even more stupid is the one who had the idea that there should be a volcano in Los Angeles? The fact is that there are no volcanoes in Los Angeles. This film should not be shot in Los Angeles, but in Honolulu, Hawaii. Hawaii has volcanoes, it's a fact that this film should be shot in the state capital of Hawaii. This film should be shot in Hawaii because it's the real idea and not in Los Angeles. There are earthquakes in Los Angeles, but there are no volcanoes. To be honest with you, this is an incredible and very stupid nonsense. In conclusion, I will not bother with this movie because a volcano in Los Angeles is nothing but nonsense.
