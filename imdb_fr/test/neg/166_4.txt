A strange and deliberately skewed biopic by Dyan Thomas in which barely more than a dozen lines of his poetry are heard. Instead, we must endure a crude, exposed character, seen through the prism of his proto-bigame relationship with his wife (Sienna Miller) and his childhood love (Keira Knightley). Matthew Rhys plays Thomas with enough charm to vaccinate us against his unpleasant interest and Cillian Murphy invents the lovetet always tense. <br /> <br /> The film never seems to decide its future. There is not so much an arc as a viaduct from one end of the war to the other. Maybury seems much more interested in her two female roles (who would not want !?) than by the man who reunites them and then divides them. Miller is the choice of both (I found Knightley to be competent at best, but I have never found it friendly), but both offer terribly inconsistent accents. Among the other amusing decisions, there is too much for the unimportant character of William (Murphy), an artistic production (for example, double fades) that is neither impressionistic nor symbolic, nor the old act of chestnuts of old images which do not merge. 4/10
