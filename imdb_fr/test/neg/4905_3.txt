This low budget film about a writer who is going to work in a London casino has a horrible storyline, wooden performances and not much to recommend to him. Of course, this will appeal to those who are "mainstream" as a verb, and automatically add 20 IQ points when they hear a British accent (apologize to Jeff Foxworthy). <br /> <br /> The script is full of holes (has he already written a book, or not?), clich√©s (relationship problems: she works days, he works nights), and provides so little information on basic elements such as the motivation of the characters that it is necessary to pass a narrative in voiceover history. <br /> <br /> To prevent the audience from falling asleep, the film includes a street fight scene about as realistic as a Julius Caesar production in high school. <br /> <br /> If your sparkling dialogue idea is "I'll see your ten and you raise twenty", then run to see this movie. Otherwise, save your money. <br /> <br />
