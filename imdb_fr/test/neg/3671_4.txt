Take a few dark and stormy nights, fog from the coast, an obsession and a doubt, two brothers who have a mysterious link based on hatred, a suspicious disappearance, a shoe in the night silently grinding a cigarette butt glowing, and finally, a trembling heroine who is threatened as much by her own doubts as by one - but which one? - men around her. Looks like we could have a good 80-minute black. Instead, under the direction of Vincente Minnelli and under the direction of Katharine Hepburn and Robert Taylor, Undercurrent becomes a morning melodrama of nearly two hours, a long band of menacing anguish amidst a perfectly neat cast, coiffed and dressed. When you watch your watch half-way through a film and have your heart sinking, you see that you have an hour left, and you and the movie probably have problems. <br /> <br /> Minnelli, in one of his first non-musical films, does not adopt the rococo approach to the greenhouse as much as was known later. Yet what is basically a simple story of greed, murder and obsession becomes a never-ending vehicle of Katharine Hepburn. Hepburn shows us in close-up carefully illuminated plans how to demonstrate fear, love, anxiety, vertigo, happiness, doubt, suspicion and terror. Robert Taylor is more or less long for the trip. <br /> <br /> Hepburn begins the film as a tomboyish Ann Hamilton, a young woman in energetic pants who helps her father achieve his inventions. Their housekeeper is determined to marry her. When Dr. Hamilton decides to sell an important formula to Alan Garroway (Robert Taylor), it's love at first sight. Garroway is the fluid, elegant and dynamic inventor of the Garroway distance controller, which was essential during the war and made him a robust millionaire manufacturer. He is an industry captain, as one of his many friends in Washington says. Ann Hamilton, now Ann Garroway, may still be a little missed, but her husband shows her how to dress and how to become a successful social hostess for all members of Congress and the judges her husband knows. She learns quickly and impatiently. They are both obviously and blissfully in love. <br /> <br /> But wait. The chancre is about to gnaw. Ann realizes she does not know anything about her husband's family. None of his employees or friends seem inclined to talk to her about it. When she gradually learns that her mother died in the old Middleburg family home on the piano or that he has a brother, Michael, gone, Alan becomes very quiet ... and sometimes gets angry. He always apologizes. But wait again. Did his mother really play the piano? Is not she really dead in bed? Was not Michael caught taking money from the family business and Alan sent him away? All this is played against the superb hotel suites, the neat Middleburg country house with its stable and the ranch house by the sea. Everyone in the movie, except the employees, is dressed to perfection. There are exclusive cocktails and intimate dinners for twenty. Even in a black and white film, Minnelli can not help but give us dining tables filled with crystal and porcelain, elegant and elegant furniture and many dresses. <br /> <br /> At the end of the film, when everything is finally known, when Ann on horseback is pursued along a high mountain trail and extremely well crafted by the nasty horse of another horse, when she is threatened with death by block and her pursuer finally meets death by horse, it is a relief. Even Robert Mitchum, who plays Michael, is unable to create much tension in the film. What could have been in small hands a small film B tense, but with the list A is a melodrama overworked, too big for his bones.
