* Spoilers to come, but that should not matter as I hope you will not see this one anyway * <br /> <br /> If you have planned to see this one, I will strongly advise not to do it. This is one of the most lost hours I've ever known. <br /> <br /> First of all, it's a real scam of the great movie "Battle Royale". It's as silly as watching any lame American TV show like "Cops" or "Hidden Camera". <br /> <br /> The plot is totally predictable. A pregnant challenger and another a nurse, all those who think logically understand in the beginning what should happen between them. <br /> <br /> The concept is torn as mentioned before and the film lacks the necessary violence to make this film enjoyable. I mean, the preggo pulls a guy in the back and no blood or even a trace of the blow in the back. <br /> <br /> I could go on forever without finding anything good about it, so grab your money and get a copy of Battle Royale instead of watching that piece of shit. <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10, a pity that I can not evaluate it lower. Made almost of Scream 3 a masterpiece ..
