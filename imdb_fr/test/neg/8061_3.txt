One of the most notorious of the banned "Video Nasties" of the 1980s is also one of the most over-excited. "Make Them Die Slowly" talks about what you expect from a potboiler in the jungle led by Umberto Lenzi: Inventive (though poorly rendered) native torture techniques, some ridiculous "social commentaries" (yes, even more stupid than " the cannibal Holocaust "), and a lot of chew guts. The exploitative violence of the film, however, is often shown only very briefly and never stays on it for long, reducing its effect (interpret it as you can). Dialogue is the usual stupidity of Lenzi, our heroes showing their affection for women by calling them "tw @ t", etc. The distribution of familiar faces (including Lorraine De Selle, Giovanni Lombardo Radice, Zora Kerowa and Robert Kerman) is doing its best against the growing idiocy (including a completely ridiculous "castration conservation"), but can not save this work overflowing and unhealthy. effort.
