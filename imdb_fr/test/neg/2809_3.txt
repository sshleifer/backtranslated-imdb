Too bad. It could have been good. The main problems are the script and the star. The film can not decide whether it is a burlesque comedy (very banal and uninspired) or a shrewd satire on old East Germany and its customs. His attempts at this last flop totally, however. The film does not hold well and the end is very artificial and incredible. All the stereotypes one could have about German comedy are unfortunately reinforced. <br /> <br /> The characters are stereotypes, and the main character, played by Kim Frank, is colorless to the extreme. He simply can not wear the film and seems to have been chosen largely for his baby face. It may not be entirely the fault of the actor (he is a pop singer), because the scenario does not give him much work. <br /> <br /> An added advantage: the recreation of the East German style is good. <br /> <br /> The worst thing is that the film feels dishonest and degrading. The film seems to have been shot by people who did not necessarily do their best and just wanted to make money quickly from a few cheap laughs. (If they did their best, it's really a sad case!) I watched it at the cinema with an East German audience and felt sorry for them. The regime of the GDR was awful in almost every respect, but those who lived it deserve better than that.
