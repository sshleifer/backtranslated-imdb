The director Nico Mastorakis has created a cynical note (by his own admission) that is too cynical to impress anyone except a second-rate amateur. <br /> <br /> The most extreme, to confront the images of genre, to paraphrase a VIDEODROME character, "has a philosophy"; That's what makes them dangerous. <br /> <br /> The philosophy of ISLAND OF DEATH is to add many "shocking" elements to a cinematic mix and move them slowly. The result is a tasteless but ugly dish. <br /> <br /> Not to be confused with the glitter of Serrador WHO COULD KILL A CHILD? (sometimes called the ISLAND OF DEATH), Mastorakis' effort takes place on a Greek island, a theater of various forms of slaughter, a little bestiality and wholesale perversion. <br /> <br /> Everything is happening at a fast pace and the plays are violent misdirected. <br /> <br /> Described as "the movie that the censors did not want you to see", I suppose the censors have never seen it, they just read the press kit until their knees straighten up.
