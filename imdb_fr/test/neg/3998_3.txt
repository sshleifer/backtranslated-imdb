Is it supposed to be serious? I hope not. It's one of the most pathetically hilarious movies I've ever seen. Since I bought it for money on the "Bad movies" set, it lives up to its place in the shop. What can I say, the effects of gore are splashed everywhere, some seeming real, others looking like teddy bears who have had an accident with a bottle of tomato sauce. The music is among the most horrible I've heard, the acting is one of the funniest things ... should I continue? Do not bother if you have not seen all the other pathetic horror movies in the store and that's all that remains.
