Congratulations to Christina Ricci for making this film and for putting her directorial role behind this important subject and for trying to make an excellent film. Ricci is my favorite actress: she is so talented, so natural, that her reactions are perfect, as well as the energy that she releases constantly, which gives credence to the term often misapplied "star". <br /> <br /> The film misses its target for many reasons, but perhaps it's mainly because the story seems unsuitable for the screen to make an irresistible story ... more about it later. The casting at first sight is excellent, but if you think about it, Jessica Lang, a Jewish mother who is too Protestant and not quite right, Ann Hetch is not about to show the compassion and dedication of the book's psychiatrist, and when you make a movie, how can you justify saying no to Anne Heche and Jessica Lange? But the real problems lie in the construction of the film: first, the inability to arouse any lasting sympathy for the character of Elizabeth Wurtzle, and secondly, to say something significant about the too common and horrible situation in which lies this poor girl. Unfortunately for the construction of the flashback, Lizzy is simply considered a teenager more affected than most others, but not as devastating as in the book. This is a major problem. This story had to be told from beginning to end and from the therapist's couch. She is only eight or nine years old when her depression begins, due to devastating social factors in both society and home. This is a crucial point to arouse not only the sympathy that suits her, but also the seriousness of her case. She has so much talent and a mind so vulnerable and dissatisfied so early that her heart can not help but join her because of her victimization. This is missing in the film. <br /> <br /> Finally, we have to understand what the film is trying to say: it is the biographical film of a young girl who is badly affected, but it is also a film about a nation that can not get his act together; this is very clear in the book, but it is interesting to note that the film was not yet better chosen than the Harvard elected officials. The film finally fails to pass one or the other of these messages convincingly, and it's a shame. Is Prozac a good thing or is it a bad thing, or a mixed blessing or an apparent need in a country where so many people can not function without a chemical crutch? These are difficult and difficult concepts to work with and the writing does not really try to approach them in a more or less engaging way. The Challenger disaster is an interesting image to symbolize a dysfunctional America, but it will not have the effect it is supposed to have because of the insufficient multiplicity and development of control themes. <br /> <br /> Ricci's performance is tight and sincere and one of the best of his acting career. <br /> <br /> Michele Williams is also superb in her role.
