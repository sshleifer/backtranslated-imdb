THE PROTECTOR. You hear the name. You think, "Oh, it's a crappy Hong Kong movie." Guess what - it's not Hong Kong. And yes, it sucks. This incredibly stupid movie of Jackie Chan, ruined by us, yes we Americans (I'm boiling with anger, oh, I think I'm going out the window!), A Chan like New York cop looking for a gang, avenge the death of his boyfriend. It looks cool ... but it's not. Do not waste your money by renting it. To prove that he could make a better crime movie, Chan realized the incredible POLICE STORY (1985).
