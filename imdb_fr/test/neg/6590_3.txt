Yes, it may not be historically accurate (in fact, only 6 soldiers from the 9th tower were killed there), and yes, there are mistakes and exaggeration (bowed machine gun? "history lesson" about how Afghanistan has never been conquered by anyone - an educated Russian officer would know history much better than that - take for example the British campaign in Afghanistan). And yes, it does not have Hollywood-style special effects worth millions of dollars, but that's the strong point of showing a soldier's life there, his relationships and his feelings when the best friends are killed before his eyes. In my opinion, 9ya rota does a really good job showing all these things. <br /> <br /> Again, the film has its weaknesses, but, in my opinion, it seems to be one of the strongest films in Russia in recent years. years. <br /> <br /> 8/10
