The Evil Below begins with "The Straits of San Sebastián 1683", the 17th century treasure ship El Diablo sinks in a violent storm. Jump to the current day of San Sebastián Strait where two divers explore the magnificent underwater coral reefs that are rich in flora and fauna, encounter the submerged wreck of El Diablo and explore it, but are attacked and killed by something that looks like a vicious eel. Captain Max Cash (Wayne Crawford) owns and operates a rental boat called 'Vagrant Viking' for tourists who wish to fish, dive and explore the islands in general. Sarah Livingstone (June Chadwick) is an art teacher who is passionate about treasures (we all have to do something to pass the time, no?), She hires Max and her slightly dressed assistant, Tracy (Sheri Able) for she can try to locate the El Diablo and become rich. Talking about sunken treasure excites some of the unscrupulous members of the local community as they dodge criminals and thugs; it is brought to the attention of Max and Sarah that the El Diablo has a sinister past, a past that is supposed to leave his supernatural heritage behind him. even now ... <br /> <br /> Directed by Jean-Claude Dubois, according to the IMDb with a little help from the Crawford star although the version I saw listed Dubois, I thought that The Evil Below had potential and a little different, but unfortunately that's not enough to save him from sinking to the bottom of the sea like a rock. Arthur Payne's scenario begins with the two divers killed by some kind of sea creature, but this opening is NEVER evoked, the creature is NEVER seen and there are no more supernatural murders. The Evil Under then suffers from a serious problem of identity crisis, he does not seem to know what he wants to be because it contains pieces of different genres, such as underwater adventures, horror, action, thrillers, crimes & other crimes. he even has time to cast some mystery about murder and religious nonsense. As a result, The Evil Below is very fragmented and, as the best scene in the whole movie is the opening sequence, I found myself sitting down, becoming more and more frustrated by the lack of consistent horror as the situation gets worse. deteriorated quickly. never see the creature thing of the sea again. The Evil Below is boring, slow, uneventful, predictable, silly & lacking in charm or intelligence, in short, The Evil Below does not do anything good that a good movie should. <br /> <br /> Director Dubois fails to liven things up, although he obviously shot a lot of material on underwater wildlife, because I sometimes thought I was watching a National Geographic documentary with all the pictures of fish, of corals and wildlife in general. Remember that something gore, water stained with blood and blood cough are as bloody as possible. <br /> <br /> Technically, The Evil Below is very basic, it's bland and totally unforgettable, apart from beautiful underwater photos. of fish. This is a point to draw and overall, the production values ​​are very low, even where the shoot was shot does not look very sunny or attractive. The acting is mediocre, but do you expect something else? <br /> <br /> The Evil Below is a mediocre film, its story is fundamental and it can not decide what it wants to be & accordingly, it ends up being a mess. Add to that the low production values, the fact that there is no gore here and absolutely minimal horror content. You probably have a movie to avoid unless you are absolutely desperate and there are surely better ways to spend more than 90 minutes of your life. .
