Some will say that it is better mainly because of the actors' play; but it is much worse for reasons that outweigh the improvement. <br /> <br /> the source of all the problems; the story. apart from the fact that one of them is shot at close range, with a shotgun in the chest and surviving for hours without medical care, the problem is more serious. Nic, the gangsta in the heart of gold wants to do everything for the friend he just met that day; and that includes asking for help from an evil spirit. This, who comes from nowhere with a voodoo past, is ready to summon Killjoy, as long as Nic can "plug her in". the acting, although improved, is always horrible. these people could not convey the emotion of a paper bag. the script does not help them either. stupid lines, and I can only assume no direction from the director. this script was read as at Shakespeare in high school with a teacher whipping them as they went. <br /> <br /> while this film (if you can call it that at its 80 minutes. (luckily)) is maybe even Funnier than the first because of all these things, it is clearly more painful to watch. 1/10.
