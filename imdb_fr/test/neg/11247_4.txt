The first movie was rather trendy and had fun moments, this movie does not have exactly the same standard. Calvin Palmer (Ice Cube) is still trying to maintain his hair salon but it is not only against the stylist Gina (Queen Latifah) who has a beauty institute next door, but soon a big chain of hairdressers called Nappy Cutz open in the street. Calvin, along with his colleagues and friends Eddie (Cedric the Entertainer), Jimmy (Sean Patrick Thomas), Terri (Eve) and Isaac Rosenberg (Troy Garity), are doing everything in their power to retain their regular customers, and finally their current business against competition. In addition to Michael Ealy (Ricky Nash), Leonard Earl Howze (Dinka), Harry Lennix (Quentin Leroux), Robert Wisdom (Alderman Brown), Jazsmin Lewis (Jennifer), Kenan Thompson (Kenard) and Garcelle Beauvais-Nilon (Bad Company) ) and Loretta. I did not like this film as much as the first because of the useless flashbacks on Eddie, and it's not so spiritual, I'm bored. Okay!
