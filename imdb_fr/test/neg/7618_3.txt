Once I saw a bit of this movie and I was interested to see the whole thing, just to see why critics give it two stars. The result is that I agree. Basically, the movie starts with Kermit the Frog (Steve Whitmire) who tells all of his Muppet mates that they've lost everything, and he ends up sitting on the bench, depressed (and maybe thinking about suicide). Meanwhile, in another world (paradise), the angel Daniel (David Arquette, already in Muppets from Space) visits the "Boss" (Whoopi Goldberg, another reason why I wanted to see the movie) to show that Kermit really needed help. In the flashbacks, we see Kermit, Miss Piggy (Eric Jacobson, not the original and best Frank Oz), Gonzo (Dave Goelz), Fozzie Bear (also Jacobson), Pepe the Shrimp (Bill Barretta) and all other Muppets have prepared theater show that many people can see during the Christmas holidays, and everything seems to be going well. But the very nasty Rachel Bitterman (Joan Cusack) is determined to close the show or the theater and Kermit is doing everything possible to prevent this from happening. Of course, Kermit fails last time and Bitterman tells him that they have finished and that she can officially take the theater. This is where Daniel is sent as Kermit's guardian angel to try to help him, but Kermit is not in the mood and ends up saying "I wish I was never born". Obviously, you can recognize the parody of It's a Wonderful Life, with Kermit as George Bailey and Cusack as Mr. Potter, and in the end, it's obvious that Kermit realizes how much he's counting for everyone and go back to the theater. registered as a historical landmark. Also featuring Whitmire in Rizzo the Rat and Beaker; Goelz as Dr. Bunsen Honeydew and Waldorf; Barretta as Dr. Teeth, Rowlf the Dog and Swedish Chef; Jacobson in Animal and Yoda (the only character who resembles the Oz version), William H. Macy in Glenn, Matthew Lillard in Luc Fromage, Carson Daly, Molly Shannon; Zach Braff Scrubs, Sarah Chalke, Neil Flynn, John C. McGinley and Judy Reyes, Mel Brooks as Joe Snow; Brian Henson as Scooter and Janice; Jerry Nelson in the role of Robin the Frog, Statler, Pops and Floyd Pepper and Kevin Clash in the role of Sam the Eagle. The most memorable moment for me is the parody of Moulin Rouge theater, other than that and the familiar faces that are there, not fantastic. He has been nominated Emmy for Outstanding Music and Lyrics for the song "Everyone Matters". The Muppets were number 47 on the 100 biggest icons of pop culture. Adequate!
