If you were trying to make a bad movie, you could not make a worse film than this one. I can not imagine someone paying a lot of money to see such waste in a theater. What makes you really fascinated is to be hypnotized by looking at the whole thing, just for the astonishment of how ugly it can become. The redemptive facet of this movie saw the words "The End"
