I'm the kind of person who never watches, ever, animated movies, but I make an exception for Thumbelina and the Swan Princess. Being totally in love with the first installment of the series, I bought it and sat down to watch it with a very partial mind, determined to love it because I had spent money to buy it. I finished the movie, and all I can think is the HORROR !!! I wanted to love him, I really liked him. I tried very, very hard to love. But I could not enjoy a second of this grueling film. The songs made me want to tear off my ears. The dialogue was so lame that I felt myself shudder with frustration and irritation every time someone opened their mouths. The villain was laughable and I felt that I wanted to die Derek and Odette at the end ... and I absolutely loved them from the first film. <br /> <br /> I will try to repress the memory of this film because it almost destroyed the first for me. There is a song in the movie in which there is a series of flashbacks on the first movie. The difference in animation between the two is very obvious, and I began to desire the first hoping never to look at the third. <br /> <br /> Do it in your favor, do not waste your time. time.
