Even though the trailer and poster for this film imply that Sally Hemmings was an important character, I might not have been as shocked to discover that she was only a minor character (and I want say minor) if this movie was supposed to have been told by Sally's own family movie! I mean, if you're going to tell the story of a family member who was ignored by the story, would you really tell it to the man who relegated it to the darkness of the main character? Her other lover (who happens to be white) as a true love interest? I know I will not do it! I'm as pale as they come and normally a big fan of Merchent ~ Ivory movies, but I could not stand the treatment of poor Sally Hemmings with this movie.
