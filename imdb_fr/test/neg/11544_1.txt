You do not have to spend a lot of time watching this video made for a TV movie or TV show, or anything that was meant to understand exactly what's in store. The unbelievably bad musical score makes its debut from the beginning. Seriously, if this is not the worst theme I have ever heard, I will certainly not remember it. While acting talent is available here, from Jeff Bridges to Carl Betz, Vera Miles and Sal Mineo, the writing is atrocious and the story is artificial, filled with tasteless stereotypes and an obvious scam of Ken Kesey. Why should Hollywood always present stories from the sixties as if the so-called hippies were all one-dimensional morons? It is unfortunate that such an interesting epoch of our exceptionally conformist social experience is usually described in a distorted way, so that the least offensive of the genre is now accepted as reasonably authentic, while almost nothing is closer to reality. . The best I've seen so far is a memoir called Look Back, written by a guy named Becker, but who else has heard of it? No one in Hollywood, for sure. They are too busy throwing guts like this movie grunt to worry about reality.
