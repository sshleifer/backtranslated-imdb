The movie starts with its smarter joke, and goes down there (pun intended). After that, there is a lot of humor and sexual situations. Beautiful women were the best part of the movie. Swearwords are not supposed to be central jokes, but they try it here. The battle between the two groups in the local city (rich and poories) is an old, tried-and-tested setup, so how could this be wrong? Well, there is no reason to envy the "rich" nor any reason to feel sorry for the poories, so we can forget the central plot. Situational humor is purely sexual or aimed at teenagers, but it just laughs and does not laugh. <br /> <br /> The only thing that saves the comedy of this movie is the humor of the character, with the blind providing some redefined settings, but rarely used, and the owner of the black bar providing stereotypical humor "street" or "hood". <br /> <br /> OK, forget the jokes, there must be some killer snowboarding shots since it was a commercial venture. Unfortunately, there were only 4 seconds of action in the background that could be inspiring. The rest was type "B" or worse. The big moment, where the main character rides "the goat", a ski slope that kills the man, provided a shot where a small avalanche devours the stuntman. It was the best boarding in this movie. All snowboard fans will be disappointed with the quality of the film's stunts. <br /> <br /> Regarding the technical aspects of the film, the soundtrack was average, which is surprising, because these documentaries on snowboard are regularly filled with quality melodies. You can see many mistakes in editing and even if it was shot on a mountain ski, the majority of shots "landscapes" have given no real meaning. <br /> <br /> Overall, it might be interesting to see if you managed to turn off your brain completely and that you like silicone breasts. Even then, you will not remember anything of it two days later. <br /> <br /> The snowboard is still waiting for his final comedy, you better watch a documentary about snowboarding for sure.
