If you take the movies, Mad Max, Beyond Thunderdome, and the Steel Dawn movie with Patrick Swayze, you'll have a pretty good idea of ​​what the movie is about. The only problem is that the film lacks the production value of one or the other and mainly represents an inexpensive copy of the two previous ones. Certainly, the film has a lot of action, but asks the viewer to suspend his beliefs. Nobody can shoot with a 50-caliber machine gun in his hand - and miss it all, and can not shoot a group of people with an automatic weapon and miss them. There is also a problem with a bad edition. When the school bus rocks, it's pretty easy to see the cannon used to do the job. And the lady driving the truck through is superfluous because she has had enough time to stop the truck. If you are interested only in stupid action and violence, then the movie is pretty easy to watch. But do not expect anything with Thunderdome, or even Steel Dawn, which is pretty cheap and old-fashioned.
