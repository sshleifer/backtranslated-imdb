This film is probably the worst film I've seen in a long time. The acting is so much wood that a door could have done a better job. The plot is laughable and shallow and the real "rugby" is far from reality. I still do not get the "haka" described in this poor excuse for entertainment. I am not a Kiwi, but I know that the Haka can only be played by someone of Maori origin and not by a white American boy. <br /> <br /> I guess that was done for the American public. So the superficiality and "Disney end" is excusable, but there was virtually no attempt to indicate the basic rules of the game outside the prison side where the main character suddenly takes charge of a football match American and brings everyone to play rugby. The only good thing about this movie was the end credits. It would be less painful to spend 90 minutes inserting toothpicks into your eyeballs.
