It's a shame that Barry Humphries, a famous character from Sir Les Patterson, made his film debut in this under-cooked spy comedy. <br /> <br /> This film reminded me of the flair of Beatty / Hoffman, Ishtar (1987). Humphries should have learned from the mistakes made by the movie - if you want to change your concept to a concept, DO NOT USE SPIES! Like Ishtar, the first 20 minutes or so offer the promise of something different. It would have been great to see the anachronistic and rude Patterson getting lost in the world of Australian politics. One of the characters even pointed out that Patterson was aware of the current time - one would think that Humphires would have had a busy day commenting on the Hawke government (I can just imagine a scene with Patterson and Hawkie in a drinks contest alcoholic). But instead of a pretty smart and even biting film in this world, we incite Patterson to go around the world under the pseudonym James Bond who tries to save the world from biochemical weapons that run out of steam before halfway. <br /> <br /> Disappointing.
