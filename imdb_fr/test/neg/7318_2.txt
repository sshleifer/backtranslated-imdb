Oh my god .. This movie is so mediocre that I do not know what to write about it. <br /> <br /> I think it's easier to write what it is not: <br /> <br /> It's not very fun. It's not original. And there is not a single character in the whole movie that concerns me. <br /> <br /> In a way, it reminds me of a certain reality show on MTV, but no interesting people. It hangs around again and again and I can wait with impatience for it to end. Jennifer Lyons (c: <br /> <br /> I've been thinking about this movie for a long time to find a good thing to say about it) What I liked about it was to remember to judge someone in the movie first impression (as Holly did when she accused Nicole), which earned her a score of 2 out of 10 instead of 1.
