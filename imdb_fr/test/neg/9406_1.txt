Another entry in the subgenus Pacino-As-Mentor. You know the situation: a young man with an extravagant flaw (in this case, Matthew McConaughey, who is trying to revive a degraded career by attaching himself to the Pacino stick - hey, it worked for Keanu and Colin, did not it? not?) by the glamorous and deliciously corrupt paternal figure (Pacino, natch). Young Hotshot learns from Father Figure all the details of a lucrative but degrading career (this time it's a football handicap). The father depicts the young Hotshot with money, hookers and power, but we all know that this decadent state of affairs is in conflict with dissolution and despair. . . that is to say, until the young Hotshot finds his moral center by rejecting the figure of the father and all, or almost all, he represents. (It is clear that Stone's * Wall Street * has laid the foundation for the Pacino-As-Mentor subgenus.) <br /> <br /> We must also take these Pacino films nowadays as a parallel with reality . Again, you know the exercise: Living-Legend Actor demonstrates its undisputed superiority over a younger, inferior actor. He may endure and smile throughout the process, but he must admit that he will not get any good lines, let alone that he will be able to chew a major landscape before the outcome. Now, it must be said that there are actually two good movies in the Pacino-As-Mentor canon: * Scent of a Woman * and * Donnie Brasco *. In the first case, it was a one-man show, anyway; in the latter case, Pacino had met his match as a thief in the person of Johnny Depp. However, these two films were serious, and were not just a showboating exercise for the sake of showboating. Pacino has made sure that his youngest co-stars in movies since * Brasco * are not nearly as charismatic as Depp. By the way, none of this speaks very well about Living Legend. Like his contemporary De Niro, Pacino has spent his last 10 or 15 years resting on his laurels. "Two for the money" is the worst example to date, even worse than * Devil's Advocate *, which had at least the virtues of presenting a naked Connie Nielsen and being chronologically anterior to this film. This is what happens when you are crowned king too early - ask Marlon Brando. Frankly, I have seen too many Al Pacino films with the same scenario - and the same excess on the part of the star - to be even more charitable. Did I say "none of this speaks well"? In fact, it's humiliating for everyone, including the paying audience. Nobody is going to accuse Matthew McConaughey of being a Shakespearean actor, but even he does not deserve the role of second violin of this ridiculous old show, with the additional implication that he, McConaughey, will never live up to the greatness C is Al. <br /> <br /> I have not lost any space on the details of the field. If you want a summary, IMDb provides a simple summary, although I think I have presented a fairly complete summary in my introductory paragraph. Basically, you've already seen this movie. Several times. The particular medium of "Two for the price" is the shabby world (the underground world, in reality) of sports handicaps. Pacino runs an office of "bet advisers" - that is, intermediaries between you and your bookmaker - and even has a disability show broadcast on cable TV, co-hosted by several of his best guys . One of the things the film did well was the leanness of this type of shows. . . but one detail they were wrong about was the constant use of the words "play" and "play". If you've ever seen ProLine or other similar shows, you'll NEVER, EVER hear Jim Feist and his cohorts say the word "play". They ask you to call their 1-900 number to get their pick. . . but if you came from Mars, you would have no idea what you were supposed to do with these choices. "Gamble" is the word F used in TV shows for sports disabled - strictly verboten. <br /> <br /> The game is illegal, you know. <br /> <br /> 1 star out of 10
