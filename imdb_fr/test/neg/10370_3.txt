I am a big fan of demonic puppets. Looking at the surface of it, it looks pretty good! You have Decapitron, the puppets and a new villain in THE TOTEM! Unfortunately, the little punk who animates this project to animate inanimate objects can not act. He smells bad! His girlfriend is worse. If we left them out, it would probably be cool, BLADE VS. THE TOTEM. I would watch this for 2 hours. But instead, the role of the puppets is played and the whole film has suffered. The mystical type of Skull who created the totem is at best corny, and the appearance of Decapitrons is long overdue, it is short and really very disappointing. You'd better watch first.
