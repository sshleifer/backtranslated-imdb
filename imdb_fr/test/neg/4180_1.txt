It must be one of those times when you meet a film with a neat cover, my first impression, sweet, full moon, crows, a scarecrow holding a scythe. OK, my impression (I watched the scarecrow on TV a few weeks ago) was perfect, a nice slasher movie to start the evening. ................... false, absolutely wrong, I think 5 minutes later, I thought I lost $ 3, so I'll end up where the scarecrow fell. Well, I guess it's the legs of the fisher man wearing heavy rain boots. you see it from time to time. I was looking at that thinking ... OK, when will these kids fall on this guy, at some point I thought they were dead. but no .... I mean frig, their still alive. I only laugh at a few parts because of their staging. one was the zoom in part at the beginning. the director / actor / screenwriter says: "remember that I had that feeling, well I still have it" and it was either zooming in or zooming out, hell I'm coming back. but I guess the scene was so-called shocking, I mean what's more shocking if his wife had the same shocked look ... OK ... she thought so ??? I'm sorry but YEAH ... I did not know he was psychic until I read the movie box to make sense of what I saw. not only that, they used pictures to make you think that this movie is at least clear. <br /> <br /> The other thing that made me laugh a little is the: screaming into the camera to make it scary ....... OK ...... ....... .. film a girl screaming in front of the camera for 5 minutes ....... yes ..... I laughed because I found it pathetic that these children could not not behave like the other characters in the movie. <To top it off, the fake must have been lost or something like that ... because the bad guy just had a stick. not even an ax, someone should cut the dam production film <br /> <br /> Do not fall into the trap of the photo, this movie is a piece of sh * t. I watched the trailer and guess what it was <br /> <br /> GIRLS CAN YOU FIND ME AND THE MAIZE
