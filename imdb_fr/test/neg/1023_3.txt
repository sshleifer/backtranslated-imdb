A fantastic production and George Clooney's comical performance can not save a curiously detached, sometimes awkward quasi-comedy of Joel and Ethan Coen. The story of the road from the time of the depression comes back yesterday with three escaped prisoners who were looking for a hidden fortune and inadvertently became country music stars! The film winds but never creates momentum. The charismatic charismatic Clooney, Gableesque, but also the artistic direction and the catchy music of T-Bone Burnett gave him a good boost. Otherwise, the (Coens) scenario is seriously lacking in humor and interest, with John Goodman's and Holly Hunter's cameos showing no improvement, and the second half of the film slips precariously into self-indulgence. ** from ****
