This film should have been presented as three film summaries linked together to form a feature film (including many shots of people walking slowly through dark corridors and streets). BE WARNED! The first hour of this film is simply a cover of the first two Aztec films as described by the main character. The film does not start until the thing is over. I must say that the excessive movements of the bat are quite hilarious. <br /> <br /> Regarding the robot, I imagined that a robot was a mechanical device that looked like a human or not. The "robot" of the bat consists of a revived radioactive corpse locked in a lead robot body. As Tom Servo said, "He is not so impressive, he does not even have knees!" That, and it takes about an hour for the robot to cross the room. But once he catches you, watch! It will disintegrate you with a touch (powered by radium? Pluh-ease!). <br /> <br /> This is a great movie when accompanied by Joel and the Bots. Otherwise, you are just a glutton of abuse.
