I love science fiction and I'm willing to bear a lot. Sci-fi movies / TVs are generally underfunded, underrated and misunderstood. I really tried, but it's too much for science fiction TV like Babylon 5 for Star Trek (the original). Silly prosthetics, cheap card games, oversized dialogs, non-background CGs, and painfully one-dimensional characters can not be overcome with a science-fiction setting. (I'm sure some of you think that Babylon 5 is a good sci-fi TV, it's not, it's clich√©d and uninteresting.) Although American viewers love the development of emotions and characters, science fiction is a genre that does not take itself seriously (see Star Trek). He can deal with important issues, but not as a serious philosophy. It's really hard to care about the characters here because they are not just stupid, they just miss a spark of life. Their actions and reactions are woody and predictable, often painful to watch. The creators of Earth know that it sucks, because they must always say "Gene's Land Roddenberry ...", otherwise people would not continue to watch. The ashes of Roddenberry must turn in their orbit, as this boring, cheap, poorly edited (look at it without pub breaks really brings this home) Trabant trailing a heavy show into space. Spoiler. So, kill a main character. And then bring him back as another actor. Jeeez! Dallas again.
