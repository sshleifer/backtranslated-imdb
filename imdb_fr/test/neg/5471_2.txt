How can you go wrong with a film mixing sophistication by Peter Cushing, Donald Pleasence's determination and Luan Peters's bust? Easy, you provide them with a terrible scenario. <br /> <br /> Peter Cushing, in a perverse role, leads a satanic cult that captured a couple of friends of Donald Pleasence. Donald plays a determined but distant priest who wants to locate his friends but needs Fred's help from Scooby-Doo to locate them. He uses a New York bloodhound, who dresses like the hero of the cartoon. Meanwhile, the girlfriend of one of the missing people, Luan Peters, joins the search. If all of this sounds good to you then, like me, you have been misled. <br /> <br /> The trio was quick to sniff the bad guys, but their methods of bringing criminals to justice are stupid. In addition, women will find this a crapfest. Whenever they start on the path of the wicked, our two male heroes tell Luan to stay at the hotel even if she can cope better than the crazy priest played by Pleasence. <br /> <br /> STORY: $ (The script really lets us down, no tension is created, no valid dialogue is given to the stars and you will need both hands to count the number of times it is told Luan Peters to stay behind and let the men work, see a minotaur on film does not bother us, we have the statue of a minotaur who spits flames). <br /> <br /> VIOLENCE: $$ (There are some attacks and some sacrifices, but those of you who are gore will be disappointed). <br /> <br /> ACTING: $$ (Although there are three of my favorite actors in this film, nothing is refundable here Peter Cushing does not have much time in front of the screen, Donald Pleasence is clearly aware that he is on the set of a stink and that Luan Peters is misused - it should have been much better considering the talent at stake, but again the nkees lose a match here and there too). <br /> <br /> NUDITY: $ (Luan Peters takes a bath, but you do not see almost anything, she's not as obliging here as she was in The Flesh and Blood Show).
