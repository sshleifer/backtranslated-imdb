*** Possible Spoilers *** <br /> <br /> I read a bit about Dahmer and saw the new movie Dahmer (by the same name) earlier. This movie here focuses instead on the victims and the murders, too little on Dahmer himself. The film entitled "Dahmer" had the opposite problem, too little about his crimes and too much about himself. <br /> <br /> I did not find the acting to my satisfaction, there was also a certain amateur who felt it, especially the probation officer. It also seemed that Dahmer's role was getting worse each time he played against the probation officer actor. But I may be wrong about that. <br /> <br /> What annoyed me a bit was that some scenes are quite disturbing, but the filmmakers seemed to be trying to show "the real deal" of what he had done. It's good - but what I do not understand then is that the guy who ran away from his apartment while Dahmer was having a beer, was not shown naked, it's also what happened. It does not matter, but the quality of the movies is undermined by the fact that such details are left out. What has not been shown, or even really hinted at, is the Dahmers' sexual obsession with the dead. Again, it does not bother me that they did NOT show it, but at least they could have mentioned it or incorporated it in one way or another. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: I think that Dahmer's very good film is still to be done, a film that incorporates not only the crimes of the Dahmers, but also who he was and why he did what he did made. I think 1.5 or 2 hours are not enough to understand the complexity of this. This film was just a cutout (excuse the pun) of Dahmers life and personality and gives you no idea "close to the best" of his life or personality. <br /> <br /> 4/10
