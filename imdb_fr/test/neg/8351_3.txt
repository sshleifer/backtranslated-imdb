"Volcano" is at best a B movie, and at worst it is more of a disaster than it is supposed to represent. To be fair, you have to be ready in any movie to suspend disbelief for a major concept. 'Volcano' asks you to suspend disbelief in science, human interaction and common sense. <br /> <br /> Tommy Lee Jones becomes the Honored Chief of the Office of Emergency Management, who is sensitive to the 90's. He's fine when he's not stuck with the stupid dialogue provided by the script. However, Anne Heche gives a disconcerting performance as a smart geologist who becomes Roark's love interest (while the city is burning, but). Gaby Hoffman, of Field of Dreams and US President, becomes a wailing, needy, and lifelong daughter of Jones. Don Cheadle can sit in a really great office and take Jones' phone calls, doing the job that Roark would do and should do. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the movie really begins to decline when Heche's geological partner gets sucked into a lava hole as they pierce the subway lines. It picks up speed when Jones starts suggesting they use buses to stem the flow of lava flowing down the street, Heche's geologist (who likes to teach everyone about The Science of Geology) is seemingly oblivious to the fact that lava is hot and melts metal and rock, and a dead bus has little effect. It really starts to be nil when the film introduces a racial tension to the Rodney King between two bad actors dressed as police and an angry black man who does not understand why the firefighters are occupied by this great river of lava. But eventually, they will work together to build a dam K-rail to prevent the lava to devour his neighborhood, even if the dam is built in the wrong direction and the materials used do not stop. wash anyway. In addition, the K-rails are scanty, but I suppose the lava would not think of making its way through the holes, not when Tommy Lee Jones looks at it. Do not even throw me on the sub-parcel of the broken down metro, where a hot lava tunnel is descending, but curiously, it's not too hot to try a rescue, it is not too smoky for the see, and there are no toxic gases so everyone can breathe. It must be LA Lava or Lava Lite. You know, he eats cars but respects the environment. <br /> <br /> There are moments of pure camp here that almost make you wonder if it should be a comedy. For example, the two security guards who pack Hieronymus Bosch's paintings discuss any weight with absurdity and farce. In the end, the little boy rescued by Roark / Jones notes that everyone looks the same when he is covered with ash, A torrential downpour breaks out and cleans everyone - then the sun rises and Heche announces something like "aw, shucks, roark". <br /> <br /> "The volcano" almost reaches the status of Battlefield Earth, but Hormis Heche, no one approaches the malice of Travolta and the technical aspects are pretty well treated. If you're from Los Angeles like me, it's quite amusing to think of a lava flow eliminating Wilshire Boulevard. I gave him a three for the effects and the little tension you get from that.
