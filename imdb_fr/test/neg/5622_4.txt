Another film that punishes us for the crime of enjoying "Pulp Fiction". <br /> <br /> If you like watching people get shot by machine gun fire for an hour and a half, that will probably do the trick. Fans of the first episode of "Aeon Flux," in which the main character will literally kill thousands of seemingly faceless soldiers, will really move forward. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, it's not really a smart movie. In fact, all of this serves as a pretext for a group of young people to be rude and shoot people. Sometimes a whole scene passes, and the only thing that happens is, you guessed it! someone gets shot. Or, to spice things up, twenty people get shot. First, they are just sitting there, the next minute they sit dead. Yahoo! <br /> <br /> Intrigue: a young American goes to Paris (an American in Paris, understood?), Hire a prostitute (the Julie Delpy ethereal), makes contact with old French friends, one of whom has the AIDS, they plan and attempt a bank robbery. Of course, the film's convention states that no film bank robbery will take place without a hitch, and this hitch takes up about three-quarters of the time (it's like "Dog Day Afternoon") without the wit, the patience and the humanity of Sidney Lumet. ). At the bank, things go wrong (surprise!), And the Parisian with AIDS goes crazy with his Uzi several times. No mess here, but suffice to say that you are at such emotional distance between these characters that it is unlikely that you will pay attention to who lives and who dies at the end of the film. <br /> <br /> Some have called it elegant. That may be the case, but it's someone else's style, it's a movie that has already been done and "Killing Zoe" is trapped in the convention. Nowhere in the film, the director (Roger Avary, co-winner of the screenplay "Pulp Fiction") does not do anything really original, elegant, funky or scandalous. Unless you consider the fact that no film that has taken place in a bank has had such a large number of people, there is nothing else to differentiate it from the multitude.
