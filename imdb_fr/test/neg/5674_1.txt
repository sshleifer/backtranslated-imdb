This show is based on the concept that strong + odious + repetition = funny. Comic writing is non-existent. In fact, I'm facing serious repercussions by even comparing it to entertainment of all kinds. Here is the premise. Two girls accidentally make their shenanigans appear on the Internet and the hilarity that follows after their first success gives them the idea of ​​making a webcast to highlight their brilliance. <br /> <br /> OK, so where do I start? Let's start with the laughter track, the often used but never successful reminder that we should be watching the audience. According to the guys, this show is the funniest thing on the planet. We should all put tons of weight in our pants because of the brilliance of the humor placed in front of us. The laughter track is serious every few seconds. It is very likely that we would usurp Scooby-doo for overuse of the king band. <br /> <br /> Next, the trick-and-bolster-over-our-lungs-the-fool-of-words-to-seem-idiot is also employed with little or no success. Whoa and do not forget to create new words to sound funny. It's web-o-licious and poop-tastic? What is hell ... <br /> <br /> Finally, the acting game. I can not complain entirely here. The actors are young and inexperienced, but this should and can be corrected by good professional help. Because of his inexperience, Nick should help the actors to define their profession. Instead, as usual, actors are placed in front of the camera and told to "act". Which for the most part is robotic line recitation, missed timing and general epic failure. <br /> <br /> The absence of everything in this show makes it a disgusting representation of how not to be funny. Do not waste your time. This show is degrading for all humanity
