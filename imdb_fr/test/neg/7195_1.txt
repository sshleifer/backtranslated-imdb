This appeared on a DVD that one of my friends bought me. They had written it as "The Savage Guns" which was a completely different movie. Obviously, the people who packed the DVD never bothered to watch what they were burning on the record. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this movie is about as bad as it is. The sound track is a Batman / Early James Bond / Spaghetti Western TV combination. A lot of galloping around this music. It seems like the guy has to gallop between scenes to save time and give the band people something to do. <br /> <br /> English is doubled compared to Italian and it really shows. I wish it was a little less good and so Ed Wood's films were a little campy. As it is, it is simply awful.
