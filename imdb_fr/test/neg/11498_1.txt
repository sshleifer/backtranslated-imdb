I had just finished reading the book and I was really looking forward to seeing this TV adaptation that aired on Hallmark Monday night (5/30/05). The key to the whole book was the manifesto stolen by the steel-tipped man, but I watched for an hour (about 3 1/2) and saw the man with steel teeth, but I have never seen him steal a manifesto. . I saw someone stealing a virus, but what did it have to do with the book? It's a shame because this film had good production values ​​and good distribution, but the idea of ​​turning a book into a movie (TV or movie) is not to make book readers part of it. public. They only kept me for an hour. I thought that the premise of the book was excellent and what did they do, but rejected it entirely? This book had an excellent McGuffin (to paraphrase Hitchcock) but they ignored it. And it says in the headlines that Forsyth was involved in the production. They must have paid him a LOT of money.
