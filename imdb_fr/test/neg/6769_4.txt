Apparently, the episodes of the TV show Gangbusters were rebroadcast on the big screen. Although this was often done in the 1950s and 1960s because people did not have television or color television and the producers wanted an increased return on their investment (selling tickets on the big screen or if they were to resell on a small syndicate), the results were generally less than the sum of their parts. The only time I ever saw it working was when multi-part stories were assembled (Ala Rocky Jones or Man From Oncle) or in the case of horror anthology (The Veil and 13 Demon Street). Here, the stories of US criminals in the 1920s and 1930s (Dillinger, Pretty Boy Floyd, Bonnie and Clyde, etc.) interpenetrate as narrators tell how the FBI stalked them. It's a strange mix that does not quite work because it's clear that there are things here that do not fit together. More than once, I watched television curiously because things did not seem to be going well. In all honesty, I will not describe the low price of production, because that was what the era of television (and series) looked like. It's not bad, but it's not very good either. To be perfectly honest, the episodes of the series I saw work better than a single episode we do not expect as much. Given the choice, I would rent DVDs of the series instead of this movie.
