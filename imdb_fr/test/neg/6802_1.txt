I do not know how this movie received so many positive comments. We can call it "artistic" and "beautifully filmed", but these things do not make up for the empty plot that was filled with sexual insinuations. I would have liked not to waste my time watching this movie. Rather than being biographical, it was a poor excuse to promote strange and obscene behavior. It was just another Hollywood attempt to convince us that this kind of life is normal and acceptable. From the beginning, I asked myself what was the interest of this film, and I kept looking, hoping that it would change and I was quite disappointed that it continues in the same vein. I'm so glad I did not spend the money to see this in a theater!
