A depressed and frightened teenager is doing a lot of harm to an elderly, socially active lady who does not like using blinds or curtains in her windows. He associates matching objects, glances at her, makes jokes and plays nasty tricks on her. Strangely, he does not hide anything from it. At first, she does not seem to care if he's bothering her. Then, later, she seems to begin to respect him for his cruel and feverish activities. <br /> <br /> There are some illogical elements to note. The first is that the guy glances through the night through a window on the brightest side. In real life, such a thing would not happen. The brighter side of a window acts as a mirror. He could not see anything exactly. Plus, everyone in the night could watch him sitting inside his well-lit room. <br /> <br /> Another illogical element is that the terrifying teenager takes a slag job, and his Every client seems to be the only customer each morning. Easy work, if you can get it. <br /> <br /> I saw A SHORT FILM ABOUT LOVE during a public screening. In the end, there was not a single eye open in the house. A short film about love is the foreign language film for those who do not like to read subtitles. Not only are very few words spoken in the film, but much of the film is silent. Some rest in peace.
