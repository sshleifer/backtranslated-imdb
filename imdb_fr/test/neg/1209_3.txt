It's hard to believe that such a bad film was not produced once, but four times! Most movies require a certain "suspension of reality" to be able to enjoy it, but it simply takes it too far. The basic scenario is an Air Force pilot who is shot down over a "Middle East" country. The US government is slow to recover, prompting the son of the pilot (Doug Masters) to attempt a rescue mission. <br /> <br /> The problem I have with the film is that it describes the US Air Force as a colossal country. joke. In the film, you'll see that Doug and his friends at the air base manage to secure two F-16s, all the ammo, the fuel, the Intel processor for the mission, and so on. Security on this basis seems like a joke. Nobody seems to have a problem for a 16 year old to be fully qualified to fly an F-16! <br /> <br /> If that were not enough, one would think that producers will at least try to get the ammunition right, because people like to see things "explode". Not so! Repeatedly in the film, Doug throws AIM-9 missiles at ground targets. AIM stands for "Air Intercept Missile", which means a weapon used to hit targets in the AIR. It also fires 15 to 20 missiles, while the F-16 can not hold more than 6 AIM-9s. The film also lacks continuity. You will see the configured aircraft with a set of ammunition and, in the next scene, a completely different ammo pack. In addition, 20MM does not completely destroy everything it touches! An F-16 will hold 500 rounds of 20MM, and it is mainly used for self-defense. <br /> <br /> I could go on forever with intrigues, flaws and misinformation from the movie, but I won you bored. If you want to see a good movie of the Air Force, your choices are rather slim. Most military films deal with either the army, the navy, or the navy. Until Hollywood can produce an Air Force movie on the themes "Save Private Ryan" or "Some Good Men", we will be forced to watch movies like the "Iron Eagle" series. <br /> <br />
