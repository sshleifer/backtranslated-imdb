Not much to say if not a lot of Wire-fu and supposed Sholin monks who slit their ego over Kung-fu and caricature plotting to conquer China. All this would not be so bad without the fights in the Japanese saber totally wrong. If you watched a Samurai movie or two, you can say that the "Japanese" who are fighting in the movie are simply the same "Kung-fu" (circus acrobats), stuntmen who do the same things except with a Japanese sword. However, there are some fun moments, for example when a Japanese Ninja woman undresses in midair to disarm a monk and capture it with a fishing net. In terms of history, there seems to be some schizophrenia about whether the Japanese should be completely despicable or whether there may be exceptions. The protagonist "Japanese" is shown to be largely honorable but not beyond an unjustified cruelty, as when he murders a monk under sedation so that he can have his duel. Pretty disappointing with a very stupid end. Does not it evoke for a moment the very idea of ​​an epic fight?
