This film gives a glimpse of the suffering of a family following the death of a child and the healing that can finally cure them. <br /> <br /> The family learns of the death of his son on Christmas Eve 1991, ruining the Christmas season for them. They do not celebrate it for many years. The girl made an interesting comment that will remind viewers that they must take into account the needs of surviving children in such a situation. <br /> <br /> The character of Matthew refers to Jesus, but I suspect that other comments he made from non-Christian sources. I wonder if other viewers could recognize these comments. If so, it would be an interesting addition to the data in this movie.
