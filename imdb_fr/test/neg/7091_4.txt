In trying to keep pace with younger audiences as the 70s approached, OaCD, YCSF was the product of more and more materials selected for musicalization. Here, it is the regression of the past life, the ESP and the hypno-therapy ... a beautiful loop The real problem with the concept (music or not), it is the dramatic stakes extraordinarily low; where can a film go, and what can happen when a man falls in love with an earlier incarnation of a girl he can not stand? It can not go anywhere, but strangely, it can not even go anywhere! Indeed, if it could, the public still would not be interested in joining the union of Yves Montand (who played a much older and arrogant French donkey) and Streisand. (a much younger girl). We never invest in them, their situations or their results. Montand is underrated and his strong accent makes many of his lyrics unintelligible. <br /> <br /> All this has been treated with a superficial veneer of the 60's which makes it eminently disposable; despite Minelli's efforts here and there, they are respectable. It's not even an adaptation of a non-musical story that had a previous success ... it's gone too much! Streisand sometimes has fun things to offer, like when she tries not to fall asleep on her roof and improvises an energetic dance. But she relies too much on her Jewish girl shtick, very zany. She can sing very well, however, at the "soft" and "central" ends of the range. In the midst of twenty pieces of music, she gets 3 or 4 amazing songs * of a caliber far superior to anything that Fanny or Dolly had to offer. "It's not you" is a sweet trifle as sublime as Lorenz Hart's "My Funny Valentine", but the film fails to make the slightest impact; because the lyrics do not seem to refer to anything in the film, and there is nothing to suggest that a great love blossoms between Chabot and Melinda. <br /> <br /> The only cut that we can see is a poor hatchet job a much bigger film. Extensive research shows a longer, better explained and more decorative, though not necessarily better, film at http://barbra-archives.com/films/clear_day_streisand_2.html. You can be sure there are more Babs in this version, but more importantly, there would be more thoughtful work from Minelli. <br /> <br /> Finally, Montand sends Babs to sing the title song, after discovering a total dick that feeds him a homily of self-esteem to afford nothing. And she takes the bait. So, uh ... well done for that. <br /> <br /> (* hurry up, it's nice here, love with all the accompaniments, it's not you and the title track)
