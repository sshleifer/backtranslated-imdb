Although this film had a lot of praise, I personally found it boring. There are beautiful Brazilian sunsets and the characters are credible, but the story of their interaction, even if it's very unusual according to our criteria, is not interesting enough to make a film last. The central woman meets one man after another in a very united way and puts the interests of her children first. As the tolerance of different men stretches, we see their characters grow. The story unfolds with dignity and is helped by an excellent acting. This is a rare glimpse of the Brazilian hinterland, far from the city, but hardly exciting to keep your eyes open.
