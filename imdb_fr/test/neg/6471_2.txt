I really enjoyed the first film and when it appeared again, without thinking or checking, I took a family of friends to see him. I was ashamed to have them so excited about them. <br /> <br /> Disney has treated the original film in the same way that the human body prepares a delicious meal - takes something good and reveals itself ... well, you know. And by having a dark-skinned FBI man, the results of the informant's fingerprinting were toned down. <br /> <br /> Taken as an isolated film, I guess it's not that bad if you like that kind of thing, but when you read the book or saw the first movie - horrible!
