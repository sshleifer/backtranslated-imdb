I had to watch "Changi" last year in the tenth year of Australian history. Looking around the classroom, both classes, the 40 students were almost asleep, the 40 heads on the table whispering to the person next to them. I refuse to believe that because I am only 16 years old, that my opinion does not count, having studied World War II, I did not feel embarrassed and ashamed to watch this trashy Australian television channel. The dreadful effort of this mini-series in using the film elements made me lose my head. The acting was mediocre, the scenario was very imprecise and the score appalling. Please, do not watch this movie, it's biased and very racist (to the Japanese).
