I have not seen many movies worse than this one. The scenario, the dialogues, the acting game: it's horror! The story simply jumps from a to b to c without any logical step in between. Whenever you think you've missed something, but no: that's what was planned. And why is the character Jenny Garth describes so in love with this guy who does not lose (who currently plays in the movie Cinderella Man with Russel Crow!)? Oh well, it's not Spielberg, of course ... I have to write ten lines to be posted. This movie really does not inspire enough to write 10 lines! It's a romantic movie that feels good with an ugly story, so if you feel like it, you'll have fun.
