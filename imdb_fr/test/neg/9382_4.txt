It starts pretty well, but after a while, you start to expect more from this movie than you actually have. Everything becomes blurry and fuzzy, it stays. Czech filmmakers were good 20 or more years ago. But after their transfer to a capitalist country, here it is: unofficial but well-known Czech mentality ... COPYING ... COPYING ... copying everything they consider good, when we see it in another film or country or elsewhere. I think it's a good example of making art, politics, horror, humor, film and money. And I still have / A flight over the nest of cuckoo /, which can not be compared to this film in the manner of ART and ACTORS and HISTORY and POLITICS. I think this movie is boring. It could be better done. At least they tried. Sorry guys. :-( CAN NOT RECOMMEND
