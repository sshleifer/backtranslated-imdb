Ok, I am normally very open to movies. I can normally see a good side to a movie that has been totally disturbed by others. This is an exception. <br /> <br /> I'm not going to waste a lot of energy telling you what's going on, but think like Bill and Ted meet the worst Police Academy movie and you've won. t be far away. <br /> <br /> What really attracted me in this film is the stupid and pure racism that was evident everywhere. The general theme of Latino / Black guys = cool, white guys = lame is a bit of fun for the first jokes, but when the same joke was repeated for the 500th time (that's not an exaggeration), it gets to the times tedious and offensive. . <br /> <br /> I spent months waiting for Karma's laws to come back to John Leguizamo for this film. I had almost lost hope when the "My VH1 Awards" were broadcast live in the UK. What followed was that of Mr. Leguizamo performing the rare feat of a comic bomb on the stage. He would have to be a complete sadist to make fun of him. Ahem. Ha! Ha! Ha!
