I went in this film hoping for an imaginative turn of the second coming. My boy, had I already been wrong? The BBC is a fool to survey a movie, idiots to create suspense, fools to build. And this film does not escape the rule of what the BBC sucks. <br /> <br /> Ugh, the laborious, rhythmic and tedious dialogue, was painful. The first 30 minutes seemed to be 2 hours. I looked down at my watch, wondering when would end the useless and monotonous tour de force. They ruined a very good actor in the lead role, because the material is so lazy and poorly written. All that happens is just to kill time. <br /> <br /> On 155 minutes, only 15 minutes are interesting (the controversial end). Too bad. Reading the plot summary is more interesting than watching the movie. The preaching, the "I am God", blah blah blah-blah endless, dumb as doornails that do boring miracles ... UGH. <br /> <br /> DO NOT WATCH THIS WATCH.
