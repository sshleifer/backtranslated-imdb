This version of Mansfield Park, while extremely faithful to the novel, lacked the compassion I felt for Fanny, which is crucial and central in this story of Jane Austen. This was due to the total lack of acting ability of the actress, Sylvestra Le Touzel. She had no recourse and sometimes seemed to be lost in space or too deep. The scene she has with her uncle where she falls into a crisis of nerves has been hysterical. She had played this crucial scene too much and I really regretted that Henry Crawford never liked it. <br /> <br /> Opposite opposite is Jackie Smith-Wood's portrait of Mary Crawford. What a wonderful actress, in a very difficult part to make this character spiritual and egocentric, selfish but vulnerable to love. I have always loved Fanny. She is gentle, but with an implacable sense of what is right and who, according to her, deserves respect and admiration. The Fanny in this adaptation is too humble and submissive with almost no personal thought until the end of the series. As much as I wanted to love this Fanny ... I just could not. <br /> <br /> I suggest skipping this version of Mansfield Park for the real ... the novel. Fanny will not disappoint you ... you will like it!
