This son of a son of a suite was terrible to say the least. One would think that production would be better 10 years after the release of the original. However, Retro Puppet Master was not directed or written by the original writers. scene. No accumulation of strong plot, very low climax, you will find yourself slowly angry throughout the movie, if you can sit all the way through the reel. I have never understood why a horror movie continues after the release of their "last chapter". I hardly suggest watching this movie, but if you needed it, I would not recommend it to anyone else.
