Sherman Hemsley was excellent in Jefferson and especially in the whole family. He was also very good in Amen, why the hell would he do this movie? This film has a terrible scenario and is a loss of a very funny man. Luis Avalos does his best but it's awful. This movie was the beginning of Sherman Hemsley's bankruptcy. I think it's very funny, but it's a terrible story of useless ghosts. Stick with Ghostbusters.
