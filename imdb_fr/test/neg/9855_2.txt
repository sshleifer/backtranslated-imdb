Looking at Enterprise for the first time, as we all definitely do with all the shows, I went into the film with an open mind, enjoying about half of Star Trek's past efforts and not liking it. other half. <br /> <br /> Enterprise was lacking, but this episode "A Night In Sickbay" made me wonder why I was bothering to watch Monday night's shows on Sci Fi. <br /> <br /> Masking the idea that it was one of those In the episodes of Day In The Life, in which we learn what makes some characters act like humanoids, the authors seemed forget that it was a spaceship, not Ricardoes and Mertzes. <br /> <br /> A planet, especially a planet whose team had already offended the people (for eating in public), was not a place for a dog. As an animal lover, I would never have brought one of my pets into an environment that had been tense in the past. <br /> <br /> But what made this episode even more ridiculous was the endless problem Among these ST shows, constantly describing sacred and insulting things to other cultures, while offering a glimpse of American religious fanatics. <br /> <br /> The extraterrestrials have now been offended when the dog urinated on a sacred tree However, the extraterrestrials were quite capable of taking the dog urinating as an insult. <br /> <br /> Strange that the dog's urination was not considered a form of worship. I wonder how the writers of the series had it. <br /> <br /> From there, we are subject to a captain who has been misled by his duties. Looking at the episode, I found it very easy to forget that Bakula was supposed to be the captain of the ship. <br /> <br /> He chose to sleep in the infirmary and from there, we are given more inanimate behavior (sigh) that we are not supposed to understand and it makes us frown. <br /> <br /> The doctor cuts non-chalantly long hairy nails and feeds them to hungry cage animals. Ewwwwww! Then a white bat creature escapes. <br /> <br /> Oh, how come someone is supposed to sleep with all this! Nail clipping to shout loudly! I was waiting for something that feeds on vomit to be presented. <br /> <br /> Then we were inexplicably implied that the captain was in love with T'pol and that he was perhaps masking those feelings with his concern. on the dog. <br /> <br /> Infinite quantities of waste. <br /> <br /> "Your dog is sick, so go make love, you'll feel better." And of course, the captain had to apologize and we, the humans, had to consider his excuses as completely ridiculous, because we are so (everyone smiles very sarcastically) narrow minded! Has seen representations like this without respite on TNG. <br /> <br /> Strangely enough, the only thing missing from this dreadful episode was that Trip's person was offering a smirk and boyishness at home, but Bakula seemed to cover it all up. with the stupid dog. <br /> <br /> Oh, the dog has survived, so go play looking.
