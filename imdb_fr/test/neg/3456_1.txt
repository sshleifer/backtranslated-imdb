It's amazing to me that the best interpretation of this incredible story is a cartoon by Walt Disney in the 1940s, but that's the truth. Here, another clumsy attempt that confuses and alienates viewers would be admirably effective while successfully countering those of us who have read history. Irving's original work is short, no matter the measure, and making a feature film is necessarily a challenge. One can either rewrite the story completely at Tim Burton, which is a discussion for another time, or complete the line of the bust of the old maid with unexpected details. This is what is attempted here, and if I may say, pitifully. New, completely modern and unimaginative facets of personalities such as religious fanaticism in Crane or vagrancy in the good old Bram Bones ruin the object of the story and betray the serious lack of talent of the filmmakers. As we approached the climax of the tale, I had completely lost interest. This is the kind of movie where we expect to see a machinist smoking in the background.
