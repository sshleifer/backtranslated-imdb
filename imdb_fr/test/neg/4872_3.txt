They make everything too easy in this movie. It reminds me a bit of Indiana Jones where he is hiding outside a submarine while crossing the ocean. Everyone knows everything that's going on, it's very easy to get anywhere in the White House. I do not even know why I watched half of it. Because I like Charlie Sheen and Donald Sutherland. I expect the usual ability to dodge bullets from all angles and be able to run faster than a motorcycle (usually faster than a car in a garage or ally). It was stupid most of the time, and I did not even know there was a ten-story elevator at the time at the White House. Anyway, any conspiracy is always interesting.
