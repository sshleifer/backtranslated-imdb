"The Snow Queen" is based on Hans Christian Andersen's very beautiful and famous tale, which tells the story of a girl, Gerda, who takes a dangerous journey to save her friend Kai from the fears of the Snow Queen. This adaptation attempts to capture the sense of adventure and complex images of this story through sumptuous sets and conceptions of production, but fails in many respects. <br /> <br /> Like so many Hallmark productions, the potential of the story is completely crushed by heavy scripts and direction. The two actors who play Gerda and Kai are both pleasant but forgettable; Bridget Fonda as a Snow Queen looks at the role but is otherwise poorly received for the role. There is a noticeable lack of dramatic tension in this winding miniseries of three hours. Some of the rhythm problems at least can be attributed to adding filler scenes that add very little to the original story, especially at the opening time that features the main characters. <br /> <br /> That said, "The Snow Queen" would be pretty much ideal for pre-teens with a taste for fantasy and a little patience. It's a feast for the eyes, without fear, and the acting is at a level of excessive pantomime that sets the story in a very daring text. Just be sure to read Andersen's story too.
