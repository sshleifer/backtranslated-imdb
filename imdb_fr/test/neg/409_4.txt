I had never read any of the books or seen the first movie. After receiving passes for a preview, I did not answer anything. <br /> <br /> "Angels and Demons" was a confused film, convoluted, without direction or any other credibility. There was very little character development and I never worried about the fate of the protagonists; the opposite was true, I was more interested to see how the antagonists would succeed, because the first half of the film was almost exclusively focused on why the Illuminati are what they are. <br /> <br /> The film goes from place to place with little explanation or reason and expects the viewer to believe that everyone in the film is an ally when they meet for the first time. Any analytical mind will realize that this is highly unlikely. <br /> <br /> The climax is extremely clich√© and lets you ask what happened and you ask why nobody has examined some of these points, it feels really useless and useless. <BR /> <br /> The actors are not particularly credible in their roles, mainly because I had a hard time believing that the scientists, teachers and men of the church would act the way they would do without considering the consequences of their actions. The events that occur are not at all plausible and the film's rhythm is questionable, the characters jumping on tight schedules and I had to know how the protagonists manage to go from one place to another each time. <Br /> <br /> The most enjoyable part of the film is the cinematography, I think it's a beautiful movie to watch, but it's such a mess that I did not find it good to pay for it viewing in theaters.
