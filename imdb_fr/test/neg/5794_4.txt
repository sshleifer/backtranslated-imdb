Even Disney is guilty of the cash cow disease, after the resounding success of The Love Bug in 1968, the house of the mouse cashed with Herbie Rides Again, Herbie Goes To Monte Carlo and Herbie Goes Bananas. In 68, neither the suite nor the charm and the harmless attraction of The Love Bug are found. In this one, the race driver, Jim Douglas, and his sidekick Wheely Applegate enter Herbie at the Monte Carlo Rally. Naturally, things outside of the race start to take precedence over priorities, they are mingled with a flight of diamonds and Herbie falls in love with another car! The cascades of cars are of course nice and easy to watch, and it would be very hard for me to really ventilate the venom on a piece of down as nice, it's just that the film is not going anywhere and quickly now, I can see it for the room. it's motivated work. You can still see Herbie take a bath, thwart the bad guys and of course dance for the woman of her life, so there is something for everyone, I think ................ ... .4 / 10.
