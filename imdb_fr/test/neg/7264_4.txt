I have never been a big fan of Almodovar, but in general I have always found something to appreciate in his films. Unfortunately, I had more trouble finding something to enjoy in Broken Embraces than I normally thought. <br /> <br /> I find that the biggest failure of Broken Embraces lies in the characters and the lack of depth they display. The film is essentially a tragic love story that wants to involve the viewer in their stories. I found this problem from the beginning. <br /> <br /> In the opening scene, our "hero", director / scriptwriter, Mateo, has sex with a very attractive young lady he just met. His agent enters and the woman goes shyly. <br /> <br /> In the opening scene, our "hero", director / scriptwriter, Mateo, has sex with a very attractive young woman he just met. His agent comes in and rolls his eyes when the woman goes shyly. Mateo babbles something about the need to enjoy life as the only thing left to him. Blinded in a tragic car accident that also killed his "real" love, Lena, played by Penelope Cruz, the viewer could subscribe to this notion, unless the rest of the film never really illustrates why Lena was love of his life. depth of his character or any other. <br /> <br /> Cruz plays Lena the mistress of an industrialist named Ernesto Martel. From the beginning, their union is rather pathetic, Martel jealousing against Lena and Lena avoids the uncertainty of staying alone while staying with the older Martel. To move on, Martel is funding a film for Mateo so he can keep an eye on the star of the movie, Lena. Naturally, without history, Lena and Mateo fall in love. And in the world of Almodovar, it's as simple as that. Mateo, in the opening scene, sleeps with a sexy young woman. Mateo falls in love with Lena. Later, it is revealed that he had a son with his agent after their love affair. His son responds to this information with a laugh and a "Oh, well." Again, no depth, no understanding for any of these characters, everything is just right. From the beginning to the end of the film, Mateo did not feel deep emotion. It is flat and does not play very differently from one scene to another. <br /> <br /> One of the scenes I enjoyed was when the film producer, Martel, watched a video clip that his son recorded under the pretext of making a documentary by Mateo. There is a beautiful moment when Martel looks obsessed while a lip reading confirms his worst fears. Later, Lena confronts Martel as he looks at the pictures and says his part out loud, matching the video images of his lips as she speaks. Some pretty brilliant moments. Rather artificial, but still really fascinating. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately for me, the rest of the film left me a little bored. I did not care about these characters or their situations, so no intelligence on the part of Almodovar can compensate for this lack of depth. I think if you're a fan of his work, you'll enjoy this movie, but if you're like me, in between, you'll find it inadequate.
