Shemp discovers he will inherit a million dollars if he is married within 24 hours. Given his ugly appearance and his personality, it is not surprising that he can not rely on a taker - that is, until an article explaining his unpleasant situation - appears at that moment when five crazy women appear from nowhere. their new husband (plus money of course). <br /> <br /> Although I do not hate the Three Stooges and like to watch their shorts on occasion, they have never come close, even the happiest day of their lives. the brilliant comedy of Buster Keaton. That's why I did not like this movie, because it was a scam of the plot of Keaton's masterpiece, SEVEN CHANCES. With the Stooges, it was not uncommon for Columbia Pictures to steal old comedy scenes or simply recycle old shoos. So, from the beginning, this film is a pale imitation of an original. It is also obvious that this film lacks the charm and subtlety of the original and that gags generally seem very forced (especially the scene of the phone booth). The cousin Basil, however, was rather cute and funny - although far from subtle! However, the worst aspect of the movie was the conclusion not particularly amusing. In the Keaton version, hundreds of women seemed to marry her and the action became very fast and furious. Here, everything has remained in a small room and has no comic punch, ending in sparkling. <br /> <br /> Overall, a dull retreading. Also, before you mark this review as "useless", be sure to check SEVEN CHANCES first to see what I'm talking about - then you decide.
