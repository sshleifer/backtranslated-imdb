Man where I start, everything about this comic book, from episodes to stories, to screenplay, to animation, is to me the most stupid, stupid and boring film that Walt Disney Television Animation ever created and I'm so happy that both (2006) and Disney Channel will stop broadcasting it in the US as early as May 2008. <br /> <br /> Believe me, it's wise not to use this casting and this black cloud of a cartoon, if you look at it Do not say that I did not alert you. <br /> <br /> Your bargain right and right, I wish and pray never to have seen 1 episode of this animated Buzz Lightyear Of Star Command. If I could, I would remove the part of my brain that remembers watching it, that's right and it was so bad.
