In my opinion, a good documentary - especially a document dealing with controversial political issues - should be informative and as impartial as possible. The point should be to reveal the truth. This includes interviewing subject matter experts and representatives from all parties. This film is a failure in this regard. Most of the interviews included in this film consist of "street men" who expose the issue of peace in the Holy Land. The wall itself, supposedly subject of the film, is not the subject of any serious treatment. For most interviews, the interviewer simply waits to be contacted and asks general questions such as "What do you think of the wall?" - she does not approach people chosen near the wall and does not ask them how they were directly affected. Apart from a person interviewed, the Israeli general in charge of the construction of the wall, we have no "expert" on the subject to provide us with the context of the wall (for example, how and when did the project take place? he started and who against the project, etc.) <br /> <br /> Apart from the interviews, a very large part of the film consists of prolonged shots of scenes without incident, such as frontal shots of the wall, the construction of the wall, and the people who get off a bus. These shots take a lot of time, in my opinion. It's nice to see what the wall looks like, but the 20-30 minutes of turning the wall (and only the wall) is excessive. It is clear that these clich√©s (accompanied by Arabic music that expresses a sense of mourning) were included for the sole purpose of arousing the viewer's hatred of the wall.
