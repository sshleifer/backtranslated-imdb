Now it's a bad movie if I've ever seen one. In one of the film's greatest years, 1999, Detroit Rock City fights with Runaway Bride and Wild Wild West for the last rank in a barrel of junkies. The plot is masterful. Four skinny high school students finally have the opportunity to see KISS hard rock film for the third year in a row. So when their tickets are worked by an ultra-religious, chain-smoking mom, friends scramble to go to Detroit, and I'm sure you can understand the rest. <br /> <br /> Well, not exactly. ; the film goes to the extreme to explain how the four members of the group (no, not Gene, Paul, Ace and Peter) go about getting these tickets: losing your virginity in a confessional; save a smoked bimbo and your mother's Volvo (Steve Schirripa of the Soprano, nonetheless); prevent a robbery robbing the debt of a 12-year-old child; and of course, you'll need everything for MC, Jeremy, after using a full blender with bourbon leftovers. Sounds funny, does not it? Maybe Detroit Rock City is right to say how extreme these fans can be. And we understand that this film is a comedy; it is supposed to be filled with slapstick. But does Detroit Rock City target the right audience? It is rated R, which means that prepubescent teens are the only way - the public as I see it, which many will eventually welcome this one of classic voyeur - goes through illegal terms. <br /> <br /> The city of Detroit Rock also fails. to give the touch of the late 1970s. The quality of the camera's texture is far too bright and too bright, missing the necessary flair of movies like This is Spinal Tap and Sid & Nancy. This would have allowed the audience to feel "more comfortable" with its time. It is not enough to encourage children to wear a grunge garment before the 90s and to settle other children in "disco hells". The environment means something you know; I doubt that Detroit looked so glamorous in 1978. If there's anything positive about this film, it's the hard rock soundtrack from the late '70s to the early' 80s. Van Halen, AC / DC, you name it, everything is there. Of course, we can not forget KISS, the perfectly submissive group. <br /> <br /> What the film visibly lacks to handle is the question of why the Knights of Satin's Service (it's just KISS) have been so frowned upon by moms across the country. Of course, powerful rock and evil makeup could be part of it; Encouraging young people to explore themselves and have a good time can also be good reasons. But what does KISS say in the music we hear throughout the film about this very rebel group? What separates these hymns from rock and music all night and from the party every day from the rest of the music? Most likely, these questions will remain in a class of musical communication and not in the films that should answer them, simply because it is KISS and they rock and we must do everything in our power forgiven by God for see them. <br />1.5/5 stars
