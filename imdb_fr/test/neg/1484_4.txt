It may be time to declare 2007 the International Year of the Crocodile! The ridiculous "Primeval" came first, about a fang named Gustave (!) Who governs the swamps of Burundi. Then there was "Lake Placid 2", a discreet suite made for television of a forgotten original. Thirdly, there is this incredibly derivative and soporific piece of Australian horror and, finally, I have not yet seen the promising "Snape". The latter is likely to be the best, given the involvement of Greg McLean ("Wolf Creek"), the Australian talent of horror. "Black Water" is certainly not a waste of time and film, but it is another rather useless survival film that confuses the agony of real life with horror. Forgive me for being outspoken, especially since I am truly sorry for the people who have gone through this ordeal, but representing three characters sitting in a tree and whining for over an hour is not my idea of ​​suspense! Three young people cross the north of Australia and decide to spend a day fishing in isolated swamps. It does not take long before a gigantic and ferocious crocodile capsizes their little boat and devours the guide. Grace, Lee and Adam can barely escape the hungry teeth of the reptile by climbing a tree. Although it remains invisible most of the time, the crocodile waits patiently and prevents them from leaving the marsh alive. Yes, it looks a lot like the plot of "Open Water". Replace the many invisible sharks with an invisible giant crocodile and the open sea with an unmissable Australian swamp, and you're done. Well, "Black Water" presents at least some rare moments of excitement and an aquatic monster with impressive design. It must be said that the crocodile looks fabulously groovy and that you eagerly count the countdown every time he comes out of the water savagely. Three-headed actors do everything they can to keep their characters interesting, but how do you do this by sitting in a tree all the time? The concept based on true events obviously imposes a number of restrictions, such as limited images of fantastic filming locations, dialogues and drawings of kind characters.
