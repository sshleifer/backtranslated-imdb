"Shade" strives to be another "sting", substituting poker for horse racing as a way to knock down an enemy, but it fails miserably. <br /> <br /> I watched everything and I never could I fully understand why the boy wanted to double his partner. Was it because his partner had stolen his daughter? Is there a woman in the world who is worthy of tackling this problem? If there is, it certainly was not this shrew. She had no redeeming quality, and really now, had she actually set up a special room so that a surgeon could pick up the kidney of anyone trying to take it to a bar? Dina Merrill appears briefly as a rich woman who organizes, among other things, paid poker games in her palace. And then the players say things like, "I'm going to see your thousands and get you five thousand more." Leave me alone. You can not call ("see") and increase, you do one or the other. Any child playing for nickels and dimes at the kitchen table knows it. you would think that adult men playing for such high stakes, or at least the players who wrote the script, will know it too. <br /> <br /> One of the other posters mentioned the lack of high-limit poker game would allow players to actually distribute their own cards and I agree. You do not allow two of the best-known car cheats in a $ 250,000 buy-in game and then let them take care of each other. It's not poker, it's just to see which one can cheat better. And I would like to know what sensible person would want to participate in a game in which two of the best-known card cheats play and expect him to have a chance to win? And above all, what boss of the mafia would organize such a game? Whenever Melanie Griffith appeared on the screen, I was fascinated by her gigantic red fluorescent lips, to the point that I completely lost the screenplay. To see her with Stallone together was more like a public service announcement for a rotten plastic surgery than a romantic relationship. Stallone mentions that she used to be a complainant before buying the restaurant she runs now, but we do not know what kind of complainant she was and we never see her working with Stallone in their youth, so we wonder if we care much about it. <br /> <br /> Jamie Foxx is the best character in the entire movie, but he gets killed right off the bat and we stay with cardboard cutouts that sound like they're 'We read their lines with a teleprompter that stands aside. <br /> <br /> The end does not make sense either. The kid pulls out of the game and walks down the street with a briefcase full of money and his partner is nowhere else. The mafia does not look at every move he makes? Everyone shrugs and quietly accepts the loss of millions of dollars without trying to recover any money? I do not think so. <br /> <br /> Above all, this film is a great injustice to professional poker players around the world, insinuating that the only way to win is to take cards and play with "bridges." And why is this? that they always palate kings and aces Sometimes you need three or nine to fill a suite or a full house. <br /> <br /> The best parts of the whole movie are the towers. There's a generics of the beginning and the end, everything in between is ridiculous.
