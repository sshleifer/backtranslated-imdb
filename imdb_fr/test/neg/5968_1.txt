If this film was simply outrageously poor would go well, the problem is that many take it seriously. To summarize, a few points: <br /> <br /> - There is no story, no focus, no track at all and all the questions asked can not be answered. Overall, the film is extremely repetitive and boring (I have been to war torn African countries many times and found it very painful to watch local misery and despair very painful to watch but not still having no meaning). <br /> <br /> - The issues raised are pure manipulation and the truth is that they are not questions but statements. <br /> <br /> - I am not a filmmaker, but what is the point of raising, for example, the issue of arms trafficking, if the only element presented to the audience is the statement of a local journalist? The director does not even bother to show us at least one sequence where he would be waiting near the airport to try to spot heavily laden trucks leaving the area immediately after landing an airplane. <br /> <br /> - The story of the fish takes less than 5 minutes and is supported only by a sequence in which the director films a documentary presented at a local conference. Did this guy do any work? <br /> <br /> - Abject poverty is shown all the time in endless sequences, but where is the point? You can go almost anywhere in Africa with a handheld camera and shoot the same pictures unfortunately. Where are the big news? <br /> <br /> - Filming prostitutes watching and crying images of their murdered friend and neighbor is worth the worst emotional manipulations that can be seen today in thrash and real television. <br /> <br /> - The parallel established between the famine that ravages the country with more than two million hungry people and the export of fish is absolutely useless and dishonest and makes no sense if it is not manipulate viewers in a typically anti-globalization and anti-Western spirit. <br /> <br /> There is an interesting debate in France after an academic has published a very detailed commentary on the film, which has led many journalists working in Africa for decades to deepen their research on several details . It turns out that: <br /> <br /> - Fish waste that dries in the sun and is collected by some local people are not intended to be eaten by humans, but are collected for export at a reasonable price. animal nutrition. I think I'm not the only one who felt that the director had suggested exactly the opposite. <br /> <br /> - Arm smuggling is a reality (but then again, where are the big news?), But not the This movie explains the question. If the empty planes landing at Mwanza smuggle, they unload their cargo in a different place in Africa, then go to Mwanza to catch the fish so as not to make the trip empty (which means they will actually land at empty). Mwanza ...). <br /> <br /> - People eat fish on the spot, contrary to what the film suggests (about 40 to 60% of what is caught in the lake) and thousands of people live on their livelihood. he. Good for them! It is a private enterprise of this kind that will one day lift African countries out of poverty and not out of moaning and endless foreign aid. <br /> <br /> I can not say how shocked I am about the success of this movie!
