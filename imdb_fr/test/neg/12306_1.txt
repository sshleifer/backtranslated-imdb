No redemptive feature, this movie is nil. His jokes do not start to be funny. Humor for kids is pathetic, and attempts to appeal to adults only add a sticky touch to this miserable package. Sitting through this with my kids made me feel uncomfortable about what might be coming. I could not enjoy the movie at all. Although my child for whom the DVD was purchased appreciated the fact that he had a new DVD, neither she nor her sisters expressed the greatest interest in seeing him again, unlike Monsters Inc., Finding Nemo, The Book of the jungle, The Lion King, etc. receive frequent requests for replays.
