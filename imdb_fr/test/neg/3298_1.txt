What is Fox's fascination with dysfunctional families, made up of naughty, hateful, spoiled kids and parents determined to be cool, rather than being a parent? I'm sorry, I do not understand. The only episode I was barely able to see in the stomach was one of the children who was asking for a Bar Mitzvah, in order to get thousands of dollars in cash as a gift. Of course, the silly mother decides that her precious little junior has to organize the biggest party of all the tests and has no problem to drop $ 20,000 during the big event. The girl, brain crazy and dead in the brain, loves to be fiercely Jewish then Catholic, when she sees the "cute" religious guardians. <br /> <br /> The only "comforting" limit of the whole episode world, was when the putz of a father, who was convinced all the time that the Bar Mitzvah is only a ploy to win money. money, sees the son studying his Hebrew lessons, and is momentarily deceived into thinking that his offspring are sincere about the right of passage to adulthood. This feeling of warmth and blur is immediately torn when he informs the junior that, as he has not yet had a break, a certain "procedure" must be performed. The Bar Mitzvah is canceled and the mother is missing several thousand dollars when the kid refuses to obey. <br /> <br /> This show is hogwash and I am saddened never to be able to recover the 23 minutes of I lost my life watching this shit, because nothing else was on TV. ..
