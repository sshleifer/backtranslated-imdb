I almost fell asleep while projecting this. From a boring story that seems to last forever, it follows several days in the life of a prostitute who falls in love with one of his tricks. After a stormy connection, the trick leaves a long letter explaining why they can not be together and how they must separate. <br /> <br /> The prostitute then embarks on a self-destructive spiral to try to find his "only true love", repeatedly returning to the same places they frequented, looking for clues or signs allowing him to locate his love. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, he met an ugly guy. (who, I thought, was also a prostitute man), a gay boy, and a guy who ends up having a "three-second sex session" with him in an alley. <br /> <br /> It never stops I'm amazed at how movies still describe random sex acts like scenes that can take place in just a few seconds, as in the case where the trick barely the pants undone before being pushed three times and miraculously make orgasm! <br /> <br /> All these random encounters end with the sexual partner who asks him to call him, to which he discards his phone numbers. <br /> <br /> There is a brief parallel plot involving the main character visiting his busy mother who seems to have no time to live. There is also another parallel plot that involves a random conversation with a young woman who has noticed her several times, standing on the deck from her window. And there is also another parallel plot involving him to show the letter to a male acquaintance, but the public is not informed of his relationship with that person. <br /> <br /> None of these things really relate to each other. only to show how much this young man is lost and confused. He seems to live his life like a ghost. There was a good scene in the whole movie in which he had searched in an auction looking for a record containing the world's saddest song. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, this film seems to last forever. Filmed in black and white, it may sound very dreamlike, but staying in the theater for almost two hours watching this training would be more like a nightmare! <br /> <br /> I found the end embarrassing You do not really know if the young man died and went to heaven? It would have been a good reward to put an end to the misery that the public and the main character had to endure in this insignificant tripe. But since this is an "independent film", movies with endings like these are supposed to encourage you to "use your imagination". <br /> <br /> For those of you who are looking for nudity, there are only brief scenes and most of them are filmed so that all that is suggestive is concealed with art in the dark. In other words, do not waste your time with this one. <br /> <br /> My ranking - 2 of 10
