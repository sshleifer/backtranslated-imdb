I know it's hard for you, Americans, to find European films on video / DVD, especially the 80s, but look for the original version of Vanishing - title Spoorloos (1988) - and you'll understand why the Hollywood version of The Vanishing screw up bigtime, especially during the final. <br /> <br /> I really like Sandra Bullock, Kiefer Sutherland and especially Jeff Bridges, but it's so bad compared to the original. What were they thinking? Can you imagine Seven with a happy ending with Gwyneth Paltrow in the arms of Brad Pitt in the final? The original was a major international success because of the shocking finale. So, why do you accept this kind of shyte remake? Really, avoid this and GET THE ORIGINAL.
