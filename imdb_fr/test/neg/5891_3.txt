Honestly, I was expecting more from this movie. That might be the problem. There was not a moment when the camera was still - never. On close-ups, the camera shakes, the subjects move and my head hurts. The cuts are so frequent and so fast that the viewer often wonders what has just happened. (IN SEARCH, SPOILER ALERT) And at the end of the film, when you expect a happy ending after being confronted with such a useless thought to understand what is happening, they end up losing. For me, it was a fundamentally terrible movie, destroyed by a cameraman with ADHD, and devoid of any significant plot.
