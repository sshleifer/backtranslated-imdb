Michael Bassett's film 'Solomon Kane' (based on the character of the same name created by Robert E. Howard) is a disappointing film from Fantasy Action-Adventure, which, despite some genius scenes, falls flat with its awkward pace, its bad characterization and general dullness. Solomon Kane (James Purefoy) is a mercenary of Queen Elizabeth's army fighting in Africa, where he is face to face with the devil's mower. a demon that covers the debts of the devil, that is to say the souls ?? refusing to go to hell for the moment, he escapes the Grim Reaper and begins a new life in an English monastery. With this new life, Solomon left behind his culture of violence and bloodshed and now embraces the values ​​of peace and non-values. But once expelled from the monastery for fear of the return of the Devil's Mower, he must return to his home in Devon and become friends with a family of Puritans on a journey to the New World. During their journey through the British counties, the family is attacked and their daughter Meredith (Rachel Hurd-Wood) is kidnapped by the army of the wicked wizard Malachi, who is led on the front lines by the mysterious Masked Rider. From now on a man of peace, Solomon must return to his old life as a man of unrepentant violence and destruction to save Meredith. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that it has a great source of information on which to work exciting and lasting medieval action-adventure movie, the film fails in three key areas. The pace of this film is terrible, which can have a lot to do with its incredibly short running time of just an hour and forty minutes (and that's probably a consequence of the fact that they want to turn this film into a trilogy ). Constantly going from drama and self-characterization to that of the action and the muddy bloodbath somewhat kills the excitement of the action sequences. Rather than leaving the audience on the edge of their seats dripping with eagle-eyed anticipation, the movie seems incredibly subdued, which follows the next criticism, dull. Although presented as an action-adventure film or, in some circles, an epic action, Solomon Kane almost certainly is not. The action is banal and dull, and is usually over before you have the chance to admire the beauty of a beheading. Finally, apart from Solomon himself, there are very few characterizations in this film. For example, we know very little, and because of that, we do not care about the young woman Soloman sets out to save her country. And I imagine again that the director would refer to this criticism to the fact that there would most likely be a second film that would, hopefully, address the aspects that this film would surely have missed. <br /> <br /> This is not an absolutely terrible movie though. James Purefoy gives a fantastic performance as Solomon, the mercenary who has to decide whether to fall back on his conscience or his blade, and how his decisions will impact not only himself, but also those who surround. Respect, admiration and gratitude must also benefit Bassett and his team, who have created vibrant places that reflect the period in which they are playing. It is sometimes difficult not to get excited by admiring the beauty of the place, the composition of the scenes and the staging presented here. This shows that a lot of time and effort have been devoted to this film. Unfortunately, it's not the same for the story and the characters. "Solomon Kane" certainly had the potential to be something more than an "epic of action", but it seems once again that the lack of real depth in the story and the characters led Michael Bassett to create nothing more than a dimensional look at the sword during the medieval period.
