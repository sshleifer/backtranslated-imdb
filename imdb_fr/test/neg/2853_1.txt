I sincerely wonder why this film was made. An Italian-Bulgarian coproduction that takes place in a version of Berlin where all Germans speak English with a German accent and where all Turks speak English with some Turkish words between the two is hardly credible. The English vocabulary is essentially limited to "fuck you, bastard" and the acting is worse than anyone can imagine. Apart from that, racial tensions in Germany may be an interesting subject, but in Germany, I know there are no gangs shooting in the middle of the street, in broad daylight. And if all that is not enough, there is also a serial killer who kills Turkish children and paints them in white. In order to create a certain tension, we see the serial killer and hear him humming Schubert's lullaby, but we will not see his face. <br /> <br /> I do not even think they actually shot it in Germany. There are street pictures that are obviously in Berlin, but the actors are not visible. It's probably Bulgaria with some German signs added here and there.
