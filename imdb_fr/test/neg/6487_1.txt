The so-called "queen of the scream", Debbie Rochon and her group of border prostitutes go to the west of the place of the title and face horrific murders that turn out to be the work of a cult of ex-Confederate psychopaths who try to resurrect the south with useless slaughter. > <br /> The action and the suspense are relegated to the cradle of a boring dialogue and an uninteresting development of character. <br /> <br /> Billy Draco plays the ungrateful (not to say useless) role of the mortifying city man, but everything else about this western slasher wannabe is extremely poor, including the city and the fort, both of which resemble modern tourist traps and costumes that appear to have been purchased at Party City. <br /> <br /> Make yourself a great favor and watch Ravenous instead.
