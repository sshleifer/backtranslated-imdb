A child puppeteer, who participates in a public performance, goes deep down when he finds out that the children he receives at the hospital have been horribly abused. This movie has some of the worst untold monstrous parents you could ever meet. Not an exploitation film as much as a special extracurricular program on the dangers of child abuse. In appearance harmless, Mr. Rabby takes matters into his own hands when it seems that the police are sterilized by the lack of evidence to condemn repugnant parents for their terrible abuse of their children. The children feel no emotion and look like zombies (because of the amount of abuse they have been inflicted), parents are strong, inconceivably harsh, despicable and bellicose. Mothers, in particular, are so obscene that you will ask for them to be executed. They are essentially miserable people who take their frustrations for their children. Our detectives are tired, frustrated by the entire judicial process, police proceedings are often unable to sue those who submitted their children to submission. Although the crimes themselves are odious, the film does not explicitly state the macabre activity on the screen. I would say that the reason for seeing this is due to Tom Basham's performance as an unbalanced child-man slipping into psychosis. Shortly after the murder of the parents responsible for the death of their child, Mr. Rabbey and his tutor witnessed a rather strange sequence at the dinner table. She tells how he lives in a fantasy and how what he had just done left an indelible mark. (Note the behavioral changes, quite awesome work, ranging from innocent to scary). Peter Renaday is Lieutenant Hayes, the detective in charge of homicide cases, visibly expressing the tension that weighs heavily on him. As a Matthews detective, John Ashton played early in the music, highlighting Hayes' anger over his inability to follow instructions, as well as his opinion of parents abusing their children. A casual and clumsy bluesy note that seems inappropriate for a movie like this. Controversial finding that even children can not tolerate so much. A little too slow to my taste, but I felt that Basham's eyes had been used effectively before he took care of business, waiting patiently while he was preparing to strike.
