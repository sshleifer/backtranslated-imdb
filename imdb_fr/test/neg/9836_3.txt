A young man named Danny escaped from his home and met a vagabond named Bix, who agreed to follow Danny and pay attention to him ... and his money. They end up in a small town where they meet Carrie, a shy and naive girl who works in her father's restaurant. Bix starts to see Carrie, but he plans to leave soon (because he's a vagabond, you know, he's not good! Meanwhile, the scourge of the city, Jesse (played by a Jack Elam in the perfect cast), continues to present at dinner and bother Carrie. Danny inadvertently picks up the whores (because he is laden with money - he has almost a hundred bucks!) That Bix has to constantly hunt (there are a lot of ambiguous homosexual nuances between Danny and Bix in this movie). In the end, Bix and Danny decide to leave town, but the problem is serious, because of Jesse's creep. <br /> <br /> My criticism of the film itself: a terrible film "Troubled Youth" of the 50s. <br /> <br /> My review of the MST3K version of the movie: I must say that this is one of the best episodes of MST3K of all time. Riffing is all the time. Except for the somewhat disappointing ending, this film is an easy subject for Joel and the Bots, especially Danny's constant failures which Bix has to save. The host segments are very good too, especially the segment with "Train Song". Let's hope that Rhino publishes this episode in family video someday.
