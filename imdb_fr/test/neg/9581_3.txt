Mount Godwin-Austin (also known as K2) is the second highest mountain in the world, and according to the evidence presented in this film, it is the most difficult mountain to climb successfully without to get killed. "K2" is basically a film in the breathtaking world of mountaineering. While outdoor photography embraces truly impressive landscapes, the characters who stand in front of all these glorious landscapes are bored - and that is where the whole film lies. <br /> <br /> Cocksure's lawyer, Taylor Brooks (Michael Biehn) and his married friend, Harold Jamieson (Matt Craven), spend their free time climbing. During one of their trips, they met another group of mountaineers funded by the rich mountain enthusiast Philip Claibourne (Raymond J. Barry). Claibourne's team is training for an upcoming shot on the infamous K2, a mountain that Taylor and Harold both would like to face but could never afford to do. However, during their training, two members of the Claibourne team are killed in an avalanche. Taylor and Harold introduced themselves as potential replacements. Despite initial reluctance, Claibourne expressed their approval and both found themselves joining his team in the Himalayas. Harold's wife, Cindy (Julia Nickson-Soul), is upset that her husband will face such a dangerous climb, especially since he recently became a father. Tensions in the climbing team increase as Taylor clashes several times with another member of the group, the arrogant and arrogant Dallas Woolf (Luca Bercovici). Meanwhile, Claibourne himself gets sicker as altitude sickness hits his body. Will the guys reach the top of the K2 or is their quest doomed to failure or even death? <br /> <br /> "K2" spends an excessively long time presenting her somewhat hateful characters. It is particularly difficult to appreciate Biehn as an impolite, adventurous and daring guy, as well as Barry as a hardy millionaire in the field of mountaineering. But on the other side of the coin, Craven is so boring that it's hard to believe that his wife could care less about his departure to climb the K2. She would be better if he never came back !! Bercovici complements the main characters and embodies Dallas Woolf as campy and daring as any other role he has ever played. The story itself is totally tamed and disposable ?? just a simple thread on guys trying to reach the top of a mountain. There is a bit of masculine connection thrown in, but all the subplot about Harold and his wife is void, and the personality clashes between Taylor and Dallas are totally false. "K2" draws its merits only from the superb cinematography of Gabriel Berastain ?? during the Himalayan sequences, the scale and fear of the mountains are fairly well captured. I totally agree with the critic Kim Newman on the latter, who said hilariously in the Empire magazine: "Based on this evidence, the rise of the K2 can not be more difficult than sit down! " Quite true, Kim, absolutely true!
