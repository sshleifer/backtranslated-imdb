The combination of Dan Haggerty (Elves) and Linda Blair (Exorcist) is enough to excite all the horror fans about this movie. And once you see the cover of this film depicting a frozen zombie coming out of their cryogenic chamber, you'll think you're in B-Movie Horror Heaven. At least that's how I approached this movie. But damn it, I was in shock <br /> <br /> I like horror movies. I also like B-Movies. Nothing makes my day more than a little movie about zombies, monsters, murderers, that sort of thing. But to say that this film was lacking, it's a euphemism. This film was a pure basket. One would think that zombies look a little like what the box poster displays, but instead, you get actors with masks that are clearly sold at all Halloween display counters. In addition, the script is more than pitiful. Our main character, Joseph, suffers from the loss of his wife and son and seeks solace in the warm Mary, played by Blair. Not once, you see no sign of sadness or discomfort on the part of Joseph's character. Instead, we see the head of the cryogenic labs, a man named Dr. Miller, eager to recover the bodies and to experiment with their organs. There is no emotion or anything to make you think you should be interested in anyone in this movie. <br /> <br /> Everyone, very disappointing. All the elements to make a big horror movie were there. You had your zombies, your honest actors and your story. But the lack of good writing and little or no sense of direction have royally messed up this one. In total, 4 out of 10
