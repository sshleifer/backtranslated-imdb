Pretty, stereotypical, beautiful casting, the story unfolds in a wide and confused arc, leading you on a number of garden paths (without auxiliary fairies) before collapsing to an end that lets you go - hollow. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a film that has reached its peak or that ends with a satisfying momentum, you will be disappointed. Despite the theoretically open sexuality of the main character, I thought he was androgynous, devoid of a clear masculine personality, as if he did not have a clear French personality. Even if it is theoretically naked (or rather naked) at the end of the film, the viewer is as ignorant of the character as the motives - this little thing called intrigue. Probably a stereotypical point of view speaking English, at least if you take the side of the film.
