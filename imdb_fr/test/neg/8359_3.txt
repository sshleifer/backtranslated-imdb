There must be a lot of background information that has been left out of the movie. In fact, in the movie, the girl, Lizzy, did not even seem depressed. She seemed to be a girl who had lost control when she first came to university, mainly because of her drug and alcohol use. It seemed like his problem, not a mental illness. Of course, she had emotional problems because her father was gone and she hardly saw him as a child, and her mother seemed a little outside. But the way she treated Noah and Ruby was just mean and I do not think it's caused by depression. She needed a lot of things, which escaped Rafe, but she was like that because of her father. <br /> <br /> But, I think the main reason why this movie never got a release at the theater is that there is not enough intrigue and the story is not well written. <br /> <br /> FINAL VERDICT: Honestly, I would only recommend it if you are interested in seeing the first scene of Ricci's nude. Otherwise, it is not very interesting.
