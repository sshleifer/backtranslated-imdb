First and foremost, I'm interested in the title of this film. "Chupacabra" is not a Spanish word. The name they refer to is "Chupacabras". I guess they dropped the 's' because it sounds like a lot, but I assure you it's singular in Spanish. <br /> <br /> Then I thought this movie was made years ago. It became one of those horror B movies I watched when I was a teenager at home when my stepfather was out of town. It would have been pretty scary. <br /> <br /> Let's talk about special effects. The most important effect is the costume used for Chupacabras. Since he is the main character, one might think that large sums would have been invested, but that is not the case. The shape, the color and the texture were all ridiculous as in a stupid haunted house of Disney World. <br /> <br /> It sometimes happened that the Chupacabras walked without anyone being able to walk. His movements were jerky and strange at that time, but moving on the floor looked like any normal man. <br /> <br /> Another thing that annoys me is that there are no animals in the world that kill everything. he sees without regard to actually eating it. The Chupacrabas would kill one, then another, but they never seemed to eat the victim. You say, "It's just a movie" and I agree. But the idea is so far away that it's stupid. <br /> <br /> From which country does Dr. Pena come? He looks a bit like Jamaincan / Hawaiian / British / Something-Else, but I think he's supposed to be Latino. The problem is that his accent is so serious that even a Russian might realize he was not Latino. <br /> <br /> The soldiers fired a shot at them, without doing anything, but they continued. shoot. I am not a soldier, but should not soldiers, especially special tactical forces like this, have a little bit of mind to perform their duties? Would not they understand that it was a waste of time to turn around and try something new? They do not have. They just kept firing as the Chupacabras continued to slaughter and not eat them. <br /> <br /> Should they kill the little dog? :) Anyway, my vote was 3 for this movie, because it was bad. Why did I look at everything? I'm sure you've done the same thing on occasion, so do not let me down. ;)
