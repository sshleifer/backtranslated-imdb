** Maybe the spoilers ** ** are hard to mess up this thing more than it is, but just in case ** Gee, I do not see how anyone could have liked this recreation! ! It was like a show "made for T.V" and still pretty bad for that. A lot of fake snow, bad actions of big stars, bad actions and that crazy pine forest in Detroit. What the hell??!! I did not really think it would be a good movie, but I was hoping to be entertained. No, we fell asleep halfway and had to finish the next day. I could have skipped the rest easily (but I would have missed those beautiful piney woods!). I'm so happy to have missed that in the theater! Enough to have wasted $ 3.50 at the video store. And I'm a lover of crime, action and drama movies. It was a very stinky 1 out of 10 stars. Give me the original everyday!
