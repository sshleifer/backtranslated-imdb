It's almost embarrassing to say that I even saw this movie. I mean it does not take much to make a good movie of zombies apart from good special effects, lots of blood and blood, scary moments and a decent plot. Does House of the Dead 2 do some of these things properly? No, not one. Of course, it's not as bad as its predecessor, Uwe Bowle, and it's the only thing that scares me in this movie. <br /> <br /> The dialogue in this film is notorious, with lines such as do to live? "In response," I kill the zombies "and" I've never been a disc jockey, I was a soldier. "The special effects are annoying even for a TV movie, I mean seriously, the zombies all have feeling bloody lips on crack background The army base in this film is a parking garage, with a desk and a closed room.This film is so small that they could not even have In fact, it seems that all this film was shot in an intermediate school. <br /> <br /> In addition, why are all the female soldiers of this film models? And for this reason Why is everyone in this movie so ignorant of all that's left to do is let the zombies kill them ... Heck a guy is even trying to feed the zombie. <br /> <br /> Overall, this film gives a fantastic appearance to the worst films in the Scifi channel.
