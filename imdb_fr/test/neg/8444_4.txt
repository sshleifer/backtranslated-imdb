Obviously, this is not the "Piranha" directed by Joe Dante and produced by Roger Corman. It was not so obvious, when I bought the DVD for only $ 2.95, because the cover of the DVD corresponded to that of the comedy / horror produced by Corman "Piranha". Even the DVD menu (without functions of course) matched the cover. Halfway through watching this strange movie, my girlfriend and I started to wonder: where are the PIRANHAS? Once the film reached its peak, we realized we had to watch the bad movie, as we had seen the trailer, which featured completely different sequences. The presentation text on the back of the DVD does not correspond to the story we were watching and the credits (actors, producer, director) were also completely different. Instead, we had a jungle melodrama about a girl and two guys who go out in search of diamonds and end up fighting a vicious hunter. This tame exploitation thriller is boring and useless and is only slightly fun for the old school, camp value. Strange that a DVD can be made with the wrong film tactfully, but I guess it's an easy mistake to pretend that it was the same quality B movies shot in the '70s. Other articles published on this film, I noticed that I'm not the only one to have the wrong movie on the DVD. How could this be an international mistake? Is there perhaps a kind of DVD phenomenon where unsuccessful movies try to be recognized by being placed on bad DVDs? WHAT IS GOING ON???
