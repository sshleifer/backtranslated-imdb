INFERNO starts with a pretty impressive effect for a starscape TVM effect. We are also introduced to a scientist named Heller. You do not get it? Heller, Hell-er, Inferno. So, I guess someone on the production had some intelligence. However, as the TVM progresses, it becomes increasingly clear that the information has been abandoned throughout the plot to appeal to an American TVM audience <br /> <br /> the hard-working liberal teacher trying to save a boy from the house of a criminal life, the doctor who lost his medical license, and so on. In fact, the story focuses much more on these characters than on the imminent disaster whose all the potential tensions and dramas of the scenario could quickly awaken, and as TVM, we know that there will not be of lost time. ending <br /> <br /> There is a problem on the screen that I noticed and that is that every time there is an explosion, there is a massive fireball that looks ridiculous not to mention physically impossible. Watch the scene where the National Guard is fighting with a gang. A soldier shoots a grenade into a tower and the whole building explodes into a fireball. What a small greanade containing only a few ounces of powerful explosive can do that! No, it can not. There is also another scene of army engineers blowing up a dam with a plastic explosive and you can see the same fireball effect. Can filmmakers note that explosive is not the same thing as napalm <br /> <br /> That said, I found INFERNO very attractive for a TVM and I have not at any time had want to disable it. There was a bit of potential and let me repeat that the special effects are pretty good given the budget and it's not as bad TVM as some people do.
