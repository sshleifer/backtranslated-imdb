As a child of the 80s, like so many other commentators, I hated the original versions of V and V: The Final Battle. I own both on VHS and never plug the VCR to watch them. I do not remember much about this short series, but I did not remember why, so I rented the first record. In the third episode, my memory refreshed. It's terrible. Writing is beyond horror. It's not even fun. They had a lot of material to work here, but since they just did not know what to do, they turned it into "Days of Our Lives with the Lizard Aliens". How cool is the concept of Elizabeth the Starchild? All they could think of doing is turning her into a crying, boring teenager, able to compete romantically with her mother. Marc Singer seemed less embarrassed to be in Beastmaster II than when he was trapped in this drivel ... in short, that you are one of the youngest who just discovered V or one of us , the oldest sci-fi fans looking for fun, save and skip this!
