I really despair for women when they talk about this program joke as intellectually appealing and promote the liberation and independence of women. This show is the biggest insult to women after all these libidinous hip-hop videos. If talking like a group of reckless teenagers over 100 dollars in upscale restaurants, blindly buy a useless fashion and go to bed with the nearest male site is considered a way to empower, women's fate Westerners can be sentenced at present. > <br /> Aside from the damage it has caused to the female sex, Sex and the City is not entertaining. Not once, it was funny, captivating, exciting or original. The episodes unfold monotonously. Each character is a factory-made mannequin that behaves the same way for each episode. Not once have any of these shallow and unattractive women evolved. The worst is perhaps the main character Carrie Bradshaw. In addition to looking ugly, his penchant for relationship analysis is trustworthy. In addition to all this, the show portrays men as a band of empty-headed idlers, unable to engage in healthy relationships. Even when there is an honest man, he is sort of described as a bad guy. The total lack of empathy among men is clearly the work of some "progressive" pseudo feminists. <br /> <br /> The saddest aspect of the show is that these women lead a miserable and unhappy life. No intelligent woman would ever envy them. It's a banal show with even more banal characters. The New York Tourism Board must hate the way this garbage appears in their otherwise great city! Fortunately, this train wreck is over! Desperate Housewives is considered the appropriate replacement for the SATC. Although HR can be quite far-fetched, it does explore at least women in more ways than one. Plus, he treats men with more respect and it's fun!
