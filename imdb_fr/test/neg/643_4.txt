After watching this movie on TV, I looked in the IMDB and I guess to my surprise a user rating of 7.6! It's not a good movie. The editing is particularly bad. the bad way the story jumps from one point to another was amateurish and a huge distraction. This is not very commonly done. I agree that the acting was pretty decent, especially Kelly Kapowski, and that the story was quite intriguing.
