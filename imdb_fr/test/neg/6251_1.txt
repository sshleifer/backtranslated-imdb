Even as a big fan of the low-budget horror genre, I could not find this disaster slightly amusing. With a horrible acting game, a painfully generic "plot" and no dimensional characters, no matter how bored and boring you are, this one is not worth your 81 minutes. Do not make the same mistake I made. Rent something else. Nothing else!!!
