Let's face it, a really awful movie, no ... I mean a "really" horrible movie, is a rare thing, strange and beautiful to see. I admit that there is a special place in my heart for films like Plan 9 From Outer Space, Half Caste, Cash, etc. And although I give this movie a 1, I strongly encourage anyone who likes a bad movie for what it is It's really (a bad movie) to find a friend, snacks, something to drink and to take advantage of the special occasion it deserves: Aussie Park Boyz. <br /> <br /> From the first moments of the performance next to each other, the main actor tries to inject intensity directly into the film without ever looking at a camera (a slice of ham straight out of dumb images - leave your heart to Rudolph Valentino) to the sudden conclusion, hey, we're out of the movie, you ... want ... not ... stop ... laugh. <br /> <br /> To summarize the film, it's complete, the Warriors of a poor man are complete. This description should be enough by itself, but then come the wonders of "the scene of the restoration of spaghetti", "the They have their tickets, they will not leave the city now" scene "," These are the Asians! Run! "And more, the only really unacceptable part is a rape filmed for free, apart from that, I challenge you to watch this movie, and I challenge you to find evidence of actors, lines, or of directions, or of those boring and superfluous elements which, according to the so-called critic, consider that a film should be considered good. <br /> <br /> If this film does not provoke uncontrollable laughter before In the end, I can only roll my eyes threateningly and shout, "Dog, my dog! My dog, my dog! ! "
