Maybe James P. Lay knows how to do in the sound department if a director supervises it. <br /> <br /> In 'Dreamland (2007)', however, he can not accomplish anything as a writer or director. <Br /> <br /> There is absolutely nothing in this film, no story, no character building, no events, no atmosphere, no plot, no twists, no game action that deserves this name. <br /> <br /> In all this film is billions of light years late on any short film that contains ideas, even a minute. <br /> <br /> It has nothing to do with David Lynch's works! <br /> <br /> I actually think it could be used as a mental torture or as a negative propaganda material against the West. <br /> <br /> Only recommend it to your worst enemies!
