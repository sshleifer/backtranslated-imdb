Like a lot of comments above me, I also thought it was a medium scifi movie, but unfortunately it was not. I found him rather condescending and even preaching. <br /> <br /> But that's not the only comment. The scenes are very "artificial" (not like in scifi, as I will explain one in a few moments). (The next sentence is a little spoiler.) The movie is more or less a discussion between two groups. The physical setting for a discussion usually involves two or three men standing side by side, the latter speaking in general. In the worst case, the other party is represented by one person. <br /> <br /> Interviews with journalists are very artificial, even unprofessional. For example, the discussion sometimes takes place between the journalists (I mean, from one point of the interviewee, "akward"). Moreover, the interviewees always remain calm, they say everything without normal emotions. That is to say. you can not tell if they are lying or not, are crazy or not. They show almost nothing. <br /> <br /> It is also very unprofessional, the "Christian" journalists always believe everything that the interviewees tell them, <br /> <br /> Conclusion: <br /> <br /> All conversations contain: <br /> <br /> - facts <br /> <br /> - arguments for / against <br /> <br /> There are no lies. Nobody is lying. (The next sentence is a spoiler, ignore if you're still thinking of seeing the movie.) The only lie is to show how bad the bad guys are. <br /> <br /> This allows me to conclude that the film is a serial movie. It's very similar to 'Plan 9 of Outer Space' (1950s), but this film also has an annoying and erroneous discussion about aliens and Christian beliefs. <br /> <br /> NOTE: I have no intention of insulting Christians, people who believe in extraterrestrials or anyone else. It's a thought I have about the film, not people. <br /> <br /> In addition, I would like to note that I do not know if the actors are bad or have just received terrible scenarios.
