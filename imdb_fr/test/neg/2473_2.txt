I can not believe I sat through all this movie! It was absolutely awful and totally worthy of the name, and yet I sat all this time thinking that he had to get better. This is not the case and I lost 2 hours of my life. Will Smith is much better in action movies - I loved him in Me, Robot, Enemy of the State, and Independence Day - and I do not think we can really expect him to win a lot. movie as romanticism Cary Grant could. Again, the scenario was unbearably awful and the dialogue so corny. <br /> <br /> I did not like everyone except the character of Albert, and even the one I found was done with a heavy hand. If you want to watch a modern and sensual romantic comedy, watch something like How to lose a guy in ten days or When Harry meets Sally. The 40-year-old Virgin left me with a smile on my face. I even preferred the music and lyrics above that - and yes, I know it's corny, but at least it was not taken seriously and it was adorable. I did not like the main female role either - and I was not convinced of the chemistry that separated her from Will Smith's character. <br /> <br /> In all, I think there are two scenes I liked (and certainly not the end, which was nauseating and unconvincing!) - Hitch calling Sarah while she did not had not given him his number was kind enough and - no, sorry, that's the only thing I liked in the whole movie. Do not waste your time.
