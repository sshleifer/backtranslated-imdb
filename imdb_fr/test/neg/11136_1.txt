I hate movies that end like those !!!! <br /> <br /> This 16mm disaster is full of clich√©s, stereotypical characters, a generic, a finished "plot" and a terrible dialogue. <br /> <br /> In this "movie", we have the aggressive black guy, the Black Guys girlfriend, the blonde bitch, the lesbian "chick hacker", the pedophile teacher ... Blah, Blah Blah ... And then the pumpkin man. <br /> <br /> "Do you think someone is taking the legend too far?" This question is asked towards the end of the film. Go too far in the slogan of Scream 2. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS ***** In general, I do not go in spoilers, but I have to scream .... <br /> <br /> > A dream? Everything was a dream !!!!! This is the easiest way to finish a movie. "I do not know how to explain all this, and we have no money ... Let's make all this a dream." That's what the director / producer / actor / FX has to think about. Yes, the director is the character of Mr. E. He did almost everything on this film of waste. It's such a case that ends ... And what about the principal, okay, so he did all the kidnappings! What does this have to do with the movie? Of course, the blacks are killed, the bitch is killed, the teacher who has a history of sexual harassment with students is killed (he is the main suspect) .... YUCK YUCK YUCK !!! This film gave me a broken heart. <br /> <br /> Useless, foolish, and made with parents Visa and Mastercards (which tells me it's probably still paid), this movie is stupid, boring and just plain stupid. ... <br /> <br /> The only thing I liked was the credits. The way they introduced the names, etc., at the beginning and the end. There was a sensation of goose bumps. Too bad the movie is not! <br /> <br /> 1 of 10
