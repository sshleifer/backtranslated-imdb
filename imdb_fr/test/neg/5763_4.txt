"The Curse of the Forty-Ninths" does not really deserve a long and detailed review, so I'll make a few random observations: <br /> <br /> - Generic aperture awesome. <br /> <br /> - No plot. <br /> <br /> - Is there anyone who has ever seen a horror movie before and can not guess in the first 20 minutes who will survive and who will not survive group of traveling stereotypes? <br /> <br /> - Hey, this newcomer (Alexandra Ford) is very hot! <br /> <br /> - Richard Lynch (made up about 100 years old) and John Phillip Law have fun, cameos ironically. <br /> <br /> - Karen Black has a bigger role, but she's not funny - she's kind of embarrassing. <br /> <br /> - Martin Kove is on the screen for about 40 seconds, but his name is still on the cover of the video. Did they pay for that appearance or was it the other way around? <br /> <br /> - I hate computer-generated cheap effects in horror movies. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 of 4.
