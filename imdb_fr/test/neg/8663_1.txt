I agree with many of you that this film was rather boring and dull. I found myself not liking the main character and the following actors / actresses who came in the scenes. The work of the camera did not please him. Random shots and shaky movie scenes made me very annoyed and turned off the movie. I will save time watching the adaptation of 1999 and hoping that it will integrate nicely with Sens and Sensibility; Emma; To become Jane; and pride and prejudice. In addition to these movies, I only have a few to watch, but I think they were made with great taste. The music was a little out of place with the movie too, reminding me of another show I had seen this year. It was called Hex and a BBC show. I fell on it one night on the web. I rather liked the first season but the second season was dry and came out of the air which should stay with the clouds. I found the main character who was Henry in this film irrelevant. Maybe I do not like his way of speaking or his stature. Well, I would not recommend this movie to anyone unless the movie is muted and they want to look at the fashion of the time or how the houses were kept at that time. Once again, I will look at the 1999 version hoping that it will be better and that Jane Austen will do justice to her writings.
