Humor is a very personal thing and the audience at the preview of The Wog Boy seemed to enjoy it more than me. I found it to be an anachronistic affair, more representative of the old-fashioned racial humor of Australian cinema in the 1960s and 1970s. The plot between the boy and the girl never takes off because of a lack of chemistry between Lucy Bell and Nick Giannopoulos as I found thin laughter on the floor. If you want to spend your money on it, wait for it on video.
