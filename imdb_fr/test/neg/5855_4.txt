This film coincides with Mike Allred's comics mini-series "Red Rocket Seven" and tells the story of an alien who escaped to Earth to wait for "Astroesque", which is related to the book Revelations and the Apocylpse. This is only part of a larger story (if the movie baffles you, read also "RR7"). You can easily say that Allred is used to telling stories with pictures. The management is very good and the effects are not bad for a budget of $ 500. Unfortunately, Mike used many friends to play the roles and probably did not have the heart to say that they could not act. In addition, Mike does not show his writing skills in this movie. His spoon of dialouge nourishes the plot and does not allow you to appreciate the characters. It was actually disappointing given his formidable writing ability shown in his comics. 4 out of 10
