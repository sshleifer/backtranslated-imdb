Masters Horror: Sounds Like takes place in Seattle, where Larry Pearce is responsible for a software call center. After losing his son Michael (Nicholas Elia), 6 years old, because of a rare heart disease, he realizes that his hearing is extremely sensitive. Larry hears everything by ten, people typing on computer keyboards, people whispering across the room, people stamping their feet on the floor, drops of drops and even breathable people become unbearable for Larry while he is constantly bombarded with piercing sounds. Finally, Larry decides that he has enough and if he can not stop the noises themselves, he may be able to stop hearing them with the help of a big guy ... > <br /> This Canadian-American co-production was Episode 4 of Season 2 of the TV series Masters of Horror, written and directed by Brad Anderson. I thought Sounds Like was a real miss. The screenplay was based on Mike O'Driscoll's short story and I'm really surprised by the amount of very positive feedback he has here based on IMDb. For starters, I would have a hard time describing it as a horror movie and it feels like a sentimental drama until the last 5 minutes, when Howard Berger, Gregory Nicotero and the boys from KNB Effects went to work . Larry has this strange and unexplained ability to amplify sounds and noises from the beginning. This episode ends up as 55 minutes with exactly the same kind of repetitive buildup that leads to a bloody end although it's too late to save it. It's rather slow and although it's well written, is not it a horror-themed theme and I'm a bit confused about who it is for? <br /> <br /> Director Anderson does not have a problem doing that. continues to repeat the same things over and over, until the last 5 minutes, there is not a single drop of blood in the set. There is no horror, no fear or tension and absolutely no atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Technically, it's very well done, the production has a good value and does not look like a cheap show for television. The acting is very good and it is unfortunate that the story is a bit limited. <br /> <br /> This sounds like one of the worst episodes of Masters of Horror, it seems to appeal to a lot of people and everything is fine, but it's definitely not for me. Another Masters of Horror, another disappointment.
