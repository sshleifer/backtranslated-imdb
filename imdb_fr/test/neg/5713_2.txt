What's up with this movie? Do Mr. Lyne and his writers think that a sadomasochistic bond between two spoiled Yuppies can be a feature film? Perhaps if there were comic elements (which is not the case, at least intentionally), or if there were some additional dramatic elements (which is not the case), or could -be if it was hardcore. No, it's just the story of the case. a timeline of a bunch of R-rated rysts. Ho-hum, who cares? "Nine and a half weeks" deserves all the Razzie nominations he has received. He is a loser. <br /> <br /> And by the way, what's going on with Roger Ebert and his commendative comment? Where was his head in 1986?
