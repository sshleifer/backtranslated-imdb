Some think that Sweden is negative: too neat, too clean, too serious, too organized and too Nordic. A people tortured by their fate and religious history, sometimes leading to depression and compulsive heaviness. This should not be a problem for a filmmaker, as for example the late Bergman showed us what can be cinematographic possible under these conditions. Bergman used his identity as a starting point and did not explicitly comment on this identity as such. <br /> <br /> Andersson, however, does the opposite: he only comments on this identity, dissecting his people to the marrow: In his world Sweden is the equivalent of hell on earth. But it does not go any further and for me, it's just not art, but simply an annotation. Despite the exceptional time it took for this filmmaker to have serious limitations that he clearly can not do without. <br /> <br /> Compared to his previous film Sånger från andra våningen / Songs of the second floor, there is not much progress to observe. The intention was that it was more accessible, but the difference is minimal and the few scenes that try to please a wider audience are not the best of the film. The same absurdism and the same minimalism are still valid: there is the position of the camera in a single take and the action (the absence of) in front of this shot. Yes, the photos are well done, some scenes work and the coloring and positioning are incredible. But does that make an interesting movie? Thinking in a negative way, the cinema has taken a step back. <br /> <br /> Andersson's story as a producer of commercials is reflected in the elaborate setup, but I find his films as empty as these. There is a message about humanity, but it is trivial and without much depth.
