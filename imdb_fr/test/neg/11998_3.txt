Wow ... I suspected it to be bad ... But now I'm running out of words ... Honestly, none of my words can do justice to this movie ... <br /> <br /> I'll try to say something anyway ... <br /> <br /> It's really a unique jewel. One of the worst. <br /> <br /> Lash The Street - given his acting experience - fights with a Toltec wizard-zombie during the film's heyday ... ??? A true stroke of genius, without a doubt. <br /> <br /> It rarely happens that I laugh aloud when I watch a movie alone. It happened several times with this one. <br /> <br /> The accents of the actors, of the man, the accents ... And the dialogues that I heard them speak ... And the actor himself ... I could not simply not "I do not believe what I heard. <br /> <br /> This big uncle fart so hard (walking to the house with his little nephew) for no apparent reason ... <br /> <br /> Boobs! Yes, there are breasts! And the female ass! There is even a girl naked in a bathtub sipping a beer ... <br /> <br /> This one " stretch his mouth on his face ": death was the bomb!" A real highlight. <br /> <br /> Aspects of the comedy were totally crazy, I just could not believe what I saw and heard. For a moment, I even thought they were not intentional, shaking their heads in disbelief, but about halfway through the movie, I started to get an overview. imagine that it took me half a movie to lift the half of my brain to finally understand it. <br /> <br /> I had a hard time believing this movie ... But it's good, really, I think. There was a black chick who was heading for a very small closet, opening it and saying "Wooow, look at all the storage spaces!" And she said it as if she thought so. I mean, it's a good dialogue and a good acting, right? <br /> <br /> Oh, and maybe needless to say: Lash La Rue's whipping skills suck the ass of The Dark Power. It's really sad and pathetic to see. It's all part of comedy, of course. Or wait, I could be wrong. No, yes, I'm wrong. Lash The street was amazing with the whip! It was the publisher's fault. He ruined everything, cutting his lashes together and everything. Or wait, maybe it was the cameraman. He filmed from the wrong angles ... So why did not Phil Smoot say anything? That's it, it's the director's fault. <br /> <br /> But it's a good movie. <br /> <br /> I'm just going to stop talking about it. Anyway, I have nothing useful to say, apart from the fact that I hope that my brain will recover from this experience ... in a few moments.
