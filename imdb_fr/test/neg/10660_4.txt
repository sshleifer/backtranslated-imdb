I do not like Himesh Reshamiya. I do not really like his singing. But his songs are a craze in India, especially among commoners. Now, when he ventured to become an actor? it was a big joke! What courage he must reap as much as he can in his prime time. I never wanted to see this movie. But one thing has changed. The film becomes a super-duper hit! After 2 weeks, Aap Ka Saroor picked up a collection of 14 crores at the box office ?? compared to Apne who collected 7 crores in the same 2 weeks. If I can sit through the absurd Sivaji of Apne and Rajnikant ?? I should also try to understand this movie that made it so successful? The story tells the story of singer Himesh Reshamiya (HR) who went to Germany for a concert and falls in love with Riya (Hansika Motwani). Ruby (Mallika Sherawat), a German lawyer, loves Himesh. Now, Himesh is arrested for murder. Himesh's mission (in the last 40 minutes) after his escape from prison is to prove his innocence and find the real murderer. <br /> <br /> Let me say that Himesh has nothing in him to become a hero. He does his best but fails miserably. He is pathetic. I thought what could have made the movie click so much? Let me find something positive. <br /> <br /> First, the saving grace of the movie is the script to the point where Himesh escapes from the prison. (But after that, the film's nose plunges into unbearable and stupid limits.) Second, the film's songs are good, catchy and appealing. Third, Mallika Sherawat ?? she looks beautiful and acts well too, as a second lady. I can imagine that Mallika fans come to see the movie just for her. Fourth, the cinematography of the film is nice ?? especially the German places, are a treat to watch for the eyes. Fifth, most of the story is a love story between Himesh and Riya ?? with snapshot dialogues that could possibly connect to the young crowd. Sixth, the director Prashant Chadha did a decent job covering as much as possible the pathetic talents of Himesh with shots that do not require a lot of Himesh. <br /> <br /> Heroine Hansika Motwani looks like a low-budget movie heroine. Raj Babbar is lost in a small role. Overall, the film is below average. <br /> <br /> I thought all along the movie ?? What if the same movie script had been made with Salmaan as the lead role? I think it would have been a much better deal. Maybe then I would have given the film 6 out of 10. But now ?? (Stars 4.5 out of 10)
