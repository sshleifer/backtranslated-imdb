When a group of businessmen begins to die in the presence of the mysterious Mr. Coulomb, FBI agent Dick Martin is assigned to the case. As the death toll continues to rise, Martin is clearly not very successful. At the end of the film, the strange truth is revealed, which I will not reveal here. <br /> <br /> One of the other users who comments on this article declares "It's a classic film that should be JOINED and not taken apart". I am sorry but I respectfully disagree with this opinion. It is "classic" only in the sense that it is old and has nothing to do with its quality. I watched a lot of low-budget "B" films from that time, but it's not one of them. <br /> <br /> The pace is unbearably slow, the work of the camera is rather bland, the acting is quite woody (even Lugosi is not great in this one in my opinion) and the plot, although it has an interesting premise, seems to be united in a very difficult way to follow.
