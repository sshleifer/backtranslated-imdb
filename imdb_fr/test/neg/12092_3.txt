First of all, what's really great about this movie: <br /> <br /> - Ryan Reynolds, excellent actor! There are very few actors that I really like and for the moment, he is one of them. He has an incredible talent for imitating characters. <br /> <br /> - The soundtrack! Very good music played at the right time. <br /> <br /> - The idea of ​​a new lost in his own world, unable to leave. <br /> <br /> However, I give him only 3 out of 10 for some flaws: <br /> <br /> - Horrible second part. It seems that the director is very eager to do something new, but despite the efforts, it was really boring <br /> <br /> - Very boring character, Melissa. I could not stand the scenes with her - that was to say that it was constantly annoying. She represents everything that is wrong with an American woman. <br /> <br /> - Terrible explanation of the numbers. The director was so busy with the development of the character that he completely missed the goal of a good story. Excuse me, koalas? brr ... terrible! <br /> <br /> This film had great potential. The shooting is well done, the music is really good, but nothing more. <br /> <br /> See it only if you're a fan of Ryan Reynolds, or if you have a lot of time to lose.
