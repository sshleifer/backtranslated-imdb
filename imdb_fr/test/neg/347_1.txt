I watched this movie only because I felt like I was going to be treated to a horror movie. I mean, look at the slogan: "They are men returned! And worse ... they are still alive!" Does not that sound like a big-eyed horror movie? And there is the title itself: "Screamers". What title perfectly suited to a horror film, I thought! Unfortunately, I did not know that the real title was, correctly translated, "Fishermen's Island". <br /> <br /> So, about an hour after watching this, I realized it was not a corny horror movie at all - it was a nasty "adventure" story to About sticky fish-men of Atlantis. "The men turned around"? No, there was nothing like that. I was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> You are crazy, misleading slogan! I want those 81 minutes of my life!
