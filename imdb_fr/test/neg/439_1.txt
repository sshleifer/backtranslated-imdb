Well, what can be said of a "comedy of horror" that presents neither horror nor comedy? There are no characters in the film, but far too many intrigues - all underdeveloped and mostly superfluous. <br /> <br /> Computer-generated creatures have a bad image, much like the Disney versions of oversized rats without a tail. The undead are the biggest scam apart from the title, they will look like the dead in the Landis movie, but they are far away. They look like bad actors with some plastic and bull's blood added. <br /> <br /> Two intrigues really show some promise (the love story and the story of "society"), but fail as miserably as the director, the writers, the SFX department, the production and players.
