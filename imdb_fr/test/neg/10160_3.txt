I had seen this movie when I was young (before the Second World War) and I was surprised to see that the local library had a copy. I saw him after sixty years and I forgot how serious it was. This is an example of a movie that was not an "A" movie. No editing, bad scenario, weak game and little staging. Should not even be at the height of a "B" I had a laugh how much I became jaded over the years. It seems to me that I thought it was good when I saw it originally.
