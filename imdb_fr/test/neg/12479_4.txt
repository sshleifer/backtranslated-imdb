There are some horror directors for whom I have accumulated so much respect and admiration over the years, that they absolutely can not disappoint me, no matter what waste to decide. Lucio Fulci is surely one of them, but damn it, he tries to disappoint me by his later efforts! You can easily afford to spend most movies made or produced by Fulci in the late 80s and simply watch "Cat in the Brain" instead, as this title brings together and repeats the best and absolute most voracious videos from SEVEN other Fulci. -ficks, including the sickest murder sequences in "When Alice Broke the Mirror". Overall, this film is certainly among the weakest and most useless achievements of our director. The scenario is incoherent like hell, the basic premise is totally implausible and somewhat stupid and there is absolutely no suspense to appreciate. I love the title, but it's actually quite meaningless. There is a character named Alice in the story, but it is only a support role and it certainly does not break any mirror. I guess she could break things just by using her voice because she's an opera singer, but she does not do it. The plot revolves around a middle-aged playboy and addicted to the game that spends its days seducing wealthy widows and killing them for their money. Lester Parson slaughters the ladies (and unwanted witnesses) horribly, makes steaks from the juiciest parts of their bodies and feeds the remains of his cat. There is also a stupid psychological plot in which he thinks that his own shadow is responsible for the murders in his place. The difference between "When Alice Broke the Mirror" and some of Fulci's greatest horror movies ("The Beyond", "The City of the Living Dead", ?? ") lies in the fact that he does not There is no need to create a horrible film, the characters, including Lester, are colorless and boring, and the murders are usually portrayed as if it's the most common thing in the world to put a woman's head in a microwave oven or run repeatedly on a human body with a car.The light is mediocre, the cinematography is very ugly, the clumsy and amateur editing and the acting performances are downright miserable.I did not know better I would think that Lucio deliberately made an ugly film to protest against all the harsh critics who do not appreciate his repertoire, regardless of his level of mind and his efforts. The obvious element to appreciate here is simply the outrageous gor e & bloodshed, as even trying to blend into black comedy does not work properly. As long as Lester is swinging his chain saw and cutting off the women's feet, "When Alice broke the mirror" is an undemanding horror entertainment piece, but other than that, there's not much to recommend.
