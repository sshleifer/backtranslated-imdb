Although I'm not too religious, I still had a lot of hope for this film, because it contains the astonishing Steve Carrell, and his previous, Bruce Almighty, was actually a creative and intelligent comedy about the Christian theme. However, Evan Almighty does not get close to the originality and freshness of the original, and he can not decide whether it's a comedy or a sentimental film about faith and the Family values. If he had chosen a clear path on which to focus, he could have lived up to his potential, but the result of his mixing is a movie with a very flat and dry sense of humor, cheesy dialogues and patterns that try to give depth to the film, but practically insult the audience's intelligence, as well as a very confused and darkened presentation of the film's opaque message. It was very obvious that Evan Almighty was very badly written. There are many plots and elements in the movie that make absolutely no sense. For example, although a wide variety of exotic animals from around the world invade Evan as he builds the ark for their salvation from the flood, their inclusion is really needed when the only "flood" that occurs in the film is in downtown Washington DC and a suburban neighborhood, which means they are not likely to be wiped out? It seems that filmmakers did not have the originality to modernize the Bible story, but simply made it happen in the present without changing the plot, leaving many elements that do not add to that and make it obvious. idiotic motives and writing in the film. Overall, this work is tragic in the sense that Steve Carrell and Wanda Sykes do not play their acting skills, because of the bland characters they represent, and so poorly written that they write so as to distort most themes tempted by the film. a mockery of the first film. Finally, Evan Almighty is also an insult to the brilliant actors and all the half-intelligent film buffs, to the extent that it fails miserably both.
