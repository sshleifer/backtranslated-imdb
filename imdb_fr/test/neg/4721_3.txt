Cult buyers unquestionably know the term "nasty video". It was a well-known British list of all films that could be "damaging" to society if viewed by an irresponsible audience (dramatization). For fans of gore, it's an excellent checklist because it contains inhumanly cruel and disturbing films of realism (Faces of Death, Cannibal Holocaust, Driller Killer) and scandalous and ultra-sick horror movies (The Burning, Nightmare City, The Murders Toolbox). . Keeping this in mind, it is quite unusual to see the "Night of the Bloody Monkeys" among the other "bad guys". Sure, it's gore ?? but the blood and the violence are so badly presented that I can not imagine anyone offending this. And the stupid plot (about a desperate doctor transplanting the heart of a gorilla into the chest of his dying son) is not exactly what you would call a troubling reality, either. All that's left is a horror movie that's quite entertaining with awful acting and a useless sleaze. The effects of man-ape makeup are laughable and there is no tension or atmosphere to detect anywhere. It's nice only if you're in a good mood, in other words. The few sequences showing detailed lady-wrestling matches (one of the leading actresses made for a living) are very cool.
