I watched this show for a while, only because of my cousins ​​and I hate it! First, girls dress the same way and wear the same letter on their behalf. (Come on, I could do better than that!) Then the bad guys (spare me), we first have a monkey with some of his (small) brain showing, then we have a (gay) version of the devil, a Pink Hillbilly, a gang of green gangs (it's ironic, that's their name) a spoiled princess (again, ironic, that's her name) among others. I also found that there were no male heroes in the series. (Not that I'm sexist or anything ...) I prefer to watch Sailor Moon, it's better than that. If someone else wants to watch the show in the room where you are, find a way to break the TV. Believe me, it will save you half an hour of torture. <br /> <br /> Note: I give you what you deserve, a 1 in 10. Whatever you do, DO NOT LOOK AT THIS!
