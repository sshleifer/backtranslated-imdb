The only enigma of this movie was how it was done. the UK film industry needs to make movies that people want to watch and not seek taxpayer money (at the BBC) to keep Luvvies in the lifestyle they've been used to, without doing anything that. <br /> <the film was all that was wrong with British Films, it was based on stereotypes, it must be a Londoner where people were either crazy and corrupt, gangsters, luvvies or gelled eel types, the scenario was terribly weak, as the policeman took out his phone and the ringtone was the "Sweeney" theme, I expected. The film as a whole was a happy purchase. Sweeney / Minder scam. <br /> <br /> The priceless manuscript I noted has been forgotten and lost a few times. It's something that even with my limited street wisdom would not wear in my chest pocket everywhere, at the beach and in fights, etc. To say that Vinnie Jones is nice, which is pretty much the only thing in the movie, this poor guy. <br /> <br /> When Derek Jacobi went into the water in the end because he was Dickens, oh my god, what a load of crap, and I'm positive here
