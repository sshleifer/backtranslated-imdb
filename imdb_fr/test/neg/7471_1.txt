"Grande Ecole" is not an artistic exploration of mixed sex, but, if you need it, a movie for an X-rated channel. Although I suspect there is nothing in this film that spoils a motivated viewer, the plot is simply an excuse to create mating between men and women in the unconvincing context of a competition between a Parisian school and future leaders. a great school for those seeking higher degrees in the liberal arts. Similarly, there is a thrill of cultural conflict between young French high status and low status, as well as a social conflict involving native French and Arab immigrants from North Africa. All that is missing is a coupling woman to woman, which could easily have been arranged without a slight twist in the plot. <br /> <br /> The acting game is at a level a bit higher than in the usual pornography film - but "Grande Ecole" is, to be frank, nothing more than pornography to artistic aspirations. I am not offended by sex. It's just repetitive and, soon, boring. Where is the Hays office when you really need it?
