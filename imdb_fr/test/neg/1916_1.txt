It's getting closer to the worst movie I've ever seen. The writer throws you in a way that puts you next to Jasper (Josh Hartnett). When he did absolutely nothing wrong, Sam (Leelee Sobiesky) leaves him for Kelley (Chris Klein), in a way that makes you mad at Sam. You do not tell how she feels, so her feelings with Kelley are not real to you and their relationship is fictional. It trails you both ways, and it gets pretty exhausting and boring. The only good thing about this movie that I saw is the casting. <br /> <br />
